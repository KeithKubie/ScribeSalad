KATE: Please
welcome to the stage

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.430
today our guest Barry Meier.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.490
BARRY MEIER: Thanks.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.240
Thanks, Kate.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.440
Thanks to everyone at
Google for having me here.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.920
And thanks to all
of you for coming.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.380
I've been a journalist
at the New York Times

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.890
for over 25 years.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.430
And people often ask me, why
did you become a journalist?

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.250
And the truth is, I did it after
I failed at a couple of things.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.020
And one of the things I
really failed spectacularly at

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.480
was being a fiction writer.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.540
When I was in my
early 20s, I really

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.940
wanted to be a suspense
writer, someone that

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.000
wrote mystery and crime novels.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.310
Because I had grown up
loving those kinds of books.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.480
I read people like Dashiell
Hammett, and Raymond Chandler,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.890
and James M. Cain,
and John Le Carre.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.050
And I loved those stories,
both for their excitement

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.020
and the kind of ambiguity of
the morality of the stories.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.120
It was often very difficult to
tell who the good guys were,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.320
who the bad guys were.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.100
And I thought, hey,
this can't be too hard.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.910
I should be able to do this.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.070
So I spent a year
in my early 20s

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.850
in what was then a
very cheap apartment

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.570
in Little Italy,
something I know

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.650
that doesn't exist anymore.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.150
And I spent every
day going, sitting

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.880
at a table with then
the preferred writing

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.760
implement of its time,
a manual typewriter,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.460
and click clacking away
for five or six hours

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.150
and writing what I thought
was a really great novel.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.170
And it was set-- the
climatic scene of this novel,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.020
was set on what was the
old West Side Highway.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.860
I don't know if any of
you have ever seen it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.340
when it was in existence,
but along what was now

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
West Street was an
elevated highway,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.100
where you could drive
from Lower Manhattan

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.860
all the way up to the
Henry Hudson Parkway.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.100
And you'd pass all
the piers and ships

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.420
that used to line the
West Side of Manhattan.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.110
And in the 1970s, I believe,
during the financial crisis

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.690
here in New York,
they decided not

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.290
to paint the underside
of the West Side Highway.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.640
And one day, sections
of it collapsed.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.800
So basically it was not
useful for cars anymore,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.000
but it became, really, this
incredible urban walkway,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.250
where you could walk from
Lower Manhattan along the now

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.740
decrepit West Side Highway
up to Central Park,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.460
or ride your bicycle along
the old West Side Highway.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.390
And it was really
a fantastic place.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.390
So I had this scene, where
the climax of my book

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.720
was taking place, set on
the West Side Highway.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.280
And basically I pictured
it like a high noon

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.290
scene out of a
Western novel, where

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.580
the good guy was approaching
from one end of the highway

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.850
and the bad guy was
approaching from the other end

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.110
of the highway and there was
this shootout that took place.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.090
And I figured, man,
this is just fantastic.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.930
People are going to
eat this novel up.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.440
Sadly, that didn't turn
out to be the case.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.880
I mean, it was roundly
rejected by every publisher

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.420
who I brought it to.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.930
And it is now in the bottom
of a closet somewhere

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.760
in my apartment.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.900
If any of you are
interested or know people

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.610
in the publishing industry
who might like to buy it,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.380
you can come see me afterwards.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.790
So fast forward 25, 30 years.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.570
I'm at the New York Times.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.370
Prior to the Times, I had worked
both at the Wall Street Journal

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.329
and at New York Newsday,
another newspaper

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.209
here in New York City.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.740
And I'd spent a large
majority of my career

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.750
as an investigative reporter.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.640
And one of the things that I
had specialized in investigating

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.370
were problems with drugs,
problems with medical devices,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.340
or surgical procedures.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.410
I was the first reporter
that wrote extensively

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.220
about the drug OxyContin.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.090
This is about 15 years
ago when it was first

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.110
appearing as here hillbilly
heroin in Appalachia

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.140
and other places.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.630
And then I wrote a book
called "Pain Killer," which

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.640
traced the story of this drug
and prescription drug abuse

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.360
and this really fascinating
family, the Sackler

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.570
family, that ran the company
that produced OxyContin.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.560
And one of the things that
is both one of the benefits

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.330
and the downsides of being
an investigative reporter

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.900
is that your bosses give you
a lot of leeway to pursue

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.660
subjects of interest to you.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.920
And they are really happy
if those stories work out.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.050
If you win awards, you get
a lot of slaps on the backs,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.220
occasionally a raise.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.430
And you are then allowed to
continue on and pursue whatever

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.680
story you want to pursue.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.570
The big downside is that there
are these lull periods, where

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.500
you can't find a story.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.630
And you begin to
worry that, oh my god,

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.630
they're going to
realize that I've been

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.970
a fraud for the last 20 years.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.030
The secret is going to be out
that I've been scamming them.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.880
I've been coming up with these
stories and it's all been luck,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.350
and I've been living
by my wits and now it's

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.760
all going to come
to a crashing end.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.670
And it was really the
state that I was in 2007.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.530
I had just won a couple
of notable awards

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.350
for doing a series of stories
about a defective heart device

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.330
and got the typical
pats on the back.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.910
And then I was
thinking, I'm really

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.720
sick of doing medical stuff.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.140
Let me see if I can find
something else to do.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.350
So month after month
after month went by.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.750
I was looking for stories.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.300
I was trying to find
things and I was really

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.990
starting to get desperate.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.670
And I also saw the looks
in my editors' eyes,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.650
or thought I saw the looks in
my editors' eyes looking at me

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.710
and saying "what's Barry doing?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.470
Why isn't he doing anything?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.630
Do we need to call him in
and have a talk with him?"

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.810
So I was walking around
the newsroom one day,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.030
and I was so desperate
to find something

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.940
that I picked up a copy of
the Financial Times, which

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.690
is an English newspaper.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.920
It covers business.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.050
I never read it.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.470
I mean, I'd be more likely
to pick up a copy of the Post

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.550
or the Daily News than
the Financial Times.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.520
And what was so pathetic about
this was the fact that it

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.600
wasn't even today's-- that
day's Financial Times.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.900
It was probably six months old.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.470
But that was a kind of
state that I was in.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.870
And as I'm thumbing
through this newspaper,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.590
I see a story that
catches my attention.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.610
And the story basically
reports that a former FBI agent

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.100
turned private investigator has
disappeared in Iran while he

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.520
was investigating a case
involving smuggled counterfeit

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.940
cigarettes.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.330
And I thought, hm, this
sounds kind of cool.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.090
I know something about
the tobacco industry.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.100
I had covered all the litigation
between the state attorney

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.480
generals and the
tobacco companies

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.990
back in the late
1990s and early 2000s,

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.310
when states were suing
tobacco companies.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.210
And I knew people
that were involved,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.850
private detectives that worked
on counterfeit cigarette cases.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:44.680
And then I continued
reading the story further,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.500
and there was this other
line in the story that

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:54.580
talked about how this gentleman
by the name of Robert Levinson

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.900
had disappeared
while he was meeting

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:04.800
in Iran with a fugitive American
murderer, a black American who

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.230
had fled to Iran in
1980 during the height

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.540
of the Iranian Revolution
after he had assassinated

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.620
a former aide to
the Shah of Iran

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.480
outside that person's
home in Washington DC.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.430
This person's name
was Dawud Salahuddin.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.860
That's the name that he
adopted after fleeing to Iran.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.280
And I thought to myself, wow.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.290
This sounds incredibly cool.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.960
This is my ticket.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.200
This is a life saver for me.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.720
This is in 2007,
the fall of 2007,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.600
and it's already about six
months after this episode

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.010
has taken place.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.670
OK, I'm going to
go to my editors.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.980
I'm going to lay
claim to the story.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.250
And the bonus of the
story is that the Times

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.040
is going to pay for me to travel
to all kinds of cool places.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.480
I'll get to go to Dubai.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.940
I really want to see
those islands that

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.580
look like palm trees.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.670
I'll get to go to Iran.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.860
I mean, how many people
get to go to Iran

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.770
and have their
employer pay for it?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:16.710
And I'm thinking, not only
do I have a good story here,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.130
I have the best of both
worlds, because the Times is

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.950
going to go pay for me to
see all these exotic places.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.840
So I make this pitch.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.720
My editors, they're
a little skeptical

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.470
but they seem
vaguely interested.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.980
And I figured I'm saved.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.290
I've got it going.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.330
I'm good.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.390
OK, full speed ahead.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.950
So I start calling these
private investigators

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.080
that I know who work in the
area of smuggle cigarettes.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.450
And I tell them this story
and I get the same thing back

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.770
from them, which is basically,
this sounds totally crazy.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.560
There is no way under the
sun that we would ever

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:07.360
send a former FBI agent,
basically a big fat white guy

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.150
with a Jewish last name, to
Iran to investigate a case.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.830
If we were going to
investigate a case in Iran,

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.990
we would send in
a local, someone

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.450
who looked Iranian, who was
Iranian, who spoke Farsi,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.260
who could blend in to Iran.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.030
I mean, there's just no way.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.090
I mean, all you would be
doing is inviting trouble

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:36.310
by sending in a former FBI agent
to investigate a case in Iran.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.800
And I have to say, I came away
from those conversations a bit

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.440
depressed.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.570
I figured, oh my god.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.540
Now I've really dug a
deep hole for myself.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.330
I've told them about this story.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.580
I've made it sound
really exciting to them,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.670
and now I've got to go and
look like a dope and say,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.500
you know what?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.500
I was wrong.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.080
And I figured this is it.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.460
This is the end of my career.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.030
So I guess I got
depressed and moped around

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.730
for another week or two.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.210
And then I get this phone call.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.650
And the phone call
was from a guy

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.930
that I know, another journalist
who worked for the Times

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.650
for a period of time, who I was
friendly with, who says to me,

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.040
I understand you're poking
around the Levinson story.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.120
I have no idea how he knew
about that, but he says to me,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.420
there's nothing going on there.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.710
I wouldn't really pay
any attention to it.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.180
But if you're
interested in it, I

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.450
know someone who knows
something about Levinson who

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.110
might be willing to help you.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.980
He's a former television
producer, a retired television

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.580
producer by the name
of Ira Silverman.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.110
So maybe, if you want, I can
let him know you're calling

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.140
and you can call him.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.950
So I figure, OK, at this point
I've got nothing to lose.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.060
So I call Ira Silverman.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.330
We start chatting,
and he's acting

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.640
very hush hush, conspiratorial.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.900
There's something
he wants to tell me,

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.250
but it's so secret
and so sensitive I've

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.870
gotta double promise
on the life of everyone

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.610
I've known in this
life and possibly

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.420
every previous life
I've lived before he

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.130
will share the secret with me.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.220
And so I do that,
and he tells me

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.760
that Bob Levinson
works for the CIA.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.690
And he went to Iran on
a mission for the CIA.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.560
And I'm thinking to
myself, either this guy

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.670
is really crazy, or
this guy is telling me

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.530
something that's amazing.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.410
And so I talked to
Ira a little bit more.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.550
And Ira tells me that
the family is frantic.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.200
They haven't heard anything
about Bob or his fate

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.690
ever since he's disappeared.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.020
The FBI doesn't seem
to be investigating

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.940
his disappearance, and
the CIA has said nothing

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.990
to the family about
what's happened to Bob.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.920
And I say, OK.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.970
And he says to me, well,
I'm coming to New York.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.600
And I'm coming to New York with
a lawyer for the family, a guy

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.330
by the name of Dave McGee.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.070
And we'd be very eager
to meet with you.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:37.970
So I said sure.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.650
This is great.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.890
And so I meet with them
around Thanksgiving of 2007.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:50.250
And they show me a
contract that Bob has.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.740
It actually shows
that Bob Levinson

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.802
was at a certain point,
a consultant for the CIA.

00:14:56.802 --> 00:14:57.510
And I don't know.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.310
Is there any one
here that-- you guys

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.310
do are this spooky stuff--
who has worked for the CIA

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.630
or doesn't want to admit
to people around you

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.397
that they work for the CIA?

00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:11.480
No one's raise their hand.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:11.980
OK.

00:15:14.646 --> 00:15:18.780
So as you may know, there
are two parts to the CIA.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.660
There's the spy side, the
people who go out and work

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.380
abroad doing spying.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.670
And that's called the Division
of Clandestine Operations.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.400
Or now it's called the National
Secrecy something or other.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.650
And then there's
the analytical side,

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.320
which is called the
Directorate of Intelligence.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.930
And the analytical
side basically

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.380
are people that work at desks.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.420
And other parts of the
government come to them

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.840
and say, well, we want to
know what's going on in Iran,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.950
or we want to know what's
going on with Russia,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.940
or we want to know about
Russian economic policies

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.620
or military policies.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.690
And these people are these
really brilliant nerds

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:08.490
who come and become research
moles inside the CIA.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.640
They're like graduate
students for life

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.590
who get to examine
and research stuff.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.070
And then they write
up reports that

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.910
are forwarded to various
government officials.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.850
And Bob's contract
was with a division

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.720
within this analytical side
of the CIA called the Illicit

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.140
Finance Group.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.970
And the supposed role of
the Illicit Finance Group

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:40.260
was to follow money laundering
and illicit financial transfers

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.590
involving countries like
Iran or North Korea,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.640
organized crime groups
or Russian criminals

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.250
or folks like that.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:54.750
So there was a clear contract
that Ira and Dave showed me,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.930
showing that Bob
worked for this group

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.160
and had been hired by this
group as an outside contractor.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.230
And they believed that Bob had
been sent to Iran by this group

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.780
to try to recruit the
fugitive American there,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.690
Dawud Salahuddin, as a source
inside Iran for the CIA.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.390
Because bear in mind, in 2007,
the United States and Iran

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.599
are almost at war
with each other.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.310
You've had president
Ahmadinejad who's

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.170
just become president of Iran.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.540
He has restarted
Iran's nuclear program.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.970
There is this raging
conflict going on in Iraq.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.560
And Iran, according
to the US government,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.660
is arming these
militants in Iraq

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.950
who are killing
American soldiers there.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.670
The Bush administration
is about to clamp down

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.580
with sanctions against Iran.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.350
So basically the
United States and Iran

00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:01.490
are on a real collision course,
and there is a great desire

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.932
to have information about Iran.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:15.700
So I'm going to stop for
a moment and read you--

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.690
So they're looking
for a reporter who's

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.660
going to try to find out
what's going on at the FBI,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.000
at the CIA, give some aid
and comfort to the family,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.540
try to find out what
happened to Bob.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.760
And I say to them, look,
I'm happy to do that,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.050
but I can't go just on the basis
of what you are saying to me.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.090
I need to know more.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.040
Are there are more
documents that you

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.740
have that talk to Bob's
involvement with the CIA?

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.320
And they said, well,
Bob's wife Christine

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.780
has all of Bob's
records, but she

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.740
hasn't shared them with us yet.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.642
And I said, why not?

00:18:55.642 --> 00:18:58.100
And he said, said, well you
know her husband's disappeared.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.580
They have seven children.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.574
She's in a state of panic.

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:03.740
I mean, they don't know
what's happened to this guy.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.720
They don't know what to do.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.240
And I said, look, I'm
willing to do what I can.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.830
I'm willing to go to the ends of
the earth to follow the story,

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.240
but I need Christine to allow
me to see these documents.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.020
So they speak with Christine.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.790
A couple of weeks later, I fly
down to Dave McGee's office

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.540
in Pensacola, walk
into a conference room.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.650
There, a reporter's
dream awaits me.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:38.210
There are 10 crammed
cardboard boxes

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.560
filled with Bob
Levinson's files,

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.040
including all the reports
he's made to the CIA,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.550
all the emails that he
sent between the CIA

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:54.230
and his handlers, lots of other
files involving other cases

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.790
that he's worked on.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.930
And those files, those
e-mails, that information

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:06.580
become the basis that begins
this reporting trail that

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.540
starts in 2007
for me, will go on

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.130
for six years, six
or seven years,

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:18.060
and ultimately result in the
writing of "Missing Man."

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.630
So let me just read to you now
from the prologue of the book.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.850
That will hopefully
set the scene for you

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.550
and set up some of the
characters for you.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.320
Rain splattered
against the windshield

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.360
of her silver gray BMW as Sonya
Dobbs pulled up to a security

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.430
gateway blocking the street.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.230
It wasn't much of
a gate, at least

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.360
by Florida standards,
just a long, rolling fence

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.090
stretching across a road.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.440
She punched a code
into the gate's keypad.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.290
After two unsuccessful tries,
she used her cell phone

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.680
to call her boss,
David McGee, who opened

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.700
the gate from inside his house.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.950
It slid back and
Sonya drove through,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.180
a laptop resting on
the passenger seat.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.540
Sonya's Saturday night had
started very differently.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.930
She had planned to spend it
sorting through photographs.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.820
Sonya worked as Dave's
paralegal at a large law firm

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.720
called Beggs &amp; Lane,
located in Pensacola,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.500
a city at the western end
of Florida's panhandle,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.550
the narrow, 200 mile
long coastal strip

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.760
tucked between
the Gulf of Mexico

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.410
and the states of
Alabama and Georgia.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.920
Sonya wanted to carve
out a second career

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.200
as a photographer,
and she had been

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.760
on a chase boat the previous
day in Pensacola Bay,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.150
snapping pictures of
a new ocean-going tug,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.170
christened Freedom, as it
went through test maneuvers.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.560
The photos showed the big,
black, and gray slicing

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.100
through the foamy water
under a blue sky filled

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.950
with white, puffy clouds.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.310
Sonya had been happily
spending that Saturday evening

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.820
playing with different
ways to crop the images.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.950
Then the telephone rang and
she heard a familiar voice

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.380
on the other end of the line.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.820
Over the past three
years, she had

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:39.310
spoken to Ira Silverman hundreds
of times, if she had to guess.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.780
Most days, the retired
television newspaperman

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.240
phoned her at least once.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.260
Their conversation was always
about a mutual friend, Robert

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.420
Levinson, a former agent
with the Federal Bureau

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.880
of Investigation turned
private investigator.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.030
Sonya had never met him,
though she felt as if she had.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.260
Bob disappeared in 2007
while on a trip to Iran.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.540
Dave and Ira, who had
both known him for years,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.350
were trying to help his
desperate family find him.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.560
Months after the
investigator went missing,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.950
Dave convinced Bob's wife,
Christine, to ship his work

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.120
files to Beggs &amp; Lane.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.260
Sonya had read through them
and organized the reports.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.470
She was a natural snoop,
at ease with computers.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.680
Before long, she had tracked
down Bob's e-mail accounts

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.210
and figured out the passwords.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.930
As she walked through
the records of his life,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:44.670
she learned the secret that
Dave, Ira, and Chris already

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.160
knew.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.830
The explanation that
US government officials

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.420
were giving out publicly
to explain Bob's reason

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.260
for visiting Iran
wasn't true, at least

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.490
not the part that
really mattered.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.700
Since the investigator's
disappearance,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.270
there had been reported
sightings of him

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.670
in Tehran's Evin Prison,
the notorious jail where

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.510
political dissidents
are tortured and killed.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.610
Some tipsters had come forward
to claim that the Revolutionary

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.640
Guards, the elite
military force aligned

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.840
with Iran's Islamic
religious leaders,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.020
were holding him at a
secret detention facility.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.100
His family had made public
pleas for information about him,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.650
and the FBI had assigned
agents to the search.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.850
But the hunt for the missing
man had gone nowhere.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.000
Ira's call was about an email
he had gotten earlier that

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.170
Saturday evening
containing a message that

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.510
read like a ransom note.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.990
He had received
similar emails before

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.230
and had passed
them on to the FBI.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.070
But this one wasn't
like the others.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.360
This e-mail had a
file attached to it.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.980
Ira told Sonya he
couldn't figure out

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.570
how to open the attachment
and was forwarding it to her

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.860
to see if she could.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:17.440
The email read, "This
is a serious message.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.930
Until this time,
we have prepared

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.830
a good situation for Bob
and he is in good health.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.650
We announce for
the last ultimatum

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.930
that his life is based
on and related to you.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:40.340
You should pay $3 million in
cash and release our friends.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.720
We are waiting for
your positive answer

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.600
without any preconditions.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.150
We would announce our way
to receive the money."

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.530
Sonya clicked on the
e-mail's attachment,

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.540
but nothing happened.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.430
She didn't recognize the file's
extension, the three letter

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.640
code that tells the
computer which program

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.110
is needed to open a file.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:10.430
She suspected the extension,
.flv signified it was a video

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:14.970
file, and she hunted around
on the internet for a player

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.660
to download.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.620
She found one and
downloaded the software

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.820
and clicked again
on the attachment.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.350
This time, the file launched
and a man's gaunt face appeared,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.120
seemingly staring out at her.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.670
He had closely shorn gray hair,
a mustache, and sunken cheeks

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.580
covered by stubble.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.690
He started speaking in
a deep, raspy voice.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.600
Strange music played
in the background,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.470
rhythmic instruments accompanied
by a singer's droning call.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.670
After a few seconds,
the camera pulled back

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.870
and Sonya could see
that the man was sitting

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.110
in front of a gray stone
wall in what appeared

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.840
to be a stark prison cell.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.680
The polo shirt he
wore looked threadbare

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.540
and hung on his frame as though
it was several sizes too big

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.710
for him.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.280
Part of the shirt's
right sleeve was gone.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.450
There was nothing immediately
threatening about the video.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.030
Masked jihadists weren't
standing over the man branding

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.110
guns or swords, and there
wasn't a black political banner

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.510
hanging behind him.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.660
Still, the video
was disquieting.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.650
The man's arms didn't
move as he spoke,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.110
suggesting that his hands, which
couldn't be seen in the video,

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.630
might be lying
manacled in his lap.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.250
He struggled to stay calm and
to keep his words measured.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.910
Occasionally, his voice
came close to breaking,

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:56.410
and he would briefly close
his eyes, pause, or gesture

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.820
by turning his head.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:06.460
He said, "For my beautiful,
my loving, my loving wife

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.190
Christine, and my children,
and my grandson, and also

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.680
for the United
States government,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.500
I have been held here
for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.770
I am not in very good health.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:28.300
I am running very quickly
out of diabetes medicine.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.860
I have been treated
well, but I need

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.390
the help of the United
States government

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.370
to answer the requests of
the group that has held me

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.040
for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.140
And please help me get home.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.020
33 years of service
to the United States

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.080
deserves something.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.460
Please help me."

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.320
Dave McGee opened his front
door and ushered Sonya out

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.770
of the rain.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.530
They went into the kitchen,
where the lawyer's wife

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.370
Joyce was waiting.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.680
Sonya put her
laptop on the table,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.420
opened it, and
launched the video.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.440
Dave wasn't positive that
Bob was the man on the tape.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.220
The last time he had seen
the former FBI agent,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.180
he resembled a big, overweight
teddy bear with a mop of hair.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.850
The man on the tape was so thin
that the skin on his throat

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.460
sagged.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.030
Dave realized that the
only way to know for sure

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.260
was to call Christine.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.860
Sonya dialed her number,
and when Chris answered,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.830
she put her cell phone
next to the computer

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.770
and clicked on the video.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:50.280
A few moments passed.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.240
"That's Bob's
voice," Chris said.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.390
"That's Bob."

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.860
So that's the
prologue for the book.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:05.040
And it captures this
moment in time in 2010,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.370
where after three
years of nothing,

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:14.810
three years of silence, three
years, where everyone involved

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:20.920
with Bob's case,
including the FBI, many

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.210
of his friends, many
people, including myself,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.960
believed that Bob was dead.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.010
It did not seem at
all possible that Bob

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.920
could have been kept somewhere
secret, out of sight, out

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.200
of view-- there were Americans
going in and out of prisons

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.700
in Iran-- that Bob could be
kept in some secret location

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.470
and kept alive for
this period of time.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:55.140
I remember very clearly
where I was on that day.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.000
Because my wife and
I were in Brooklyn.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.630
We had been to our
daughter's school

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:06.500
for some parent teacher
conference or some event.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.560
And I had said to
her, like when I

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.420
agreed to receive all this
information from the Levinson

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.860
family, I had told
them I would do nothing

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.100
to jeopardize Bob's safety.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.270
That was the agreement, the
promise that I made to them.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.830
And I had spent years
tracking down the route that

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.880
took Bob to Kish Island.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.360
The people that the FBI
had recruited eventually

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.750
to help search for him,
and it was this wild cast

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:45.660
that I detail in the book of
arms dealers, and criminals,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.810
and Russian oligarchs, and
all these kinds of people

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.250
who wanted something
from the US government

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.790
as part of the help
in the search for Bob.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.080
And I had come to the
conclusion that day

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:05.460
that there was no way that Bob
Levinson could still be alive.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.400
And I told my wife
that I'm going

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.140
to go into work on Monday.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.830
I'm going to tell my editors
that it's probably time for us

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.110
to run our story.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:21.030
And then I was at a restaurant
that evening with some friends.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:25.590
And I got an email
from Ira Silverman

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.030
that had an attachment to it.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.270
And I just excused myself.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.280
I went out and I
looked at the email,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.900
and I opened the attachment.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.060
And what I saw was
that videotape.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.940
And what I saw was evidence
at that point in time

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.470
that Bob Levinson was alive.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.090
And as someone who had
followed this story,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.570
someone who had spent
their life as a reporter,

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.500
it also blew my mind, because it
made me realize something that

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.520
was dawning on me through
the years that I was working

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.910
on this story was that I had
entered myself into the shadow

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.160
world, into this world of
secrecy, and criminality,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.240
and surveillance, and
characters of moral ambiguity,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.360
where you might presume
something was the case

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.250
and you could never be
sure it was the case.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.090
And any assumption
you might make

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:28.880
would soon be
proven to be wrong.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:36.330
There was another piece
of information showing

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:40.350
Bob was alive that came
out about four months

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.800
afterwards, in early 2011,
a series of photographs

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.990
that some of you may have seen
on the news, which showed Bob

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:55.256
this time with very bushy
hair and a big beard,

00:33:55.256 --> 00:34:00.910
in this faux orange jumpsuit
like a Guantanamo prisoner

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:05.010
holding signs that were very
much of a political bent,

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.680
saying why haven't
you come to get me?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.630
Why are you deserting me?

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.879
Isn't my service to
this country enough?

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:22.920
And the book follows this behind
the scenes search for Bob.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.179
The video also set off
secret negotiations

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:32.870
between the United
States and Iran

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.380
to try to learn about
what happened to Bob.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.070
the United States
came to believe

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.480
during the course of
those negotiations

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.650
that the Iranians were basically
playing the United States,

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:53.690
had basically taken Bob and were
using him in some ways as bait

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:59.010
to try to better understand
how the United States spies

00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.910
on Iran.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:05.100
Bob's fate was also a part
of these recent nuclear

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.020
negotiations.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:12.750
And US officials
continued to press

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.480
their Iranian
counterparts about Bob.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.070
And from the very beginning,
from the day Bob disappeared

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:24.820
in Iran to this very
day, Iranian officials

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.210
have claimed that
they know nothing

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.980
about what happened to Bob.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.260
They know nothing about
how he disappeared on Kish.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:37.670
And obviously anyone with any
working knowledge of Iran,

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:42.030
or at least a little
working knowledge of Iran

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.260
that I gained while
working on this book,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.700
would find that
explanation absurd.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.610
I mean, the Iranian government
and the Iranian intelligence

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.300
unit have some of the most
sophisticated surveillance

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.650
systems in the world.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.660
They operate much like the
Stasi did in Eastern Europe.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.190
They have neighbors
spying on neighbors,

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.970
taxicab drivers acting
as spies and reporting

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.860
about foreigners etc.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.440
Who pick them up.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.580
And the idea that
elements within Iran

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:22.160
be it the Iranian government
or the Iranian intelligence

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.430
authorities do not know what
happened to Bob Levinson

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.630
is beyond the pale.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:34.890
One of the things that
also became clear to me

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.390
as I was working on
the book, and also one

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.120
of the more shocking and
depressing aspects of it,

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.610
is that in many ways our
government does not care

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.550
what happened to Bob Levinson.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:53.230
Over the course of my
investigation, much of which

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:58.650
is detailed in the book,
there is clear evidence

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.210
of the Iranian involvement
in Bob's disappearance.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:09.020
The FBI has been investigating
this case for eight or nine

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:13.280
years now and has
probably dossiers

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.010
that would fill this room
and go beyond it of the work

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.200
they've done to try
to gather evidence

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.120
about what happened to Bob.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.520
And I believe if
the head of the FBI

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.340
was here today instead
of me, and one of you

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:37.600
asked him, do you believe that
elements of Iran's intelligence

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.060
hierarchy or religious hierarchy
were involved in the capture

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.630
and detention of
Bob Levinson, he

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.060
would have no alternative
but to say yes.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.810
Because that is what most
FBI agents have told me

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.150
they believe.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.460
But despite that belief,
the Obama administration

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.900
has done nothing to publicize
the involvement of Iran,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:11.160
because sadly, they have a far
broader and different agenda,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.710
which was the
Iranian nuclear deal.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.440
And Bob Levinson,
his case, potentially

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:27.270
his life, his family's welfare,
became collateral damage

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.050
to the pursuit of that deal.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:36.400
I mean, to the extent that
when these recent hostages were

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.900
released, or prisoners
were released,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.200
they actually were hostages not
prisoners, since none of them

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.100
had committed any crimes,
by Iran in January,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.420
the Levinson family
thought initially

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.730
thought that the United States
State Department and government

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.250
officials, White House
officials were actively

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.770
negotiating for Bob's
release while they

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.160
were negotiating for the
release of these prisoners.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:09.120
And not only was the White
House not negotiating

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.210
on behalf of Bob
Levinson, the way

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.010
that the Levinson family, his
wife and Bob's seven children,

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.870
found out about this
release was the same way

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:24.080
every American did, when
they turned on the television

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.560
one morning and they
heard a news report

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.180
that four Americans have
been released by Iranians

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.510
in exchange for Iranian
prisoners held here

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.040
in the United States.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.540
The Obama administration
didn't even

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.050
have the courtesy
to call the Levinson

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.000
family 15 minutes
ahead of time to let

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.660
them know that this husband and
this father wasn't coming home.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.390
And now we know
that $400 million

00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:03.240
was involved in the release
of these American hostages.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:09.100
And one thing that I hope
in months and weeks to come

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.810
will be answered by
congressmen or someone

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:18.660
in authority is, why Bob
Levinson's fate was not

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.150
part of these negotiations.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.320
We don't know whether Bob is
alive, whether Bob perished,

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.110
whether Bob was
killed, but what we

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:36.920
do know is that an American
citizen was captured,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:45.690
detained, and possibly died at
the hands of forces within Iran

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:50.270
without any demands
for accountability

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.620
by this government.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.350
And I guess,
ultimately, that's been

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.060
one of the most shocking
takeaways for me

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.990
from being involved
in this story.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.920
Anyway, they put
a clock up there

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.190
to make sure I don't
run over too much time.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.780
And I think I'm about 24
seconds beyond what I was

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.860
told how long I was told to go.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.510
I could talk forever about
this, but if any of you

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.330
have any kinds of questions
about Bob's story, what we know

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.840
about him, what we
don't know about him,

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.400
the roles of the various
governments in this saga,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.770
I'd be more than
happy to take them.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.060
I guess there are
microphones there.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.444
If you have questions to ask.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.370
AUDIENCE: So I'm only about
40% done with the book,

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.050
so I don't know all the details.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.820
BARRY MEIER: Did
I ruin it for you?

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.430
I hope I didn't.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.950
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:47.230
BARRY MEIER: OK.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.271
AUDIENCE: It's a real page
turner so far, though.

00:41:49.271 --> 00:41:51.710
I recommend you all pick it up.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.630
So you said the US Government
hasn't been working

00:41:54.630 --> 00:42:00.290
as hard as maybe they could or
should be about his release,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:07.020
but even though everyone's gut
says Iran does this, if they

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:12.230
continue to deny at every turn
that they know where he is,

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.160
and there's no smoking gun,
there's no real proof that he

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.590
did it, how far can the US go?

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.980
And I guess as a
follow up, I was

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:27.170
wondering how the Iranian
government's public stance

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:32.020
on this compares to
other Americans who

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.340
have been arrested there.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.940
I believe in 2009, there were
three hikers who were arrested.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.050
How does their publicity?

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.934
Do they always have
this wall of denial?

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:43.850
BARRY MEIER: They're
both excellent questions.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:47.000
And as to the first
one, since you're only

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.210
40% through the book, I
won't ruin the fact for you

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.710
that there are
some smoking guns.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.940
And you'll get to one of them
towards the end of the book.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:08.000
I have been told, along
with that smoking gun,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.070
there's different
types of evidence.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.660
There's evidence that you
would go to court with

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.710
to convict someone, right?

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.050
Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:22.820
Then there's evidence
that you could

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.500
put on the table
today that would point

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.300
to an inescapable conclusion,
that would be clear to anyone

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.360
looking at that evidence,
that the conclusion--

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.420
that there is no
other possibility,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.870
no other reasonable possibility
that elements within Iran

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.746
were involved with Bob's
disappearance and capture.

00:43:47.746 --> 00:43:52.020
And there is evidence of that
nature both within the book

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.150
and within the files of the FBI.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.910
Because I have been specifically
told that by FBI agents.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:02.197
FBI agents have said
to me the conclusions

00:44:02.197 --> 00:44:04.030
you reach in the book,
which are essentially

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:08.980
the conclusions I've
just laid out to you,

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.620
we are so glad
that you did that,

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:17.720
because we are being
prevented from saying that.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.800
And that's the
dilemma right now.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.700
As to the other cases,
it's very interesting.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.400
So there have been
over the years a number

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.210
of Iranian-Americans--
I know there

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.110
is a young Iranian-American
woman in the audience today,

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.543
so I will emphasize
this for her benefit.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.510
Iran has made a habit of
arresting dual nationals,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:50.490
because it does not recognize
the part of their nationality

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:53.140
that comes after
the Iranian part.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.710
They consider
Iranian-Americans Iranians.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:58.830
They consider Iranian-British
citizens Iranians.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.200
But what's very interesting, and
I think very, very illustrative

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:13.110
in Bob's case, is
that all those people

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:18.450
were arrested and publicly
charged with spying,

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.080
like the hikers,
despite the fact

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.780
that there was no evidence
that any of them were spying.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:33.660
Bob Levinson was in the broadest
definition of that word a spy.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.820
He was there to spy.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.750
He was there to gather
information for the United

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.410
States government.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.810
He may have been there
on a rogue mission,

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.850
but he was there to spy.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:51.330
And the Iranian government
pretended he didn't exist.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:57.340
Because they saw a value to
him in being an actual spy

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.840
that they didn't
see in the people

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:06.380
that they put on these phony
show trials, spy show trials.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.100
So I hope that
answers that question.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.030
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, so they

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.770
would go out and announce
something about it?

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.353
BARRY MEIER: Yeah,
they would announce

00:46:17.353 --> 00:46:18.860
like they arrest the hikers.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.720
Hey, they're spies.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.550
They keep them in the
regular prison system.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.660
They march them out.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.070
They pretend that there's some
kind of judicial proceeding

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.450
going on, that they're
following the laws of Iran

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.720
in indicting and
prosecuting a spy.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.610
Bob never was in a prison.

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:40.910
He was kept in some
sort of black site,

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.880
like the CIA used to run.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.440
He was never brought
into the judicial system.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.990
He was never charged
in a court room.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.080
None of those
proceedings took place.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.890
Basically, they put
a bag over his head

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:59.360
and took him off to some
secret place somewhere.

00:47:01.834 --> 00:47:03.500
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you weren't sure

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.310
if it was religious
or government

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.916
agents who were holding him.

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.390
Could you go into more depth
about the religious groups

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.675
there?

00:47:13.675 --> 00:47:14.425
BARRY MEIER: Sure.

00:47:14.425 --> 00:47:17.200
So basically we think
of the United States

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.510
and we think about
most Western countries

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.000
as having a government.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.320
There's a single government,
and that government acts,

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.350
whether we agree with it or not,
in some sort of cohesive way.

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.050
So something happens.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.290
It's the United States
government did it,

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.940
or the CIA did it, or some
formal government agency

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.460
did it.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.390
Iran is a country that
is filled with factions.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.440
So you have what we think
of as the government.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.080
Then you have these
other factions over here,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.560
like the Revolutionary Guards.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.830
And they have their
own hierarchies.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:55.750
And then you have
the religious groups.

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.230
And the religious hierarchy
with the Supreme Leader

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.620
at the head of it have
their own intelligence unit.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:09.120
So you have these structures
that are not common to us,

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.050
but they are structures
that operate side

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.460
by side with each other.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.230
Sometimes they operate in
silos from one another.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.670
Sometimes they intersect
with one another.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.850
And it's a very
confusing situation,

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:26.540
but it's very unlike
what we're used to.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.229
Sir?

00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:28.770
AUDIENCE: Does anyone
know or suspect

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.844
which group made the video?

00:48:31.844 --> 00:48:32.510
BARRY MEIER: No.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.910
I mean, what was very
interesting is that there were

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:43.900
great efforts made by whomever
was making the video to mask

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.550
who made it and to
mask any suggestion

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.060
that it was made by
any organized group,

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.970
be it in Iran or elsewhere.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.270
For example, one of the things
that you will read about

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.490
in the book is what
the FBI did to try

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.740
to analyze the videotape.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.840
So one of the things,
as I mentioned

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.660
in reading the prologue,
there is music playing

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.380
in the background.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:14.920
And this music turns out to be
music from some tribal region

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.490
in Afghanistan.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:21.060
Pashtun, it was a
Pashtun wedding song.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.840
And the Pashtun people
are a large ethnic group

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.850
of people that are
in Afghanistan,

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.180
and Iran, and Iraq.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.180
And basically the
purpose of that music,

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:39.320
according to FBI analysis,
was both to mask, cover up,

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.810
any ambient noise, that
when they're deconstructing

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.520
the tape, sometimes
they can hear people

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.900
on the street, planes overhead.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:52.600
And that can be used as a clue
to try to identify the person's

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.770
location.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.830
So it was both to mask
that ambient noise

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.380
and also to throw
out a false flag clue

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.109
as to where he might be held.

00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:04.650
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned negotiations.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.820
Those negotiations were
made with an unknown party?

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.460
BARRY MEIER: I'm sorry, sir?

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.670
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned negotiations.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.260
They were made with
an unknown party?

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.560
BARRY MEIER: No, they
were made with the Iranian

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.030
Ministry of Intelligence.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:15.070
AUDIENCE: So that was
[INAUDIBLE] from the video?

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.280
BARRY MEIER: With the
government of Iran, who claimed,

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.510
we don't know
anything about him.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:19.176
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:19.770
Thanks.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.645
BARRY MEIER: Nothing.

00:50:20.645 --> 00:50:22.760
Yeah, so those
negotiations went nowhere.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.460
Sir?

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.126
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:24.126 --> 00:50:26.680
I'm curious about your opinion.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.947
Do you feel like he's
a real victim here?

00:50:29.947 --> 00:50:31.780
Or do you feel like
it's a, "he made his bed

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.260
and he's lying in it" situation?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.700
Or is it somewhere in between?

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.250
BARRY MEIER: I would say
it is somewhere in between.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.340
Bob Levinson's a
fascinating character.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.730
I mean, one of the
things that, to me,

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:47.841
and this goes back to like my
desire to be a fiction writer.

00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:50.090
One of the hardest things
about being a fiction writer

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:51.790
is creating characters.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.630
We like fiction when
we find characters

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:59.430
that we can relate to, that we
get into, that appeal to us.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.840
And they don't have
to be always good.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.090
They can be complicated.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:10.170
I was given kind of Bob's
character on a plate

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:14.530
when I was given his
reports and his emails.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:20.650
And his emails form the
dialogue in parts of this book.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.450
You learn about
him as a character

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.490
through his reports
and his emails

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.770
and his interactions
with people.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:35.170
And Bob, I guess as slightly
on the other side or middle--

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.880
I like to think to myself
psychologically that I'm still

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.770
a middle aged man.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:46.420
And Bob, who was in his
late 50s at the time,

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.970
was fascinating to me.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.890
Because we all come to a point
in our life, or many of us

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.240
do, where the world
is changing around us.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.270
And we don't know whether what
we've done to make a living,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.520
to be relevant, is
relevant anymore.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.030
And people become
desperate, some people,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.300
to find ways to keep
their hand in the game.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.790
And that very much is where
Bob Levinson found himself when

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.400
he started working for the CIA.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.870
He knew nothing about Iran.

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:20.400
He knew nothing about
the Middle East.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.370
His expertise in the FBI was
with Russian organized crime.

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.200
But he had seven kids, so
he had financial pressures.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.510
He was a person of
pride, who thought

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.760
he was a great investigator.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.690
And so he was willing to
take a risk that I certainly

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:41.500
would have never
taken, most people

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.970
would have never
dreamed of taken.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.480
But he decided to
take that risk.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.330
So yes, in that sense,
he did make his own bed,

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:54.870
but it was a risk that,
to me, humanizing him.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:56.500
AUDIENCE: It spoke
to you, that risk.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.999
BARRY MEIER: Yeah,
it humanizes him.

00:52:57.999 --> 00:52:59.820
It makes him much
more accessible

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.670
than some James Bond guy who's
like, oh well, I can do this.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:05.500
I'm a high falutin spy.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.550
It humanizes him.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.320
It humanizes his story.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:15.850
I mean, don't forget
that as a country,

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:20.290
as people, when
somebody goes out

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:24.820
and puts himself into danger,
they go climb a mountain

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.900
that they shouldn't be
climbing, they go out

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:33.340
in a boat into a rough sea,
they throw caution to the wind,

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.820
we don't abandon those people.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.060
We don't abandon them.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.080
We try to find them.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.310
We try to rescue them.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:44.440
We try to do what we can
to save them, particularly

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:50.020
in a case like this, where
whether you think what he did

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.460
was right or wrong, whatever
conclusion you come to,

00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:00.419
you ultimately have to walk
away with the understanding

00:54:00.419 --> 00:54:02.210
that he actually was
trying to do something

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.700
good for this country.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.040
He may have been
wrong about that.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.650
He may have been naive about
that and foolish about that,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.470
but he did have the interests
of this country in mind

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.602
when he did what he did.

00:54:18.602 --> 00:54:19.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:20.685
BARRY MEIER: You're
very welcome.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.870
AUDIENCE: Do you think
a new administration

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.740
will be better for trying
to secure his release?

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:35.830
BARRY MEIER: To
me, the thing that

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:40.230
will bring Bob's
story to conclusion,

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.120
and I believe more
than anything and I

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.860
would like to see that
happen for his family,

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:50.930
having gotten to know his family
over the course of what is now

00:54:50.930 --> 00:55:01.470
almost 9 and 1/2 years, I
want them to have closure.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.980
They deserve closure.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.100
They did not wish
this upon themselves.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.180
They did not do anything to
bring this upon themselves.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.330
And the people that took Bob and
held Bob and may have allowed

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:17.830
Bob to die are
visiting a cruelty

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.700
upon them that is
both unimaginable,

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:26.080
and unjustifiable, and baseless.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.210
There's nothing to be
gained by it anymore.

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.740
Where our government
is concerned,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:39.790
the best they can do, I
believe, by the Levinson family

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:45.870
is to lay out what they know
about the involvement in Iran

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:50.080
in his case, and then let the
chips fall where they may.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.656
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:51.656 --> 00:55:53.031
BARRY MEIER: You're
very welcome.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.380
OK.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.750
Well, anyway, it's one o'clock.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.850
You guys get to go back to work.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:00.960
I get to go back to work.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.810
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.430
I really, really
appreciate it, and I

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:08.300
hope that you enjoy
the book as well.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:08.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.450
Thank you.
