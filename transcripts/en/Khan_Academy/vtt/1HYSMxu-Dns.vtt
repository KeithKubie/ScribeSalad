00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.269
Voiceover: What we're going
to talk about in this video

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:07.859
are the negatives of
fractional reserve lending.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.127
And the biggest negative of
fractional reserve lending,

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:12.611
and these are all related,

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.354
is that it's fundamentally unstable

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:16.210
unless you have a lot of engineering

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.987
on the part of central
banks and governments

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:19.495
to make it more stable.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:22.967
Unnatural things have to be put

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.745
in place to make it stable.

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.912
And the reason why I say it's unstable

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:29.654
is because all of these
depositors have been promised

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.500
that their money is safe and sound,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.874
that at any point they
can come to the bank

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:38.274
and get their money. It's on demand.

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:41.536
But a good fraction of that
money is being lent out.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.738
You can imagine, let's say
that all of these banks

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:45.909
are lending out the money responsibly,

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.674
but let's say this bank
something shady happens.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:50.221
It lends out money in a really bad way

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:51.663
and it doesn't get it back,

00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:53.005
or maybe it's even worse.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.041
Maybe there's some type
of fraud taking place

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.003
where executives were embezzling money.

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.164
Whatever. These are good
actors within a fractional

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:00.493
reserve lending system.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.510
This is a bad actor.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.789
It made a bad loan.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.744
Now all of a sudden this money is gone.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.252
If you don't have any support from central

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:09.045
banks or from governments,

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:10.872
now all of these customers
are going to say,

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:12.669
"Wait, I heard something
shady happened at this bank."

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.592
They're all going to show up at this bank

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:18.486
all on the same day and
they're going to say,

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.217
"Give us back our money."

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:21.891
Then it will be pretty
clear that their money

00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:23.805
actually was not available,

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.638
that it was lent out, some of it was lost.

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.822
They will be very upset,
these people right over here.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.200
It's not just bad for this bank.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.314
It's not just bad for this bank.

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:37.004
It doesn't even have to be that this bank

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.071
actually did anything fundamentally bad.

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.404
If even rumors start to spread
that something at this bank

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.074
is a little bit fishy,

00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:46.162
you could imagine every one
of these bank's customers

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:48.538
showing up when that news
report hits and says,

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.050
"Give us back our money."

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.936
They'll say, "Well I can give
you back 10% of your money.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.760
"The other 90% has been lent out."

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.218
That won't just affect this bank.

00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:59.554
As soon as these people
try to go get their money

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:01.070
and they're not able to see it,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.942
then the rest of the economy,

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:04.403
all the other actors in it will say,

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:07.423
"Wow, the banking system isn't
as solid as I thought it was."

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:08.982
So all of these other banks,

00:02:08.982 --> 00:02:10.565
and maybe there wasn't
any news report written

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:12.172
about them and they
didn't do anything shady.

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.424
All of their customers are
going to start showing up.

00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:16.842
They're going to say,
"Well, you promised me

00:02:16.842 --> 00:02:18.572
"that my money is available on demand,

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.353
"well I'm demanding it right now."

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:22.397
Of course they're not
going to be able to get it

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:25.691
because their money was being lent out.

00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:27.906
The situation that you
have right here is called

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:29.666
a run on banks.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.753
You know banks lent out 90% of the money

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:34.903
and so really people
cannot get access to it.

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:38.353
You can imagine this is a
very, very, very bad situation.

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:40.266
You can have major bank failures.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.344
A lot of lending starts to be ...

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:44.586
The whole banking system
essentially has to unwind

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:48.200
in some way and it would probably throw

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.207
the economy as a whole into something

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:54.614
of a downward spiral.

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:58.839
So the way that governments
attempt to address this issue

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.211
and in particular it's
usually the Central Bank,

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:02.873
is they say, "Okay we'll insure banks."

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:05.581
That's why you'll often
see at the front door

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.751
of a bank you'll see FDIC,

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.481
which means Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation,

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.424
which means that the
federal reserve is insuring

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:13.755
that bank.

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:15.271
So for whatever reason,

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:17.337
it's usually up to some
amount of deposits,

00:03:17.337 --> 00:03:19.345
if one of these scenarios happens

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.927
and the bank does not
have the money on hand,

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:23.601
the Federal Reserve will say,

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:28.231
"Okay, we'll just make sure
that you have the money."

00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:30.411
It's not an easy process
and it takes some time

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:33.744
but eventually the Federal
Reserve will give them the money.

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:36.735
But that by itself
creates another problem.

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:39.534
So that creates really the second problem

00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:46.239
is bad incentive, or nonmarket,
I would say discipline.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.084
Bad incentives.

00:03:48.084 --> 00:03:50.734
Because in a traditional
system if I was giving

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.942
my money to someone and
they were going to go

00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:54.318
and lend it to someone else,

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:56.382
I would really care how
they're lending that money.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.117
I would really care how they're managing

00:03:58.117 --> 00:03:59.577
their business.

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:02.404
I would want transparency in terms of what

00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:05.563
investments they're making and
how safe they are etc, etc.

00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:08.897
But in a situation where
all of the banks have this

00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:10.571
FDIC insurance,

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.988
they essentially are back
stopped by the government.

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:16.764
Now all of the sudden when
customers go to the bank

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.316
they're like, "You know
what? I really don't

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:19.820
"care what you do with my money.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.422
"I have FDIC banking so all I really care

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:25.213
"about is if you have cute kittens on your

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:27.233
"checkbooks and you have lots of ATMs.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.801
"You have very impressive
looking buildings."

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.146
They really wouldn't
scrutinize the financials.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.605
So you don't have that
market incentive anymore

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:36.254
for banks to say, "Hey
look, we are good shepherds

00:04:36.254 --> 00:04:37.388
"of your money.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:39.320
"Look at where your
assets are being spent.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.963
"We want the market to scrutinize us onto

00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:43.233
"whether we are making good loans

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:44.900
"or we are making bad loans."

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.670
The third problem with
fractional reserve lending

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.646
is that because of
fractional reserve lending,

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:53.534
you're giving the private banking system

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:56.335
a good deal of control
over the money supply.

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.817
If they lend more,

00:04:57.817 --> 00:05:03.403
so lending translates into
more money in the money supply

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.957
or the other way around,

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:06.703
if lending were to go away,

00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:09.561
that would mean contraction of
money in the lending supply.

00:05:09.561 --> 00:05:12.486
The problem with this is
when the economy is weak.

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:16.407
Let's say you have a recession,

00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:21.615
standard monetary policy
arguments you would say,

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:23.345
you want to increase the money supply.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:25.408
Maybe you want to lower
interest rates so that

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.710
people will borrow and start
to consume or invest again.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.473
So you want during a
recession, you want more money.

00:05:32.473 --> 00:05:34.045
What's going to happen?

00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:35.710
Central Bank tends to do that.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.543
When it is clear that
it is in a recession,

00:05:37.543 --> 00:05:40.549
the Central Bank will
attempt to print more money.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.457
But in a fractional
reserve lending system,

00:05:42.457 --> 00:05:44.809
that's only part of the
money supply equation.

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.713
You also have the lending and
when you're in a recession,

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:50.637
lending goes back.

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:52.094
So this is what you want.

00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:53.741
You want this.

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.223
Central Bank might do it.

00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:57.066
That is what you want.

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:59.311
The reality is in a recession the banks

00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:00.589
are going to get scared.

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.342
They're going to see their loans go bad

00:06:02.342 --> 00:06:04.368
and you have less lending.

00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:07.469
It's going to essentially have the exact

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.384
opposite effect of what you want.

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:13.514
You're going to have less, and
I should put money in quotes.

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:15.081
It depends on how you define money

00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.035
but you have less money in circulation.

00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:18.736
The opposite happens in the boom.

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:21.089
The economy is down
and out in a recession.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.301
It's going to be even worse
when that lending dries up.

00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:25.420
There's going to be even
less money in circulation.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.370
It's going to be even harder for people

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.030
to get access to capital.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.808
The opposite is true in a boom.

00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:33.535
I'm running out of real
estate on my screen.

00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:39.069
In a boom when the economy is
well heated or overheating,

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.074
Central Bank will say,
"Hey let me take a little

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:43.697
"bit of that fuel out of the fire."

00:06:43.697 --> 00:06:48.492
So what you want is less
money and Central Bank

00:06:48.492 --> 00:06:51.205
might do that by taking
securities it owns,

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:52.808
selling it in the open market

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.545
and then it takes that cash and it could

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:56.542
even discontinue that cash,

00:06:56.542 --> 00:07:00.173
and that's what Central Bank could do.

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.612
Central Bank could actually act on this.

00:07:01.612 --> 00:07:03.257
In a boom banks get even more confident.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.527
They get less risk and
start understating the risk

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.069
and so the reality is
you have more lending.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.801
It essentially puts more
... which is more money.

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.671
More money in the system and essentially

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.347
adding more fuels to the flame

00:07:17.347 --> 00:07:20.475
in an economy that is
already getting overheated.

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:23.143
So a lot of times this
fractional reserve lending

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:26.283
might lead to the money creation process

00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:28.206
going in the exact opposite
direction that you want

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:31.025
it to go if you really wanted to moderate

00:07:31.025 --> 00:07:34.000
the fluctuations in the economy.
