00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.350
Brand new Benjamins hit
the streets this week,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.670
so what do all those little
symbols on your $100 bills

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.211
mean, anyway?

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:11.710
Hey, guys.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.110
This is Annie for DNews.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.672
Newly redesigned $100 bills
went into circulation this week,

00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:17.880
though it might be a little
while before you actually

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.922
lay eyes on one.

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.380
Depending on how
often you actually

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.740
come into contact with $100
bills in general-- in my case,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.290
never.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.346
But you, maybe you're a
bank teller, say this guy.

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:29.220
In which case, you may
have already seen one.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.803
Either way, when you
do, you'll notice

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:32.420
a number of changes
meant to enhance

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.930
the security of the bill.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.350
Now as some background,
counterfeit US currency

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.440
is relatively rare.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.320
In 2003, the US Department of
Treasury estimated $70 million

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.170
worth of counterfeit US cash
in circulation worldwide,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.970
which actually only
accounts for about one

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.460
out of every 10,000 notes.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.950
But it's not unheard of,
and hundreds are obviously

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.300
among the most valuable fakes.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.290
You might remember
reports from several years

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.270
ago about so-called
super notes, which

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.980
were near-perfect $100
fakes that were once

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.560
rumored to come
from North Korea.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.210
In the early 2000s,
a British gang

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.130
was charged with printing
millions of dollars

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.330
worth of high caliber
fakes as well.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.170
So every few years, the US
adds new security features

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.420
to stay ahead of the curve.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.150
And in this version,
there are two.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.080
A blue 3D ribbon with
images of bells and 100s,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.560
and a color-changing
bell in an inkwell.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.120
Both are meant to
be user-friendly,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.742
allowing average people to
easily verify that it's real.

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:22.200
Apart from those
two changes, there

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.580
are several design
updates that, as always,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.350
incorporate bits of US
history and identity.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.870
The biggest being the Benji
himself, Benjamin Franklin,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.945
who happens to be one of two
non-US presidents whose mug

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.150
is on paper currency,
the other being Alexander

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.719
Hamilton on your 10 spots.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.260
Hold the bill up to
light, and you'll

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.920
see a second Benjamin
on the right.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Other details include
tiny printed words

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.630
on his jacket collar and
phrases from the Declaration

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.600
of Independence to the
right of the portrait.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.975
And on the front
and back, you'll

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.720
see gold 100s in large type
to help the visually impaired

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.010
recognize the bills.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.822
Currency design in general
has attracted lots of intrigue

00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:56.280
over the years,
the most persistent

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.870
of these having to do with
the symbol on the back of ones

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.580
and a vast Freemason or
Illuminati conspiracy,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.730
depending on what
message board you're on.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.600
This theory was so
persistent that it once

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.842
prompted an official rebuke
from the Freemasons of America.

00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:10.800
Well, what all that detail
really comes down to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.980
is making it as difficult
as possible to forge,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.500
and maybe even nice to look at.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.516
It's money, after all.

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:17.640
And for more on how money
makes the world go round,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.710
be sure to check out
Trace's episode from a while

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.005
back on the real value
of paper currency.

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.380
Have you seen one of these
new bills out in the wild yet?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.810
Let us know in the comments
or on Twitter @DNews.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.230
As always, thanks for tuning
in, and I'll see you next time.
