sensors at all and one of the reasons

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149
sensors at all and one of the reasons
 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.099
sensors at all and one of the reasons
for that is that or anything like that

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109
for that is that or anything like that
 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:36.980
for that is that or anything like that
so it's you're not were Xcode that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
so it's you're not were Xcode that
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.739
so it's you're not were Xcode that
depends on sensors you're gonna have to

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749
depends on sensors you're gonna have to
 

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.450
depends on sensors you're gonna have to
do some programming and testing to see

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
do some programming and testing to see
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910
do some programming and testing to see
if the sensor is there you may even want

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
if the sensor is there you may even want
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260
if the sensor is there you may even want
to get a little bit more subtle because

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
to get a little bit more subtle because
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.989
to get a little bit more subtle because
people who've done this kind of stuff

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999
people who've done this kind of stuff
 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.480
people who've done this kind of stuff
have noticed that you're doing motion

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
have noticed that you're doing motion
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.029
have noticed that you're doing motion
related stuff it makes a big difference

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039
related stuff it makes a big difference
 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.330
related stuff it makes a big difference
whether the phone has an excel because a

gyroscope or not
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.280
gyroscope or not
and that's they better quality data if

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290
and that's they better quality data if
 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.960
and that's they better quality data if
there's a gyroscope or some cases you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970
there's a gyroscope or some cases you
 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.670
there's a gyroscope or some cases you
might even get by engineer on this note

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680
might even get by engineer on this note
 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.130
might even get by engineer on this note
I respond for example now having said

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140
I respond for example now having said
 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620
I respond for example now having said
all that what the person who's asking

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630
all that what the person who's asking
 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.749
all that what the person who's asking
here yeah yeah something like that

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759
here yeah yeah something like that
 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.130
here yeah yeah something like that
none are you one of the people can see

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
none are you one of the people can see
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.990
none are you one of the people can see
so no doesn't look like it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
so no doesn't look like it
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.890
so no doesn't look like it
not anymore as I can tell nope okay

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
not anymore as I can tell nope okay
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.140
not anymore as I can tell nope okay
somebody else just doing anyhow so what

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
somebody else just doing anyhow so what
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.690
somebody else just doing anyhow so what
yan was really driving it was you know

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
yan was really driving it was you know

should we try and crack down on apparent

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
should we try and crack down on apparent
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.410

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
 
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.090
 
current dependability test suite does

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
current dependability test suite does
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.670
current dependability test suite does
have some tests but I've tried on a few

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
have some tests but I've tried on a few
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.979
have some tests but I've tried on a few
devices and they're actually pretty good

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989
devices and they're actually pretty good
 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.270
devices and they're actually pretty good
for accelerometer and gyroscope in

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
for accelerometer and gyroscope in
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.979
for accelerometer and gyroscope in
particular when I use them I noticed

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989
particular when I use them I noticed
 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.360
particular when I use them I noticed
some little quirks that in certain

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
some little quirks that in certain
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.580
some little quirks that in certain
particular hardware but but not that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590
particular hardware but but not that
 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.290
particular hardware but but not that
many there's also some basic types of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300
many there's also some basic types of
 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.590
many there's also some basic types of
the API do to check so let me say a few

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600
the API do to check so let me say a few
 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.270
the API do to check so let me say a few
things in general first of all

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
things in general first of all
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.800
things in general first of all
empirically I see that there's quite a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810
empirically I see that there's quite a
 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.660
empirically I see that there's quite a
few decent apps out there that make

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670
few decent apps out there that make
 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.539
few decent apps out there that make
excellent use of the other sensors in

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549
excellent use of the other sensors in
 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.920
excellent use of the other sensors in
particularly accelerometer and the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
particularly accelerometer and the
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.560
particularly accelerometer and the
gyroscope so so whereas there are some

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570
gyroscope so so whereas there are some
 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.080
gyroscope so so whereas there are some
compatibility issues here we see that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090
compatibility issues here we see that
 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.520
compatibility issues here we see that
people have successfully worked around

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
people have successfully worked around
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.100
people have successfully worked around
them for the pitman sauce so so you know

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110
them for the pitman sauce so so you know
 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870
them for the pitman sauce so so you know
maybe a little harder than we don't like

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880
maybe a little harder than we don't like
 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.220
maybe a little harder than we don't like
it to be but you can actually do it

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
it to be but you can actually do it
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.810
it to be but you can actually do it
another thing I actually point out is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820
another thing I actually point out is
 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.530
another thing I actually point out is
that the compatibility test suite is one

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
that the compatibility test suite is one
 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.940
that the compatibility test suite is one

test and submit it to the project you

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070
test and submit it to the project you

looking at it
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.430
looking at it
the final point somebody made was that

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440
the final point somebody made was that
 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.290
the final point somebody made was that
the observed issues where that sense if

we're giving wonky value this when the
 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.590
we're giving wonky value this when the
screen was tough which means probably

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600
screen was tough which means probably
 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.570

actually any live bugs file on them
 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.350
actually any live bugs file on them
perhaps the reason there is that all the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360
perhaps the reason there is that all the
 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.590
perhaps the reason there is that all the
work that I did on exam children was you

tests in the CTS so ok I would look at I
 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.130
tests in the CTS so ok I would look at I
would add that if if you are using

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140
would add that if if you are using
 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.200
would add that if if you are using
sensors and you run into something which

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210
sensors and you run into something which
 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.320
sensors and you run into something which
you think is a bug or it is not working

might have I'm working with a whole

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610
might have I'm working with a whole
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.940
might have I'm working with a whole
bunch of background threads and I'm

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950
bunch of background threads and I'm
 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.070
bunch of background threads and I'm
starting to really have some issues with

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080
starting to really have some issues with
 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.780
starting to really have some issues with
race conditions and trying to figure out

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:33.790
race conditions and trying to figure out
 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.170
race conditions and trying to figure out
which thread is doing what and that sort

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180
which thread is doing what and that sort
 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.990
which thread is doing what and that sort
of thing I just started looking at

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000
of thing I just started looking at
 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.720
of thing I just started looking at
traceview a couple days ago and it is

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730
traceview a couple days ago and it is
 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.030
traceview a couple days ago and it is
incredibly difficult to try and make any

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040
incredibly difficult to try and make any
 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.790
incredibly difficult to try and make any
sense of what actually gives me is there

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
sense of what actually gives me is there
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.630
sense of what actually gives me is there
a recommended practice or a different

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:51.640
a recommended practice or a different
 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.370
a recommended practice or a different
tool perhaps that might a little more

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:53.380
tool perhaps that might a little more
 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.750
tool perhaps that might a little more
sense well so traceview is more for

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:56.760
sense well so traceview is more for
 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.920
sense well so traceview is more for
performance optimizations it gives you

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:58.930
performance optimizations it gives you
 

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.710
performance optimizations it gives you
an idea of you know when your app is you

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720
an idea of you know when your app is you
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.320
an idea of you know when your app is you
know drawing to the screen when it is

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330
know drawing to the screen when it is
 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.770
know drawing to the screen when it is
actually using CPU things like that it's

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:07.780
actually using CPU things like that it's
 

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.750
actually using CPU things like that it's
not so good at seeing interactions

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:09.760
not so good at seeing interactions
 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.320
not so good at seeing interactions
between three

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330
between three
 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.530
between three
and really there's not too much this

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:13.540
and really there's not too much this
 

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.180
and really there's not too much this
really to do good job of visualizing

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.190
really to do good job of visualizing
 

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.280
really to do good job of visualizing
that for you your best tool really there

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.290
that for you your best tool really there
 

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.430

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.570
timestamp so I'm trying to figure out it
maybe there's a way that I

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:15.580
maybe there's a way that I
 

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.580
maybe there's a way that I
read data without synchronizing on it

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.590
read data without synchronizing on it
 

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.300
read data without synchronizing on it
but write data without that's what I can

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.310
but write data without that's what I can
 

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.640
but write data without that's what I can

to I mean I could use a content provider
 

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.390
to I mean I could use a content provider
I'm sure that would simplify a lot of

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.400
I'm sure that would simplify a lot of
 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.340
I'm sure that would simplify a lot of
things but I don't actually have me of a

you feel any better what you're trying
 

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.440
you feel any better what you're trying

to do is well-known to be a hard thing
 

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.460
to do is well-known to be a hard thing
yeah well I know I I know that I mean I

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:53.470
yeah well I know I I know that I mean I
 

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.220
yeah well I know I I know that I mean I
originally had programmed in C++ so I

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.230
originally had programmed in C++ so I
 

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.050

mean it's even worse yeah I was hoping

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.060
mean it's even worse yeah I was hoping
 

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.160
mean it's even worse yeah I was hoping
there might be some sort of tool that

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:08.930
and I don't think a content provider
 

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.580
and I don't think a content provider
would help you all that much because um

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:11.590
would help you all that much because um
 

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.640
would help you all that much because um
that's just a lightweight in a lot of

probably just didn't do a very good job

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:25.889
probably just didn't do a very good job
 

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:31.790
probably just didn't do a very good job
of it okay um any other comments or

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800
of it okay um any other comments or
 

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.410
of it okay um any other comments or
ideas that we can provide

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420
ideas that we can provide
 

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.720
ideas that we can provide
I think that's covered quite a bit yeah

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:38.730
I think that's covered quite a bit yeah
 

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.490
I think that's covered quite a bit yeah
I'll take a look at the concurrent

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500
I'll take a look at the concurrent
 

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.810
I'll take a look at the concurrent
classes that sounds like it might be a

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820
classes that sounds like it might be a
 

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.689
classes that sounds like it might be a
good place to start okay yeah thank you

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699
good place to start okay yeah thank you
 

00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:46.639
good place to start okay yeah thank you
very much for your patience yeah thank

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:46.649
very much for your patience yeah thank
 

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:48.910
very much for your patience yeah thank
you hmm all right so we have another

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920
you hmm all right so we have another
 

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:55.400
you hmm all right so we have another

that's basically the topic today so we

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:06.570
that's basically the topic today so we
 

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.710
that's basically the topic today so we
were talking about the accelerometer in

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720
were talking about the accelerometer in
 

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.000
were talking about the accelerometer in
particular you're not working in the

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.010
particular you're not working in the
 

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.319
particular you're not working in the
background of some devices right so

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:14.329
background of some devices right so
 

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:17.300
background of some devices right so
there's I mean there is a ton of devices

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:17.310
there's I mean there is a ton of devices
 

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.040
there's I mean there is a ton of devices
and reports to the surrounding net but

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.050
and reports to the surrounding net but
 

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.769
and reports to the surrounding net but
there's also a fairly easy solution of

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779
there's also a fairly easy solution of
 

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:24.530
there's also a fairly easy solution of
course on some devices basically restart

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540
course on some devices basically restart
 

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.259
course on some devices basically restart

of broadcasts the problem there is or
 

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.860
of broadcasts the problem there is or
the question would be is so in some

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:33.870
the question would be is so in some
 

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.009
the question would be is so in some
devices human does not work so if you

00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019
devices human does not work so if you
 

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.110
devices human does not work so if you
hold the partial weight lock on the

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120
hold the partial weight lock on the
 

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.639
hold the partial weight lock on the
device should that let me restart the

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:43.649
device should that let me restart the
 

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:48.050
device should that let me restart the
accelerometer or not that's a good

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060
accelerometer or not that's a good
 

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.470
accelerometer or not that's a good
question and I don't think the behavior

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480
question and I don't think the behavior
 

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.689
question and I don't think the behavior
there is actually specified as part of

00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699
there is actually specified as part of
 

00:15:53.699 --> 00:15:55.759
there is actually specified as part of
the API I suspect what you've probably

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:55.769
the API I suspect what you've probably
 

00:15:55.769 --> 00:16:00.019
the API I suspect what you've probably
found out something that works by chance

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:00.029
found out something that works by chance
 

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:03.860
found out something that works by chance
but not by design so it's difficult to

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:03.870
but not by design so it's difficult to
 

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.530
but not by design so it's difficult to
say exactly just to be clear when you

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540
say exactly just to be clear when you
 

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.569
say exactly just to be clear when you
say in the background do you mean your

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579
say in the background do you mean your
 

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:10.069
say in the background do you mean your
app is no longer in the foreground or do

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079
app is no longer in the foreground or do
 

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.030
app is no longer in the foreground or do
you mean you've actually shut the phone

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040
you mean you've actually shut the phone
 

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.460
you mean you've actually shut the phone
completely off so I mean it doesn't even

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.470
completely off so I mean it doesn't even
 

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.259
completely off so I mean it doesn't even
matter the Epson in the for rather

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:15.269

background right it's basically there's

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
background right it's basically there's
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.009

then some phones when you press the
 

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.689
then some phones when you press the
power button right and you turn the

00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699
power button right and you turn the
 

00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:29.840
power button right and you turn the
screen off then automatically shuts down

actually need to wait for a couple of

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:37.370
actually need to wait for a couple of
 

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.400
actually need to wait for a couple of
seconds and then restart the

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.410
seconds and then restart the
 

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.160
seconds and then restart the
accelerometer right so the expected

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.170
accelerometer right so the expected
 

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.020
accelerometer right so the expected
behavior or the documented thing would

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.030
behavior or the documented thing would
 

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.000
behavior or the documented thing would
be even for the wakelock right the

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.010
be even for the wakelock right the
 

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.460
be even for the wakelock right the

partial way clock should keep the at
 

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.440
partial way clock should keep the at
least the processor running and I would

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:50.450
least the processor running and I would
 

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.710
least the processor running and I would
expect that by default it will enable

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720
expect that by default it will enable
 

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.560
expect that by default it will enable
you to do other stuff as well right that

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:56.570
you to do other stuff as well right that
 

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.020
you to do other stuff as well right that

it's you know leaving the accelerometer

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880
it's you know leaving the accelerometer
 

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.760
it's you know leaving the accelerometer
running when the screen is off consumes

running when the screen is off consumes
 

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.830
running when the screen is off consumes
a lot of battery power so let's just go

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840
a lot of battery power so let's just go
 

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.690
a lot of battery power so let's just go
in and terminate in the accelerometer

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:58.700
in and terminate in the accelerometer
 

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.470
in and terminate in the accelerometer
listeners that are that are waiting and

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480
listeners that are that are waiting and
 

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.430
listeners that are that are waiting and
they probably just you know maybe they

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440
they probably just you know maybe they
 

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.540
they probably just you know maybe they
didn't think through the implications of

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:04.550
didn't think through the implications of
 

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.520
didn't think through the implications of
that or maybe they really don't want you

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:06.530
that or maybe they really don't want you
 

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.750
that or maybe they really don't want you
to do that who knows but any case it's

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760
to do that who knows but any case it's
 

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.310
to do that who knows but any case it's
not that the behavior here isn't

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320
not that the behavior here isn't
 

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.500
not that the behavior here isn't
something that we specify in the API I

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:14.510
something that we specify in the API I
 

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.510
something that we specify in the API I
do agree though that the right thing

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520
do agree though that the right thing
 

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.640
do agree though that the right thing
probably is to leave the accelerometer

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:18.650
probably is to leave the accelerometer
 

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.670
probably is to leave the accelerometer
running as long as you hold away clock

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:20.680
running as long as you hold away clock
 

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.290
running as long as you hold away clock
so generally speaking when you run into

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:23.300

to go and make sure that the behavior is

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440
to go and make sure that the behavior is
 

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.060
to go and make sure that the behavior is
really well specified and basically that

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.070
really well specified and basically that
 

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.190
really well specified and basically that
means filing a bug so if you go to beat

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200
means filing a bug so if you go to beat
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.560
means filing a bug so if you go to beat
on intercom you know that that's usually

our recommendation open them up a bug
there and if you're really ambitious you

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.110
there and if you're really ambitious you
 

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.830
there and if you're really ambitious you
can actually go

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840
can actually go
 

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.440
can actually go
so far as to submit a patch since you

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:45.450
so far as to submit a patch since you
 

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.430
so far as to submit a patch since you
bought this up here I'll make sure that

about I have an Excel spreadsheet so I
 

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.790
about I have an Excel spreadsheet so I
can send it to you because just

generally do most of them turn off would

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:00.540
generally do most of them turn off would
 

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.380
generally do most of them turn off would
be most of them stay upon I would say

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.390
be most of them stay upon I would say
 

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.860
be most of them stay upon I would say
it's kind of 50/50 situation yeah

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:06.870
it's kind of 50/50 situation yeah
 

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.310
it's kind of 50/50 situation yeah
so it works it works I have problems

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320
so it works it works I have problems
 

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.440
so it works it works I have problems
actually on on a Google device I think

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.450
actually on on a Google device I think
 

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.680
actually on on a Google device I think
the galaxy asked a little Nexus a

Spartan was problematic in that regard

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.530
Spartan was problematic in that regard

Spartan was problematic in that regard
um what what's the use case I mean I'm

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:22.290
um what what's the use case I mean I'm
 

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.900
um what what's the use case I mean I'm
assuming that you want to be able to

off by saying okay if I have a wakelock

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:33.330
off by saying okay if I have a wakelock
 

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.660
off by saying okay if I have a wakelock
than it shouldn't turn off so what are

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:35.670
than it shouldn't turn off so what are
 

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.620
than it shouldn't turn off so what are
you trying to accomplish by this so

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:39.630
you trying to accomplish by this so
 

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.710
you trying to accomplish by this so
here's the the use case right huh I want

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720
here's the the use case right huh I want
 

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.720
here's the the use case right huh I want
a monitor let's say let's pretend I want

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:44.730
a monitor let's say let's pretend I want
 

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.280
a monitor let's say let's pretend I want
to monitor activity during the day right

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.290
to monitor activity during the day right
 

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.140
to monitor activity during the day right
so I have a service that's in the

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.150
so I have a service that's in the
 

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.150
so I have a service that's in the
background and every time you turn on

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160
background and every time you turn on
 

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.210
background and every time you turn on
screen the accelerometer goes off what

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220
screen the accelerometer goes off what
 

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.280
screen the accelerometer goes off what
we do here in our case is we acquire a

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.290
we do here in our case is we acquire a
 

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.860
we do here in our case is we acquire a
new way clock and you partial a clock is

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:57.870
new way clock and you partial a clock is
 

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.730
new way clock and you partial a clock is
it really the pillars that you need to

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740
it really the pillars that you need to
 

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.680
it really the pillars that you need to
acquire a new one because the old don't

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:03.690
acquire a new one because the old don't
 

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.540
acquire a new one because the old don't
want to be expires that happens in the

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.550
want to be expires that happens in the
 

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.120
want to be expires that happens in the
cero devices so you listen for the

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.130
cero devices so you listen for the
 

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.450
cero devices so you listen for the
screen ah broadcast you acquire a new

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460
screen ah broadcast you acquire a new
 

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.140
screen ah broadcast you acquire a new
way clock the same second you wait for I

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.150
way clock the same second you wait for I
 

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.360
way clock the same second you wait for I
think we were waiting for 3 seconds was

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.370
think we were waiting for 3 seconds was
 

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.460
think we were waiting for 3 seconds was
the sweet spot and then we go to the

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:19.470
the sweet spot and then we go to the
 

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.330
the sweet spot and then we go to the
accelerometer and say hey start now and

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340
accelerometer and say hey start now and
 

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.990
accelerometer and say hey start now and
then it's on in 99.5% of the cases it

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000
then it's on in 99.5% of the cases it
 

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.570
then it's on in 99.5% of the cases it
actually works with some device yeah

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580
actually works with some device yeah
 

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.020
actually works with some device yeah
it's I mean I can I can understand why

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.030
it's I mean I can I can understand why
 

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.270
it's I mean I can I can understand why
we would turn off the accelerometer in

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280
we would turn off the accelerometer in
 

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.060
we would turn off the accelerometer in
viña what I don't understand is this the

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.070
viña what I don't understand is this the
 

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.910
viña what I don't understand is this the
next 0.5% of devices which ignored the

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:40.920
next 0.5% of devices which ignored the
 

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.510
next 0.5% of devices which ignored the
way clock the chilli that should allow

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520
way clock the chilli that should allow
 

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.090
way clock the chilli that should allow
you to to wake the the damn

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100
you to to wake the the damn
 

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.580
you to to wake the the damn
ironically okay so it seems like the if

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:49.590
ironically okay so it seems like the if
 

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.740
ironically okay so it seems like the if
we were to admit it's a bug it would be

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:51.750
we were to admit it's a bug it would be
 

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.510
we were to admit it's a bug it would be
a welcome well characterized but it's

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520
a welcome well characterized but it's
 

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.400
a welcome well characterized but it's
the case square you're trying to turn it

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.410
the case square you're trying to turn it
 

00:20:55.410 --> 00:21:03.020
the case square you're trying to turn it
on when them which is yes it sounds like

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.030
on when them which is yes it sounds like
 

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.350
on when them which is yes it sounds like
I mean is it's it's a bug in the sense

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360
I mean is it's it's a bug in the sense
 

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.210
I mean is it's it's a bug in the sense
that its behavior that's not well

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220
that its behavior that's not well
 

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.640
that its behavior that's not well
specified so so again this is a really

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:10.650
specified so so again this is a really
 

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.020
specified so so again this is a really
good candidate for something that we

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.030
good candidate for something that we
 

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.340
good candidate for something that we
should include as part of the

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:13.350
should include as part of the
 

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.650
should include as part of the
compatibility test suite right so if you

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660
compatibility test suite right so if you
 

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.029
compatibility test suite right so if you
since you already have that spreadsheet

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039
since you already have that spreadsheet
 

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.470
since you already have that spreadsheet
there's actually really good data to

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480
there's actually really good data to
 

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.850
there's actually really good data to
pass along to our engineer so we can do

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860
pass along to our engineer so we can do
 

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.240
pass along to our engineer so we can do
some testing on our end probably the

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:23.250
some testing on our end probably the
 

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.470

I think law cat has a the log has a

I think law cat has a the log has a

flush mechanism I
 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.400

make sense it's possible that they are
 

00:22:56.179 --> 00:22:59.140

you want to get around that maybe a good
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.870
you want to get around that maybe a good
idea would be to go and include the

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880
idea would be to go and include the
 

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.640
idea would be to go and include the
system time when the log messages

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:09.650
system time when the log messages
 

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.030
system time when the log messages
generated as part of your log message I

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.040
generated as part of your log message I
 

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.460

would say said like on a modern four

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:15.470
would say said like on a modern four
 

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.950
would say said like on a modern four
four core processor it would be really

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960
four core processor it would be really
 

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.810
four core processor it would be really
really hard to do look at in the ways

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:19.820
really hard to do look at in the ways
 

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.490
really hard to do look at in the ways
that you know I mean you know something

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:21.500
that you know I mean you know something
 

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.020
that you know I mean you know something
might happen but then you get swapped

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.030
might happen but then you get swapped
 

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.370
might happen but then you get swapped
over right so he doesn't like swapping

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:24.380
over right so he doesn't like swapping
 

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.880
over right so he doesn't like swapping
yep right you know I see the system time

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:27.890
yep right you know I see the system time
 

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.460
yep right you know I see the system time
is a good way of doing it okay perfectly

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:30.470
is a good way of doing it okay perfectly
 

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.740
is a good way of doing it okay perfectly
just does log have a flush method do you

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:32.750
just does log have a flush method do you
 

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.650
just does log have a flush method do you
guys know uh no I don't think so

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:35.660
guys know uh no I don't think so
 

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.890
guys know uh no I don't think so
okay it's what's happening behind the

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:38.900
okay it's what's happening behind the
 

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.390
okay it's what's happening behind the
scenes where you can control them yeah

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400
scenes where you can control them yeah
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.289
scenes where you can control them yeah
yeah thanks Jerry

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:46.299
yeah thanks Jerry
 

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:49.480
yeah thanks Jerry
anyone else I have you know that the

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:49.490
anyone else I have you know that the
 

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.190
anyone else I have you know that the
reason I do this is I have to ask the

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200
reason I do this is I have to ask the
 

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.230
reason I do this is I have to ask the
engineer if there's anybody else and I

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240
engineer if there's anybody else and I
 

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.730
engineer if there's anybody else and I
hang out because I can only see one

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:54.740
hang out because I can only see one
 

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.090
hang out because I can only see one
other person at the time I'm gonna put

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:58.100
other person at the time I'm gonna put
 

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.990
other person at the time I'm gonna put
Martin back on okay go ahead Martin

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000
 
 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.799
 
okay just another quick one it's not a

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:05.809
okay just another quick one it's not a
 

00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:11.140
okay just another quick one it's not a
related to sensors but should be fairly

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.150
related to sensors but should be fairly
 

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.520
related to sensors but should be fairly
easy to answer if you know anything

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:12.530
easy to answer if you know anything
 

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.919
easy to answer if you know anything
about it so I've been having a ton of

00:24:14.919 --> 00:24:14.929
about it so I've been having a ton of
 

00:24:14.929 --> 00:24:17.470
about it so I've been having a ton of
problems with the calendar timezone

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480
problems with the calendar timezone
 

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.789
problems with the calendar timezone
thingy and I'm wondering if there's I've

00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799
thingy and I'm wondering if there's I've
 

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:24.400
thingy and I'm wondering if there's I've
been able to find one bug report on the

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.410
been able to find one bug report on the
 

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.159
been able to find one bug report on the
older phones but it's I feel like it

00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:27.169
older phones but it's I feel like it
 

00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:29.140
older phones but it's I feel like it
still haven't been hadn't been fixed so

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:29.150
still haven't been hadn't been fixed so
 

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.970
still haven't been hadn't been fixed so
you have to make this on the calendar

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:30.980
you have to make this on the calendar
 

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.610
you have to make this on the calendar
right which you can set the zone the

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:33.620
right which you can set the zone the
 

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.190
right which you can set the zone the
time zone you have the the field zone

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200
time zone you have the the field zone
 

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.280
time zone you have the the field zone
offset right and you have the time zone

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.290
offset right and you have the time zone
 

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.190
offset right and you have the time zone
parameter timezone step time zone method

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200
parameter timezone step time zone method
 

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.580
parameter timezone step time zone method
that actually takes the time zone object

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:44.590
that actually takes the time zone object
 

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.530
that actually takes the time zone object
I'm just wondering if both of those

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:47.540
I'm just wondering if both of those
 

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.140
I'm just wondering if both of those
methods should work the same or not

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.150
methods should work the same or not
 

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.860
methods should work the same or not
hmm yeah not familiar enough with the

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:55.870
hmm yeah not familiar enough with the
 

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.030
hmm yeah not familiar enough with the
API to know what the difference between

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.040
API to know what the difference between
 

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.320
API to know what the difference between
those two is that's a really good

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.330
those two is that's a really good
 

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.410
those two is that's a really good
question I think we're gonna have to do

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:04.420
question I think we're gonna have to do
 

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.230
question I think we're gonna have to do
some research there and get back to you

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240
some research there and get back to you
 

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.200
some research there and get back to you
I've written it down I'll go over

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.210
I've written it down I'll go over
 

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.760
I've written it down I'll go over
questions from last week at the beating

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:11.770
questions from last week at the beating
 

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.200
questions from last week at the beating
of the next Joe actually no I suppose

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.210
of the next Joe actually no I suppose
 

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.060
of the next Joe actually no I suppose
forgot to do that I have answers to

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.070
forgot to do that I have answers to
 

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.350
forgot to do that I have answers to
questions from last week too like it's

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360
questions from last week too like it's
 

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.230
questions from last week too like it's
important we can do we have agreed to

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240
important we can do we have agreed to
 

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.400
important we can do we have agreed to
let Tim yeah listen to do it Tim let's

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.410
let Tim yeah listen to do it Tim let's
 

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.810
let Tim yeah listen to do it Tim let's
keep Tim on the line here as long as we

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:24.820
keep Tim on the line here as long as we
 

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.310
keep Tim on the line here as long as we
can and then we'll go over a question

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320
can and then we'll go over a question
 

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.200
can and then we'll go over a question
from last week a little bit later right

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.210

show next week we should have some more
 

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.520
show next week we should have some more
info for you all right thank you have a

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:47.530
info for you all right thank you have a
 

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.980
info for you all right thank you have a
question we want to use as much time of

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:49.990
question we want to use as much time of
 

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.810
question we want to use as much time of
Tim's as we can get so we're gonna move

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:51.820
Tim's as we can get so we're gonna move
 

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.720
Tim's as we can get so we're gonna move
on to the moderator to get some more

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:56.730
 
 

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.250
 
sensor questions yes thank you sensor

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.260
sensor questions yes thank you sensor
 

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.340
sensor questions yes thank you sensor
questions recommend best practices to

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:02.350
questions recommend best practices to
 

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.720
questions recommend best practices to
get input from sensors for a

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:03.730
get input from sensors for a
 

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.550
get input from sensors for a
long-running application with the

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:05.560
long-running application with the
 

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.310
long-running application with the
display off that does not drain the

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320
display off that does not drain the
 

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:17.130
display off that does not drain the
battery here for the reason one of the

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:17.140
battery here for the reason one of the
 

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.690
battery here for the reason one of the
reasons why sensors drain batteries is

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:18.700
reasons why sensors drain batteries is
 

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.370
reasons why sensors drain batteries is
not so much that the sensor itself

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:20.380
not so much that the sensor itself
 

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.350
not so much that the sensor itself
consumes power is that it's calling you

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360
consumes power is that it's calling you
 

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.180
consumes power is that it's calling you
back like 100 times a second or I think

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.190
back like 100 times a second or I think
 

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.890
back like 100 times a second or I think
the slowest possible rate they can do

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:25.900
the slowest possible rate they can do
 

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.730
the slowest possible rate they can do
it's like 20 or 30 times a second and so

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:29.740
it's like 20 or 30 times a second and so
 

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.290
it's like 20 or 30 times a second and so
you know that's waking up your process

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:31.300
you know that's waking up your process
 

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.500
you know that's waking up your process
looking into it and unfortunately if you

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:34.510
looking into it and unfortunately if you
 

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.810
looking into it and unfortunately if you
look at typical sensor callbacks they're

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:36.820
look at typical sensor callbacks they're
 

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.730
look at typical sensor callbacks they're
full of trigonometry and math libraries

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:38.740
full of trigonometry and math libraries
 

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.190
full of trigonometry and math libraries
and floating-point and you know we're

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200
and floating-point and you know we're
 

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.280
and floating-point and you know we're
not cheap they so so I would really

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:44.290
not cheap they so so I would really
 

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.800
not cheap they so so I would really
totally not recommend leaving the sensor

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:46.810
totally not recommend leaving the sensor
 

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.600
totally not recommend leaving the sensor
run so if I were gonna do this kind of

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:48.610
run so if I were gonna do this kind of
 

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.070
run so if I were gonna do this kind of
thing what I would do is I would put

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080
thing what I would do is I would put
 

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.260
thing what I would do is I would put
myself into its service and you know

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:52.270
myself into its service and you know
 

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.360
myself into its service and you know
schedule myself to wake up you know

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.370
schedule myself to wake up you know
 

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.919
schedule myself to wake up you know
every so often

00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:55.929
every so often
 

00:26:55.929 --> 00:26:57.509
every so often
you know turn the sensors on for 10

00:26:57.509 --> 00:26:57.519
you know turn the sensors on for 10
 

00:26:57.519 --> 00:27:01.080
you know turn the sensors on for 10
seconds gather a bunch of data then go

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.090
seconds gather a bunch of data then go
 

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:01.799

no ideally I would not do much data

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:05.470
no ideally I would not do much data
 

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.840
no ideally I would not do much data
processing unless there's actually

gather the data stuff it in the database
go back to sleep you know the ratio

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360
go back to sleep you know the ratio
 

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.820
go back to sleep you know the ratio
between the amount of time you're awake

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:17.830
between the amount of time you're awake
 

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.499
between the amount of time you're awake
in the amount of time you're asleep you

00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:19.509
in the amount of time you're asleep you
 

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:20.999
in the amount of time you're asleep you
don't work it up you know but if you're

00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:21.009
don't work it up you know but if you're
 

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:23.310
don't work it up you know but if you're
only awake you know four can you know

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320
only awake you know four can you know
 

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.659
only awake you know four can you know
five percent of the time you're really

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:24.669
five percent of the time you're really
 

00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:27.109
five percent of the time you're really
not gonna hurt the batteries that much

00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:27.119
not gonna hurt the batteries that much
 

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:29.100
not gonna hurt the batteries that much
now the one thing you asked about was

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.110
now the one thing you asked about was
 

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.889
now the one thing you asked about was
GPS and that's a different thing so one

00:27:31.889 --> 00:27:31.899
GPS and that's a different thing so one
 

00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:33.749
GPS and that's a different thing so one
thing to watch out for is while you're

00:27:33.749 --> 00:27:33.759
thing to watch out for is while you're
 

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:34.320
thing to watch out for is while you're
asleep

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:34.330
asleep
 

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.119

you should totally do is go and look at

00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:42.879
you should totally do is go and look at
 

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:44.549
you should totally do is go and look at
some of the stuff that radar has been

that's so for the regular sensors just

00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:16.899
that's so for the regular sensors just
 

00:28:16.899 --> 00:28:19.379
that's so for the regular sensors just

for the location and go and look and do
 

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.690
for the location and go and look and do
a radio set right there I will add one

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:24.700
a radio set right there I will add one
 

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.690

more thing on GPS there - a lot of times

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:27.700

what you need when you're trying to turn

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:29.289
what you need when you're trying to turn
 

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:32.609
what you need when you're trying to turn
GPS on doesn't actually require GPS you

00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:32.619
GPS on doesn't actually require GPS you
 

00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:34.109
GPS on doesn't actually require GPS you
can use the course location provider

00:28:34.109 --> 00:28:34.119
can use the course location provider
 

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:36.419
can use the course location provider
which will still get you actually a

00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:36.429
which will still get you actually a
 

00:28:36.429 --> 00:28:39.359
which will still get you actually a
fairly accurate location fix but without

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:39.369
fairly accurate location fix but without
 

00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:41.430
fairly accurate location fix but without
the power overhead of turning the GPS

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440
the power overhead of turning the GPS

lock and all this other stuff which

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320
lock and all this other stuff which
 

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.460
lock and all this other stuff which
takes time and CPU so if you can note it

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:47.470
takes time and CPU so if you can note it
 

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.989
takes time and CPU so if you can note it
all get away with it use the course

00:28:48.989 --> 00:28:48.999
all get away with it use the course
 

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:51.359
all get away with it use the course
location provider first in addition to

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:51.369
location provider first in addition to
 

00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:53.159
location provider first in addition to
you know all the other stuff like using

00:28:53.159 --> 00:28:53.169
you know all the other stuff like using
 

00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:54.539
you know all the other stuff like using
the passive location provider and

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:54.549
the passive location provider and
 

00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:56.609
the passive location provider and
definitely look the rate of rate is post

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:56.619
definitely look the rate of rate is post
 

00:28:56.619 --> 00:28:58.830
definitely look the rate of rate is post
but yeah keep in mind GPS isn't your

00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840
but yeah keep in mind GPS isn't your
 

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.880
but yeah keep in mind GPS isn't your
only option for location

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:02.890
 
 

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:08.380
 
okay I'm looking for sensor related

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.390
okay I'm looking for sensor related
 

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.169
okay I'm looking for sensor related
stuff yeah there's that one sorry the

00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:11.179
stuff yeah there's that one sorry the
 

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:13.149
stuff yeah there's that one sorry the
next one down Joe is actually different

00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159
next one down Joe is actually different
 

00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:16.720
next one down Joe is actually different
from the rest of his actually the next

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:16.730
from the rest of his actually the next
 

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.880
from the rest of his actually the next
one the next one down for you mean yon

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:20.890
one the next one down for you mean yon
 

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:26.350
one the next one down for you mean yon
yes okay can you a question yeah sensors

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360
yes okay can you a question yeah sensors
 

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.180
yes okay can you a question yeah sensors
for fragmentation could you enforce on

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:28.190
for fragmentation could you enforce on
 

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.769
for fragmentation could you enforce on
manufacturers somewhat more standards

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:31.779
manufacturers somewhat more standards
 

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:34.210
manufacturers somewhat more standards
many sensors returning values will kneel

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:34.220
many sensors returning values will kneel
 

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.389

in the cage hold on for a second
I think that's further up and you gotta

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:39.529
I think that's further up and you gotta
 

00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:43.269
I think that's further up and you gotta
be that's it yeah

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279
be that's it yeah
 

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:46.000
be that's it yeah
here we are many sensors return values

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.010
here we are many sensors return values
 

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.919
here we are many sensors return values
only when they change could this become

part of the spec and draw a line between
 

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.360
part of the spec and draw a line between
sensors that do just that and those

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.370
sensors that do just that and those

no as of now yeah no I didn't actually

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:01.940
no as of now yeah no I didn't actually
 

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.340
no as of now yeah no I didn't actually
know that I've never used such a

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:03.350
know that I've never used such a

I was going and reading this TDD and

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:06.830
I was going and reading this TDD and
 

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.220
I was going and reading this TDD and
things like that and I gather than 4.1

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.230
things like that and I gather than 4.1
 

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.500
things like that and I gather than 4.1
we did introduce a new type of sensor

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:11.510
we did introduce a new type of sensor
 

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.769
we did introduce a new type of sensor
that is what's called a streaming sensor

00:30:13.769 --> 00:30:13.779
that is what's called a streaming sensor
 

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:16.360
that is what's called a streaming sensor
but then you just read live values out

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.370
but then you just read live values out
 

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.730
but then you just read live values out
of it having said that I've never used

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:18.740
of it having said that I've never used
 

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.620
of it having said that I've never used
one and I didn't have time to go and

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:20.630
one and I didn't have time to go and
 

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.380
one and I didn't have time to go and
drill down on it so they actually had to

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.390
drill down on it so they actually had to
 

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.840
drill down on it so they actually had to
do quite a bit of architectural work the

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:25.850
do quite a bit of architectural work the
 

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.180
do quite a bit of architectural work the
core sensor code because all the stuff

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:28.190
core sensor code because all the stuff
 

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.639

callback based so so the answer to Yanis

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:34.250
callback based so so the answer to Yanis
 

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.600
callback based so so the answer to Yanis
question is yes this couldn't become

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:37.610
question is yes this couldn't become
 

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.039
question is yes this couldn't become
part of spec and it has become part of

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:39.049
part of spec and it has become part of
 

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:41.049
part of spec and it has become part of
spec but no I don't actually have any

00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:41.059

has asked a question before are there
 

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.139
has asked a question before are there
any use cases for sensors and apps which

whatever type of device it is from the
 

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.650
whatever type of device it is from the
environment which means that you can't

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:13.660
environment which means that you can't
 

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.200
environment which means that you can't
directly use the touch screen but you

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.210
directly use the touch screen but you
 

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:22.050
directly use the touch screen but you
can still use the accelerometer so any

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.060
can still use the accelerometer so any
 

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.680

question is how do you prefer to

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960
question is how do you prefer to
 

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.920
question is how do you prefer to
recognize this kissters I mean basically

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:07.930
recognize this kissters I mean basically
 

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.740
recognize this kissters I mean basically
have parameter data you can use a few

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:12.750
have parameter data you can use a few
 

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.330
have parameter data you can use a few
aberthol sensors like linear

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:15.340
aberthol sensors like linear
 

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.810
aberthol sensors like linear
acceleration you know and they actually

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:18.820
acceleration you know and they actually
 

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.000
acceleration you know and they actually
provide to use the acceleration hotel

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.010
provide to use the acceleration hotel
 

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.850
provide to use the acceleration hotel
and if you want to direct the movement

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:23.860
and if you want to direct the movement
 

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.060
and if you want to direct the movement
itself would go for example some symbol

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.070
itself would go for example some symbol

the pin device it not to use integration

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:40.780
the pin device it not to use integration
 

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.820
the pin device it not to use integration
and just to try to use raw sensor data

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:43.830
and just to try to use raw sensor data
 

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.130

however maybe is there some way of some

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.140
however maybe is there some way of some
 

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.680
however maybe is there some way of some
filters for example which will help to

messy as it comes off the sensor so you
 

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.180
messy as it comes off the sensor so you
have to do some filtering from that

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.190
have to do some filtering from that
 

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.160

to do that for like a month or two and I
 

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.810
to do that for like a month or two and I
couldn't do it and if you look at

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:42.820
couldn't do it and if you look at
 

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.060
couldn't do it and if you look at

somebody could figure out how to do that
 

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.400
somebody could figure out how to do that
and make it work I think that would be a

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:11.410
and make it work I think that would be a
 

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.620

now this reminds me of another question

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:15.850
now this reminds me of another question
 

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.910
now this reminds me of another question
that actually saw earlier in moderator

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920
that actually saw earlier in moderator
 

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.690
that actually saw earlier in moderator
and that was the the kid number who lost

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:21.700
and that was the the kid number who lost
 

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.250
and that was the the kid number who lost
it but the question was are there any

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:23.260
it but the question was are there any
 

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.290
it but the question was are there any
good libraries out there to go and do

good libraries out there to go and do
 

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.180
good libraries out there to go and do
gesture detection since right now you we

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:27.190

just provide the low level like

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:28.900
just provide the low level like
 

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.320
just provide the low level like

now I'm not actually familiar of any
 

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.130
now I'm not actually familiar of any

acceleration but no I think that it's

00:37:59.520 --> 00:37:59.530
acceleration but no I think that it's
 

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.620
acceleration but no I think that it's
actually a fairly weak area okay so

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:01.630
actually a fairly weak area okay so
 

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.300
actually a fairly weak area okay so
that's actually probably actually going

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.310
that's actually probably actually going
 

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.700
that's actually probably actually going
back to last question to on open areas

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:05.710
back to last question to on open areas
 

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.740
back to last question to on open areas
for development and so if somebody wants

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:07.750
for development and so if somebody wants
 

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.870
for development and so if somebody wants
to do some open source work that really

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880
to do some open source work that really
 

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.430
to do some open source work that really
benefit the community I think this is

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440
benefit the community I think this is
 

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.580
benefit the community I think this is
it's an open area for development

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:13.590
it's an open area for development
 

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.230
it's an open area for development
Yeah right like a library that does

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240
Yeah right like a library that does
 

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.210
Yeah right like a library that does
gesture recognition right there's um

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220
 
 

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.820
 
gestures right there was a question here

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:23.830
gestures right there was a question here
 

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.490
gestures right there was a question here
from Pablo about standard sensor based

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:26.500
from Pablo about standard sensor based
 

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.920

yeah that that was the one yeah right

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.270
yeah that that was the one yeah right
 

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:35.460
yeah that that was the one yeah right
and my I don't know for sure but I think

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:35.470
and my I don't know for sure but I think
 

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.560
and my I don't know for sure but I think
we agree that the likelihood of that

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:37.570
we agree that the likelihood of that
 

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.440
we agree that the likelihood of that
happening anytime soon is not high but

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:40.450
happening anytime soon is not high but
 

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.870
happening anytime soon is not high but
it's certainly a place where other

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880

Java code but it C just work pretty well

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:21.950
Java code but it C just work pretty well
 

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.740

it's okay I actually have a comment to

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:23.750
it's okay I actually have a comment to
 

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:28.330
it's okay I actually have a comment to
this cuz it it kind of goes to what Tim

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:28.340
this cuz it it kind of goes to what Tim
 

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.070

was talking about where he worked on it

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.080
was talking about where he worked on it
 

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.520
was talking about where he worked on it
for a long time and you know struggle

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:33.530
for a long time and you know struggle
 

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.950
for a long time and you know struggle
with it basically what you're talking

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960
with it basically what you're talking
 

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.510
with it basically what you're talking
about doing is an inertial guidance

rockets they all do it they do it
 

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.500
rockets they all do it they do it
incredibly well but they're talking

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:44.510
incredibly well but they're talking
 

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:46.200
incredibly well but they're talking
about something where they're measuring

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.210
about something where they're measuring
 

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.670

feet accurate over several miles and
 

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.120
feet accurate over several miles and
you're talking about you know

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:52.130
you're talking about you know
 

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.280
you're talking about you know
millimeters accuracy you know and a foot

devices that are actually doing it they

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.070
devices that are actually doing it they
 

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.000
devices that are actually doing it they
were purpose-built for that task so

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.010
were purpose-built for that task so
 

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.220
were purpose-built for that task so
there are sensors for much more accurate

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.230
there are sensors for much more accurate
 

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.750

there are analog to digital conversions

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760
there are analog to digital conversions
 

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.190
there are analog to digital conversions
much more accurate they're able to do a

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200
much more accurate they're able to do a
 

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.630
much more accurate they're able to do a
lot more processing because they have

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640
lot more processing because they have
 

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.420
lot more processing because they have
DSP chips to do all this math and much

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:13.430
DSP chips to do all this math and much
 

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.240
DSP chips to do all this math and much
more you know real-time so I think in

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.250
more you know real-time so I think in
 

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.430
more you know real-time so I think in

that's just the nature of the field yeah
and I would also say that there's

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480
and I would also say that there's
 

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.320
and I would also say that there's
various ways there's various types of

various ways there's various types of
 

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.540
various ways there's various types of

sensors that you can use to do the same
 

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.710

type of measurement and then in robotics

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720
type of measurement and then in robotics
 

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.480
type of measurement and then in robotics
at least the question becomes which is

at least the question becomes which is
 

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:15.630
at least the question becomes which is
the best one to use for your particular

a color sensor doesn't mean that that's
 

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.000
a color sensor doesn't mean that that's
necessarily the best way of sensing the

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.010
necessarily the best way of sensing the
 

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.070
necessarily the best way of sensing the

particular quality of some material that
you have in front of you there might be

you have in front of you there might be
 

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.070
you have in front of you there might be
another sensor that you could choose

our internal development is done on for

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160
our internal development is done on for
 

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.280
our internal development is done on for
obvious reasons it doesn't cover

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:47.290
obvious reasons it doesn't cover
 

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.080
obvious reasons it doesn't cover
everything but a level it does cover a

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.090
everything but a level it does cover a
 

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.210
everything but a level it does cover a
pretty wide spectrum out there and on

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:51.220
pretty wide spectrum out there and on
 

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.530

top of that just devices that are

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:52.540
top of that just devices that are
 

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.090
top of that just devices that are
popular right if there's a lot of users

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:54.100

using a phone it might make sense for
 

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.860
using a phone it might make sense for
you to have one of those too now that

have a ton of phone factor you
 

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.810
have a ton of phone factor you
definitely need to have a ton of phones

everything behaves
 

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.480
everything behaves
consistently across devices but you know

out for that one thing if you do want to
 

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.590
out for that one thing if you do want to
get access to a lot of different devices

get you access to all of that you don't
 

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.370
get you access to all of that you don't
need physical devices in many cases but

of devices and you can get some really

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:08.690
of devices and you can get some really
 

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:12.700
of devices and you can get some really
good data that way - I would say one of

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:12.710
good data that way - I would say one of
 

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.230

the things also don't discount the fact

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240
the things also don't discount the fact
 

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.870
the things also don't discount the fact
that you can you can build as many

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880
that you can you can build as many

and the emulator has gotten a lot better

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.030
and the emulator has gotten a lot better
 

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.330

or run a test suite yeah you if you

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960
or run a test suite yeah you if you
 

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.120
or run a test suite yeah you if you
haven't used the emulator in quite

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:55.130
haven't used the emulator in quite
 

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:56.200
haven't used the emulator in quite
awhile or haven't been following the

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:56.210
awhile or haven't been following the
 

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.350
awhile or haven't been following the
comments there we've added hardware

support and basically that means the

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:04.730
support and basically that means the
 

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.280
support and basically that means the
emulator has actually gotten to the

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:06.290
emulator has actually gotten to the
 

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.460
emulator has actually gotten to the
point where it's not painful to use it

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:09.470
point where it's not painful to use it
 

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.530

actually feels as fast as a normal phone

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:11.540
actually feels as fast as a normal phone
 

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.960
actually feels as fast as a normal phone
in a lot of cases so it really is a

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:13.970
in a lot of cases so it really is a
 

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.730
in a lot of cases so it really is a
useful useful development tool and if

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:15.740
useful useful development tool and if
 

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.080
useful useful development tool and if
you don't find yourself using an

you don't find yourself using an
 

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.000
you don't find yourself using an
emulator now might be a good time to

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.010
emulator now might be a good time to
 

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:22.120
emulator now might be a good time to
give it another try right okay great

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:22.130
give it another try right okay great
 

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.990
give it another try right okay great

the other question was about parsing

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020
the other question was about parsing
 

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.530
the other question was about parsing
JSON data on devices with limited memory

JSON data on devices with limited memory
 

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.110
JSON data on devices with limited memory
and so in particular are there any

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:24.120
and so in particular are there any
 

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.600

and we have two recommendations for you

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740
and we have two recommendations for you
 

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.250
and we have two recommendations for you
the first one is actually already built

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260
the first one is actually already built
 

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.740
the first one is actually already built
into Android so as of honeycomb API

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:33.750
into Android so as of honeycomb API
 

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:37.490
into Android so as of honeycomb API
level 11 we have Android util dot JSON

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500
level 11 we have Android util dot JSON
 

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.060
level 11 we have Android util dot JSON
Reader which is a streaming JSON parser

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:41.070
Reader which is a streaming JSON parser
 

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.150

exactly what you want now if you're on a

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740
exactly what you want now if you're on a
 

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.270
exactly what you want now if you're on a
device that's pre honeycomb we would

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280
device that's pre honeycomb we would
 

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.270
device that's pre honeycomb we would
recommend using a library called JSON so

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280
recommend using a library called JSON so
 

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.090
recommend using a library called JSON so
jeez and you know just Google right said

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:56.100
jeez and you know just Google right said
 

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.720
jeez and you know just Google right said
and it turns out that JSON Reader is

00:50:59.720 --> 00:50:59.730
and it turns out that JSON Reader is
 

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.380
and it turns out that JSON Reader is
actually derived from JSON so the two

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.390
actually derived from JSON so the two
 

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:05.510
actually derived from JSON so the two
have very similar interfaces so if

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520

is something to read for reference later
or what are the fundamentals right

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400
or what are the fundamentals right
 

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.509

the right order yeah so yeah fundamental

00:53:05.529 --> 00:53:05.539
the right order yeah so yeah fundamental
 

00:53:05.539 --> 00:53:08.079
the right order yeah so yeah fundamental
is definitely a good place to start you

00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:08.089
is definitely a good place to start you
 

00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:10.120
is definitely a good place to start you
know that's why it's called fundamentals

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.130
know that's why it's called fundamentals
 

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.670
know that's why it's called fundamentals
right loaders definitely you'll

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680
right loaders definitely you'll
 

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.779
right loaders definitely you'll
definitely want to read up on loaders

00:53:13.779 --> 00:53:13.789
definitely want to read up on loaders

sequel Lite is that I can't or if that's

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200
sequel Lite is that I can't or if that's
 

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.450
sequel Lite is that I can't or if that's
part of the fundamental section or not

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:28.460
part of the fundamental section or not
 

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.859
part of the fundamental section or not
but you'll definitely need to be

00:53:29.859 --> 00:53:29.869
but you'll definitely need to be
 

00:53:29.869 --> 00:53:32.140
but you'll definitely need to be
familiar with that

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.150
familiar with that
 

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:37.030

other things work knowing binder is it
probably nothing you need to know to

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:38.660
probably nothing you need to know to
 

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.090
probably nothing you need to know to
begin with but something you'll probably

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:40.100
begin with but something you'll probably
 

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.680
begin with but something you'll probably
run into eventually so it's that that's

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:41.690
run into eventually so it's that that's
 

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:45.430
run into eventually so it's that that's
the the RPC mechanism for Android see

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440
the the RPC mechanism for Android see
 

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.960
the the RPC mechanism for Android see
what are some other really good sections

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:46.970
what are some other really good sections
 

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:47.500
what are some other really good sections
worth knowing

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:47.510
worth knowing
 

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.020
worth knowing

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:50.030
noting shared preferences definitely a
 

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:53.080
noting shared preferences definitely a
good section to read up on see what else

good section to read up on see what else
 

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.030
good section to read up on see what else
it's it I would say that it's difficult

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040
it's it I would say that it's difficult
 

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.520
it's it I would say that it's difficult
to and you know sort of give you

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:57.530
to and you know sort of give you
 

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.010
to and you know sort of give you
detailed advice without knowing what

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.020
detailed advice without knowing what
 

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.630
detailed advice without knowing what
sort of things you're trying to do if

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640
sort of things you're trying to do if
 

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.010
sort of things you're trying to do if
you're just trying to learn everything

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020
you're just trying to learn everything
 

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:06.010
you're just trying to learn everything
there is to know about Android my

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:06.020
there is to know about Android my
 

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.740
there is to know about Android my
approach to it as always to suggest that

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:08.750
approach to it as always to suggest that
 

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:10.420
approach to it as always to suggest that
people pick a project that they want to

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:10.430
people pick a project that they want to
 

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:13.560
people pick a project that they want to
do and then go off and and try to do it

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:13.570
do and then go off and and try to do it
 

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:18.250
do and then go off and and try to do it
and in addition read the API guides as

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:18.260
and in addition read the API guides as
 

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.530
and in addition read the API guides as
you go along trying to do that project

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:20.540
you go along trying to do that project
 

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.320
you go along trying to do that project
to learn about activities and how

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:23.330
to learn about activities and how
 

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:25.300
to learn about activities and how
activities interact with each other if I

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:25.310
activities interact with each other if I
 

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:26.800
activities interact with each other if I
was going to name it I would say

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:26.810
was going to name it I would say
 

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:33.130
was going to name it I would say
activities intents services yep and also

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:33.140
activities intents services yep and also
 

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:37.540
activities intents services yep and also
shared preferences and fragments

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:37.550
shared preferences and fragments
 

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.120
shared preferences and fragments
probably fragments fragments might be

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:40.130
probably fragments fragments might be
 

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.330
probably fragments fragments might be
very useful as well I think you can you

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:43.340
very useful as well I think you can you
 

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.310
very useful as well I think you can you
can wait on those until after you've

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:45.320
can wait on those until after you've
 

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.770
can wait on those until after you've
gotten through some simple exercises and

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:47.780
gotten through some simple exercises and
 

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.900
gotten through some simple exercises and
you know keep in mind that we have a

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:49.910
you know keep in mind that we have a
 

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:53.110
you know keep in mind that we have a
whole set of Android training that you

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:53.120
whole set of Android training that you
 

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.200
whole set of Android training that you
can do in conjunction with any of the

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:56.210
can do in conjunction with any of the
 

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.570
can do in conjunction with any of the
API guides of your bead right I would

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:58.580
API guides of your bead right I would
 

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.210
API guides of your bead right I would
say you get a solid foundation the

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:01.220
say you get a solid foundation the
 

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.430
say you get a solid foundation the
Android training is sort of split into a

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440
Android training is sort of split into a
 

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.590
Android training is sort of split into a
basic training section in an advanced

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:05.600
basic training section in an advanced
 

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.440
basic training section in an advanced
topic section basic training is this

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:08.450
topic section basic training is this
 

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.140
topic section basic training is this
stuff that everyone should try to learn

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:11.150
stuff that everyone should try to learn
 

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.660
stuff that everyone should try to learn
all of yeah because it's the stuff that

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:13.670
all of yeah because it's the stuff that
 

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:15.550
all of yeah because it's the stuff that
comes up in almost every Android

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:15.560
comes up in almost every Android
 

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.370
comes up in almost every Android
application past a certain size like

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:18.380
application past a certain size like
 

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.080
application past a certain size like
that you're going to write the advanced

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:20.090
that you're going to write the advanced
 

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.060
that you're going to write the advanced
topic stuff is also very useful to know

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.070
topic stuff is also very useful to know
 

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.030
topic stuff is also very useful to know
but it it only matters to your

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040
but it it only matters to your
 

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.580
but it it only matters to your
application some of the time so I would

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:27.590
application some of the time so I would
 

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.530
application some of the time so I would
say definitely cover the getting started

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:29.540
say definitely cover the getting started
 

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.530
say definitely cover the getting started
section of Android

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540
section of Android
 

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.410
section of Android
and it'll it'll cover a really good

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420
and it'll it'll cover a really good
 

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.320
and it'll it'll cover a really good
solid foundation for you yeah and then

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:36.330
solid foundation for you yeah and then
 

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.820
solid foundation for you yeah and then
the training section is probably a

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:37.830
the training section is probably a
 

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:38.750
the training section is probably a
little bit close to what you're trying

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760
little bit close to what you're trying
 

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.070
little bit close to what you're trying
to do - that's that's the section that

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.080
to do - that's that's the section that
 

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.840
to do - that's that's the section that
really is meant to be read sequentially

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:41.850
really is meant to be read sequentially
 

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:44.300
really is meant to be read sequentially
