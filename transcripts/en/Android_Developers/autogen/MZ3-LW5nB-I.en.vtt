sort of the libraries your linked

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500
sort of the libraries your linked
 

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.600
sort of the libraries your linked
against the difference the ones that run

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:41.610

on Wednesdays can I have a quick
 

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.730
on Wednesdays can I have a quick
question yeah you see what do you think

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:36.740
question yeah you see what do you think
 

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.310
question yeah you see what do you think
about implementing have a list of let's

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320
about implementing have a list of let's
 

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.870
about implementing have a list of let's
say items that I have more than I want

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880
say items that I have more than I want
 

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.630

to show the user a couple of quick

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640
to show the user a couple of quick
 

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.990
to show the user a couple of quick
actions on the same row for each item

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000
actions on the same row for each item
 

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.080
actions on the same row for each item
but I need to have two more actions to

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:56.090
but I need to have two more actions to
 

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:01.980
but I need to have two more actions to
the which list on each item on the list

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:01.990
the which list on each item on the list
 

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.810
the which list on each item on the list
so basically I have four actions but two

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:04.820
so basically I have four actions but two
 

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.290
so basically I have four actions but two
of them should be quick actions so I'll

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:08.300
of them should be quick actions so I'll
 

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.720
of them should be quick actions so I'll
do a custom view with added buttons or

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:10.730
do a custom view with added buttons or
 

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.510
do a custom view with added buttons or
something and what do you think should

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520
something and what do you think should
 

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.560
something and what do you think should
be the implementation or the UI for

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:16.570
be the implementation or the UI for
 

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.450
be the implementation or the UI for
having an interaction for two more

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:19.460
having an interaction for two more
 

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.210
having an interaction for two more
actions I thought about the long press

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:22.220
actions I thought about the long press
 

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.250
actions I thought about the long press
but not sure that's the proper because I

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260
but not sure that's the proper because I
 

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:32.020
but not sure that's the proper because I
have actions on the view so what's your

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:32.030
have actions on the view so what's your
 

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.120
have actions on the view so what's your
suggestion you can do context action by

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:34.130
suggestion you can do context action by
 

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.370
suggestion you can do context action by
long-pressing contextual action bar just

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:36.380
long-pressing contextual action bar just
 

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.140
long-pressing contextual action bar just
don't do a pop-up dialog

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.150
don't do a pop-up dialog
 

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.970
don't do a pop-up dialog
there's lots thinking Oh an alternative

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:39.980
there's lots thinking Oh an alternative
 

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.620
there's lots thinking Oh an alternative
if you can look at something like the

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:41.630
if you can look at something like the
 

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.060
if you can look at something like the
cards in Google now they have like a

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.070
cards in Google now they have like a
 

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.710
cards in Google now they have like a
small version of the overflow button

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720
small version of the overflow button
 

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.290
small version of the overflow button
which leads to additional actions or so

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:47.300
which leads to additional actions or so
 

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.910
which leads to additional actions or so
another music app the same similar with

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:48.920
another music app the same similar with
 

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.550
another music app the same similar with
a drop down the little disclosure arrow

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:51.560
a drop down the little disclosure arrow
 

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.470
a drop down the little disclosure arrow
which you could you know normally used

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480
which you could you know normally used
 

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.630
which you could you know normally used
to spin it to do that to show a pop-up

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640
to spin it to do that to show a pop-up
 

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.500
to spin it to do that to show a pop-up
menu that could work as well okay so the

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:58.510
menu that could work as well okay so the
 

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.620
menu that could work as well okay so the
overflow button from Google now could be

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:02.630
overflow button from Google now could be
 

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.680
overflow button from Google now could be
on each on each item on the list yeah

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:05.690
on each on each item on the list yeah
 

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.820
on each on each item on the list yeah
all the disclosure triangle thing just I

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:09.830
all the disclosure triangle thing just I
 

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.869
all the disclosure triangle thing just I
prefer the triangle yeah

00:29:11.869 --> 00:29:11.879
prefer the triangle yeah

yeah me too actually and being ever feel

00:29:16.939 --> 00:29:16.949
yeah me too actually and being ever feel
 

00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:18.079
yeah me too actually and being ever feel
about a contextual action bar because if

00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:18.089
about a contextual action bar because if
 

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.249
about a contextual action bar because if
it is contextual actions mean that's

00:29:19.249 --> 00:29:19.259
it is contextual actions mean that's
 

00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:20.930
it is contextual actions mean that's
what it's there for it also it means if

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940
what it's there for it also it means if
 

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.249
what it's there for it also it means if
you can perform that action on multiple

00:29:22.249 --> 00:29:22.259
you can perform that action on multiple
 

00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:24.439
you can perform that action on multiple
items you kind of get that behavior for

00:29:24.439 --> 00:29:24.449
items you kind of get that behavior for
 

00:29:24.449 --> 00:29:25.699
items you kind of get that behavior for
free with the context action mind

00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:25.709
free with the context action mind
 

00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:28.519
free with the context action mind
annotation which ever you like yeah and

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:28.529
annotation which ever you like yeah and
 

00:29:28.529 --> 00:29:30.379
annotation which ever you like yeah and
that's what I thought because I'm I'm

00:29:30.379 --> 00:29:30.389
that's what I thought because I'm I'm
 

00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:34.009
that's what I thought because I'm I'm
trying to merge several actions to be

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:34.019
trying to merge several actions to be
 

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:39.619
trying to merge several actions to be
more to be more specific

00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:39.629
more to be more specific
 

00:29:39.629 --> 00:29:43.249
more to be more specific
I wanted to use the split action bar to

00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:43.259
I wanted to use the split action bar to
 

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:46.789
I wanted to use the split action bar to
show quick actions that are changed

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799
show quick actions that are changed
 

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:49.969
show quick actions that are changed
contextual a way when you long-haul then

00:29:49.969 --> 00:29:49.979
contextual a way when you long-haul then
 

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:53.269
contextual a way when you long-haul then
when you don't have the long press edit

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279
when you don't have the long press edit
 

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:56.959
when you don't have the long press edit
mode and I wasn't sure if I can maybe

00:29:56.959 --> 00:29:56.969
mode and I wasn't sure if I can maybe
 

00:29:56.969 --> 00:30:00.649
mode and I wasn't sure if I can maybe
show that button or should I use the

00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659
show that button or should I use the
 

00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:07.189
show that button or should I use the
contextual menu so i i i thought of a

00:30:07.189 --> 00:30:07.199
contextual menu so i i i thought of a
 

00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:11.839
contextual menu so i i i thought of a
lot of suggestions i wasn't sure which

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:11.849
lot of suggestions i wasn't sure which
 

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:15.110
lot of suggestions i wasn't sure which
ones to implement

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120
 
 

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.280
 
yeah I like sunny protection action bar

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.290
yeah I like sunny protection action bar
 

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.350
yeah I like sunny protection action bar
or some type drop-down affordance oh
