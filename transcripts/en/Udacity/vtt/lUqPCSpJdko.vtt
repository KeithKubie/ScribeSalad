00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is a little bit tricky. It's not exactly like anything we've done

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:09.266
before, but here's the answer. We have y minus t equals m times the quantity x

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:14.127
minus s. We'll talk more about why this works in just a second. What we have to

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:18.777
notice about the right hand side of this equation, the second to last one we

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:23.744
came up with, is that each term has a factor of m. We call this a common factor,

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:28.336
since the two terms share it. So that means each of these terms can be divided

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:32.738
by m, but it wouldn't end up with a remainder for either one. If we redistribute

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:37.027
the m by multiplying it by either terms inside the parenthesis here, we would

00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:39.690
end up with same equation as we had just before.
