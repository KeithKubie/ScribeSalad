this is my question be great really like
somebody to go further into the concept

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
somebody to go further into the concept
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.000
somebody to go further into the concept
of reverse gravity and dark energy

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
of reverse gravity and dark energy
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009

the most experienced hi Alice so you're

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
the most experienced hi Alice so you're
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.740
the most experienced hi Alice so you're
asking what what is dark energy and

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750
asking what what is dark energy and
 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.060
asking what what is dark energy and
reverse or I suppose anti-gravity really

consists of and well the that concept

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
consists of and well the that concept
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.229
consists of and well the that concept
came out of the observation as you know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
came out of the observation as you know
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.010
came out of the observation as you know
that the universe which is expanding is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
that the universe which is expanding is
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.920
that the universe which is expanding is
not expanding at a steady rate but

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
not expanding at a steady rate but
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080
not expanding at a steady rate but
rather the rate of expansion is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
rather the rate of expansion is
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270
rather the rate of expansion is
increasing the universe has accelerated

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
increasing the universe has accelerated
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.689
increasing the universe has accelerated
expansion and that's hard to explain

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
expansion and that's hard to explain
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.279
expansion and that's hard to explain
because some people in fact expected to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
because some people in fact expected to
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920
because some people in fact expected to
have found that the universe would DXL

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
have found that the universe would DXL
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.179
have found that the universe would DXL
right since matter tends to cause the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
right since matter tends to cause the
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.170
right since matter tends to cause the
universe's acceleration to slow down

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180
universe's acceleration to slow down
 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.820

gravity is always attractive so if

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
gravity is always attractive so if
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.560
gravity is always attractive so if
there's matter or energy it will pull in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
there's matter or energy it will pull in
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.060
there's matter or energy it will pull in
and reverse the expansion the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
and reverse the expansion the
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999
and reverse the expansion the
accelerated expansion therefore could be

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
accelerated expansion therefore could be
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.149
accelerated expansion therefore could be
due to anti-gravity well that's not the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
due to anti-gravity well that's not the
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399
due to anti-gravity well that's not the
case anti-gravity doesn't exist we

case anti-gravity doesn't exist we
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.960

believe what we do believe is and if you
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.550
believe what we do believe is and if you
want an X Factor that explains the

want an X Factor that explains the
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710
want an X Factor that explains the
accelerated expansion but it's a very

anti-gravity not so much because of the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
anti-gravity not so much because of the
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.150
anti-gravity not so much because of the
energy but because of the pressure of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
energy but because of the pressure of
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.650

this stuff the vacuum could it behave

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
this stuff the vacuum could it behave
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.990
this stuff the vacuum could it behave
like a gas or a fluid with both energy

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
like a gas or a fluid with both energy
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.900

fluid has positive energy and positive
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.780
fluid has positive energy and positive
pressure and that causes things to to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
pressure and that causes things to to
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.910

get attracted and contract but stuff

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920

actually causes the universe to have

actually causes the universe to have
 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.830
actually causes the universe to have
accelerated expansion so that's the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
accelerated expansion so that's the
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.470

different to different observers moving
 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.599
different to different observers moving
with different velocities they have

with different velocities they have
 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.330
with different velocities they have
different energy content much like a

automobile has much more energy when
it's moving fast than it does when it's

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980
it's moving fast than it does when it's
 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.430
it's moving fast than it does when it's
at rest but this kind of fluid because

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
at rest but this kind of fluid because
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.340
at rest but this kind of fluid because
it has negative pressure just the right

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350
it has negative pressure just the right
 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.240
it has negative pressure just the right
amount equal to its energy

matter how fast they're moving would see

matter how fast they're moving would see
the same amount of energy and negative

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070
the same amount of energy and negative
 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.960
the same amount of energy and negative
pressure and therefore couldn't tell

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970
pressure and therefore couldn't tell
 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.800
pressure and therefore couldn't tell
which was the preferred observer of the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810
which was the preferred observer of the
 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.110
which was the preferred observer of the
preferred frame of reference so this is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
preferred frame of reference so this is
 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.690
preferred frame of reference so this is
the one kind of energy of momentum

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700
the one kind of energy of momentum

universe that doesn't pick out a
 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.010
universe that doesn't pick out a
preferred observer so it's allowed by

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020
preferred observer so it's allowed by
 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.650
preferred observer so it's allowed by
the theory we should expect it the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660
the theory we should expect it the
 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.270
the theory we should expect it the
therefore from that point of view

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280
therefore from that point of view
 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370
therefore from that point of view
there's nothing strange about this

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380
there's nothing strange about this
 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.980
there's nothing strange about this
observation of the accelerated expansion

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
observation of the accelerated expansion
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.700
observation of the accelerated expansion
of the universe and in fact we can test

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710
of the universe and in fact we can test
 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.400
of the universe and in fact we can test
whether the energy and pressure are

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410
whether the energy and pressure are
 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.980
whether the energy and pressure are
exactly related as Einstein's theory

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990
exactly related as Einstein's theory
 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.140
exactly related as Einstein's theory
would predict so that there was no

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150
would predict so that there was no
 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.970
would predict so that there was no
preferred observer and it works out very

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980
preferred observer and it works out very
 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.570
preferred observer and it works out very
well so they're all as well the only

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
well so they're all as well the only
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.909
well so they're all as well the only
problem we have as theoretical physics

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919
problem we have as theoretical physics
 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.060
problem we have as theoretical physics
is to understand the magnitude of this

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070
is to understand the magnitude of this
 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.340
is to understand the magnitude of this
energy where does it come from we sort

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350
energy where does it come from we sort
 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.700
energy where does it come from we sort
of know that quantum fluctuations and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710
of know that quantum fluctuations and
 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.120
of know that quantum fluctuations and
quantum mechanics the fluctuations of

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130
quantum mechanics the fluctuations of
 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.840
quantum mechanics the fluctuations of
all fields and particles will give rise

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850
all fields and particles will give rise
 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.210
all fields and particles will give rise
to an energy that pervades the vacuum

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220
to an energy that pervades the vacuum
 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.500
to an energy that pervades the vacuum
but we have no way of calculating how

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510
but we have no way of calculating how
 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.860
but we have no way of calculating how
much energy will be produced and all of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870
much energy will be produced and all of
 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.469
much energy will be produced and all of
our attempts so far have gotten the

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479
our attempts so far have gotten the
 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.110
our attempts so far have gotten the
wrong answer so whereas we don't

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120
wrong answer so whereas we don't
 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.120
wrong answer so whereas we don't
understand the magnitude of this energy

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130
understand the magnitude of this energy
 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.740
understand the magnitude of this energy
by any means oh we or at least I am very

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
by any means oh we or at least I am very
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.110
by any means oh we or at least I am very
comfortable with a phenomena itself and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120
comfortable with a phenomena itself and
 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.930
