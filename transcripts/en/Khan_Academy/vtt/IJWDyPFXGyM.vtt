00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.877
Select the piecewise function
whose graph is shown below.

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:06.460
Or I guess we should
say to the right.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660
I copied and pasted it
so it's on the right now.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.250
So we have this piecewise
continuous function.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
So it's not defined for x
being negative 2 or lower.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.340
But then starting at x
greater than negative 2,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.870
it starts being defined.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.210
It's continuous all
the way until we

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.130
get to the point x equals 2 and
then we have a discontinuity.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.750
And then it starts getting
it defined again down here.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.090
And then it is continuous for
a little while all the way.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.990
And then when x is greater than
6, it's once again undefined.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.330
So let's think about
which of these functions

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.300
describe this one over here.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.120
So this one looks like a
radical function shifted.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.490
So square root of x
would look like this.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.640
Let me do it in a color
that you could see.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.800
Square root of x
would look like this.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.610
So the square root
of x looks like this.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.110
And this just looks
like square root

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.280
of x shifted 2 to the left.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.480
So this looks like
square root of x plus 2.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.040
This one right over here looks
like square root of x plus 2.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.910
And you could verify that.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.320
When x is negative 2, negative
2 plus 2, square root of that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.680
is going to be 0.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.970
And it's not defined
there, but we

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.650
see that if we
were to continue it

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.070
would have been defined there.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.480
Let's try some other points.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.950
When x is negative 1,
negative 1 plus 2 is 1.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.310
Principal root of 1 is 1.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.410
Let's try 2.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.900
When x is equal to
2, 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.950
Principal root of
4 is positive 2.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.670
So this just looks like
a pretty good candidate.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580
So it looks like our function.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.639
So let's see, it looks like
our function would be--

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.180
and I'm not going
to call it anything

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.250
because it could
be p, h, g, or f.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.120
But our function, if I
were to write it out,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.890
it looks like over
this first interval.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.120
So it looks like it's the square
root of x plus 2 for negative 2

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.350
being less than x-- it's
not defined at negative 2,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.750
but as long as x is greater than
negative 2 and x is less than

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.000
or equal to 2.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.910
And x is less than
or equal to 2.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.690
So that's this part
of the function.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.160
And then it jumps down.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.900
Now, this looks like
x to the third. x

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.910
to the third looks
something like this.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.990
So x to the third power
looks something like that.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.310
So let's see, negative 2 to
the third power is negative 8.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.700
So it looks something like that.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.470
That's what x to the
third looks like.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.656
So 2 to the third power is 8.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.480
So x to the third looks
something like that.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.930
This looks like x to the
third shifted over 4.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.410
So I'm guessing that this is
x minus 4 to the third power.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.200
But we can verify that.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.880
When x is equal to 4, 4
minus 4 to the third power,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.430
we do indeed get the value
of this expression being

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.690
equal to 0.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.820
When x is 6, 6 minus 4 is 2 to
the third power is indeed 8.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.710
When x is 2, 2 minus 4 is
negative 2 to the third power

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.410
is indeed negative 8.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.590
So this over this
interval, it is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.690
x minus 4 to the third power.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.210
So we could say so this part of
the function right over here,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:50.260
we could say is x minus 4
to the third power for 4x

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.050
being greater than 2, or we
could say 2 is less than x.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.926
And it's defined all the
way to x being equal to 6,

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.050
but not being greater than.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.610
So x is less than or equal to 6.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.960
So which of these choices
are what we just put in?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.000
So the square root of x plus 2--
well, that's not-- let's see.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.140
Square root of x
plus 2 for negative 2

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.760
is less than x is less
than or equal to 2.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.899
X minus 4 to the third
for 2 is less than x,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.420
which is less than
or equal to 6.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.791
So I would go with that one.
