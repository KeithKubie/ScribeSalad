Responsive design isn't just about flexible fluid designs, it's

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.730
also about adapting to different scenarios and environments, and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.930
our primary tool for doing that is Media Queries.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.580
Media Queries have their roots in the media type for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.280
style sheets, used to declare a style sheet that's

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.660
only applied to certain media types; like when printing.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.530
And in the at media section, in CSS, where

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.050
you can declare a subsection of the style sheet to

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.920
only be used for print or other media. For

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.090
example it's helpful to display the URL of hyperlinks

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.510
when printing, since you can't click on the links

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.360
on paper. So that's what this rule does, but

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.690
CSS3 Media Queries add a media query terms. This

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.470
let's us make condition rules in our style sheets

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.350
based on environmental factors, like the width of the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.130
window or the orientation of the device. This opens

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.550
up a huge opportunity for us to make

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.380
truly adaptive layouts. There are a number of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.330
different properties available inside these Media query expressions.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.600
Like the width and height of the current window,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.970
the width and height of the device, the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.340
device orientation, the device aspect ratio and window aspect

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.310
ratio. Weather the, the device is grid based,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580
how many bits per color the device uses or

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.300
weather it's an indexed color device, or weather it's monochrome, the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.260
overall resolution of the device, and

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.440
weather it's progressive or interlaced scanned.
