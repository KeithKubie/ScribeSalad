Hey, everybody! I'm Sara Bareilles,

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.796
and I'm here to talk to you about depression.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.424
It's something I have dealt with in my life. 

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:09.300
I know my family members have dealt with it.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.136
I know friends who have dealt with it. 

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.762
And I bet you do, too.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:19.561
It is a very complicated and confusing set of emotions and a disease,

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.565
and UCLA, my alma mater, is trying to do something about it. 

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:29.070
UCLA is launching the largest study on depression in the history of the world. 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.203
They are trying to help the over 300 million people who struggle with depression by getting information. 

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.498
So I'm here to ask you to get involved.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:47.005
If you are a student at UCLA, you will see information about this on campus, but you can also visit this website:

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:53.136
GrandChallenges.ucla.edu/depression

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:59.768
You share a little bit about your story, a little bit about your emotions, and you can potentially help the researchers

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:05.857
unlock this incredibly difficult thing to deal with.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:11.279
This is an effort to really understand each other by understanding ourselves.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:18.870
So get behind this incredible effort by UCLA and share this on social media. Share it with your friends, 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.669
get involved, and help this incredible study come to life that can really truly, truly change the world.

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.129
Thank you.
