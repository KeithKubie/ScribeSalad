The Meme Me app let's you create
a meme with an image and some text.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.689
Everyone loves a good meme and it's
a good way to get a laugh from friends.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.980
This is the meme editor.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.820
It let's you select a picture and
edit the text at the top and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.230
bottom of the picture.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.379
The picture can be selected from
the device's photo album, or

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.430
the user can bring up the camera.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.790
Whether we're using the camera or

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.210
the album, you'll use Apple's UI image
picker controller to select your image.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.760
I like this one of
Jason with James Bond.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.870
Here, text is entered into a text field.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.439
Notice how the view slides up so

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.640
that the keyboard doesn't
obscure the bottom text field.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.520
When the editing is complete, we show
the text with an outlined white font.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.170
It's slightly different from the true
meme font, but it's pretty close, and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.530
available among iOS stock fonts.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.800
Now our meme is ready to go,
so let's share it.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.314
Here's our old friend,
the activity view controller, and

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:53.888
I'm going to send this to Kunal.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.590
The app will keep track of
all of the memes you've sent.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.510
You can see the memes in a table view or
a grid.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.550
We can switch back and
forth using these tabs.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.220
Both of these views access
the same meme model objects.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.680
The grid is created using
a UI Collection View Controller.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.920
It's similar to
a UI Table View Controller, but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.540
has a more flexible layout mechanism.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.170
And, from the set memes page,
we can go back and create new memes.
