00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, DC.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:15.060
[ Silence ]

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.200 position:69%
This is the first even online conference for
the Library of Congress and for educators.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.820
We have a fabulous program
lined up for you right now.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.010 position:61%
During this session, you'll learn how
to use free online assessments designed

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.780
by the Stanford History Education
Group that incorporate documents

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.460 position:63%
from the Library of Congress's archives.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.440 position:63%
Participants will examine assessments,
rubrics, and sample students' responses.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.760
Leading us through this session
is Joel Breakstone.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.960 position:64%
Joel co-directs the Teaching With Primary
Sources Program at Stanford University.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.720
And directs the Stanford
History Education Group.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.500
Along with Mark Smith and Sam
Wineberg, he led the development

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.840 position:59%
of Stanford History Education Group's
assessment website, Beyond the Bubble.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.510
He received his PhD from Stanford
Graduate School of Education.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.650 position:59%
And before coming to Stanford, he
taught high school history in Vermont.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.060 position:64%
So I'm going to turn things over to Joel.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Kathy.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.330 position:58%
I really appreciate the introduction.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.160
I'm really pleased to be
with all of you this evening.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.730
And I want to also just reiterate
my thanks to the Library

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.650 position:67%
of Congress for organizing this conference.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.530
It's a really excellent opportunity
for teachers,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.690
and we're really excited to
be able to participate in it.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.190 position:61%
My colleague, Sam Wineberg, just
finished up a session that perhaps some

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.610 position:72%
of you had a chance to hear him speak as well.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.190 position:64%
Over the course of the next 40 minutes
or so, I hope to give you an introduction

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.830 position:72%
to the materials that we've created and have
posted online on beyondthebubble.stanford.edu.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.990 position:75%
And to not only provide introduction to the
materials, but also to provide a bit of a window

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.960 position:66%
into the process by which we designed
them and what we hope they are useful for.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.980 position:73%
But before I get to that, I want to just say a
little bit about how I ended up doing this work

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.910
and being at the Stanford
History Education Group.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.190 position:61%
I was a -- as Kathy mentioned -- a
high school history teacher in Vermont.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.280
But I came to that position after
being a history major in college.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.670
And I graduated from college
and I didn't have a job.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.450 position:69%
And I ended up getting offered a position in
Vermont, even though I had only spent a day

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.370
in Vermont before getting the job.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.440
I moved there from Boston
-- I had grown up in Boston.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.970 position:61%
And I took over for a gentleman who had
been teaching for a number of years.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.330 position:64%
And the main things that I inherited were
a classroom set of the American Pageant.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.010 position:67%
And I knew that although the textbook would
be a great starting place for my students,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.640 position:64%
it wasn't the only thing that I wanted my
students to read in their history class.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.380 position:70%
And so I wanted them to read primary sources.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.430 position:61%
That is what I read as a history major.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.760 position:58%
And so I gave my students a document.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.460 position:66%
One of the first ones I gave them was this
great speech by William Lloyd Garrison

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:20.390 position:72%
in which he describes the hypocrisy of
celebrating the fourth of July in independence

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.950 position:63%
when there are thousands and thousands
of people enslaved in the United States.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.230 position:64%
And I found quickly that giving a
student a document that is 850 words long

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.810
and in 12-point font at 7:37
in the morning is a bad idea.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.070 position:58%
And it was that terrible feeling that
I had too often as a young teacher

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.040 position:67%
where the lesson's going poorly and you're
trying to figure out how you can salvage it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.150 position:75%
so that it goes a little better when you have to
teach it three more times the rest of the day.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.740 position:64%
And so I figured out some things over the
course of my time teaching in Vermont.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.400 position:58%
But I also had a lot of questions
about how I could do the work better.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.740
And how you could provide
more materials for teachers.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.530 position:66%
Because it's simply unreasonable to expect
that each teacher is going to be able

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.560 position:58%
to create a variety of document-based
materials on their own.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.430 position:69%
It's an incredibly time-consuming process to
track down materials and to build lessons.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.760 position:66%
Certainly you can do some, but it's really
difficult to create an entire curriculum.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.140 position:69%
And so that's what led me ultimately to pack
up my life's belongings into a Penske truck

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:29.250 position:69%
and drive across I-80 to California, where I
began a doctoral program at Stanford working

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.270 position:61%
with folks who had similar interests at
the Stanford History Education Group.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.290
Around, how do you create
materials that are available

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.480 position:63%
for teachers to use with their students?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.670 position:59%
And make them in an accessible fashion
so that you don't have the looks

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.580
that my students gave me
that first morning at 7:37

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.430 position:70%
where they simply had no interest in reading.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.920
And in many cases the materials
were simply inaccessible for them.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.930
And when I arrived at Stanford,
we had just released the Reading

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.130
Like a Historian curriculum online.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.470
And we had a lot of interest in it.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.550
There was a lot of excitement
about the materials.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.180
But there was also simultaneously
a lot of talk about assessment.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.500
And it came from the highest
levels of government.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.820 position:59%
Barack Obama, in March of 2009 said,
"I'm calling on our nation's governors

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.660
and state education chiefs to
develop standards and assessments

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.910 position:63%
that don't simply measure whether
students can fill in a bubble on a test,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.720 position:69%
but whether they possess 21st Century skills
like problem solving and critical thinking."

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.420
And we agreed.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.070
We said, yes, absolutely.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.120 position:75%
We would love to see those types of assessments.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.710
But where are they?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.600
That's an excellent goal,
but if you're a teacher,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.060 position:66%
where do you get those types of materials?

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.890
And simultaneously we were
releasing, as I mentioned,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.450 position:63%
the Reading Like a Historian curriculum.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.480
This is our old website.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.500
And when we first released the
curriculum, we got a lot of emails

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.130 position:66%
from folks who began to use the materials.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.360 position:56%
And the most common query was, where
are the World History materials?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.270
Which was a fair critique.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.020
We've since adjusted and have begun
to make World History materials.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.750
But the second most common
response that we heard

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.690 position:67%
from people was, where are the assessments?

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.750
If you guys are going to make
all these materials based

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.660 position:70%
around teaching historical inquiry and having
students engage in disciplinary reading

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.580
and thinking, how do I know whether
or not my students can do it?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.890
How do I know whether or not they
can consider source information?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.250
Where did the document come from?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.750 position:70%
What was the context in which it was created?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.600 position:66%
How does the context in which it was
created shape the content of the document?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.820 position:73%
These historical things need scales of
sourcing, contextualization, and corroboration.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.590
Which our curriculum was based on.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.100 position:56%
And then at the same time the
Common Core standards were released.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.860 position:67%
And they called for students to do things
like analyze primary and secondary sources.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.260
Consider authors' perspectives.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.620
Corroborate sources.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.120 position:64%
And develop written historical arguments.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.070
And we said, you know, these
are some interesting skills.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.420 position:59%
But how are we going to assess whether
or not our students can do that?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.550 position:70%
These various fairly complex ways of thinking
and reading, where are the assessments

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.190 position:63%
that would help students to engage in --
to give teachers feedback about whether

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.810
or not their students can engage in
these ways of thinking and reading.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.600 position:56%
And so we continue to ask the
question, where are the assessments?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.510
But we didn't have a good
answer for where to find them.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.450
And when you look around, you
can find an enormous number

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.760 position:64%
of materials that talk about assessments.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.170 position:75%
And particularly issues of formative assessment.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.660
How do you create short tasks?

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.970
If you go on Amazon you can find
hundreds and hundreds of resources

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.960 position:69%
that you can buy about formative assessment.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.300 position:72%
But there are not many for history teachers,
for guidance for how do you create short tasks

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.660 position:75%
that give us quick feedback that we can use to
quite literally form our next steps in teaching.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.130
There wasn't much guidance.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:05.680 position:66%
And moreover, there weren't many resources
in the world of formative assessment.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.090
So we weren't sure what these types
of assessments could look like.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.330 position:56%
But we knew where we could find the
materials to make those assessments.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.490 position:69%
We had just joined the Library of Congress's
Teaching With Primary Sources Consortium.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.380 position:61%
And as a result, we suddenly had
access to the world's greatest library.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.140
And all the resources that
the Library's archives offer.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.830
And so we knew we wanted to
construct some short tasks

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.830 position:73%
that would provide teachers meaningful feedback
about these ways of historical reading.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.790
But we still weren't sure
exactly what form they would take.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.730
And so we wanted to be clear
first about what are the resources

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.190
that are immediately available
to history teachers?

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.210
And we see them as existing
on a continuum of complexity.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.160
At one end of this spectrum
are multiple choice questions,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.110 position:67%
which are quite familiar to us as teachers.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.050 position:66%
But also as citizens of the United States.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.190 position:61%
The United States likes multiple
choice questions more than most places.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.620 position:58%
In the U.K. They call multiple
choice questions "the American form."

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.180 position:67%
So not everywhere has the same
fascination with multiple choice questions.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.610 position:64%
And so before we -- we knew that
multiple choice questions were available,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.650 position:66%
but we wanted to also be very clear about,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.320 position:58%
what is it that a multiple choice
question requires our students to do?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.270
And it was an important first
step in the design process.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.840 position:72%
We wanted to be very explicit about the skills
and knowledge that are required for students

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.560 position:58%
to answer a multiple choice question.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.890
And so here's an example drawn
from the California State Test

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.600
for tenth graders, World History.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.560 position:75%
And what I'd like you to do is to take a moment,
read the question, and just think about all

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.030
of the things that a student would
need to know and be able to do

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.850
in order to answer this question.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.140
So when we give a student
this multiple choice question,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.980 position:61%
what is it that we're really assessing?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:01.130 position:75%
And so as you think about that, take a moment
and just type in the chat box some of the skills

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.300
that are required in order
to answer this question.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.960 position:59%
We'll take a minute or two to do that.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.800
And then we'll go on as people
begin to fill in some of the things

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.470
that are required in order
to answer the question.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.450 position:59%
Think of sort of the most basic thing.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.560 position:67%
What's the first thing students need to do?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.510
And then what are some of the
knowledge that they need to know?

00:10:16.510 --> 00:11:14.830
[ Silence ]

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.630
Great. So looking through this
list, you know, I see a lot of --

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.990
there are a lot of things that are
required in order to answer this.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.520 position:59%
You know, one of the very basic things
is it requires reading comprehension.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.430
Students need to be able to
read and decode the question.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.190
So somebody wrote down academic
vocabulary, right?

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.440 position:64%
Students need to know what an outcome is.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.820
And then beyond that, there are
some crucial vocabulary words.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.690
Like "colonial possessions."

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.190 position:58%
You need to know what a Communist is.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.560
"Dominant military powers."

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.850
"International superpowers."

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.350 position:67%
So there's some just reading comprehension.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.900 position:59%
There's also content knowledge, right?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.910 position:58%
Issues of, how does World War II end?

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:01.080 position:59%
Right? Students need to know something
in order to answer the question.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.480
And also how to read a test, right?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.570 position:72%
That there's also a basic move of test taking.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.510
Of eliminating, somebody said,
the wrong answers, right?

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.820
It's that, you know, by the
time a student's in tenth grade,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.410
they've taken a lot of multiple
choice questions.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.530
They have a pretty good idea
of how to answer the question.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.150
And so that's about doing
a process of elimination.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.180 position:72%
And so, you know, when we think about multiple
choice questions, we see them as providing,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.350
you know, immediate feedback
about students' reasoning.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.240
But it's not necessarily the
way to measure all of the things

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.880
that we want our students
to know and be able to do.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.630 position:61%
Because it's also measuring some things
that are not particularly historical.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.520
Like process of elimination.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.990
That's not a move of a historian.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.380
That's a test-taking move.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:55.740 position:73%
Similarly, it doesn't give us a lot of feedback
about students' more complex ways of thinking.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.040 position:69%
But it's quick and we can do it fairly
efficiently and get some immediate feedback.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.890
But it may not be the best tool
for measuring all of the things

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.330
that we want our students
to know and be able to do.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.420 position:63%
At the other end of the spectrum are
DBQ's -- a much more complex, rich task.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:18.570 position:69%
One that has gained increasing popularity
as the Advanced Placement program has grown.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.850
And the State of New York has
used them in their Regents Exams.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:27.540
And other groups have provided
materials around DBQ's.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.220 position:72%
And it's a much richer task, one that requires
students to engage in a variety of skills.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.440 position:59%
And again, what we did before we moved
on to develop the assessments was,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.190 position:75%
we wanted to be really clear about, what do some

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.240
of these most common types of
tasks require students to do?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.260 position:56%
So here's an example; this is pulled
from the 2010 AP U.S. History exam.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.900 position:72%
And it was, "In what ways did ideas and values
held by Puritans influence the political,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.250 position:73%
economic, and social development of the New
England colonies from 1630 through the 1660's?"

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.090
Students then receive a series
of primary sources.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.060 position:64%
In this case they received ten documents.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:10.350 position:66%
They have then an hour to read through the
documents and formulate an analytic essay,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.030
and to compose that analytic essay.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:17.110 position:63%
And so again, I'd like us to take a
moment and do the same thing that we did

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.850 position:67%
when we were initially surveying the field.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.480 position:69%
And take a moment and list in the chat box,
what are the things that students have to do

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.070 position:72%
from start to finish in order to answer a DBQ?

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.710
So that we can have some clarity
about, what are the skills

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.510
that we're really assessing
with this type of question?

00:14:29.510 --> 00:15:33.520
[ Silence ]

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.970
Yes, as this chat box indicates,
it's a lot of things, right?

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.090
I think that's indicative of
the complexity of the task.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:49.230 position:67%
Students have to, at a basic level, be able
to have some strong reading comprehension.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.500 position:58%
They need to first unpack this slide.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.590
This is not a small thing.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.450 position:73%
You know, you need to understand this question.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:06.010 position:70%
What are the different pieces of the question
that need to be addressed in a response?

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.710 position:75%
And then they need to engage with the documents.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.620 position:72%
And as people's comments have noted, there are
a variety of things the students have to do.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.290
They have to skim, they have
to look for context clues.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.060 position:59%
They need to look for evidence, right?

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.600 position:64%
They need to figure out what is the
argument that they're going to be making,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.800 position:59%
and then seek it out in the documents.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.530 position:59%
And as several people noted, it's
also about a process of multi-tasking.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.920 position:61%
You need to be reading at the same time
as thinking how the documents connect

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.070
to the broader argument that
they're seeking to make.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.030
And then they need to read a map.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.530 position:63%
They need to understand archaic English.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.040 position:70%
So they're -- and the ultimately, after
they've done all this reading, and analyzing,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.450
and organizing, they need to write.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.690
And write pretty furiously.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.710 position:72%
In the process, hope their wrist doesn't cramp
up, they can mop some sweat off their brow,

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.320 position:58%
and maybe do a quick proofread
before they're done in about an hour,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.910 position:73%
within the framework of the traditional AP DBQ.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.480
It's a rich task.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.650 position:70%
And it is testing the types of things we want
our students ultimately to be able to do.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:21.760 position:64%
To analyze a series of primary documents,
and to write an analytic argument.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.680
That's what we want our students
to be able to do.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.260
However, it may be a little too
challenging for some students.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.910
And moreover, its complexity
can make it a little difficult

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.490 position:67%
to discern what a student is doing well at,

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.480
and the things that students
might be struggling with.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.680 position:59%
If a student doesn't do well on a DBQ,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.970
is it because that they don't
have the reading ability?

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.710 position:70%
Or is it perhaps because they struggle to
orchestrate these various skills all at once?

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.100 position:75%
Or perhaps they don't do well with a timed task?

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.550 position:73%
So as a result, if I'm a teacher and I receive
the DBQ back, it can be a little more difficult

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:05.740
to figure out, what are my next
steps to help my student do better?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.170 position:66%
In addition, though, is the issue of time.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.550
If I'm a teacher and I assign
a DBQ, I then have to do what?

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.740
I have to grade it.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.170
And that's really time consuming.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:24.160 position:73%
And unless you want to spend all of your waking
hours reading student writing, it's not --

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.940 position:70%
it's simply unrealistic to expect that we can
use DBQ's for frequent classroom assessment.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.200
They're a great task, but
they're not ideally suited

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.030 position:73%
for quick feedback about student understanding.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:42.150 position:61%
And so as we thought about the spectrum
of assessments that were available

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.900 position:56%
to history/social studies
teachers, we were struck by this gap

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.820 position:59%
between the more basic multiple choice
questions and the complex DBQ's.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.050 position:67%
And we hope to be able to provide something

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.540
that could inhabit this middle
ground between the two.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:03.640 position:64%
And so in a world of acronyms, we decided
to make our own to fill the middle space,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.700
what we call "history assessments
of thinkings, or HATs."

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.400 position:63%
And so rather than talk a lot about
what HATs are, I'd like to show you one.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.030 position:56%
To give you an example of one of the
tasks that we created in an effort

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.680 position:66%
to create short document-based assessments

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.190
that give us some quick feedback
about specific skills.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.350 position:58%
This is an assessment that we created

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.450 position:59%
to target very specifically the
historical thinking skill of sourcing.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.910
That is, can students pay attention
to where a document came from?

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.570
Who made it?

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.770
When? Why?

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.950
And for what purpose?

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.280
And specifically with this task, we
were really interested in whether

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.280
or not students will notice
the date of the document.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.560 position:69%
So this assessment gives students this image
from the Library of Congress's archives.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.290
The title of the document is,
"First Thanksgiving, 1921."

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.730
The document is from 1932, made
by a guy named J.L.G. Ferris.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.950 position:64%
And the question is, "This painting helps
historians understand the relationship

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.470
between the Wampanoag and
the Pilgrim settlers in 1621.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.550
Do you agree or disagree?

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.100
Briefly support your answer."

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.530
What I'd like you to do is take a
minute or two and just think about,

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.330
what do you think a common
student mistake would be?

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.320 position:64%
Not what do you think the idea answer is?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.270 position:72%
But rather, what do you think a common mistake
would be if you were to give this to students?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.510 position:73%
What might they answer that might trip them up?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.690 position:59%
So think about that and then jot down,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.870 position:58%
what do you think some common student
mistakes with this task would be?

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.510 position:61%
And write those in the comment section.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:21:26.920
[ Silence ]

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.710 position:61%
So people have really hit on the issues
of what the most common mistakes are.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.420
Without a doubt.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.180
And we piloted this task now
with thousands of students.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.910
And the types of mistakes that
you are identifying are spot on.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.230
And so I'd like to show you
a few of the responses.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.760
This response is by far the
most common one that we see.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.410
The student wrote, "True."

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.150 position:63%
True as in, it would be a useful source.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.720
"Because you can see how they're
interacting with each other.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.960
Without any picture, you couldn't
really see how Wampanoag Indians

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.640 position:70%
and the Puritans interacted with each other."

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.890
So this student is essentially
saying, yes, it's a great source.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.030
Of course it would be useful.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.090 position:70%
If you didn't show me this picture, how could
I know anything about the First Thanksgiving?

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.180 position:75%
Essentially, a picture's worth a thousand words.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:25.570
Which is, as several people noted
in the comments, it seems like more

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.680
than anything the student is
matching the image of Thanksgiving

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.310 position:63%
to their own beliefs about Thanksgiving.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:38.160 position:70%
This matches what I think Thanksgiving looked
like, and as a result it's a useful source.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.270
The second most common type of
response looked more like this one.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.450
The student in this case disagreed.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.880
And they said that it would not
be a useful source for historians.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.510 position:66%
The student wrote, "As soon as the
settlers arrived, there was mass curiosity

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.600 position:59%
which turned into violence and hatred.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.460
There was never such a "party"
between the two peoples.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.100 position:66%
They couldn't even understand each other."

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.740
And so at first, you know, the
student said something good, right?

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.740 position:61%
They're trying to bring some background
knowledge to bear on the source.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.410 position:58%
And they're trying to have a
critical examination of the document.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.630 position:56%
But there are also some errors here.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.830
You know, the students say
that there never such a party.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.440 position:67%
But we have documentary evidence that there
was a meal held between the two groups.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.600 position:66%
We can certainly argue about the nature of
the meal, but there's certainly evidence

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.840 position:64%
that the two groups understood each other
and even could understand each other

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.050
with Squanto having some exposure
to English and being able to speak.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:47.800
But regardless, the bigger
issue is that in both the cases,

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.700
the students have totally
ignored the date of the document.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.900 position:63%
And have not addressed the problems that
are associated with using a document

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:04.090 position:69%
that was created 311 years after the event,
as a source of information about that event.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:10.490 position:67%
And to acknowledge the problems that result
from such a gap in time between the date

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:15.140
of production and the event
that it seeks to depict.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.660 position:75%
And so as a teacher, from those quick
responses I get immediate feedback about whether

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.390 position:67%
or not my students can attend to one aspect
of historical thinking, which is sourcing.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.750 position:70%
At this point, though, some people say great,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:35.040
why don't you just make this
into a multiple choice question?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.090
And get rid of all this writing?

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.010 position:56%
It's a lot easier to score
multiple choice questions than it is

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.240 position:64%
to have even short constructed responses.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.360
But what we think is that
there is an enormous amount

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.480 position:73%
that we can learn from short student responses.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.430 position:67%
So for instance, this student disagreed and
said that it would not be a good source.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.330 position:63%
So if it was a multiple choice question,
this student would have gotten it right

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.400
because they're saying no,
it's not a useful source.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.830
But their reasoning is interesting.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.710
The student wrote, "Painted
by a white person from Europe,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.050 position:73%
of course they will be extremely biased in
order to bring to light a highly positive image

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.700
of the Europeans as to excite
more foreign expeditions.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:17.350
Because the Indians look
sooo friendly and thankful."

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:23.390
So, although they might have
gotten it right in terms of arguing

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:28.260 position:69%
that the document would not be a useful one,
their reasoning is clearly pretty suspect.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.810 position:59%
First, they assume that J.L.G. Ferris
must be white and must be from Europe.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.720
But moreover, they seem to
have ignored the date as well.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.080 position:56%
Because they seem to think that in
1932 the Europeans were still trying

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.260
to excite more foreign expeditions
to the new world.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.930
Deeply problematic.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.430
But as a teacher, there's something
good going on here as well.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:58.170 position:69%
The student is acknowledging that the author
of a document -- the artist in this case --

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.500 position:61%
influences the content of the document.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.730
That's what we want students to do.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:08.410 position:69%
We want them to think about the way in which
the author carefully shapes the content

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.410
of a document.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:16.100 position:75%
So if this is my student, I can say, "I'm really
glad that you're paying attention to the way

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.070 position:69%
in which the author influences the document.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:22.140 position:56%
But we also really need to pay
attention to the date of a document.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.510 position:61%
And that's going to be a crucial piece
of information to think about as well."

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.870
We also in some cases see
really polished responses.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.110 position:58%
This student wrote -- and it was an
eighth grader, as a matter of fact --

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.220 position:59%
wrote, "This painting was drawn 311
years after the actual event happened.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.580 position:67%
There's no evidence of historical accuracy,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.030
as we do not know if the artist
did research before painting this,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:49.590 position:67%
or if he just drew what is a
stereotypical Pilgrim and Indian painting."

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.430 position:61%
Really impressive for an eighth grader.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:57.320 position:73%
I did not have a lot of tenth graders when I
was teaching who could formulate this response.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.330 position:75%
And the student has nicer handwriting than I do.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:07.510 position:70%
But what is striking is, the student has both
identified the danger of using a document

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.930 position:72%
so far removed from the event that it depicts.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.280 position:70%
But they've also acknowledged that if we knew
more about what the artist did in advance

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.960 position:59%
of creating the document, it might
change the way that we think about it.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.470 position:56%
The document -- this answer also
shows something that we've seen over

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.890 position:56%
and over again with these responses.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:36.070 position:67%
Which is, there isn't a clear developmental
trajectory in terms of student thinking.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.880
In other words, it's not as
though seniors can engage,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.260
only high school seniors can
engage in this type of thinking.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.710 position:69%
In fact, as this eighth grader demonstrates,

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.960
many students can engage
in this type of thinking.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.870 position:72%
Perhaps not surprisingly, what we found is
it's the students who've been taught to engage

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.680
in historical thinking who do it.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.250 position:75%
And it's the students who have not who struggle.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:03.140 position:64%
So for instance, we've given this task to
high school seniors who have gotten fives

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.940 position:70%
on the AP U.S. History exam, and they've
missed the date of the Thanksgiving painting.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.780
And I don't mean that in any way
as a knock against those students.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.110 position:66%
I'm very confident that with a few minutes

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.460
of instruction they would see
the importance of the date.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.690 position:58%
They just haven't been taught to look
carefully at the dates of documents.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:26.740 position:59%
That, especially in the past, has not
been heavily emphasized in AP testing.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:32.830 position:66%
In contrast, we've seen fifth graders who
have come up with really strong responses.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.470 position:69%
Not quite as polished, and the
handwriting's not quite as good as this one.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.590
But we've seen fifth graders
do it because they've been

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.130 position:70%
in classrooms where this has been emphasized.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.910
However, none of these tasks are
based on only a single document.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:52.550
Instead, they are -- we intend
them to be flexible

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.480 position:72%
so that we can make multiple versions of them.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.070
This is the exact same assessment.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.280
But instead of a Thanksgiving
painting, we have an engraving

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.470 position:63%
of the signing of the Mayflower Compact.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.130
And again, there's a big
gap in time between the date

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.450 position:72%
of the document and the event that it depicts.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.760
And so if I'm a teacher I could
use the Thanksgiving assessment

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.530 position:56%
at the beginning of the school year.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.370
And then give it back to students
and give them some feedback

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.750 position:59%
about what strong responses look like.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.340 position:69%
And then I could give them another one a few
weeks later, like this one, to see whether

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.060
or not they've really internalized
those ideas and they have been able

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:35.480 position:66%
to track the crucial nature of considering
the source when evaluating documents.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:41.910
So when we think about HATs,
we have made them to be short,

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.240
so that they can be done
quickly in five or ten minutes.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.020 position:69%
And they target specific content and skills.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.740 position:72%
So in this case it's very much about sourcing,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.720
and one aspect of sourcing,
the date of the document.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.450
So that we can get quick feedback
about students' ability with them.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.520
Similarly, it gives evidence
of student thinking.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.890 position:75%
So as teachers we get some immediate information
that we can use to shape our next steps

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.810 position:61%
and it doesn't take us hours to get it.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.240 position:72%
We can quickly even flip through, even if we
don't give students detailed written feedback,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.930 position:67%
we can get a temperature for our classroom.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.450 position:69%
Which will shape our next steps as teachers.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.690 position:70%
And hopefully they're more accessible, right?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.980
That if some of our students are
not yet ready for the really great,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.900 position:70%
rich challenged of a document-based question,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.190 position:69%
that we can have them complete these shorter
tasks in the building block towards some

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.420 position:67%
of those more complex types of assessments.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.340 position:59%
Often at this point after looking at
that assessment, some people will say,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.620 position:63%
so do you guys just care about skills
and you don't care about content at all?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.620 position:69%
And they couldn't be further from the truth.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:53.810 position:69%
When we constructed our domain of what we
were seeking to assess, historical thinking,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.850 position:67%
we place historical knowledge as one of the
three main pillars of historical thinking.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:03.080 position:59%
Students need to know content in order
to engage with historical documents.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.560 position:63%
And then there's evaluation of evidence.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.630
Students need to consider the
source and place it in context.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.120
And corroborate it, to consider
multiple documents,

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.100
and to look for points of
similarity and difference.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.880 position:63%
In order to build a historical argument.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.140 position:67%
And so other assessments that we've created
address historical content very directly.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:26.030 position:69%
This is an assessment that's about students'
knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.370 position:63%
And it would be an assessment you'd give

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.050
after you had taught students
about the Civil Rights Movement.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:35.550
And it draws on two letters
from the archives of the NAACP.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.040
And the first letter, both written
to the executive director of NAACP.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.890 position:72%
The first letter says, "Before I received your
letter today, I had been in to the President.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.590
And he said the difficulty is that
it is unconstitutional, apparently,

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.860
for the federal government to
step into the lynching situation.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.960 position:59%
The President feels that lynching is
a question of education in the states.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.640 position:70%
I'm deeply troubled about the whole
situation, as it seems to be a terrible thing

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.320
to stand by and let it continue."

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.060 position:58%
Students then read a second document,
also from the NAACP about conditions

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.260
at a previously all-white school.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.460 position:69%
The letter reads, "Conditions are yet
pretty rough in the school for the children.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.270 position:70%
The treatment of the children had been
getting steadily worse for the last two weeks

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.720
in the form of kicking, spitting,
and general abuse.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.650 position:67%
As a result of our visit, stronger measures
are being taken against the white students

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.300 position:69%
who are guilty of committing these offenses.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:27.030 position:59%
The President of the United States was
very much concerned about the crisis."

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:33.970 position:66%
And instead of asking students a question
like, what was the year of Brown v. Board?

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.750
Or when did lynching reach
its peak in the United States?

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.850
We asked a very basic question,
which is, which letter came first?

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.480
We didn't give them the dates
of the documents in this case.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.300 position:70%
Instead we wanted them to use their knowledge
of the Civil Rights Movement in order

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.730 position:56%
to place these documents in context.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:50.740
Which one came first?

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:57.740 position:70%
And what from the document provided them the
necessary information to answer the question?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:05.580 position:73%
So if students don't know about the Civil
Rights Movement, they might answer it this way.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.850
Student wrote, "Letter B
was likely written first,

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.840
because letter B is addressing
the unsegregation of schools,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.890
and letter A is about the
response to the issue -- lynching."

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.330 position:59%
And there's a certain cause-and-effect
logic going on here.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.720 position:66%
But it's simply historically incorrect
that following the integration of schools,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.190 position:70%
although there's some violence, there is not
widespread lynching that happens as a result.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:31.110 position:67%
The student does not have a grasp of the
Civil Rights Movement and the way in which,

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.780 position:73%
over the course of the 20th Century, the
federal government became increasingly involved

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.070 position:70%
in acting on the behalf of African-Americans.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.530 position:70%
And intervening in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:46.720 position:70%
Moreover, that the lynching was much more a
problem in the first part of the 20th Century

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.480 position:63%
when it reached a sort of critical mass.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.990
In contrast, the integration
of schools happened later.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.540
And so as a teacher we can
get some quick feedback about,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.040 position:61%
do my students have the broad
narrative of the Civil Rights Movement?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.520 position:58%
Do they understand the broad
contours of the Movement rather than,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.760 position:67%
do they know about specific names or dates?

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.130
Although those are important,
this is a different type of task

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.950 position:58%
that assesses their broader
knowledge of the movement as a whole.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:19.370 position:56%
As with the Thanksgiving assessment,
we can make parallels that focus

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.680
on other important moments
and events in history.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.660
This one is about immigration.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:31.400 position:70%
And so this shows an excerpt from a newspaper
article that says, "It's my firm belief

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.910 position:64%
that an exclusion act even more stringent
than the present one should be passed

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.360 position:63%
in the matter of the Japanese immigrant.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.610
The Chinese are dangerous enough,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.150
but the Japanese would drive
all competition out of business.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.100 position:56%
It is the stern duty of the American
citizen, particularly of those

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.790
of us upon this western coast,
to scrutinize this even

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:49.250
and then suppress it with
appropriate legislation."

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:54.690 position:73%
And the second document says, "There had been
4700 emigrants landed on the previous Thursday,

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.920 position:61%
and we learned on Monday that 10, 035
had arrived on the Saturday and Sunday,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.860 position:72%
principally Germans, each possessed of a small
capital, and all ready to proceed instantly

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.270
to the various German settlements
in the interior without staying

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.650
to waste their means in New York.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.220
The Custom-house officer's
duty was a mere form."

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.970 position:69%
So again, the students have an understanding
of when did exclusion acts take place.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:23.900 position:72%
And in what place and time did different waves
of immigration occur in the United States.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:30.070 position:59%
All of these assessments are available
on beyondthebubble.stanford.edu.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:35.690 position:56%
And there is a very short video that
you can watch right now at this link

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:40.890 position:66%
that gives you a little taste of why we've
constructed materials the way we have.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:46.060 position:64%
And then after you watch that, we'll take
a very quick tour through the website.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.300 position:58%
And then we will take some questions.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.520
&gt;&gt; Imagine if real-life decisions
were like a multiple choice exam.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.960 position:61%
&gt;&gt; First question, "To surprise the
British troops in Trenton, should I A),

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:04.480 position:58%
dress my troops up as a marching band
and offer to play a free concert?

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.100 position:69%
B), Hide my troops in a giant horse and
present it as a victory gift to the British?

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.890 position:75%
C), Cross the icy Delaware in a rickety rowboat?

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:18.740 position:70%
D) Stay in my tent because it's cold
outside, and let someone else deal with them?

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.810
&gt;&gt; Seems ridiculous, right?

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.340
Essentially, that's what
multiple choice tests do.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.590 position:58%
They penalize kids for not knowing
facts that are ripped out of context.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.500 position:67%
On the opposite end of the spectrum are
document-based questions requiring students

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.230 position:56%
to analyze and write a college-level
essay based on ten documents.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:41.360 position:64%
But what if your students haven't learned
to analyze one document, let alone ten?

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.040 position:72%
As an educator, do you have any other options?

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.970
Now you do.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:50.530 position:58%
Beyond the Bubble was developed by
the Stanford History Education Group.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.930
And unlocks the vast digital
archive of the Library of Congress

00:36:53.930 --> 00:37:05.220
to create a new generation
of history assessments.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:23.350
Our easy to use assessments capture
students' knowledge in action.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:30.970 position:73%
Rather than their recall of disconnected facts.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:34.150
We call our exercises History
Assessments of Thinking, or HATs.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.620
HATs ask students to engage
in historical reasoning

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.790 position:67%
as they critically examine primary sources.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.080 position:72%
Most HATs take just a few minutes to complete.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.680
And they're easy to score.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.230 position:75%
They also come with interactive scoring rubrics,
samples of student work, and Going Deeper videos

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.580
that extend your understanding
of these assessments.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.470 position:59%
Your students' short written responses
to these HATs will give you access

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.220
to what they are really thinking.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.180 position:66%
Of course, there's always the alternative.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.800
&gt;&gt; Are you sure we weren't supposed
to dress up as a marching band?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.910 position:69%
&gt;&gt; No, I picked A last time; it has to be C.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.720 position:59%
&gt;&gt; I'd have preferred D; I'm freezing.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.680 position:59%
I think I got some ice in my knickers.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.190
&gt;&gt; Everyone be quiet.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.510
I picked C, and that's the answer.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:59.390
[ Water noises ]

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:04.060
&gt;&gt; So all the materials are on
beyondthebubble@stanford.edu.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.470
On the top of the home page,
it says Assessments.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.090 position:72%
That's where you'll find all of the materials.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.540
And so you'll see they are
organized by assessment type.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.660
So for instance, you'll see
the First Thanksgiving here.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.370
And then below that there are
the parallel versions of it.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.050 position:75%
So there's the signing of the Mayflower Compact.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.550 position:72%
There's a brief description of the assessment.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:31.240
There are words that are underlined
in red; if you hover your cursor

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.390
over that you'll get a brief
definition of what that word means.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:40.090
There's a link to the Common
Core standard that goes along

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.350
with those materials highlighted
for the History/Social Studies.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.160 position:72%
It certain addresses lots of ELA ones as well.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:54.170 position:61%
On the right-hand side of the page once
you go into a particular assessment,

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.400
you'll see that there is a link
to the PDF of the document.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.690 position:69%
So if you want to hand it out to students --

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.240 position:64%
I will note that you need to be logged
into the website in order to download it.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.710 position:75%
Logging into the website is completely free;
you just need to make an account on the website.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.840 position:72%
Or if you've already made an account on
sheg.stanford.edu, it will work there as well.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.510 position:73%
You can see everything without being logged in,

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.740
but we require people to log
in to download materials.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.250 position:73%
Just so we can track who's using the resources.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.240 position:61%
And then there's a link to the document
in the Library of Congress's archive.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.680 position:70%
So you can see the original document as well.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.060 position:72%
Then going on the right-hand side of the page,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:38.950
you'll see that there is a
rubric for each of the tasks.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.100 position:75%
And so the rubric is a basis three-level rubric.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.060 position:66%
Proficient: Student has gotten it dead on.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.350 position:58%
Emergent is, student's done something
good but it's not all the way there.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.260
And then Basic is, the student's
missed the boat;

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.640
they haven't really understood
the question just yet.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.740
And each of the rubric levels
is linked to student work.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:07.590 position:64%
And so all of the same student responses
that we showed before are on the website.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.210
And there are these little blue
thumb tacks on the answers.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.120
And if you roll over them, they're
just prefanatations [assumed]

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.970 position:73%
about what we see going on with the assessment.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:25.330 position:64%
And that is, an example of the responses
that we've chosen to include are examples

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.340 position:72%
of the common responses we've seen in piloting
these with hundreds and thousands of students.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.460 position:58%
So as a teacher it will give you some
really quick feedback about the kinds

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.870 position:58%
of responses you might expect to see.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:41.390 position:73%
You can also show it to students to demonstrate
what exemplary responses might look like.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.870 position:73%
and then finally, each type of assessment --
assessment types, so Thanksgiving for instance,

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.470
has a short streaming video
that goes with it that talks

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.580
about how you might use these
materials in your class

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.030
or how you might create your
own that you can watch.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.860 position:56%
And then finally, actually, there's
also a comment section so you can --

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.030 position:64%
if you have some thoughts about the task,

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:04.430 position:63%
or you'd like to see what other teachers
have said, you can go there as well.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.000 position:56%
But I also want to point out that
we certainly don't have any monopoly

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.050 position:63%
on the creation of assessment materials.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:15.610
And in fact we hope the teachers
will create their own materials.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.970
We see them as templates for
other people to create materials.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:25.950 position:72%
And the Library of Congress offers an
incredible set of resources in order to do so.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:32.160
And so some of our favorite Library
of Congress resources are available

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.480 position:64%
on the main page of the Library, loc.gov.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.390
A really great, really a wealth
of materials are available

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.020 position:63%
on the teachers' page, loc.gov/teachers.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.330
Great primary source sets.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.220
Blog quotes as to how you
might use these materials.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:52.270
The ability to search by standard
or by state, all available there.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:56.270 position:64%
So although loc.gov is incredible, it can
also sometimes feel a little overwhelming

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.110
because there's so much.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:01.430
And loc.gov/teachers has really
great curated sets of materials.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:06.870 position:70%
And then chroniclingamerica.loc.gov, I
think, is one of the coolest websites around.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:12.610 position:73%
And somebody who spent far too much time in the
basements of libraries going through microfilm,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:19.310 position:66%
the chroniclingamerica has thousands and
thousands of newspapers totally digitized.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.040
And you can search by keyword,
by date, by location.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.790
And you get the full pdf of
the pages of the newspapers,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.710
even after they've been fully
searchable by key word.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:37.350 position:70%
So if you want to know how the sinking of
the Titanic was covered in Missoula, Montana,

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:42.060 position:67%
you can go look for that and then compare
it to how it was covered in Washington, DC.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.190
It's a really fabulous resource.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:49.270 position:58%
And then also see all of the ads that
go alongside the newspaper stories.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:55.750 position:73%
And then finally, World Digital Library is an
incredible resource for world history teachers.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:43:01.210 position:61%
And it is a project that the Library of
Congress has undertaken in partnership

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.440 position:69%
with cultural institutions around the world.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.900
And it offers world history
materials and documents

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.450
from various museums and
libraries around the globe.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:14.570 position:66%
And you can search by time period, you
can search by geographic location as well.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.750 position:75%
And they continue to add materials all the time;

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.680
it's a really great resource
that continues to grow.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.300
And so finally I'll just
leave you with a few thoughts

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.000 position:75%
about how you might create your own assessments.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.100 position:64%
You know, the first thing we always do is
to choose what we're trying to measure.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.970
Then make a rough draft.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.180
And then take a moment and
do what we did when we looked

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.750 position:70%
at those multiple choice questions and DBQ's.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.570
What is this actually measuring?

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.780
Do the analysis before you
even give it to students.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.860
What are we actually measuring?

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.990
If I'm trying to make an assessment
about sourcing and my student has

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:50.610 position:66%
to write a long paragraph, then maybe it's
more assessment of writing than sourcing.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.650
And pilot it; try it out with
your students and see how it goes.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.110
And then revise it.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.420 position:63%
We've never made an assessment that
works perfectly the first time we do it;

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.210 position:64%
we need to adjust it after we've done it.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.960
And then tweak it as you go.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.030
And see how it works.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:07.360
And if you make something
great, please share it with us.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.330
We love to hear from teachers
who are using our materials.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.420 position:64%
And that's everything from, I'm wondering
how to get logged onto your website,

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.300
to I made this cool assessment;
what do you think?

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.020
Or, I'm trying to use these
materials in my classroom.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:25.350 position:69%
Please do reach out to us; we really do want
to be in touch with teachers and support you

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:31.210 position:73%
in any way we can as you're using our materials
or you're navigating the Library's archives.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.210 position:70%
And I would just point out the last two items

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.880
on this list are the SHEG's twitter
handle and the Facebook page.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.760
That we're adding new materials
all the time to our website.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.780
And we don't send out emails to
our email list when we do that.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:55.080
But we do post on twitter and
Facebook when new resources go up.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.690 position:69%
And then I would also just point out, as
Kathy put it in the chat section just now is

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.810 position:66%
that the Library also offers an incredible
set of professional development resources

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.890
on the teacher's page, and
she put the link there.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.370
So that's a great resource too.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.580
So thank you so much for
spending some time with me

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.590 position:75%
on a school night; I know that's not easy to do.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.950 position:64%
And I look forward to some questions now.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.070 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Oh, Joel, we have lots of questions.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.800
Thank you so much for the
wonderful presentation.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:31.070 position:63%
So I'm just going to dive right into
them so we can get in as many as we can.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.520
Jodi -- and I'm not sure I'm going
to pronounce her name correctly,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:41.180 position:72%
Montebiano [phonetic] asked the question, "How
do you correct errors in student thinking?"

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.740 position:66%
And then Chrissy Jacobs chimed in, "You
can't really correct a student's thinking.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.910 position:59%
You can help them construct
knowledge by giving them opportunities

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.620 position:58%
to notice inconsistencies, etcetera."

00:45:51.620 --> 00:46:00.090 position:75%
And then Amber, who was in the last session with
Sam, noted that that was basically her question.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.570
She's new to her district
and it's been a struggle.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:11.410 position:59%
So how can you address the errors when
looking at the students' thinking?

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.340
&gt;&gt; Really, really good questions.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:19.560 position:75%
You know, and I think our hope is that these
types of tasks provide opportunities to surface.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.910
What are some of the misconceptions
or errors in student thinking?

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.720 position:70%
So that we can address them as a whole class.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.630 position:59%
You know, we work with a teacher in
San Francisco Unified School District.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.730
And she gave the Thanksgiving
task on the first day of school.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:35.540
Because she knows that almost none
of her students will get it right.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.890
She doesn't even grade the task;
she just has everybody do it.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.800 position:63%
And she knows that probably 90% of the
students will say it's a great resource.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.810 position:66%
And then instead of even spending the time
to mark up all of them, she goes over,

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:48.730 position:63%
"What does a strong response look like?"

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:52.970
So that it's an opportunity to
build student understanding of,

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.590 position:66%
it's really important to look at the date.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.400 position:58%
And in this class we're going to
care about where documents came from.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.830
And so I think that's one way.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:05.130 position:66%
And then the other is, you know, of the
idea of formative assessment is to be able

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.470
to provide students with a goal
of what we're trying to do.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.310
Ultimately this is what we
want to be able to do in terms

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.210 position:70%
of our thinking, we want to source documents.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.170
And that the tasks are a way
for us to identify the gap

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:18.650 position:69%
between where we ultimately want our
students to be and where they currently are.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:22.020
And it's a way for students to
see where they currently are,

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.100 position:67%
and have a sense of where they can go next.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.330 position:63%
And so I think there are ways in which
we can do some with individual feedback.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.840 position:64%
But also given, you know, the constraints
of if you have 150 kids in your classes,

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.500 position:64%
you can't write even short responses on
all of these types of tasks all the time.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.620 position:72%
So figuring out other ways to provide
constructive, meaningful feedback that's based

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:42.490 position:72%
on sort of the overall place your class is in.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.900 position:63%
And then if there are a few students who
are, you know, way above or way below,

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.280 position:58%
that you can work with them
individually but have tried to figure

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.990
out how we can help move the
whole class forward in general.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.650
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:54.550
Thank you.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.880
Rita had sent a question, but I
think you've already answered it,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.360 position:58%
saying, "Where can we find the HATs?"

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.300 position:72%
And we provided the link to Beyond the Bubble.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.580
And you explained some of the
functionality of that site.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.640
So I thank you for that.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.580
Chas Chastain asks a question,
"Does the way the opening statement

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:17.750 position:66%
in the DBQ is worded influence students
to believe the document is more credible?"

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:23.050 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Yes, you know, I think we always are
trying to be really cognizant of the way

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.160
in which the wording of tasks
may influence students.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.320 position:73%
And we try certainly quite hard not to do that.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.030 position:58%
And one way that we do that is, we do
think-aloud interviews with students

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:40.520 position:61%
where we sit down and ask them to think
out loud as they complete our tasks.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.130
And sometimes we find that, you
know, the students read the tasks

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.190 position:69%
in a very different way than we intended it.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.450
And then we tweak it as a result.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.900
So, you know, our hope is
certainly that we don't want

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.790 position:75%
to be influencing students one way or the other.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.140
But it's an ongoing process.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:03.980 position:56%
So it's possible, but our hope is
they're not unduly being influenced.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.180
&gt;&gt; Okay, I have a question.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.980
I'm going to make it a two-fer.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.640 position:61%
But they come from two different folks.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.310 position:66%
Veronica Zermino asks, "Will Stanford move
into creating something like this for --

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.590 position:72%
I mean Beyond the Bubble -- for other subjects
other than Social Studies or History?"

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:22.210 position:56%
And Crissy Jacobs asked a question,
"What kind of issues do you see come

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.750 position:70%
up in a pilot that would need to be tweaked?"

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:29.940 position:69%
I don't know if they belong in the same
bucket, but they're not far from each other.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.690
&gt;&gt; Yes, those are really
two excellent questions.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:37.520 position:66%
We are currently working on creating tasks

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.570
that assess how students
interpret information online.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:47.810
That, for instance, are students
able to recognize

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:52.570 position:58%
that a new story is sponsored
content, that it's essentially an ad?

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:59.680
Or will they ask, where did the
Facebook post that makes a claim

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.520
about that Denali means Black
Power in Kenyan, for instance?

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.660
Will they ask whether or not
they trust that Facebook post?

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.600 position:56%
So we're trying to create some short
tasks that move us into the realm

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:18.540
of assessing students' ability
to interpret information online.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:23.920
So that's a new effort that's
beyond just History.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.530
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.880 position:59%
And I think we have one last question.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.490 position:73%
I'm going to leave it with Jody's question, "Is
it effective to teach by direct instruction?

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.140 position:59%
Or do we need to veer away from this?"

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.820 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think you could do some of both.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:46.900 position:66%
You know, I think that it's quite possible
to do some direct instruction, you know,

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:52.800 position:70%
we're going to give this task out and we will
all answer the question and then I'm going

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.320
to provide some instruction about
how would I answer this question?

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.560 position:59%
What does an ideal response look like?

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:05.950 position:72%
You know, that too often our expert thinking
as teachers remains invisible to our students.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:11.270 position:63%
And so more opportunities for us to make
our thinking visible, of thinking aloud

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:16.500 position:59%
and doing some cognitive modeling of
what strong responses would look like.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.890
Or how do we interrogate historical
sources certainly can be useful.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.670 position:56%
That's not an argument to say that
it should all be direct instruction.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.650 position:56%
We also want our students to wrestle
with these documents, ultimately.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.510 position:59%
And that any cognitive modeling should
be followed up with opportunities

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:31.910 position:59%
for students to practice on their own.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:38.860 position:67%
And to begin to develop their ability to
engage in this type of historical thinking,

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.270 position:63%
and reasoning and writing independently.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:46.640 position:66%
So I think it's going to be a mix of both.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.040
&gt;&gt; Alright, thank you, Joel.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.690
And I see more questions coming in.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.510 position:75%
And they're excellent, but we are past our time.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:59.810 position:70%
So I am going to invite you to make sure that
you get Joel's contact information there.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.130
It's breakstone@stanford.edu.

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:06.070 position:56%
His twitter feed is @joelbreakstone.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:13.040
You can contact him through the
SHEG website, sheg.stanford.edu.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.070 position:64%
The url beyondthebubble is there as well.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:22.060
And the Stanford History Education
Group has a page on Facebook.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:26.180
I will make sure to get Joel
the chat from today.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.150
And so he will have your questions.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.040
A couple of items before
we break for the evening.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.760
Please give us your feedback.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.790 position:67%
We have a very short three-question survey.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.970
It helps us program for the future.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.740
We will send you an email
within the week about how

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.780
to get a certificate for
completing this session.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.860
And you'll receive an email
within five business days.

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.950 position:67%
And for those who asked the question about,
where can I get some information about how

00:52:55.950 --> 00:53:00.580 position:61%
to get students to analyze them,
please go visit us at loc.gov/teachers.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:06.030 position:69%
We have tons of information to help you in
getting students to analyze primary sources.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:09.850
Joel, thank you so much for
this great presentation.

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:13.530 position:56%
This will be something that I know
will be treasured in the recordings.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.230
I know that our folks got
a lot out of this tonight.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:19.620
So thank you all for staying
with us at the end of a long day.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.920
We do appreciate your time.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.600
Joel, thank you very much.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.280
&gt;&gt; You're very welcome.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:23.920
Thanks so much.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.510
And thanks to all of you who
came out and participated.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.910
It was a pleasure.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:29.490
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.120
I'm going to end the recording,
and I'm going to end the meeting.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.710
Thank you very much.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.510
&gt;&gt; Goodnight.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:55:24.300
[ Silence ]

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.160
