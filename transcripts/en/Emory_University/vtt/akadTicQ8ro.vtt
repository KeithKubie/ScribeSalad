00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.845
Emory Saint Joseph's

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:08.120
Chief Heart Surgeon Douglas Murphy

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.240
gets ready to repair a patient's heart valve.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:13.055
Along with his surgical team, he'll be assisted by

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.240
a Da Vinci surgical robot.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.720
Murphy: "What the patient sees is fast recovery --

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.815
out of the hospital, like 3 days,

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:23.855
playing golf in like 3 weeks,

00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:26.955
and cosmetically the scar is minimal.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:30.485
But that's not the reason we do it.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.105
The reason we do it is because we can do

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.715
the operations better because we can see better."

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.920
From a console, the surgeon performs the operation

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.560
remotely while observing the scene through a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.680
stereoscopic monitor, which provides a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.480
magnified view in 3D. And that's not all.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.240
Halkos: "By coming through the right chest

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.040
with robotic technology and instrumentation

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.195
we're able to see the valve better,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.820
and because we're able to see it better,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.620
we're able to perform more precise technical

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.960
maneuvers to repair valves."

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.140
Along with Murphy, Emory's Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.660
Michael Halkos, routine share information and help train

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.760
other heart surgeons from around the world

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.020
on robotic surgical practices.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.940
Halkos: "We believe it provides a benefit to patients

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.620
and we want more patients

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380
to be able to enjoy that benefit.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.540
The robot uses several arms,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.300
essentially high-tech surgical tools

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.325
that are inserted into the patient's torso

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:30.595
through small incisions.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.500
Murphy: "We can fix the mitral valve, the tricuspid valve,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.480
we can take out tumors, we can repair holes in the heart,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720
and other miscellaneous little defects --

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.700
and we do it through five little holes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.340
In addition, the tools respond to the natural dexterity of the human hand,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.420
giving surgeons and impressively steady and accurate touch.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.020
Murphy: "The robot has software that eliminates tremor,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.880
so you can reach way in to work on a heart valve,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.400
and your hand is incredibly steady.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.520
And just like the human arm,

00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:02.445
the robotic arm has the wrist at the distal end,

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.360
we call it, inside the patient."

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800
Patients also appear to be less susceptible to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.940
surgical site infections.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.640
Murphy: "We're just not seeing it.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.180
So infections is zero. We've eliminated that problem."

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.700
But a robotic surgical project is a major investment

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.120
and may not be practical for all hospitals.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.840
Murphy: "Robotics is not for everybody.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640
Robotics is for big institutions

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.000
that have the resources,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.520
that live in a relatively populated area,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.640
so there's a lot of patients who can potentially benefit.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.960
And it'll be like mitral valve repair centers of excellence.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.980
That's where it'll fit in.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.940
It's not going to be done in small towns

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.180
where they do five a year."

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.020
But for large teaching hospital systems like Emory,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420
this type of advanced technology makes perfect sense.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.160
Halkos: "Without bragging, Emory's cardiac robotics program

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.280
is the largest program in the United States  and probably in the world.
