00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.949
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:34.078
- Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:35.537
My name is Gibor Basri.

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:38.697
I'm a professor of the
graduate school in astronomy

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:41.839
and the former Vice Chancellor
of Equity &amp; Inclusion

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.238
and a member of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:47.244
We're very pleased along
with the Graduate Council

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:51.172
to present to you this
afternoon Nina Jablonski,

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:52.456
who is this spring's speaker

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:56.535
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:00.868
As a condition of the bequest
I am obliged but happy

00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:03.561
to give you some of the verbal information

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:07.370
that is also in your
program about the endowment

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.909
and how it came to Berkeley.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.109
It's a story that exemplifies
the many ways in which

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.685
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.159
and to the Bay Area.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.576
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:21.444
came to San Francisco
during the Gold Rush,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.445
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:27.788
In 1885, not long after
this place started,

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.567
he established a
professorship here at Berkeley

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.476
as an expression of his
long-held interest in education.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.061
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.339
whose name has probably been seen by you

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:44.376
in reference to a certain
tower in San Francisco,

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:48.512
had a very colorful personality
and was also very generous.

00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:51.400
She greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.462
to establish a
professorship at UC Berkeley

00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:55.877
and also make it possible for us

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:59.186
to present this series of lectures.

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:00.472
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:02.236
one of the most cherished endowments

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:04.173
for the University of California

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.125
and it recognizes the highest distinction

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.824
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.826
Thank you Lillie and Charles.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.751
And now a few words about our speaker.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:16.712
Dr. Nina Jablonski is a
renowned anthropologist

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:18.911
whose current research comprises basic,

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:21.920
clinical, and educational projects.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.627
These include a study of the lifestyle

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:26.726
and genetic factors that
affect vitamin D status

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:29.722
in healthy young adults in South Africa,

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:32.284
the writing of a graphic
novel about skin color

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.439
for South African middle-school children,

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.109
and the development of a
science summer-camp curriculum

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.657
for minority and underserved

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:41.375
middle-school students in the US.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:42.725
Her research is funded by grants

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.381
from the National Science Foundation,

00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.929
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.788
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:51.080
She is the author of books,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.316
Living Color: The Biological
and Social Meaning

00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:57.770
of Skin Color, and
Skin: A Natural History,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.130
both from the University
of California Press.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.363
Dr. Jablonski earned her
doctorate in anthropology

00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.093
from the University of Washington in 1981,

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:08.357
and her undergrad degree
from Bryn Mawr College

00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:09.940
in biology in 1975.

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.031
She is the Evan Pugh University
Professor of Anthropology

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:16.941
at the Pennsylvania State University.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:17.774
She is the director

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:20.813
of the Center for Human
Evolution and Diversity

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:21.646
and the associate director

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:24.312
of the Huck Institutes
of the Life Sciences,

00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:27.512
both at Penn State, and a
permanent visiting fellow

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.840
at the Stellenbosch
Institute for Advanced Study

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.508
in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:35.096
Dr. Jablonski has been
recognized most recently

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:38.585
as the recipient of a
2012 Guggenheim Fellowship

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.336
for the project Naturalistic
Studies of the Dynamics

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:44.786
of Vitamin D Status in Human Populations,

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.942
and the 2005 Alphonse
Fletcher Sr. Fellowship

00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:50.769
for the project Improving
the Public Understanding

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.265
of the Biological and Social
Meaning of Skin Color.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:03:56.012
I think it's safe to say she's an expert

00:03:56.012 --> 00:03:58.936
on her subject for this afternoon.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.137
She currently serves as a member

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:02.398
of the Scientific Executive Committee

00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:04.945
for the Leakey Foundation,
and a member of the board

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:07.273
for the behavioral,
cognitive, and social sciences

00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:09.574
of the National Research Council

00:04:09.574 --> 00:04:12.085
of the National Academy of Sciences.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.595
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jablonski.

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:18.485
(audience applauding)

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.525
- Thank you very much for
that generous introduction,

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:23.221
Gibor, and thank you, Ellen,

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.406
for your logistical arrangements.

00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:28.107
It's a great pleasure to be here

00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:30.349
and such an honor to be part

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.646
of the Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:35.798
It's been wonderful to
reconnect with colleagues

00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:38.548
that I've known for years
as well as meet some

00:04:38.548 --> 00:04:41.560
new young students who hold

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.101
the promise of the future for all of us.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.268
Years ago people asked me,

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:52.899
"Why, Nina, are you studying skin?"

00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:57.462
Most anthropologists,
most paleoanthropologists

00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:59.462
study bones, or fossils,

00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:02.692
or the genetics of humans,

00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.071
but they don't try to understand aspects

00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:10.238
of human evolution by looking at skin.

00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.414
First of all, skin isn't
preserved in the fossil record,

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.047
so there are some real shortcomings,

00:05:16.047 --> 00:05:20.183
if you're trying to study
the physical remains of skin.

00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:24.099
But I realized that by overlooking skin

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.266
we overlooked probably one of the most

00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:30.990
important parts of the human body.

00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:35.688
Our physical interface
with the environment,

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:39.688
our protection, our organ
of thermal regulation,

00:05:40.738 --> 00:05:43.238
and our organ of communication

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:46.725
via touch and body decoration.

00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:53.194
By missing out on skin we
missed out on a big part

00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:55.507
of the study of human evolution.

00:05:55.507 --> 00:05:57.924
And so despite the obstacles,

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:03.416
I have enjoyed studying the
evolution of human skin,

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:07.520
and I'm going to share with
you over the next few days

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.735
a little bit of that journey.

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:12.792
Today talking about general aspects

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:15.359
of the evolution of human skin,

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:19.054
how we came to have
naked, potentially sweaty,

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:21.303
and extremely colorful skin,

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:23.220
and then tomorrow about

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:27.859
what skin color means to all of us

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:31.662
in terms of our health and
our social relationships

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.079
over centuries and millennia.

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:40.322
In 2005 colleagues began to take

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:45.108
a little bit more notice of skin.

00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:49.275
In 2005 the genome of the
chimpanzee was published,

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:55.206
and everyone looked at this
paper with great anticipation,

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.690
because they expected certainly

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.857
when we compare the genomes
of humans and modern chimps

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:05.754
what we would see are enormous differences

00:07:05.754 --> 00:07:09.143
in genes dictating the
differentiation of the brain

00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:11.657
or the musculoskeletal system.

00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:15.824
What was revealed was a
surprise to many, but not to me.

00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:19.332
Because the major set of loci

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.651
that turned out to be

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:27.484
under most rapid evolution
in the human genome

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.858
was that governing the differentiation

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:33.775
of the human epidermis.

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:37.723
In other words it was our skin

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:41.890
that was the most differentiating
part of our genome.

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:47.444
This is because having
mostly naked body skin

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:52.257
is a big departure from
the condition present

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:54.347
in our primate relatives

00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:57.322
and our more distant mammalian relatives.

00:07:57.322 --> 00:08:00.489
Fur and hair does a lot and without it

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:06.213
we have to compensate in various
ingenious biological ways

00:08:07.096 --> 00:08:10.883
that I'll elaborate on
in the next few minutes.

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:14.904
So this really got people
thinking about the evolution

00:08:14.904 --> 00:08:17.117
of skin in a much more serious way.

00:08:17.117 --> 00:08:19.328
And I must say in the last 12 years

00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:21.643
since the chimp genome was published

00:08:21.643 --> 00:08:24.517
there has been a greater swell of interest

00:08:24.517 --> 00:08:26.600
in the evolution of skin.

00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:30.831
One of my favorite visuals is what I call

00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.319
the hairy timeline of human evolution,

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:37.152
where we have here at the back end

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.683
around 7 1/2 million years ago

00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:42.853
when we last shared a common ancestor

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:45.796
with our closest relatives, chimpanzees.

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:49.022
And our skin, if we could
look at it back then,

00:08:49.022 --> 00:08:53.104
we reconstruct it to be
mostly lightly pigmented

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:57.271
and covered with dark hair,
that of a chimpanzee today.

00:08:58.652 --> 00:09:01.106
But through time and critically

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:06.057
just around two million years
ago we see important changes,

00:09:06.057 --> 00:09:08.191
and I want to focus on those changes,

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.519
because this is when we
really see the transition

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:15.352
to what we would call
ostensibly modern skin:

00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:18.602
mostly naked, and sweaty, and colorful.

00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:24.046
And it's about this time,
around two million years ago,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:26.694
and here represented by this impeccable

00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.218
partial skeleton from Kenya,

00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:32.107
we find an early member of the genus Homo,

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:34.320
a beautiful skeleton representing

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.621
one of our ancient ancestors.

00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:41.431
What's important for you
here is that this individual,

00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:45.958
a young man, has very
modern body proportions,

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.339
quite different from that of
the Australopithecine ancestors

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.497
from previous millions of years,

00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:56.664
and the lifestyle of this
hominin is what sets him apart,

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.331
and what sets the genus Homo apart,

00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:04.847
because it is these long
legs, the broad pelvis,

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:08.167
the relatively short arms that indicate

00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:11.667
that this is a person with a modern build.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.009
A strider.

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:16.954
Potentially a runner.

00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:19.029
And very different from any kind

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:22.258
of slightly more hesitant biped

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:26.425
or more arboreally competent
biped that existed previously.

00:10:29.216 --> 00:10:32.883
We reconstructed the
skin of this individual

00:10:34.197 --> 00:10:38.114
to be really mostly naked
and darkly pigmented,

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:43.600
but here what I want to talk
about is why do we reconstruct

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.780
this as mostly naked skin at this time?

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:52.747
There are lots of primates
that live in east Africa

00:10:52.747 --> 00:10:56.418
and other hot environments
that run around a lot

00:10:56.418 --> 00:10:57.986
that have lots of hair.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:01.153
Why did we lose most of our body hair?

00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:08.572
We know from studying human physiology

00:11:08.572 --> 00:11:11.916
as well as the physiology
of lots of mammals

00:11:11.916 --> 00:11:14.596
that basically having hair

00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:17.687
is great protection against abrasion,

00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:20.449
great insulation, physical insulation

00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:22.933
against cold and temperature fluctuations,

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:26.358
but it physically impedes the process

00:11:26.358 --> 00:11:28.691
of the evaporation of sweat.

00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:33.156
So even in those mammals
that can produce sweat

00:11:33.156 --> 00:11:36.291
on their surface, if
they sweat into the fur,

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.366
and the fur gets wet,

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:42.449
their skin cannot actually become cool.

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:44.491
In other words, the purpose of sweating,

00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:47.658
which is evaporative cooling, is lost.

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:53.034
What happens if you belong
to a lineage like primates

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:58.186
where most excess body heat
is lost through the skin?

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:05.751
Here are our buddies
that have a lot of hair

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:07.512
that run around a lot,

00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:09.283
a beautiful antelope on the right,

00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:11.957
a domestic dog on the left.

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:15.433
They liberate excess body
heat in a very different way.

00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:19.831
The carnivore on the left
here is able to pant.

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:23.517
The beautiful antelope on the right here

00:12:23.517 --> 00:12:25.517
has a wonderful big nose

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:29.731
with lots of veins

00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:33.389
and the inspired air that gets brought in

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:37.148
through the wet nasal
mucosa cools the veins

00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:40.777
that drain back to the
proximity of the brain

00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:44.425
and help to locally cool the brain.

00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:47.925
So both of these animals can get quite hot

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:53.061
but they have local cooling
mechanisms in their head

00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:55.434
that help their brains to stay cool,

00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:56.487
when they're exerting themselves,

00:12:56.487 --> 00:12:59.154
especially in a hot environment.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.512
You would think that our primate cousins,

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:07.023
our hairy primate
cousins would do similar,

00:13:07.023 --> 00:13:10.623
but even in this long-faced baboon,

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.872
we don't have any
structures similar to those

00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:15.990
that we find in hoofed mammals

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.157
or in the panting respiration of dogs.

00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:25.095
Instead even our close relative the baboon

00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.152
and chimpanzees for that matter

00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:30.245
have to lose heat from their body surface

00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:33.046
through radiant cooling,

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:36.546
through radiant heat loss and evaporation.

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:42.280
So they lack these specialized
methods of cooling.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.088
When a baboon runs full pelt

00:13:45.088 --> 00:13:48.921
for a long distance it
overheats and it stops.

00:13:50.654 --> 00:13:52.957
In the evolution of the genus Homo

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:56.316
we find the evolution of a primate

00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.694
that is walking, and
running, and foraging,

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:04.370
and escaping from predators,
and possibly hunting.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.335
And needing to be able to
sustain energetic locomotion

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:10.384
for a long period of time.

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:13.693
There was natural selection at this time

00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:15.901
for the loss of body hair

00:14:15.901 --> 00:14:19.484
in order to facilitate
evaporative cooling.

00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:23.962
So we hypothesized years ago that the loss

00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:26.589
of functional body hair was related

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:30.188
to the needs of thermal regulation.

00:14:30.188 --> 00:14:34.907
So here we have this
beautiful young early member

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:39.074
of the genus Homo with mostly
functionally naked skin

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.876
and where did the sweat glands come from?

00:14:43.876 --> 00:14:45.813
We know that in most mammals

00:14:45.813 --> 00:14:49.947
sweat glands of the kind that
we have all over our body

00:14:49.947 --> 00:14:52.024
are found only on the surfaces

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:54.760
of the palms and the soles of the feet.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.671
So how did human primates manage to get

00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:01.499
all these sweat glands all over the place?

00:15:01.499 --> 00:15:02.401
This has been a question

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:05.401
that has pressed people for decades.

00:15:06.457 --> 00:15:08.409
We didn't lose all of our hair.

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:11.549
Rather we reduced the
size of the body hair,

00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:13.409
so that when you look
at your own body hair

00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:16.282
it's this little sort
of measly little things

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:18.220
coming out of hair follicles.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.734
The hair follicles are
enormously important

00:15:20.734 --> 00:15:23.657
but where did the sweat glands come from?

00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:26.748
And this, as I say, was
an unanswered question

00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:29.832
for years until literally
just a few months ago

00:15:29.832 --> 00:15:32.114
when my colleague, Elaine Fuchs,

00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:34.697
and her post-doc, Catherine Lu,

00:15:35.862 --> 00:15:39.642
published a beautiful paper in Science

00:15:39.642 --> 00:15:43.176
about how this differentiation occurs

00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:45.679
in early human development.

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:49.205
Long story short, what
happens is that there is

00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:53.726
an important bone
morphogenetic protein, BMP,

00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:57.226
that determines where these hair follicles

00:15:58.284 --> 00:16:02.028
and sweat glands are
going to be differentiated

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:03.719
on the surface of the body,

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:08.030
and then at a very critical
time in embryonic development

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.863
there is a little tilt

00:16:10.782 --> 00:16:13.199
toward BMP in differentiating

00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:18.891
toward sweat gland development
as opposed to hair follicles.

00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:23.306
So what could've been a terminal
hair like in other primates

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:25.773
becomes a sweat gland instead.

00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:28.262
A beautiful piece of evolutionary

00:16:28.262 --> 00:16:32.064
developmental biological regulation.

00:16:32.064 --> 00:16:34.814
And voila, sweat glands all over.

00:16:36.939 --> 00:16:39.016
What do we do with that naked skin?

00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:41.074
Well, we sweat a lot, yes.

00:16:41.074 --> 00:16:44.088
But it's really important to recognize

00:16:44.088 --> 00:16:48.005
that in our repertoire
of behaviors as primates

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:53.550
we engage in lavish amounts
of meaningful touch.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.238
Although we don't engage
in it so much these days

00:16:56.238 --> 00:16:58.727
except with our smartphones,

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.310
gaining or touching one another

00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:04.024
has been an important part

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.330
of our communication repertoire
for millions of years,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.533
long before we existed as a human lineage.

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:13.783
But with hairless skin the surface area

00:17:15.072 --> 00:17:19.239
for this communication has
become ever much larger.

00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:23.608
This surface of communication

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:25.441
is an important portal

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.009
for social bonding in
early human development

00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:32.707
and continues to be very important

00:17:32.707 --> 00:17:36.344
throughout our ontogeny
and throughout our lives.

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:39.573
So even though we legislate against touch

00:17:39.573 --> 00:17:42.708
in many workplaces and look down upon it

00:17:42.708 --> 00:17:45.436
it is an essential part

00:17:45.436 --> 00:17:48.317
of the human communications repertoire.

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:52.417
And we know now that
withholding touch from infants,

00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:55.334
withholding affectionate touch

00:17:55.334 --> 00:17:58.018
actually stifles infant growth,

00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:01.660
not just emotional growth,
but physical growth.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.410
And so infant massage

00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:08.382
and affiliative touch are now championed

00:18:08.382 --> 00:18:10.080
not only for infants,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.129
but for people throughout the life course.

00:18:14.129 --> 00:18:18.882
But the loss of hair had
many other consequences

00:18:18.882 --> 00:18:23.872
and although I could go into
this alarmingly long, I won't.

00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:26.753
But think about when you lose the ability

00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:29.672
to express heightened emotions,

00:18:29.672 --> 00:18:33.264
especially fear, and anxiety, and anger,

00:18:33.264 --> 00:18:38.217
through piloerection, the
standard mode that a mammal uses

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.884
to show its level of
sympathetic excitation,

00:18:42.738 --> 00:18:47.680
raising its hackles, raising
its body hair, what do we do?

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.847
I mean, we can raise our hairs,
but who's gonna see them?

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:59.143
Well, we have something that compensates.

00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:01.207
There's no Botox there.

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:04.124
We have enhanced facial expressions

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.971
that help us to
communicate from a distance

00:19:07.971 --> 00:19:11.001
what our states of emotion are,

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:13.834
what our emotional intentions are.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.253
And at times that we don't know,

00:19:18.253 --> 00:19:20.802
we don't know how distant this was,

00:19:20.802 --> 00:19:24.969
but humans with naked skin
began to decorate themselves.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.850
We recognize in the archeological record

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.600
we have traces of pieces of ocher

00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:40.343
dated from about 70,000
years ago from South Africa.

00:19:40.343 --> 00:19:44.544
We have other pieces of pigment
from elsewhere in the world,

00:19:44.544 --> 00:19:48.840
very ancient, some 50 to 25,000 years old.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.265
I would guess that these pieces ocher,

00:19:52.265 --> 00:19:56.439
at least some of them, were
used to decorate human bodies,

00:19:56.439 --> 00:19:58.772
and that even before that

00:19:58.772 --> 00:20:02.105
humans who had a sense of self and image

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.060
were decorating themselves with clay, mud,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.618
and making meaningful
marks on their bodies.

00:20:12.618 --> 00:20:14.290
I can never prove this,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.893
but I would think from the evidence

00:20:16.893 --> 00:20:20.194
of all the symbolic behavior that we see

00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:23.974
in the lives of early
members of the genus Homo,

00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:28.135
early Homo sapiens, even
Homo neanderthalensis,

00:20:28.135 --> 00:20:32.742
that over 100,000 years
ago people were decorating

00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:36.909
the surfaces of their naked
bodies in significant ways.

00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:41.661
Tattooing is universal and people

00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:43.381
have been marking themselves.

00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:47.548
Otzi, the so-called Iceman
from about 5,000 years ago

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.602
had several tattoos on his body

00:20:52.602 --> 00:20:56.807
and many modern people,
including many of our students

00:20:56.807 --> 00:20:58.950
at Berkeley and elsewhere,

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.700
have lavish numbers and
varieties of tattoos.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.552
It has been one of the
most fundamental modes

00:21:06.552 --> 00:21:09.542
of communication and self-expression

00:21:09.542 --> 00:21:11.550
with the very permanence of it

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.633
being its signal feature.

00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:18.206
But I'm interested now in
turning to the question

00:21:18.206 --> 00:21:22.373
of how we came to have this
beautiful range of colors.

00:21:23.641 --> 00:21:26.840
And it's been widely recognized that,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.750
at least since the mid-20th century,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.181
that it's not just sunlight,

00:21:32.181 --> 00:21:35.590
but it's ultraviolet
radiation within sunlight

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.543
that has been the most important
factor, physical factor,

00:21:39.543 --> 00:21:43.710
correlated with skin pigmentation
in the human lineage.

00:21:46.374 --> 00:21:51.104
In our work we have been able
to take advantage of databases

00:21:51.104 --> 00:21:54.864
that weren't available to
workers in the mid-20th century.

00:21:54.864 --> 00:21:57.864
Thanks to NASA's several generations

00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:02.798
of Total Ozone Mapping
Spectrometer satellites

00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:09.087
we're able to create images
of ultraviolet radiation

00:22:09.087 --> 00:22:10.410
at the earth's surface.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.109
This one happens to be annual average UVR,

00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:16.938
but we can actually get
wavelength-specific maps now.

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:20.825
This map was created by
my colleague, and husband,

00:22:20.825 --> 00:22:24.823
and main collaborator in
our studies, George Chaplin.

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:26.790
And what we're able to see in this

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.572
is more or less what you'd predict,

00:22:28.572 --> 00:22:31.572
that the highest levels
of ultraviolet radiation

00:22:31.572 --> 00:22:33.284
are close to the equator,

00:22:33.284 --> 00:22:36.951
but that humid areas,
like the tropics here,

00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:41.747
the tropical forests
of Africa, of Amazonia,

00:22:41.747 --> 00:22:44.654
of southeast Asia have rather lower levels

00:22:44.654 --> 00:22:47.231
than the hot pink and red areas

00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:51.084
of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa.

00:22:51.084 --> 00:22:53.348
But there are very high
levels in the Andes

00:22:53.348 --> 00:22:56.280
and also in the Himalayas.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.447
Very high altitude, even
though not high latitude.

00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:04.937
So it was in this environment

00:23:04.937 --> 00:23:07.730
in equatorial and eastern Africa

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.646
that we think the human lineage

00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:13.909
and that Homo and Homo
sapiens are emerging,

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:17.909
an environment of intense
ultraviolet radiation.

00:23:18.853 --> 00:23:22.644
Ultraviolet radiation comes
in a variety of forms.

00:23:22.644 --> 00:23:24.675
The most biologically significant,

00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:28.008
because they come to earth, UVA and UVB,

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.912
at the equator in high doses,

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:36.896
especially at the vernal
and autumnal equinoxes.

00:23:36.896 --> 00:23:41.322
UVC is mostly screened
out by the atmosphere.

00:23:41.322 --> 00:23:43.739
So if we look at a simulation

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:48.841
here at the equator the
UVC is mostly screened out

00:23:49.794 --> 00:23:54.294
or absorbed by the
atmospheric oxygen and ozone,

00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:58.219
a small but biologically
significant fraction

00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:02.312
of UVB penetrates, and a
huge amount of UVA travels

00:24:02.312 --> 00:24:04.801
with the visible light down
to the earth's surface.

00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:09.009
So the equator is bathed in
a moderate amount of UVB,

00:24:09.009 --> 00:24:13.906
in fact fairly high at the
equinoxes, and a lot of UVA.

00:24:13.906 --> 00:24:18.819
And these wavelengths have
specific biological activity.

00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:20.859
I'm going to come back to this theme

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:24.192
of we evolved under the sun, many times.

00:24:27.152 --> 00:24:30.534
So in early genus Homo, mostly naked,

00:24:30.534 --> 00:24:33.582
potentially very sweaty skin,

00:24:33.582 --> 00:24:35.839
the dark pigmentation

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:38.339
being the essential substitute

00:24:39.639 --> 00:24:41.639
for hair, fur protection

00:24:42.612 --> 00:24:45.695
against solar, ultraviolet radiation.

00:24:46.988 --> 00:24:51.138
Most mammals wherever
they're living are protected

00:24:51.138 --> 00:24:55.305
from ultraviolet radiation
by a heavy coat of hair.

00:24:57.014 --> 00:25:01.018
If you lose hair you have
to compensate somehow,

00:25:01.018 --> 00:25:05.071
and the major compensation
in the human lineage

00:25:05.071 --> 00:25:09.238
is the evolution of permanent
dark protective pigmentation.

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:16.507
Eumelanin is the molecule that
I'll be talking about a lot,

00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:20.426
sometimes just referring to it as melanin.

00:25:20.426 --> 00:25:23.368
This is an amazing
pigment that has been used

00:25:23.368 --> 00:25:25.657
over and over again

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:27.574
by hundreds of millions

00:25:28.978 --> 00:25:31.745
of different kinds of organisms

00:25:31.745 --> 00:25:33.661
that live on the earth's surface

00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:37.328
and in shallow parts
of marine environments.

00:25:38.407 --> 00:25:41.240
Eumelanin is the superior absorber

00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:45.474
of ultraviolet radiation
and visible light.

00:25:45.474 --> 00:25:48.783
It's dark, very dark brown to the eye

00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:52.955
and it's this beautiful,
incredible multifunction molecule

00:25:52.955 --> 00:25:55.955
that's able to absorb UV wavelengths

00:25:58.086 --> 00:26:02.156
and as it does so the
large polymer structure

00:26:02.156 --> 00:26:05.607
uncoils a little bit, absorbing energy.

00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:08.418
It also has the ability chemically

00:26:08.418 --> 00:26:11.585
to neutralize so-called free radicals,

00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:16.520
a reactive oxygen species,
that are produced in cells

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.687
as UV impinges on organisms' surfaces.

00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:24.454
So eumelanin has been used
over and over and over again

00:26:24.454 --> 00:26:28.037
and this is what we
see that is manipulated

00:26:28.966 --> 00:26:32.383
through an easy genetic series of changes

00:26:33.303 --> 00:26:37.355
in the Homo lineage in
order to bring about

00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:40.795
dark pigmentation to protect the skin

00:26:40.795 --> 00:26:42.795
of our active ancestors.

00:26:43.959 --> 00:26:48.238
Without going into great detail
about the mechanisms of this

00:26:48.238 --> 00:26:51.984
there are many genes that
control pigmentation,

00:26:51.984 --> 00:26:55.067
probably over 120 that have some role

00:26:55.902 --> 00:26:58.544
in regulating pigmentation in mammals

00:26:58.544 --> 00:27:03.071
and some role in humans, but
one of the most important

00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:05.756
at this point in our evolution

00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:09.530
is one called the
melanocortin 1 receptor locus,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:13.782
which determines the configuration
of this important protein

00:27:13.782 --> 00:27:16.444
which exists on the surface

00:27:16.444 --> 00:27:20.320
of the melanin-producing
cells called melanocytes.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.403
Basically in darkly pigmented people,

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:29.365
and here I'm going to
refer to our ancestors,

00:27:29.365 --> 00:27:31.704
early members of the genus Homo,

00:27:31.704 --> 00:27:34.451
what we see is that this locus

00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:37.511
is under strong natural selection

00:27:37.511 --> 00:27:39.344
to lose all variation,

00:27:40.638 --> 00:27:42.221
so that this switch

00:27:44.514 --> 00:27:49.441
effectively switches on the
production of eumelanin,

00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.293
the photoprotective natural sunscreen,

00:27:52.293 --> 00:27:56.426
and reduces the production of pheomelanin,

00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:59.926
the yellow-red form of melanin that we see

00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:06.763
in red-colored mammals and
primates of various kinds,

00:28:06.763 --> 00:28:11.357
and red-haired people, and
freckles on human skin.

00:28:11.357 --> 00:28:15.616
Pheomelanin is not photoprotective at all.

00:28:15.616 --> 00:28:18.693
Eumelanin is highly photoprotective

00:28:18.693 --> 00:28:22.026
and this was the switch that was thrown.

00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:26.217
And so we can summarize
by saying in early Homo

00:28:26.217 --> 00:28:29.690
we have functionally naked,
or functionally hairless skin

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.489
even though the hairs were retained.

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:34.515
We have enhanced barrier functions.

00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:36.345
I'm not gonna talk a lot about this,

00:28:36.345 --> 00:28:38.973
but we have enhanced
ability to repel water,

00:28:38.973 --> 00:28:42.390
to repel microorganisms through a variety

00:28:43.293 --> 00:28:48.270
of different compounds
that are actually very good

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:52.353
at fighting viruses, and
bacteria, and parasites.

00:28:53.292 --> 00:28:57.109
And we have enhanced
water-protective functions.

00:28:57.109 --> 00:29:00.655
So we have this wonderful
series of barrier functions

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:04.254
that also helps to
prevent excess abrasion.

00:29:04.254 --> 00:29:05.845
We might not think of our skin

00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:07.693
as being very abrasion-resistant,

00:29:07.693 --> 00:29:10.568
but it's actually extremely tough.

00:29:10.568 --> 00:29:12.743
And it's darkly pigmented.

00:29:12.743 --> 00:29:16.329
So early Homo skin is very, very different

00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:19.746
from that of our close primate relatives.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.646
When we look at all people
around the world today

00:29:25.646 --> 00:29:29.006
all indigenous people and
measure their skin reflectance,

00:29:29.006 --> 00:29:32.866
this is data that we collated from reports

00:29:32.866 --> 00:29:35.159
collected by anthropologists,
and geographers,

00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:37.996
and human biologists over many decades,

00:29:37.996 --> 00:29:42.163
we found that skin reflectance
is very highly correlated

00:29:43.068 --> 00:29:45.782
with ultraviolet radiation to the extent

00:29:45.782 --> 00:29:48.865
that over 86% of total variation

00:29:50.707 --> 00:29:54.159
in skin pigmentation in modern humans

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:58.581
can be accounted for by
variation in autumnal levels

00:29:58.581 --> 00:30:00.966
of ultraviolet radiation alone.

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:03.957
That's a very large
percentage of variation

00:30:03.957 --> 00:30:07.820
that can be explained by one variable.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.579
And so if we look at a
mock-up of human skin here,

00:30:11.579 --> 00:30:14.779
we've got the skin layer
here, the epidermis,

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:18.472
there's the dermis underneath,
and the hypodermis.

00:30:18.472 --> 00:30:22.518
Here's the atmosphere, ozone, and oxygen.

00:30:22.518 --> 00:30:25.185
UVB at the equator is attenuated

00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:29.538
by atmospheric oxygen and ozone,

00:30:29.538 --> 00:30:33.412
and is able to penetrate
into the epidermis.

00:30:33.412 --> 00:30:35.245
It's slowed down a lot

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:39.392
by the dark pigment in the epidermis,

00:30:40.474 --> 00:30:42.723
but some manages to get through

00:30:42.723 --> 00:30:46.749
and that turns out to be
incredibly biologically important.

00:30:46.749 --> 00:30:49.950
A lot of UVA manages to get through,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.310
although the eumelanin in the
bottom of the epidermis here

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.477
is quite a good sunscreen and
reduces the amount of UVA.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:02.542
What happens when UVA impacts naked skin?

00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:07.149
It causes all sorts of interesting damage

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:08.899
to DNA in skin cells.

00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:14.686
And for the longest time
anthropologists and biologists

00:31:14.686 --> 00:31:18.057
mused that this must be the major reason

00:31:18.057 --> 00:31:20.387
that protective pigmentation evolved,

00:31:20.387 --> 00:31:23.449
to protect against damage to DNA,

00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:25.973
which could cause skin cancer.

00:31:25.973 --> 00:31:30.517
But in the 1960s a very
good biologist pointed out

00:31:30.517 --> 00:31:34.742
that, hold on, people
get skin cancer mostly

00:31:34.742 --> 00:31:38.492
after their reproductive
years are completed.

00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.520
This cannot have a selective effect.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.847
Skin cancer has no evolutionary potency

00:31:45.847 --> 00:31:49.178
because it mostly affects
people when they're old.

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:51.895
Very few skin cancers affect people

00:31:51.895 --> 00:31:53.124
during reproductive years.

00:31:53.124 --> 00:31:57.291
So we must seek another reason
for the presence of melanin.

00:31:58.311 --> 00:32:00.661
This is where we came in

00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:04.411
and it was in the early
1990s that I realized

00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:10.031
that what the connection
between ultraviolet radiation

00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:12.991
and reproductive success could be

00:32:12.991 --> 00:32:17.055
was actually mediated by a
different set of molecules,

00:32:17.055 --> 00:32:20.222
one of which was the B vitamin folate.

00:32:22.033 --> 00:32:25.204
The reason that I
identified folate initially

00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:27.621
was that folate and its close

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:33.031
biochemical relatives are sensitive

00:32:33.975 --> 00:32:35.562
to ultraviolet radiation,

00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:38.659
especially to ultraviolet B radiation,

00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:40.576
and that folate is also

00:32:43.012 --> 00:32:46.429
incredibly important in human development

00:32:47.983 --> 00:32:51.483
because it helps to fuel DNA replication,

00:32:53.108 --> 00:32:57.108
DNA repair, and DNA
modification or methylation.

00:32:58.158 --> 00:33:01.692
In other words folate is a linchpin

00:33:01.692 --> 00:33:05.081
in determining whether DNA in cells,

00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:09.019
specifically in skin cells,
is going to be healthy.

00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:11.436
Folate needs to be protected.

00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:16.019
One of the reasons that
this came to my attention

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:20.071
in the early 1990s is
that it was at that time

00:33:20.071 --> 00:33:22.493
when people were beginning
to realize the importance

00:33:22.493 --> 00:33:26.558
of folate as a determinant
of maternal health

00:33:26.558 --> 00:33:30.171
and early embryonic and fetal health

00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:31.870
because of the implication

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.203
of folate deficiencies in birth defects.

00:33:36.955 --> 00:33:39.967
We get our folate from
green leafy vegetables,

00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:41.868
and citrus fruits, and whole grains.

00:33:41.868 --> 00:33:43.051
We can't store it.

00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:44.741
We have to continue to ingest it

00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:46.866
and there are lots of environmental agents

00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:48.904
that can break down folate,

00:33:48.904 --> 00:33:52.718
not just ultraviolet
radiation, but alcohol,

00:33:52.718 --> 00:33:56.885
so we need to constantly
replenish our folate intake.

00:33:59.435 --> 00:34:01.309
With folate being required for all

00:34:01.309 --> 00:34:03.987
of these important functions,

00:34:03.987 --> 00:34:07.715
we need to have diets rich in folate.

00:34:07.715 --> 00:34:11.205
In the absence of diets rich in folate

00:34:11.205 --> 00:34:14.992
problems in early embryogenesis can ensue.

00:34:14.992 --> 00:34:18.575
This is what you look
like at 23 to 26 days

00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:21.827
of embryonic development.

00:34:21.827 --> 00:34:23.994
Your simple plate of cells

00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:29.794
is undergoing the process of neurulation,

00:34:29.794 --> 00:34:31.883
or neural tube formation.

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:36.475
This process requires prodigious
amounts of DNA production,

00:34:36.475 --> 00:34:38.517
cell division, cell migration,

00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:40.796
and if it all doesn't happen,

00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:43.879
then we can have a neural tube defect

00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:47.929
that affects the cranial end,

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.914
or the middle part of the spine,

00:34:49.914 --> 00:34:52.348
of the lower part of the spine,

00:34:52.348 --> 00:34:54.765
and many of these are lethal.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:00.117
So having made this connection
between a physical force,

00:35:01.462 --> 00:35:04.715
a physical influence,
ultraviolet radiation,

00:35:04.715 --> 00:35:07.215
a molecule, a vitamin, folate,

00:35:08.213 --> 00:35:12.397
and a process, neurulation,
neural tube formation,

00:35:12.397 --> 00:35:14.524
and reproductive success,

00:35:14.524 --> 00:35:18.304
we felt that we were onto
something that was worth pursuing.

00:35:18.304 --> 00:35:21.843
And this really started me
on this quest of studying

00:35:21.843 --> 00:35:26.010
the evolution of skin
pigmentation over 25 years ago.

00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.879
So now when we think about the effects

00:35:28.879 --> 00:35:32.650
of ultraviolet radiation
on the human organism

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.968
we think about primarily folate metabolism

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.787
involved with birth defects.

00:35:39.787 --> 00:35:43.370
And now I want to bring
in another chapter.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.927
How folate is necessary in
the regulation of temperature,

00:35:51.038 --> 00:35:55.205
of cutaneous, of the sweating
reaction in the skin.

00:35:57.017 --> 00:36:00.362
Remember how important naked, sweaty skin

00:36:00.362 --> 00:36:03.402
is for a hominin that's
walking and running around,

00:36:03.402 --> 00:36:05.855
especially in hot environments.

00:36:05.855 --> 00:36:10.176
The skin is the main event for
liberating excess body heat.

00:36:10.176 --> 00:36:14.622
And it turns out that folate
is incredibly important

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:17.622
in safeguarding the process by which

00:36:18.798 --> 00:36:22.298
this dilation of blood vessels in the skin

00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:29.576
thereby provides fluid to
the eccrine sweat glands

00:36:30.495 --> 00:36:34.523
that then give sweat to
the surface of the skin.

00:36:34.523 --> 00:36:36.127
So here we bring in

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:39.627
another molecular character, nitric oxide.

00:36:40.975 --> 00:36:44.414
I'm not going to elaborate long on this,

00:36:44.414 --> 00:36:47.673
but it's a fascinating mechanism.

00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:51.006
Folate affects nitric oxide in the body.

00:36:52.295 --> 00:36:56.656
Nitric oxide is this really
important biochemical messenger,

00:36:56.656 --> 00:36:59.823
and in the skin many different signals

00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:06.066
turn on nitric oxide, the
production of nitric oxide,

00:37:06.066 --> 00:37:09.316
and excite the release of nitric oxide.

00:37:10.405 --> 00:37:13.483
It turns out that folate
is incredibly important

00:37:13.483 --> 00:37:16.983
in the activation of nitric oxide and then

00:37:19.708 --> 00:37:23.791
the vasodilation that
actually occurs in the skin

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:28.060
prior to sweat glands starting to sweat

00:37:29.154 --> 00:37:32.817
is triggered by ultraviolet A radiation

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.961
penetrating the skin.

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:38.211
So you have folate fueling this process

00:37:40.483 --> 00:37:44.316
that is kicked off by
ultraviolet A radiation.

00:37:45.795 --> 00:37:49.128
So we have nitric oxide here in the skin

00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:52.970
and in the cutaneous blood vessels

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.803
just a little bit of vasodilation.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.027
The UVA actually excites the cutaneous

00:38:01.388 --> 00:38:04.971
and systemic vasodilation
that is important

00:38:06.772 --> 00:38:09.522
in the control of blood pressure.

00:38:11.858 --> 00:38:16.212
So we can really begin, or
end, this part of the lecture

00:38:16.212 --> 00:38:20.458
about the evolution of dark
protective pigmentation

00:38:20.458 --> 00:38:24.041
by saying that really
as far as we can tell

00:38:25.457 --> 00:38:29.245
the critical role played
by dark pigmentation

00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:32.197
is protection of folate availability

00:38:32.197 --> 00:38:34.530
for these important reasons.

00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:39.723
And that we have this invariant

00:38:39.723 --> 00:38:43.337
melanocortin 1 receptor locus that we find

00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:46.774
in most modern African populations

00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:49.524
and African diaspora populations.

00:38:51.885 --> 00:38:54.567
If we dissect the genome,

00:38:54.567 --> 00:38:57.352
and many of my colleagues
have worked diligently

00:38:57.352 --> 00:39:00.694
to do this, to look at the
evolution of pigmentation genes,

00:39:00.694 --> 00:39:04.861
we can see that there was
a so-called selective sweep

00:39:05.707 --> 00:39:07.624
whereby this locus lost

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.127
all of its functional variation

00:39:12.127 --> 00:39:16.129
under these stringent
conditions of natural selection.

00:39:16.129 --> 00:39:18.838
And we'll see that this situation changes

00:39:18.838 --> 00:39:22.561
for some populations
later in human evolution.

00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:26.240
So during the course of the
evolution of the human lineage

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.407
in Africa from early Homo
through early Homo sapiens

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:35.602
here about 200,000 years
ago, to the modern day,

00:39:36.849 --> 00:39:39.490
we have the evolution of darkly pigmented,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:43.471
potentially sweaty skin,
and people can stay healthy,

00:39:43.471 --> 00:39:47.225
very, very healthy under intense sun

00:39:47.225 --> 00:39:51.615
because the protective
eumelanin still allows

00:39:51.615 --> 00:39:54.554
a little bit of ultraviolet radiation

00:39:54.554 --> 00:39:57.137
that turns out to be important.

00:39:59.365 --> 00:40:02.532
But we have many colors of human skin,

00:40:04.212 --> 00:40:07.129
this entire glorious sepia rainbow,

00:40:08.423 --> 00:40:10.799
How did it come about?

00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:14.637
The story of this is one
of the most fascinating

00:40:14.637 --> 00:40:17.804
and important ones of human evolution,

00:40:19.238 --> 00:40:22.684
and it has to do, at least in part,

00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:26.015
with the importance of
another molecule in the skin.

00:40:26.015 --> 00:40:27.989
So here's our darkly pigmented skin

00:40:27.989 --> 00:40:30.365
under very strong sunlight at the equator

00:40:30.365 --> 00:40:34.532
there's still enough UVB
that penetrates the epidermis

00:40:35.412 --> 00:40:39.784
to start the process
of producing vitamin D.

00:40:39.784 --> 00:40:42.951
Vitamin D is the second major vitamin

00:40:42.951 --> 00:40:45.839
that is in our cast of characters

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:47.689
and turns out to be just as important

00:40:47.689 --> 00:40:50.522
to reproductive success as folate.

00:40:51.598 --> 00:40:52.431
But UVB

00:40:54.338 --> 00:40:56.505
is only available strongly

00:40:58.662 --> 00:41:02.240
within the tropics, year in and year out.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.509
What happens when people start

00:41:04.509 --> 00:41:07.009
dispersing out of the tropics?

00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:13.044
Let's look at what happens
to ultraviolet radiation

00:41:13.044 --> 00:41:17.211
in the northern hemisphere
at the winter solstice.

00:41:18.669 --> 00:41:22.921
UVC is completely absorbed
again by the atmosphere,

00:41:22.921 --> 00:41:23.754
as is UVB.

00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:27.881
UVA comes to the earth's
surface with visible light,

00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:30.605
so although it's attenuated
by the atmosphere,

00:41:30.605 --> 00:41:32.354
by the thick pack of atmosphere,

00:41:32.354 --> 00:41:35.133
there's still a lot that makes
it to the earth's surface,

00:41:35.133 --> 00:41:38.754
but UVB nothing for a
good part of the year

00:41:38.754 --> 00:41:41.083
depending on the latitude.

00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:45.546
This has enormous consequences
for human dispersals

00:41:45.546 --> 00:41:48.656
and human survival at high latitudes,

00:41:48.656 --> 00:41:50.094
whether we're talking about the northern

00:41:50.094 --> 00:41:53.397
or the extreme southern hemisphere.

00:41:53.397 --> 00:41:57.727
Because ultraviolet radiation
although mostly bad for us

00:41:57.727 --> 00:41:59.841
and mostly bad for most organisms

00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:02.924
has the one important positive effect

00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:08.568
of stimulating the production
of vitamin D in the skin.

00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:13.357
From the cholesterol-like
molecule 7DHC, which is present

00:42:13.357 --> 00:42:17.274
in the dermis of your
skin, the UVB penetrates,

00:42:18.131 --> 00:42:22.214
converts that 7DHC to
pre-vitamin D3 in the skin,

00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:28.310
and over the course of a few
chemical steps, conversions,

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:33.937
we have biologically active
vitamin D that's produced.

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:39.369
What happens under
partial UVB, seasonal UVB,

00:42:40.698 --> 00:42:43.470
or low levels, and low levels of UVA?

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:47.707
Well, we have some
vitamin D that's formed,

00:42:47.707 --> 00:42:50.374
but it takes a much longer time.

00:42:51.793 --> 00:42:54.947
These two guys, similar in age,

00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:57.738
sunny day in northern California.

00:42:57.738 --> 00:43:01.755
The man on the left can
make vitamin D in his skin,

00:43:01.755 --> 00:43:05.611
assuming that this is summer
sunlight with plenty of UVB,

00:43:05.611 --> 00:43:08.867
he can make vitamin D
in his skin at a rate

00:43:08.867 --> 00:43:12.969
five to six times faster
than the man on the right.

00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:15.995
Both of them will be able
to produce enough vitamin D

00:43:15.995 --> 00:43:18.745
at the end of the day, or
at the end of several hours,

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:23.084
to suit and to meet their
physiological needs,

00:43:23.084 --> 00:43:27.496
but the man on the right will
take a longer time to do so.

00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:29.834
This was never an issue for people

00:43:29.834 --> 00:43:32.327
who were outdoors all the time.

00:43:32.327 --> 00:43:34.479
But it is an issue today.

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:38.603
And it was an issue for
darkly pigmented people

00:43:38.603 --> 00:43:40.249
who were beginning to disperse

00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:45.073
outside of equatorial latitudes
during the Pleistocene.

00:43:45.073 --> 00:43:47.977
And we now really want
to turn to the dispersal

00:43:47.977 --> 00:43:50.560
of modern humans, Homo sapiens,

00:43:51.479 --> 00:43:54.396
beginning around 200,000 years ago.

00:43:56.606 --> 00:44:00.358
The best molecular and
paleontological estimates

00:44:00.358 --> 00:44:02.941
place the origin of our species

00:44:03.885 --> 00:44:06.511
around 200,000 years ago in Africa.

00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:10.945
Most of the evolution of Homo
sapiens occurs in Africa.

00:44:10.945 --> 00:44:14.587
All of the tremendous linguistic,
cultural, technological,

00:44:14.587 --> 00:44:17.171
artistic differentiation of our species,

00:44:17.171 --> 00:44:18.684
the tremendous evolution

00:44:18.684 --> 00:44:22.160
of our quintessentially human traits

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.694
occurs in this early phase
of Homo sapiens evolution

00:44:26.694 --> 00:44:29.248
until 70 or 80,000 years ago.

00:44:29.248 --> 00:44:33.794
So this tremendously active
Homo sapiens evolution phase

00:44:33.794 --> 00:44:37.961
occurring here with dispersals
within Africa occurring.

00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:42.258
Beginning around 60 to 70,000 years ago,

00:44:42.258 --> 00:44:45.763
and this number changes
in light of new evidence

00:44:45.763 --> 00:44:47.686
all the time, but we'll just stick with

00:44:47.686 --> 00:44:50.009
about 60 to 70,000 years ago,

00:44:50.009 --> 00:44:53.259
we have the first egress of populations

00:44:54.326 --> 00:44:56.699
through the Afro-Arabian peninsula,

00:44:56.699 --> 00:44:59.949
along the southern coast of south Asia,

00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:04.339
and into the hinterland of central Asia.

00:45:05.899 --> 00:45:09.899
Down 50 to 60,000 years
ago into southeast Asia,

00:45:11.364 --> 00:45:14.310
and then 40 to 50,000
years ago from sort of

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.285
a staging post here near the Black Sea

00:45:17.285 --> 00:45:21.000
populations dispersing both
westerly and northwesterly

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.500
into Europe, and northeasterly

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:27.539
into Asia, northeastern Asia.

00:45:28.873 --> 00:45:31.399
Into regions with very low

00:45:31.399 --> 00:45:35.566
and highly seasonal levels
of ultraviolet radiation.

00:45:37.173 --> 00:45:39.506
This dispersal is sped along

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:45.019
by the incredible cultural
competence of these people.

00:45:45.019 --> 00:45:48.988
All of these years of evolution
we had this incredibly

00:45:48.988 --> 00:45:51.674
sophisticated and varied toolkit.

00:45:51.674 --> 00:45:52.812
We had language.

00:45:52.812 --> 00:45:56.094
We were behaviorally
modern in every sense.

00:45:56.094 --> 00:45:58.662
And so these dispersals occurred faster

00:45:58.662 --> 00:46:01.434
than those of other mammals.

00:46:01.434 --> 00:46:03.444
But what happened?

00:46:03.444 --> 00:46:05.497
We were going into these areas

00:46:05.497 --> 00:46:08.160
that were really very different

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.243
from our ancestral solar environment.

00:46:14.206 --> 00:46:16.590
And it's important to remember

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.007
that probably during individual lifetimes

00:46:21.193 --> 00:46:23.254
people didn't travel a lot.

00:46:23.254 --> 00:46:25.279
The idea of sort of going somewhere.

00:46:25.279 --> 00:46:27.455
Yeah, well, yes, you'd
be looking for food,

00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:29.502
and you'd be escaping predators,

00:46:29.502 --> 00:46:33.335
but there wouldn't be
active moves very often.

00:46:34.929 --> 00:46:38.318
But most people spent time out of doors

00:46:38.318 --> 00:46:40.485
and without sewn clothing.

00:46:41.845 --> 00:46:45.828
The earliest common occurrences of needles

00:46:45.828 --> 00:46:47.606
for the preparation of sewn clothing,

00:46:47.606 --> 00:46:51.067
of tailored clothes,
about 20,000 years ago.

00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:53.734
Humans were hoofing it big time,

00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:58.388
dispersing with mostly naked skin,

00:47:01.215 --> 00:47:03.080
and without sewn clothes.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.916
They certainly had the
ability to use animal hides,

00:47:05.916 --> 00:47:08.138
and possibly to use plant materials,

00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:09.580
but they didn't have the ability

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.853
to tailor close-fitting clothing.

00:47:11.853 --> 00:47:16.020
So our skin was the primary
interface with the environment.

00:47:18.078 --> 00:47:21.176
Throughout the year being outdoors

00:47:21.176 --> 00:47:24.113
ultraviolet radiation varied by season

00:47:24.113 --> 00:47:26.946
and we adapted to different levels

00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:32.090
of temperature and ultraviolet radiation

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.923
through biological and
cultural modifications.

00:47:37.074 --> 00:47:40.574
Vitamin D is incredibly important in this.

00:47:41.553 --> 00:47:44.635
How did we maintain the
ability to make vitamin D

00:47:44.635 --> 00:47:46.878
when we were dispersing into latitudes

00:47:46.878 --> 00:47:50.711
that had virtually no
UVB throughout the year?

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:55.705
We need vitamin D to build strong bones.

00:47:55.705 --> 00:47:59.616
In the absence of vitamin
D to help us absorb

00:47:59.616 --> 00:48:02.874
calcium from our diet in early development

00:48:02.874 --> 00:48:06.488
infants and children can develop
this bowing of the bones,

00:48:06.488 --> 00:48:09.026
nutritional rickets, really, really bad,

00:48:09.026 --> 00:48:12.438
especially if it persists into later life.

00:48:12.438 --> 00:48:15.180
A young woman who suffers from rickets

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:19.347
throughout her early life will
develop a deformed pelvis,

00:48:20.688 --> 00:48:22.949
the outlet of which is compressed,

00:48:22.949 --> 00:48:26.199
so that she cannot give birth normally.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.440
Natural selection big time.

00:48:30.989 --> 00:48:33.116
We now recognize that in addition

00:48:33.116 --> 00:48:35.912
to that classical function of vitamin D

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:39.750
that vitamin D controls
important functions

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.114
of the immune system

00:48:41.114 --> 00:48:44.155
and of cellular growth and
proliferation in the body.

00:48:44.155 --> 00:48:47.890
There are vitamin D receptors
on virtually every organ,

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.490
whether we're talking about the brain,

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:53.695
the pancreas, the skeletal
muscle, as well as bone.

00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:57.501
So our health turns out to be regulated

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.501
in part by this vitamin,

00:49:00.454 --> 00:49:03.388
which we never questioned
in our early evolution.

00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:05.428
Vitamin D was being produced in our bodies

00:49:05.428 --> 00:49:08.761
just because we were alive and outdoors.

00:49:10.565 --> 00:49:14.565
But when humans are now
living in high latitudes

00:49:15.564 --> 00:49:17.430
being outdoors isn't enough.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.419
And at the highest
latitudes, what we find is

00:49:20.419 --> 00:49:25.303
that people can only sustain
year-round habitation

00:49:25.303 --> 00:49:28.553
if they have maximally depigmented skin

00:49:30.716 --> 00:49:34.255
and if they have cultural adaptations

00:49:34.255 --> 00:49:37.422
for ingestion of vitamin D-rich foods.

00:49:39.532 --> 00:49:42.782
Their biology and their culture change.

00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:47.264
So this dispersal involved

00:49:47.264 --> 00:49:50.344
both biological and cultural adaptations

00:49:50.344 --> 00:49:53.761
in what we call the vitamin D compromise.

00:49:55.844 --> 00:49:58.231
And the first element of this compromise

00:49:58.231 --> 00:50:00.148
is skin depigmentation.

00:50:01.004 --> 00:50:05.171
I don't talk about so much
light skin as depigmented skin.

00:50:06.425 --> 00:50:09.675
Depigmented skin is a derived condition

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.536
from our ancestral darkly pigmented skin.

00:50:13.536 --> 00:50:16.224
And we predicted this even before

00:50:16.224 --> 00:50:17.890
there was any genomic evidence

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.869
that these individuals resulting

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:24.723
from two sort of
sub-lineages of modern humans

00:50:24.723 --> 00:50:26.311
dispersing into high latitudes

00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:28.698
would have evolved independently.

00:50:28.698 --> 00:50:33.322
And how beautiful that in the
course of the last 15 years

00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:36.783
genomicists looking at pigmentation genes

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:40.033
have found that these groups of people,

00:50:43.074 --> 00:50:47.100
northwest Europeans and
northeastern Asians,

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.738
have independently
evolved depigmented skin.

00:50:50.738 --> 00:50:53.727
One of the genetic loci is similar,

00:50:53.727 --> 00:50:56.681
but most of the others aren't.

00:50:56.681 --> 00:51:00.848
This is music to the ears of
any evolutionary biologist,

00:51:01.882 --> 00:51:05.781
that you would have a
selective force so strong

00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:08.289
that it would call upon
whatever genetic variation

00:51:08.289 --> 00:51:11.695
was available, and we've got
a big palette, as it were,

00:51:11.695 --> 00:51:15.090
of pigmentation genes, that we would use

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:18.418
whatever variation was
available to produce

00:51:18.418 --> 00:51:22.296
lightly pigmented or depigmented skin.

00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:25.634
And now we know that there are many loci

00:51:25.634 --> 00:51:29.801
in many populations that are
associated with depigmentation

00:51:30.782 --> 00:51:33.597
under strong positive selection.

00:51:33.597 --> 00:51:37.347
And the elucidation of
the different pathways

00:51:38.471 --> 00:51:40.983
that have been used in
different populations,

00:51:40.983 --> 00:51:43.478
we now know that depigmentation occurred

00:51:43.478 --> 00:51:47.383
at least three times and
I would guess it occurred

00:51:47.383 --> 00:51:50.518
probably even more than
that in Homo sapiens,

00:51:50.518 --> 00:51:54.094
in addition to having occurred most likely

00:51:54.094 --> 00:51:57.844
in Neanderthals as well,
our distant cousins.

00:52:00.195 --> 00:52:01.528
So what happens?

00:52:02.527 --> 00:52:05.110
Under strong selective pressure

00:52:07.614 --> 00:52:11.697
low UVB at high latitudes
we have depigmentation,

00:52:13.049 --> 00:52:16.873
loss of eumelanin pigmentation,
most eumelanin pigmentation,

00:52:16.873 --> 00:52:20.073
so that we have excellent
vitamin D production.

00:52:20.073 --> 00:52:22.785
And this is the primary selective force

00:52:22.785 --> 00:52:25.952
for the evolution of depigmented skin.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.775
An example of the vitamin
D compromise at work,

00:52:29.775 --> 00:52:31.986
and I'm going to take one of many.

00:52:31.986 --> 00:52:35.348
This is a very extreme example.

00:52:35.348 --> 00:52:38.348
People started moving into Scotland,

00:52:39.542 --> 00:52:43.098
modern people, about 10,000 years ago,

00:52:43.098 --> 00:52:46.598
and mostly inhabiting coastal settlements.

00:52:47.655 --> 00:52:50.405
The people have undergone in situ

00:52:52.495 --> 00:52:56.522
maximal loss of eumelanin pigmentation.

00:52:56.522 --> 00:52:59.439
Not surprising, even on a sunny day

00:53:00.505 --> 00:53:02.157
at the summer solstice

00:53:02.157 --> 00:53:06.035
it is not very sunny in northern Scotland.

00:53:06.035 --> 00:53:07.190
And there are many days

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.201
where there is very, very
little ultraviolet B.

00:53:10.201 --> 00:53:13.010
So how did people survive?

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.379
Maximally depigmented skin.

00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:19.546
But it turns out that even
with no natural sunscreen

00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:23.810
they could not make enough
vitamin D in the skin

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.850
to satisfy their
physiological requirements.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.600
So year-round habitation required

00:53:30.866 --> 00:53:35.599
technology and culture to
harvest vitamin D-rich foods.

00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:37.677
People lived near the coast, they ate lots

00:53:37.677 --> 00:53:41.484
of cod fish, cod liver, cod liver stews.

00:53:41.484 --> 00:53:44.484
People in the hinterland dried fish,

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:48.562
kept fish on the roofs of their cottages

00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:50.593
and ate other sources of protein

00:53:50.593 --> 00:53:53.760
like blood sausage that had vitamin D.

00:53:54.813 --> 00:53:57.374
And they stayed healthy.

00:53:57.374 --> 00:54:00.309
So the vitamin D compromise
also involved, sort of,

00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:02.779
the tinkering, the genetic tinkering,

00:54:02.779 --> 00:54:05.850
of genes that affect vitamin D production

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:08.433
in the skin and its metabolism.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.417
And the introduction
of vitamin D-rich diets

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:15.084
in many populations.

00:54:16.341 --> 00:54:18.083
But let's not forget vasodilation.

00:54:18.083 --> 00:54:19.916
What happened?

00:54:19.916 --> 00:54:24.083
This depigmentation also allows
enhanced penetration of UVA

00:54:26.216 --> 00:54:30.577
so that healthy levels of
vasodilation can occur,

00:54:30.577 --> 00:54:34.416
reducing blood pressure
and allowing sweat glands

00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:38.583
to get the fluid that they need
from the expanded arterials.

00:54:41.055 --> 00:54:43.905
So here we have a healthy situation

00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:47.238
with a nicely vasodilating little artery

00:54:48.995 --> 00:54:50.912
and people are healthy.

00:54:52.045 --> 00:54:56.021
In skin pigmentation
thus we can really see

00:54:56.021 --> 00:55:00.188
one of the most interesting
evolutionary compromises

00:55:01.633 --> 00:55:03.899
that we've been able to describe.

00:55:03.899 --> 00:55:05.611
There is operating here

00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:08.652
what evolutionary
biologists and geneticists

00:55:08.652 --> 00:55:10.652
would call a dual cline.

00:55:13.136 --> 00:55:16.416
One that emphasizes photoprotection,

00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:20.326
maximal eumelanin
pigmentation at the equator

00:55:20.326 --> 00:55:23.962
and in other high-UV environments,

00:55:23.962 --> 00:55:27.211
and a cline in the opposite direction

00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:29.252
emphasizing depigmented skin

00:55:29.252 --> 00:55:33.348
that permits photosynthesis
of vitamin D maximally

00:55:33.348 --> 00:55:36.931
under very seasonal
and low-UVB conditions.

00:55:38.052 --> 00:55:41.885
A beautiful system honed
by natural selection.

00:55:43.485 --> 00:55:47.166
And so the eumelanin
concentration in human skin

00:55:47.166 --> 00:55:50.542
is very much related to the intensity

00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:52.363
of ultraviolet radiation,

00:55:52.363 --> 00:55:56.530
and in middle latitudes we
have people who can tan.

00:55:57.477 --> 00:55:59.836
And we are now looking at
the genetic architecture

00:55:59.836 --> 00:56:03.428
of tanning, this is some of
my past graduate students,

00:56:03.428 --> 00:56:07.519
and we're finding that in all
sorts of different populations

00:56:07.519 --> 00:56:09.768
whether they're in the
circum-Mediterranean,

00:56:09.768 --> 00:56:12.698
or north Africa, or southeast Asia,

00:56:12.698 --> 00:56:14.261
that have tanning ability.

00:56:14.261 --> 00:56:16.480
They have different suites of genes

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.093
that can be turned on and off,

00:56:19.093 --> 00:56:21.041
or on at various seasons,

00:56:21.041 --> 00:56:24.832
when there's high amounts
of ultraviolet radiation.

00:56:24.832 --> 00:56:27.616
So this is really, really exciting stuff.

00:56:27.616 --> 00:56:31.334
The tanning too has evolved independently.

00:56:31.334 --> 00:56:35.501
Similar skin colors have
evolved independently many times

00:56:36.616 --> 00:56:38.946
under the same UV conditions,

00:56:38.946 --> 00:56:42.446
and using different combinations of genes.

00:56:44.697 --> 00:56:48.049
So these three darkly
pigmented individuals,

00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:52.382
on from Africa, one from
Australia, one from southern India,

00:56:52.382 --> 00:56:55.214
have darkly pigmented beautifully,

00:56:55.214 --> 00:56:58.385
naturally, sunscreen-rich skin,

00:56:58.385 --> 00:57:01.440
and the genetic architecture
of their dark pigmentation

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.357
is different in all of these cases.

00:57:06.062 --> 00:57:08.895
Very importantly skin pigmentation

00:57:11.174 --> 00:57:14.571
genetically is mostly independent

00:57:14.571 --> 00:57:17.219
of other physical traits.

00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:19.817
So whether we're talking about hair color,

00:57:19.817 --> 00:57:23.984
eye color, nose shape, ear
shape, or other physical traits,

00:57:25.406 --> 00:57:30.298
skin pigmentation for the
most part is independent.

00:57:30.298 --> 00:57:33.585
So these groups of characteristics

00:57:33.585 --> 00:57:36.473
that have sometimes been put together

00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:39.640
by people for various reasons are not.

00:57:40.749 --> 00:57:44.916
They don't sort of walk in lock
step genetically in a group.

00:57:45.766 --> 00:57:46.599
They aren't.

00:57:46.599 --> 00:57:47.703
They aren't connected.

00:57:47.703 --> 00:57:50.769
And they have undergone
independent histories

00:57:50.769 --> 00:57:52.769
through our own history.

00:57:54.677 --> 00:57:58.844
So we now have this beautiful
sepia rainbow of modern humans

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:03.614
that has evolved in
different parts of the world.

00:58:03.614 --> 00:58:06.268
Over time as humans, modern humans,

00:58:06.268 --> 00:58:09.238
have dispersed into
different parts of the world

00:58:09.238 --> 00:58:13.321
similar pigmentations and
different ones evolving

00:58:14.494 --> 00:58:16.744
under similar UV conditions

00:58:18.298 --> 00:58:21.224
with different genetic mechanisms.

00:58:21.224 --> 00:58:24.224
It is a beautiful story of evolution

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:29.170
of the human body under natural selection.

00:58:30.548 --> 00:58:34.147
I tell people, remember Chuck, right?

00:58:34.147 --> 00:58:36.476
(audience laughing)

00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:40.242
We as teachers, whether we're
teaching in our living room

00:58:40.242 --> 00:58:42.418
with our children and grandchildren,

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:44.462
or whether we're teaching
in our classrooms,

00:58:44.462 --> 00:58:48.288
we're always seeking
examples of natural selection

00:58:48.288 --> 00:58:50.840
and evolution on the human body.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.840
Here is one of the best.

00:58:53.854 --> 00:58:57.271
And, you know, I urge people to use this,

00:58:58.113 --> 00:59:01.712
because it is understandable,
everybody has skin,

00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:04.702
this is something that people can grasp.

00:59:04.702 --> 00:59:08.378
Skin pigmentation is a natural compromise

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:11.045
determined by natural selection.

00:59:12.974 --> 00:59:15.325
And so we can marvel

00:59:15.325 --> 00:59:18.742
at this beautiful evolutionary compromise

00:59:19.962 --> 00:59:23.795
and tomorrow we will
consider what this means,

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:27.602
what this beautiful compromise means,

00:59:27.602 --> 00:59:31.213
especially when people start moving around

00:59:31.213 --> 00:59:34.714
and interacting in ways
that weren't predicted

00:59:34.714 --> 00:59:38.047
by our ancestors 20 or 50,000 years ago.

00:59:40.099 --> 00:59:42.024
Thank you very much.

00:59:42.024 --> 00:59:45.191
(audience applauding)

00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:52.029
- [Man] So in one of the very last slides

00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:54.795
you showed the different
people with different colors.

00:59:54.795 --> 00:59:58.147
The person in Alaska had
kind of dark pigment.

00:59:58.147 --> 00:59:59.345
Can you explain that one.

00:59:59.345 --> 01:00:00.178
- Yes.

01:00:00.178 --> 01:00:01.638
I didn't plant you in the audience

01:00:01.638 --> 01:00:04.579
but I'm so glad that
you asked that question.

01:00:04.579 --> 01:00:08.746
People always ask me about the
dark pigmentation of Inuit.

01:00:10.495 --> 01:00:13.561
Inuit and many of the circumpolar peoples

01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:15.460
have great tanning ability.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.543
When you look at their unexposed skin

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:22.093
it's sort of moderately pigmented,

01:00:22.093 --> 01:00:26.412
but they have tremendous
ability to make melanin

01:00:26.412 --> 01:00:31.073
in their skin as a result
of direct solar radiation,

01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:35.406
but also from UV that
bounces off the surface

01:00:35.406 --> 01:00:37.906
of the water and snow and ice.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:42.787
So how do they manage?

01:00:42.787 --> 01:00:45.122
So here they are, super high latitudes,

01:00:45.122 --> 01:00:49.596
Arctic Circle and above,
how do they manage?

01:00:49.596 --> 01:00:53.763
They get their vitamin D
entirely through their diet.

01:00:54.886 --> 01:00:59.560
And when we look at the
culture of Inuit people

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.375
it is built around the harvesting
of vitamin D-rich food.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:07.042
Whether we're talking
about spearing whales,

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:09.797
or seals, sea lions,

01:01:11.772 --> 01:01:14.238
or eating oily fish,

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.896
or in the hinterland

01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:17.813
chasing caribou or reindeer,

01:01:17.813 --> 01:01:21.281
depending on which part
of the Arctic you're in.

01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:25.043
You are pursuing vitamin D-rich prey.

01:01:25.043 --> 01:01:29.001
And basically people can
maintain good health,

01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:33.953
Inuit people, when they are
eating vitamin D-rich foods.

01:01:33.953 --> 01:01:37.116
As soon as they start
moving to settlements

01:01:37.116 --> 01:01:39.993
and abandon their traditional diet

01:01:39.993 --> 01:01:43.880
they have terrific problems
of vitamin D deficiency,

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.243
which are now a cause

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:48.954
of great public health
concern and mitigation.

01:01:48.954 --> 01:01:53.068
But the fascinating thing
is that natural selection

01:01:53.068 --> 01:01:56.823
has worked to enhance
tanning through genes,

01:01:56.823 --> 01:01:59.629
complexes that we still don't understand.

01:01:59.629 --> 01:02:04.520
Enhanced tanning to protect
against this UVA load

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.201
in a sense knowing that the vitamin D

01:02:08.201 --> 01:02:10.784
is coming from dietary sources.

01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:14.830
- [Man] I'm from the Department
of Nutritional Sciences

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:18.841
and I'm fascinated by what
you said about human foods

01:02:18.841 --> 01:02:22.457
and human food cultures and
their role in evolution,

01:02:22.457 --> 01:02:25.593
but this makes me think of another element

01:02:25.593 --> 01:02:28.282
of human food culture and that is

01:02:28.282 --> 01:02:30.406
when you look at a lot
of different cultures

01:02:30.406 --> 01:02:34.057
there's something about
hot foods and cold foods

01:02:34.057 --> 01:02:37.531
and I wonder if the origin
of the ideas of hot foods

01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:41.002
and cold foods may have
actually been something

01:02:41.002 --> 01:02:44.273
that helped us to walk out of Africa.

01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:48.506
- You mean hot as far
as cooked or hot spicy?

01:02:48.506 --> 01:02:51.509
- [Man] Or what people culturally call,

01:02:51.509 --> 01:02:54.400
oh, that's a hot food,
or that's a cold food.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.584
And if you ask people from
many different cultures

01:02:57.584 --> 01:02:59.896
what their grandmothers taught them

01:02:59.896 --> 01:03:01.965
you find a lot of different answers

01:03:01.965 --> 01:03:05.800
but so many of them talking
about hot foods and cold foods.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.855
- Yes, and there's a lot
of discussion about this

01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:12.219
that some foods are eaten,
especially in the winter

01:03:12.219 --> 01:03:16.386
to help protect you against
the temperature fluctuations.

01:03:18.748 --> 01:03:22.568
We've never, to my knowledge
no one has actually looked

01:03:22.568 --> 01:03:25.313
at the, you know, relative thermogenesis

01:03:25.313 --> 01:03:28.753
of these so-called hot
foods and cold foods.

01:03:28.753 --> 01:03:32.966
In traditional east Asian
cultures, for instance,

01:03:32.966 --> 01:03:36.716
eating turtle, eating
snake in the wintertime

01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:40.114
is considered very important

01:03:40.114 --> 01:03:43.528
and avoiding those foods in
the summer is equally important

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.343
because they're said
to generate more heat.

01:03:46.343 --> 01:03:49.248
I would love to know if there was actually

01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:53.571
more thermogenesis that was
gained from these so-called

01:03:53.571 --> 01:03:55.998
hot or cold foods, but to my knowledge,

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.547
no one has looked at this.

01:03:58.547 --> 01:04:00.406
- [Man] Thank you for that talk, Doctor.

01:04:00.406 --> 01:04:04.239
My question involves our
very hairy ancestors.

01:04:05.393 --> 01:04:07.212
(both laughing)

01:04:07.212 --> 01:04:09.545
Would it be fair to say that

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:14.215
their primary method or system of cooling

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:16.809
was something other than
evaporative cooling?

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:19.636
- Oh, yes, very good question.

01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:23.053
So with our hairy ancestors and relatives

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.443
modern monkeys and apes today

01:04:27.774 --> 01:04:31.357
actually lose body heat
through their skin,

01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:34.964
through their hairy skin,

01:04:34.964 --> 01:04:37.804
and they have some sweat glands.

01:04:37.804 --> 01:04:40.401
So they are able to sweat a little bit.

01:04:40.401 --> 01:04:43.038
There are some monkeys,

01:04:43.038 --> 01:04:47.078
the patas monkey of east and west Africa

01:04:47.078 --> 01:04:49.489
has a relatively thin coat of hair

01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:52.361
and quite a few eccrine sweat glands.

01:04:52.361 --> 01:04:56.528
It is the most fast-running
of the non-human primates

01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:01.764
and people have looked at the patas monkey

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:04.931
as sort of a model for human sweating.

01:05:06.487 --> 01:05:09.838
That there was natural
selection for thinning of hair

01:05:09.838 --> 01:05:13.411
and increased density
of eccrine sweat glands.

01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:16.476
But the key thing with
all of these primates

01:05:16.476 --> 01:05:18.329
is that they did lose heat

01:05:18.329 --> 01:05:20.948
through the surfaces of their body.

01:05:20.948 --> 01:05:23.568
There isn't a specialized
panting mechanism

01:05:23.568 --> 01:05:27.485
or nasal-cooling mechanism
as in other mammals.

01:05:29.287 --> 01:05:31.781
- [Woman] A few years ago my husband and I

01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:34.364
visited the prehistoric museum in Bordeaux

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.031
on our way to Lescar

01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:40.331
and there was a mock-up of a small family

01:05:40.331 --> 01:05:44.853
of Homo neanderthalensis,
which absolutely fascinated me

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:48.357
because they had light
skin, nearly hairless,

01:05:48.357 --> 01:05:52.060
red hair, and they looked like, you know,

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.227
a lot of guys I've known. (chuckles)

01:05:58.105 --> 01:06:02.658
I know you were careful in
your use of Homo, and so forth,

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:05.249
and I know there were
besides the neanderthalensis

01:06:05.249 --> 01:06:08.955
there were, you know, Homo
ergaster, Homo erectus,

01:06:08.955 --> 01:06:11.648
I mean, many other Homo species,

01:06:11.648 --> 01:06:13.481
but having seen the...

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:17.019
First of all, was it inaccurate?

01:06:17.019 --> 01:06:20.579
And then how do you differentiate
the, was it accurate

01:06:20.579 --> 01:06:23.435
that they had light skin
and fairly hairless?

01:06:23.435 --> 01:06:26.610
I mean the rib cages were more robust,

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:29.551
but in terms of the skin, I'm fascinated.

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:32.255
- Yeah, this is a very good question.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:37.243
We know that the loss of
body hair in our lineage,

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:41.060
in the Homo lineage, occurred probably

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.620
more than a million and a half years ago.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.870
So the ancestor

01:06:48.028 --> 01:06:51.541
of the ancestor of the Neanderthals

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.124
was a mostly hairless,

01:06:54.124 --> 01:06:57.017
sweaty member of the genus Homo.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:07:00.967
So whatever kind of species
designation you want to give,

01:07:00.967 --> 01:07:03.803
Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis,

01:07:03.803 --> 01:07:06.470
the predecessor to Neanderthals,

01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:10.683
this was a mostly hairless hominin.

01:07:13.555 --> 01:07:17.305
We have inferred even
before genetic evidence

01:07:18.507 --> 01:07:22.674
that a hominin that would have
been living deep in the past

01:07:23.756 --> 01:07:27.636
in a middle latitude, or in, let's say,

01:07:27.636 --> 01:07:31.389
about 40 degrees north latitude in Europe,

01:07:31.389 --> 01:07:35.396
would have lost most of it's pigmentation.

01:07:35.396 --> 01:07:39.146
So we hypothesized this
in one of our papers.

01:07:40.168 --> 01:07:42.835
But then just about 10 years ago

01:07:43.899 --> 01:07:46.232
using ancient DNA techniques

01:07:47.587 --> 01:07:51.754
an excellent Spanish human
geneticist, Carles Lalueza-Fox,

01:07:53.771 --> 01:07:57.271
was able to look at the pigmentation gene,

01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:00.543
the MC1R locus specifically,

01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:05.554
of a very important group
of Neanderthals from Spain.

01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:09.767
What he was able to determine,

01:08:09.767 --> 01:08:11.536
and this was a very clever piece

01:08:11.536 --> 01:08:13.612
of genetics that was undertaken.

01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:16.789
He was able to reconstruct the activity

01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:18.938
of this particular gene.

01:08:18.938 --> 01:08:21.449
So even though it was no Neanderthal there

01:08:21.449 --> 01:08:24.557
to sort of inhabit the gene,
if you know what I mean,

01:08:24.557 --> 01:08:27.974
he was able to show that the gene product

01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:33.012
would have been light skin,
or mostly depigmented skin.

01:08:34.264 --> 01:08:37.925
So they actually used the ancient DNA

01:08:37.925 --> 01:08:42.092
to reconstruct the action of
the melanin-producing cells

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:45.930
and reconstructed that most individuals

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.642
would have been lightly pigmented

01:08:48.642 --> 01:08:51.637
and at least, they estimated,

01:08:51.637 --> 01:08:55.977
around 10 or 20% would have had red hair.

01:08:55.977 --> 01:09:00.315
You know, I think that's a bit
more of a sort of question.

01:09:00.315 --> 01:09:03.482
But there's no doubt that the strength

01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:07.321
of natural selection was great

01:09:08.599 --> 01:09:13.252
when humans were dispersing
into high latitudes.

01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.835
So it was either be depigmented

01:09:17.492 --> 01:09:20.810
or have a lot of vitamin D in the diet.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.677
And I would guess in the
history of various human species

01:09:24.677 --> 01:09:27.043
and in various Homo sapiens groups,

01:09:27.043 --> 01:09:30.222
we have all sorts of mixing and matching,

01:09:30.222 --> 01:09:33.627
that there's strong selection occurring

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.212
and some of that is going to be met

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:38.808
through genetic modifications

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:42.677
of readily available genetic
variation when it's there,

01:09:42.677 --> 01:09:46.688
and other times it's going
to be met by dietary changes,

01:09:46.688 --> 01:09:49.935
and other times it's not
going to be met at all

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.852
and the populations become extinct.

01:09:56.962 --> 01:09:58.239
- [Woman] I'm going to
ask you a silly question,

01:09:58.239 --> 01:09:59.201
if that's all right.

01:09:59.201 --> 01:10:00.468
- Go ahead.

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:02.962
- [Woman] So if you have
a black-and-white cat

01:10:02.962 --> 01:10:07.129
and you shave it, its skin is
also black-and-white patchy,

01:10:08.598 --> 01:10:11.384
so why, I mean, obviously
that's a carnivore,

01:10:11.384 --> 01:10:14.462
but why is it that human
skin and pelage coloration

01:10:14.462 --> 01:10:17.326
is so uniform on an individual?

01:10:17.326 --> 01:10:19.591
- Yeah, it's a great question,

01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:22.288
and it's not a silly question at all.

01:10:22.288 --> 01:10:25.352
We see throughout primates,

01:10:25.352 --> 01:10:27.935
and especially throughout apes,

01:10:29.965 --> 01:10:32.048
that we lose our pattern.

01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:34.988
So there are some monkeys

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:38.541
that have beautifully patterned coats

01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:42.651
and that have similarly
patterned skin under the coats.

01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:46.162
But as soon as we get into the ape lineage

01:10:46.162 --> 01:10:50.647
we lose, and especially the
large, the African ape lineage,

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.044
we lose all of that patterning

01:10:53.044 --> 01:10:56.427
for genetic reasons that
we still don't understand.

01:10:56.427 --> 01:10:58.457
So when you shave an orangutan,

01:10:58.457 --> 01:11:01.982
you shave a gorilla or a chimpanzee,

01:11:01.982 --> 01:11:05.372
it's all the same color underneath.

01:11:05.372 --> 01:11:08.987
This is a real question as to why,

01:11:08.987 --> 01:11:12.519
why we lose this, the relationship

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:16.728
between the hair color and
the underlying skin color.

01:11:16.728 --> 01:11:20.014
And this is, as I say,
it is an open question

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:23.666
that primate biologists
who are studying skin

01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:27.532
and hair coloration have yet to answer.

01:11:27.532 --> 01:11:30.699
But a very good one, not silly at all.

01:11:31.758 --> 01:11:34.212
- [Woman] Hi, I have two quick questions

01:11:34.212 --> 01:11:36.453
The first one is will you be covering

01:11:36.453 --> 01:11:39.094
in the following lectures
what some refer to

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:42.208
as the epidemic of vitamin D deficiencies?

01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.905
And my second question is

01:11:43.905 --> 01:11:47.140
how has skin pigmentation
evolved independently

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.648
from other phenotypes if
melanin is responsible

01:11:49.648 --> 01:11:51.477
for the color of not only skin

01:11:51.477 --> 01:11:53.229
but our eyes and our hair color?

01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:56.440
- The first question is easy, yes,

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.457
I will be talking at length
about vitamin D deficiency.

01:12:00.457 --> 01:12:04.447
What's interesting about
the melanin systems

01:12:04.447 --> 01:12:06.751
in, you know, in the hair and eyes

01:12:06.751 --> 01:12:10.918
is that they are not under
as strong natural selection.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:16.313
It's important to have hair on the head.

01:12:16.313 --> 01:12:19.008
We know that the hair
on the head, scalp hair,

01:12:19.008 --> 01:12:23.228
does serve an important
thermoregulatory function

01:12:23.228 --> 01:12:25.640
on the surface of the head,

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:29.444
but the color of the
hair probably hasn't been

01:12:29.444 --> 01:12:31.874
under strong natural selection.

01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:35.134
But, and we know also that
it seems to be controlled

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:38.717
by many fewer genes
than skin pigmentation.

01:12:39.573 --> 01:12:42.560
To make a long and interesting story short

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.555
what has happened in the
history of human dispersals

01:12:45.555 --> 01:12:48.778
is that there hasn't
been so much selection

01:12:48.778 --> 01:12:52.514
of hair color and texture or eye color

01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:55.764
but, rather, loss of genetic variation.

01:12:57.752 --> 01:13:02.357
So that when you have a
limited palette of genes

01:13:02.357 --> 01:13:05.129
and you lose some of that variation

01:13:05.129 --> 01:13:08.796
because the dispersing
populations are small

01:13:10.184 --> 01:13:13.934
then you're sort of
stuck with all dark eyes.

01:13:15.327 --> 01:13:19.205
If you look at eastern Asian populations

01:13:19.205 --> 01:13:23.893
all individuals have darkly
pigmented hair and eyes

01:13:23.893 --> 01:13:25.984
and I would venture that
that's not a product

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:29.306
of natural selection, it was an accident

01:13:29.306 --> 01:13:33.522
of small-population effect
in human dispersals.

01:13:33.522 --> 01:13:36.189
Similarly in northwestern Europe

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:41.099
where we know we have strong
population bottlenecks

01:13:41.099 --> 01:13:45.355
occurring in the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:48.464
that we have repeated genetic bottlenecks

01:13:48.464 --> 01:13:50.071
and loss of variation.

01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:53.974
So we might get some really
interesting variations

01:13:53.974 --> 01:13:57.807
being thrown up in hair
color and in eye color

01:13:58.688 --> 01:14:03.106
but this isn't, it
hasn't been selected for.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:07.207
Initially it is there because
of a small-population effect,

01:14:07.207 --> 01:14:09.790
I would venture, and then later

01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:15.033
it may become acted upon by
natural or by social selection.

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:20.888
We do have evidence for
social and sexual selection

01:14:22.675 --> 01:14:27.040
of certain of these traits
in certain populations.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.912
But I think it's really
important that we look carefully

01:14:29.912 --> 01:14:33.745
at the range of genetic
and population factors

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.640
that are occurring and the
sequence in which they acted,

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.905
and that we don't just say, oh, yes, yeah,

01:14:40.905 --> 01:14:43.868
blondes evolved under sexual selection.

01:14:43.868 --> 01:14:45.220
No.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.449
It was a genetic accident
probably then followed

01:14:49.449 --> 01:14:53.126
by some social and sexual selection.

01:14:53.126 --> 01:14:53.959
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:54.792
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:58.008 --> 01:14:59.682
- [Man] Two sort of questions.

01:14:59.682 --> 01:15:03.765
One, why is hair regionally
retained on the body?

01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:07.332
And a related question, not for myself,

01:15:07.332 --> 01:15:09.530
but for those in the
audience who might care,

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:11.657
is there a selective
advantage or disadvantage

01:15:11.657 --> 01:15:13.327
to male pattern baldness?

01:15:13.327 --> 01:15:17.160
- (laughs) A common question.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:22.020
Usually put to me by people
with less scalp hair.

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.998
In answer to your first question,

01:15:23.998 --> 01:15:27.270
this is a really good question.

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:30.056
Answers to why did we retain

01:15:30.056 --> 01:15:32.866
these regional accumulations of hair

01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:36.556
and in addition to pubic
hair, and axillary hair,

01:15:36.556 --> 01:15:40.667
and scalp hair, why do
men have facial hair?

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:43.746
The jury is still out, to be generous,

01:15:43.746 --> 01:15:44.900
on most of these things.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.522
I think scalp hair we
can make a strong case

01:15:47.522 --> 01:15:51.817
for the fact that it does
locally protect the scalp

01:15:51.817 --> 01:15:55.136
from solar radiation and overheating,

01:15:55.136 --> 01:15:57.460
and that is allows sort of a,

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.360
a space in which the skin
can sweat and lose heat.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.153
So I think that's important.

01:16:04.153 --> 01:16:06.640
With pubic and axillary hair,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.807
I think the primary function
is dispersal of pheromones,

01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:16.017
because the apocrine glands
that are concentrated there

01:16:17.109 --> 01:16:19.987
secrete important molecules

01:16:19.987 --> 01:16:22.786
that are used in chemical communication.

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:26.504
We do our level best
to silence them, right,

01:16:26.504 --> 01:16:29.683
in modern societies, and
we consider it antisocial

01:16:29.683 --> 01:16:32.175
when we can smell somebody,

01:16:32.175 --> 01:16:36.342
but smell is part of our
armamentarium of communication

01:16:37.557 --> 01:16:39.150
and this has been very important.

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:43.728
We know that it still is
important in sexual attractiveness

01:16:43.728 --> 01:16:48.122
even though we do our very
best to eliminate smells.

01:16:48.122 --> 01:16:52.289
So I think this is a fascinating
and still ill-studied area.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.421
With beard hair there has been a lot

01:16:56.421 --> 01:17:00.588
of interesting recent work
on beards as sexual signals,

01:17:02.606 --> 01:17:06.023
as signals of male maturity and male age.

01:17:07.867 --> 01:17:12.597
Because the beard changes
color generally more rapidly

01:17:12.597 --> 01:17:15.104
than other parts of body hair.

01:17:15.104 --> 01:17:18.252
And so not only does the
fullness of the male beard

01:17:18.252 --> 01:17:21.252
indicate sort of a fully mature male

01:17:23.659 --> 01:17:27.066
but also the change of
color can be a very accurate

01:17:27.066 --> 01:17:30.146
chronological indicator of male age,

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:33.896
and that may have been
important in the past.

01:17:35.169 --> 01:17:39.252
So these are interesting
hypotheses, all of them,

01:17:40.247 --> 01:17:42.871
that have not been tested very well.

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:47.038
There is still a huge amount
of work to be done on hair.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.511
- [Woman] Your very
interesting hairy timeline

01:17:51.511 --> 01:17:55.753
at the beginning showed
a rather rapid loss

01:17:55.753 --> 01:17:57.773
of hair in the middle.

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:02.334
Is it real, and if so, what
do you think caused it?

01:18:02.334 --> 01:18:05.658
- Yes, well, that, the rapid loss of hair

01:18:05.658 --> 01:18:08.395
was probably fairly rapid.

01:18:08.395 --> 01:18:12.087
For this we really need to
look to the paleontologists

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.585
and look at the transition

01:18:13.585 --> 01:18:16.335
from sort of an Australopithecine

01:18:17.778 --> 01:18:19.945
to a modern Homo skeleton.

01:18:21.568 --> 01:18:23.950
That occurred over the course

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:26.700
of probably a half million years.

01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:32.030
So, you know, I can't
really say how quickly

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:34.897
the change in skin would've occurred,

01:18:34.897 --> 01:18:38.314
but certainly going along with a skeleton

01:18:39.162 --> 01:18:42.830
that is fit for walking and running

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.012
we know that there
would have been build-up

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:48.795
of excess body heat under
hot environmental conditions,

01:18:48.795 --> 01:18:51.064
and if the only physiological mechanisms

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:54.978
available to you are from
the surface of the body

01:18:54.978 --> 01:18:57.715
through radiant and evaporative heat loss

01:18:57.715 --> 01:19:00.697
there would've been
strong natural selection

01:19:00.697 --> 01:19:04.609
for complete loss of functional body hair.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:08.496
And so I would guess that
transition was quite rapid,

01:19:08.496 --> 01:19:10.774
and that little sort of signaling

01:19:10.774 --> 01:19:13.937
and evolutionary developmental biology

01:19:13.937 --> 01:19:17.571
toward increased differentiation
of eccrine sweat glands,

01:19:17.571 --> 01:19:21.790
I think the switch was thrown and probably

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.040
the genetic architecture of that change

01:19:25.972 --> 01:19:28.972
was under strong positive selection.

01:19:31.029 --> 01:19:32.945
- [Woman] I have a very young niece,

01:19:32.945 --> 01:19:35.555
who just had kidney transplant.

01:19:35.555 --> 01:19:37.805
She's of Scottish heritage.

01:19:39.557 --> 01:19:42.284
They've said people who've
had kidney transplants,

01:19:42.284 --> 01:19:44.113
of course they're taking
immune suppressants

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:46.739
and the doctors are really dismayed

01:19:46.739 --> 01:19:50.685
that oftentimes they'll get
skin cancer within five years.

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.356
So I was just wondering,

01:19:52.356 --> 01:19:55.606
shouldn't they all be taking vitamin D?

01:19:56.943 --> 01:19:59.231
- This is a really good question

01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:00.648
and I talk a lot

01:20:02.176 --> 01:20:06.651
to nephrologists and
kidney transplant surgeons

01:20:06.651 --> 01:20:08.264
all around the world about this

01:20:08.264 --> 01:20:11.681
because it is one of the major challenges

01:20:14.592 --> 01:20:17.503
to keep people healthy
with respect to vitamin D.

01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:22.303
In the case of your relative
with lightly pigmented skin

01:20:22.303 --> 01:20:26.866
it is really important that
she stay out of the sun.

01:20:26.866 --> 01:20:29.457
So I would say that she needs to talk

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:32.874
to her physicians quickly and efficiently

01:20:34.257 --> 01:20:38.304
about what program of
vitamin D supplementation

01:20:38.304 --> 01:20:40.726
she should take to stay healthy

01:20:40.726 --> 01:20:45.374
because the majority of,
or, I should say many,

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:48.520
if not the majority of
kidney transplant patients

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:51.020
are badly vitamin D deficient.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.806
- [Woman] And what about folate,

01:20:54.806 --> 01:20:56.338
or is that a totally different issue?

01:20:56.338 --> 01:20:57.737
- Folate is a completely different story

01:20:57.737 --> 01:20:59.436
and folate is, you know,

01:20:59.436 --> 01:21:01.819
you can get it really, really easily.

01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:04.764
There are no easy dietary
sources of vitamin D

01:21:04.764 --> 01:21:08.324
unless you really seek out mackerel

01:21:08.324 --> 01:21:11.491
and other specific kinds of oily fish.

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:16.173
But folate you can get from
green leafy vegetables,

01:21:16.173 --> 01:21:19.738
mostly of any kind, citrus
fruits, whole grains.

01:21:19.738 --> 01:21:22.164
You can get folate from
a variety of sources,

01:21:22.164 --> 01:21:24.029
so it's easy to top up on folate.

01:21:24.029 --> 01:21:26.477
Less easy to top up on vitamin D.

01:21:26.477 --> 01:21:27.812
- [Woman] So, then, supplements.

01:21:27.812 --> 01:21:31.535
- Yes a supplement but
talk to the physicians

01:21:31.535 --> 01:21:34.117
to determine the dosage.

01:21:34.117 --> 01:21:36.291
- Okay, well, let's thank
our speaker once again,

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:37.753
and thanks very much for coming.

01:21:37.753 --> 01:21:39.544
- Thank you, thanks very much.

01:21:39.544 --> 01:21:42.211
(upbeat music)
