00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.620
This is the aftermath of California's
deadliest and most destructive wildfire.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.780
85 people died here in a fire that PG&amp;E,
the country's largest utility,

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.380
is suspected of starting. Now,
PG&amp;E has filed for bankruptcy,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.230
which pauses any lawsuits
brought by survivors.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
And that means those who've lost
everything might get nothing at all.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.840
This is a story about a
deadly catastrophe ...

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.960
- Please, dear God, don't let me die. ...

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
and what happens when the government
puts the interests of a corporation over

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:30.484
people.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.400
This is what used to be my home.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.060
My husband and I moved
in here over a year ago.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.320
Though months have passed since
the Camp Fire destroyed Paradise,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.370
survivors like Jeana Darby are still
searching for anything they're able to

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:49.950
recover.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.900
I'm very hopeful that they find my rings.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.160
I have an antique ring that was gifted
to me when I graduated high school,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.620
and a ring that my mother made from the
diamonds from her wedding ring to my dad.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.220
Pacific Gas and Electric, or PG&amp;E,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.820
has admitted that its equipment was
probably the cause of the Camp Fire.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.540
An employee reportedly spotted flames
at a utility tower in the area,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
the same location that CAL FIRE,
which is investigating the blaze,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.060
has identified as the start of it all.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920
That tower is part of a century-old
high-voltage transmission line that PG&amp;E

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.640
knew was a safety hazard and intended
to overhaul for five years, but didn't.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.710
And that's the fundamental problem.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.690
PG&amp;E is a privately owned corporation
that answers to its shareholders and Wall

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.300
Street lenders, not members of the
public. Like 17-year-old Katya,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.100
whose home was completely
destroyed in the Camp Fire.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.740
That was my grammy's house.
That was never supposed to change.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.880
That was always supposed to be the same.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.040
It was the one thing that stayed the same throughout my entire childhood. And now it's gone.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.540
On the morning of the fire,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.980
Katya was house-sitting for a friend
when she woke up to intense smoke.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490
The next thing she knew, firefighters
were throwing her in the back of a truck.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.560
Yeah, it was [so] pitch black that you
could not see through any of the smoke.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.380
There was fire everywhere,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.120
and we pulled up onto this bridge
and the fireman said, "Get out."

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.760
Katya jumped into this river with 14
others and took shelter for several hours

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.690
as flames surrounded her.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.150
I couldn't do anything except for scream.
It was just looking around.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.750
It was just,
I thought I was gonna die.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.330
All of this was on fire.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.300
Even the leaves on the water were burning.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.460
Everything was just so intensely hot,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.560
and at one point I just kind of leaned
back in the water and I just floated out

00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:50.480
over there and I just kind of said,
OK,

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.200
if this is how it happens and this is
how you want to take me, I'm ready.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
So who do you blame?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.080
I know that someone is at fault,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.240
and I would like to say that it's most
likely PG&amp;E's negligence that caused

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.960
this. But I don't like to be like, oh,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.980
let's get angry at the PG&amp;E guys
because they started this. It's like,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.400
I'm sorry,
but they work for a bigger corporation.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.880
You're talking about how it's unfair to
attack the PG&amp;E workers who are up there

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.560
trying to fix things.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.900
But what about the giant
corporation that's worth billions?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.560
Take responsibility,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.200
take ownership and help those
people that you have hurt.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.800
That's the least that you
can do in all of this.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
And [of] all the mistakes you've made,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.940
you can at least make some right. And they've made it
very clear that they won't.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.150
In the next town over,

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:50.170
California Governor Gavin Newsom met
with children displaced by the Camp Fire.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.220
He was elected just days before the fire.
And during his campaign,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.280
he accepted over $200,000 from PG&amp;E.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.420
There's a growing demand among ratepayers
that I've spoken to that PG&amp;E be truly

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.320
publicly owned. Is that something
you'll support as governor?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.240
Truly publicly owned â€“ right now,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.500
we're just trying to figure out
how to deal with the immediacy,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.580
which is the need to
make sure we have safe,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.160
affordable and reliable service.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.880
Make sure we get through this bankruptcy
in a way that protects ratepayers,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.440
protects the victims.
Make sure the victims are made whole.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.600
How will you hold them accountable if
they're found responsible for the Camp Fire?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.860
Well, they're going to be held
accountable by the letter of the law.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.140
We're going to hold them to account.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.840
We're going to hold them to account to
make sure that the victims are made whole.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.820
We're going to hold them [to] account
to make sure they're doing everything to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.020
mitigate against any future disasters.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
But PG&amp;E was already on
criminal probation. In 2010,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.920
a PG&amp;E gas line exploded
and killed eight people.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.780
The company was convicted on six criminal
charges and fined $1.6 billion by the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.540
state for failing to
maintain its pipeline system.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.640
From 2014 to 2017,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.520
PG&amp;E power lines and equipment were
responsible for sparking 1,500 wildfires

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.060
across California. Then, in 2018,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.580
the California state legislature passed
a bill allowing PG&amp;E to pass the costs

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.480
of the 2017 fires to its customers. Three
months later, the Camp Fire happened.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.360
Several things went wrong
before the Camp Fire broke out.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.220
A big issue is that power lines in wooded
areas like Paradise tend to get caught

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.260
on trees. And PG&amp;E,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.780
which services 70,000 square
miles across California,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.900
insists it doesn't have the manpower
required to trim all the trees.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.680
But what they could have done is shut
off power to customers as a safety

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.120
precaution. In fact, they even said they
would. Two days before the Camp Fire,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.960
PG&amp;E warned customers that they might
shut off power. But they didn't,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.290
even though it appears that all of the
factors for a shutoff were at play.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.060
In an email, PG&amp;E told me the conditions
that day did not meet their criteria,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.953
but declined to elaborate.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.720
We're in the middle of reporting on this
PG&amp;E story and we heard about another

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.400
gas explosion that just
occurred in San Francisco.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.920
So we're on the way to
check out the scene.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.660
The initial reports indicate that this
was a third-party dig-in related to a

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.700
construction project,
and not in any way associated with PG&amp;E.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.320
But until PG&amp;E turns off the gas,
the fire can't be put out.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.100
And they have a reputation for being slow.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.660
Well, during the last explosion in 2017,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.220
it took PG&amp;E three hours to turn off
the gas. Do you think that's acceptable?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.191
As I mentioned,

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:37.191
our number-one priority is the safety
of the public and the customers we serve

00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:41.250
in our communities. So we're going to
work as hard as possible, as safely,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.560
as quickly as possible,
to get this situation resolved.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.060
You agree it should be turned off ASAP?

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.040
I definitely agree that we will
work as quickly as possible,

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.530
do everything we can to ensure
the safety of our customers,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.000
San Francisco residents.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.560
It's been over two hours since the gas
explosion and we just heard a press

00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:01.561
conference during which the PG&amp;E spokesman
really had no information to offer,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.680
other than the fact that
this was not caused by PG&amp;E.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.010
But he couldn't tell us when the gas line
would be cut. And until that happens,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.900
this is still a very active situation.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.000
In the end, no one was hurt, but
five buildings were destroyed.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.980
PG&amp;E claims all of its lines were
properly marked before a crew working for

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.280
Verizon started digging underground.
But in 2018,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.400
an investigation by the California
Public Utilities Commission,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.460
the state agency responsible
for regulating PG&amp;E,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.020
found the company falsified internal
records on gas pipeline safety over a

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.960
five-year period.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.100
We, the people of
California, find PG&amp;E ...

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.220
guilty on the charge of murder,
arson, perjury, manslaughter.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.120
At a CPUC meeting held days
after PG&amp;E declared bankruptcy,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.060
ratepayers blasted the agency for
approving PG&amp;E's request to borrow $6.1

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.040
billion from the state.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.720
The CPUC has come under fire for what
critics say is the agency's refusal to

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.520
make PG&amp;E put safety over profits,

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:04.180
and for its cozy relationship with
the multibillion-dollar corporation.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.560
Let me just say, you were talking
about how can you correct the market?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.640
You can correct it by democratizing it.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.660
I'm here in support today for a
state buyout of PG&amp;E, over a bailout.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.660
If the plan is structured in such a
way as to prioritize paying off the big

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.520
investors and the big companies first,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.980
and not the survivors,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.960
then this is, I think,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.320
a terrible insult to the memories
of the dead and to the survivors.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.600
Protesters like Seth Sanders believe
that because PG&amp;E is providing a public

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.100
service,
the company should in fact be public.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.500
There is no reason that the state can't
just buy PG&amp;E over the next year and

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.820
make sure that it truly serves Californians.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.460
Why do you think they wouldn't?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.760
So if you look at who
is on the CPUC board,

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.180
and you look at who's worked for energy
companies, there's a lot of overlap.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.950
You can't just pay your friends,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.930
you can't just pay your
already super-rich investors.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.660
You have to take care of the people first.
Who do you blame for this tragedy?

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.040
I blame the big corporations. The Big Oil,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.220
the utilities,
along with the fossil fuel industry,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.100
have been lying to us and covering
it up for the last 30 years.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.240
PG&amp;E does not have the right
to kill people for profit.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.520
After repeated requests, the CPUC,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.320
PG&amp;E and Governor Newsom's office all
declined my requests for an interview,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.070
but I still had questions.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.260
I'm at PG&amp;E's headquarters,

00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:50.900
and I've asked them several times
for an interview before this.

00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:53.300
They won't give it to me.
But I still want to know,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.150
why didn't they turn off the
power on the day of the fire,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.950
and why did this
multibillion-dollar corporation
keep delaying necessary repairs

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.410
on a transmission line
near Paradise for years?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.593
Hi, how are you?

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.420
I'm here to see Blair Jones,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.200
your spokesman. We've been in touch
over email. PG&amp;E spokesman Blair Jones.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:28.820
Sir, stop the camera. You can come in and ask the lady right there.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.360
These are my colleagues. They're going to come in with me.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.860
They have to stay for a while, because they have a camera. They're not allowed in with the camera.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.200
PG&amp;E would not let me speak with anyone.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.100
Their security gave me a business
card and showed me the door.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.900
OK, thank you.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.820
The Camp Fire had catastrophic
effects on the environment. For weeks,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.190
toxic air choked parts
of northern California,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.080
and at points we were dealing with
the worst air quality in the world.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.700
On the same day of the Camp Fire, the
Woolsey Fire scorched southern California.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:05.020
Oh my God, please dear God, don't let me
die. Please dear God, don't let me die.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.620
Please dear God,
let me get out of this.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.120
Please, please.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.230
In the face of growing climate change,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.900
which PG&amp;E points to as a culprit in the wildfires,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.200
I wanted to know what can be done
to prevent such catastrophes.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.300
Mark Jacobson is an expert in renewable
energy and is consulting on the Green New Deal.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.340
How much is climate change a factor,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.080
when you look at the magnitude of the
fires California has been having lately?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.220
Climate change is definitely a factor
in intensifying fires and even allowing

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.340
some of them to occur or to spread.
We have to address global warming,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.460
certainly on a large scale.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.120
And the way to do that is to transition
to clean and renewable energy for all purposes.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.940
So if you were tasked with helping to
rebuild Paradise and set up the energy

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.200
there, what would you be doing?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.200
I would make it so it's a completely
electric-efficient community running

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.600
primarily on solar and wind. In
California, there's a law that by 2020,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.240
all new homes have to be zero net energy.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.320
They have to basically produce as much
energy as they consume in the annual average.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.460
It could take up to a
decade to rebuild Paradise.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.720
PG&amp;E has stressed it'll do more safety
shutoffs as part of a new wildfire prevention plan.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.080
Its CEO has stepped down with
a payout of $2.5 million.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.910
The company is also trying to give
out $235 million in bonuses this year,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.230
all while the Camp Fire survivors are
waiting to see what they'll receive.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.350
And as wildfires become the norm in California,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.680
the state has yet to hold the corporation
accountable to the public it serves.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.391
There is somebody up there in the chain
of command making these decisions and

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:44.980
being totally fine with it,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.250
but at least take ownership for the fact
that you provided the service and it

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.120
ended up hurting thousands.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.120
Hey guys, it's Dena here at PG&amp;E's headquarters.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.530
Thanks for watching this episode about
how corporate negligence can kill people.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.200
Let me know what you think
