MALE SPEAKER: Thank you all for
stopping by to another Talks

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.870
at Google presentation.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.770
This afternoon's talk is
with Marcelo Gleiser, who

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.490
is a Professor of Physics and
Astronomy at Dartmouth College,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.260
and he's made
numerous contributions

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.820
to research and science
in the popular eye.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.230
His contributions to
physics and cosmology

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310
include being the
co-discoverer of oscillons,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.810
and of the publishing
of numerous articles.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.580
And his research and his
books have actually wound up

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.310
in the publishing of four books,
including "A Tear at the Edge

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.980
of Creation" and "The
Dancing Universe."

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.610
Today he speaks to us on
"The Island of Knowledge,"

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.590
which blends science
and philosophy

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.580
to trace our search
for the answers

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.620
to life's fundamental questions.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.780
And we'll have some time
for Q and A at the end.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.460
So please join me in welcoming
Professor Gleiser to campus.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.960
Thank you.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:58.450
MARCELO GLEISER: All right.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.330
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.720
I have been told that there
are about 4,000 other people

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.100
from Google watching remotely
so it's really awesome.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.350
Thank you very much, guys,
for being there for me.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.570
You know, it's really great.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.250
And the other thing
which I wanted

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.890
to make a remark, which you
guys may or may not know,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.570
that there is this real hot
debate going on in academia

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.160
right now about should students
take laptops to class or not.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.260
It's a big one, you know?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.370
And it's a complicated question,
actually, to deal with.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.430
So what I want to talk
about today-- and my plan

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.410
is to talk for maybe
30 minutes or so,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.770
so we have time for questions,
which is, to me at least,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.780
the more fun part.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.460
I will talk about ideas from
my last book-- latest book.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.490
Hopefully not the last book--
on really big questions.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.990
OK?

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.860
So this book is dealing
with what is reality

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.380
and how can you tell.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.430
And because reality is so much
related to the nature of truth,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.740
really the book relates
how we can figure out truth

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.520
and does science
actually lead you

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.520
towards that kind of big
T formulation of what

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.199
we know in the world.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.620
And the answer is
kind of humbling.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.140
So what this is, is an exercise
on how science actually works.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.750
You know, it's what philosophers
like to call epistemology.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.170
How do we acquire
knowledge of reality?

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.250
And so the first fundamental
point is the following.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.310
How do we know that you're here?

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460
How do you know this
is happening right now?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.820
Well, you know, you have these
amazing sensor apparatus,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.320
right?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.280
You have your eyes,
and you have your ears

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.500
so your organs are
picking up the information

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.130
from the environment, right?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.240
And they are bringing this
information into your brain.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.470
And your brain is
this amazing thing

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.070
that can integrate all
this sensor information

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.590
and construct this
cognitive image

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.920
and impression of
what reality is.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.280
So what we call reality-- at
least from a more immediate

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.190
way, as humans-- is this sum
total of the sensor integration

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.450
that is happening in
your brain, right?

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.210
And, of course, the point
is that that is really

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.170
not all of reality at all.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.420
That's just a tiny
little fraction

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.370
of what reality is about.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.800
And what else is going on?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.050
Well, you know that
right now there

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.810
are tons of electromagnetic
waves going to this room.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.500
You know, all the FM and AM
radio stations from the areas

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.510
around here.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.720
You have ultraviolet
radiation from these lights.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.170
You have infrared radiation
that you guys are beaming out,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.570
because we're all
warm bodies and when

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.390
you're a warm body at about
98 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.330
you're beaming
infrared radiation.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.020
But all these things
you cannot see.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.880
But the fact that
you can't see it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.340
doesn't make it
less real, right?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.340
So in a very concrete
sense, science

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.360
is an effort to amplify
the way we see reality.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.860
Right?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.730
There's this little line
from "The Little Prince"

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.630
where the fox is talking
to the Little Prince

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.330
and says that what's invisible
is essential to the eye.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.380
And essentially
science is trying

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.120
to uncover-- at least
modern science-- is

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.360
trying to uncover
this invisible.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.750
Kind of opening our eyes to
what's going on out there.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.040
So I wanted to kind
of set the mood

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.280
with a quote from the master
himself, from Albert Einstein,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.626
and I see there is a
Google equals mc squared

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.000
over there, which
is really cool.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.380
I had to take a picture of
that to show my students.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.520
But what he says is the
following, "What I see nature

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.110
is a magnificent structure that
we can comprehend only very

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.340
imperfectly, and that
must fill a thinking

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.170
person with a
feeling of humility."

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.320
And what he is
trying to say there

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.240
is almost against
what he believed.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.740
Right?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.390
So Einstein was a
realist so he thought

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.820
that there is order in
nature and that there

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.200
is some sort of pattern that
we can uncover with our minds.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.440
And it's just a matter
of working hard at it,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.770
and you can figure things out.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.570
That nature-- as
you probably heard

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.700
before-- he is famous for saying
that God doesn't play dice.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.610
He wasn't talking
about any real God.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.370
It was meant nature
cannot be random,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.160
cannot be unpredictable.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.730
There has to be a fundamental
order underneath everything.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.460
And yet, he also recognized
that as humans we

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.731
can only go so far in
understanding the world.

00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:25.230
Right?

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.870
And so, in that sense, you can
understand things imperfectly,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.530
and you should have really a
feeling of humility, meaning

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.870
you should be humble to
understand that you really

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.171
don't know.

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.670
There's another
quote from Einstein,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.670
which I think is relevant
in this context, which

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.630
is this one.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.670
"The first thing we can
experience is the mysterious.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.410
It is the fundamental
emotion which

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.570
stands at the cradle of
true art and science.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.300
He who does not know it
and can no longer wonder,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.970
is as good as dead."

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.330
So basically what he's
saying is, wake up, people.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.280
There is all this awesome
unknown stuff out there.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.310
What he calls the
"mystery," what's

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.350
out there in nature
that we do not know.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.136
And if you're not excited by
trying to figure that out,

00:06:06.136 --> 00:06:07.260
then you're just not alive.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.760
You know?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.980
That's just not happening.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.760
And furthermore, it is this
kind of seductive power

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.660
that we have to this mystery,
to what we want to figure out,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.710
that is the creative
engine behind so much art

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.990
and so much science.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.670
So he's bringing this
sort of human urge

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.770
to understand into this
big umbrella, right?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.030
Putting all our creative output,
be it artistic or scientific,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.510
under this big
umbrella, which is

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.760
this engagement
with the unknown,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.936
with the mysterious, which is a
very interesting position which

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:39.435
I share.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.210
And then we have this picture
here of the fish in the bowl.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.600
so here's the little fish,
and we-- at least when

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.760
I look at it, I go, to me
it's a beautiful picture.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.504
But it's also kind
of sad, right?

00:06:49.504 --> 00:06:52.170
Because you look at the fish and
say, poor little guy, you know?

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.690
His universe is so confined.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.190
Right?

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.430
He is in that little bowl.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.670
That's all he sees.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.960
I mean, he can kind of
glimpse through the glass

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.640
and there is some
stuff out there,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.720
but he can never get to it.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.620
Much better to be the
photographer, right?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.010
To be the guy on the
outside that can actually

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.940
take that picture and see the
sunset and understand that,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.790
hey, my reality is much
richer than that of the fish.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.740
And the point I'm going to make
is it's not really, you know?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.740
That our reality is kind of
exactly like that of the fish.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.990
And so when we go
conceive the world

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.590
and understand what
is the world like,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.940
you have to be very
careful to measure where

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.120
you want to take this statement
this is what reality is about.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.030
There is such a thing
as a fundamental reality

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.280
that we try to uncover.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.030
And I speak to this being a
theoretical physicist that

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.890
works in cosmology and high
energy physics, which is really

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.650
of the big bang and black
holes and Higgs particle.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.610
That's the kind of
stuff I do, and I

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.820
will be happy to answer
questions about that later on.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.185
But it's important to
understand that when

00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:02.950
we try to push the
boundaries of knowledge,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.770
we are always going to
hit a certain wall, which

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.820
is the wall of what we can do
to understand what's going on.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.030
And furthermore-- and
here I quote Heisenberg,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.636
who is one of the architects
of quantum physics--

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:18.010
he says something
very important.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.720
He says, "what we observe
is not nature itself

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.070
but it's nature exposed to
our method of questioning."

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.960
And that's really interesting,
because what he's telling here

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.700
is that there is only a human
way of understanding things.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.150
There is no universal way
of understanding things.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.809
That kinds of rubs
against our notion

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.750
that there is such a thing
as some universal truth

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.539
out there, right?

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.510
That we should be able
to get to that and that

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.320
is beyond the human frame.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.700
So that if an alien intelligence
can do physics or chemistry,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.160
they are going to come up with
laws of nature which are just

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.290
like our laws of nature, right?

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.270
And what he is saying
here is something

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.832
like, perhaps the content
of those laws is similar,

00:09:06.832 --> 00:09:08.540
but the way they're
going to be expressed

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.820
as completely different.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.140
There is a very human way
of probing reality, right?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.800
That we are animals that
evolved in a very specific set

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.080
of circumstances.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.600
We have a star, about 150
million miles from us,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.310
and it has a temperature--
a surface temperature--

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.770
of about 6,000 degrees
Celsius, which makes it glow

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.470
white-ish yellow.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.070
And so any form of
light-- of life, sorry.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.840
Any form of life that
evolved in this planet

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.890
had to maximize the way it
could capture this radiation,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.950
and hence we and most
of the animals around us

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.160
can see in this
very tiny window all

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.810
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, which

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.400
is what we call
the visible, right?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.870
From the red to
the violet, right?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.050
And that makes sense, because
if you could see in radio waves

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.650
or in microwaves, you know,
when a tiger comes to you,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.230
you're going to be eaten.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.740
So it doesn't really
work very well

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.150
from a survival perspective.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.490
So it's no wonder that our
eyes can capture the most power

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.860
output that the sun can put out.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.130
And so when we try to put
these things in context,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.890
we want to understand what
is science trying to do.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.112
And there is this philosopher
from the 17th century, which

00:10:28.112 --> 00:10:30.195
is really an awesome guy,
called Bernard Le Bovier

00:10:30.195 --> 00:10:30.778
de Fontenelle.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.532
So the same year that Newton
published his "Principia,"

00:10:35.532 --> 00:10:37.990
which is the book that changed
the wall, in a sense, right?

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.525
It was the book where the laws
of motion, the law of gravity,

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:42.025
was written.

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:45.870
In 1686, this French
philosopher wrote a book

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.865
on the possibility of
life in other planets.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.460
And it is a really
interesting book,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.500
because it's constructed as
a dialogue sort of inspired

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.710
by Plato.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.650
But in that book he
has two characters.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.200
He has the philosopher,
which is himself,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.650
and a co-protagonist which is a
woman-- who is a woman-- which

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.100
is a very, very rare thing
in the 17th century, who

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.920
is much smarter than
he is in a sense

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.980
that she has this sort wit.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.680
And there is this
dialogue between them

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.530
in which she is always
questioning his assumptions

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.380
from a natural
philosophical, which

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.599
is the old name for a
science perspective.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.140
And this guy says
the following, this

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.090
is how he summarizes the problem
with trying to figure things

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.420
out from a scientific
perspective, OK?

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.280
So he says, "all philosophy
is based on two things only:

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.480
curiosity and poor eyesight."

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.120
Right?

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.536
And I think that's
just brilliant,

00:11:39.536 --> 00:11:41.240
because that is exactly right.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.690
I mean, we are super curious.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.580
We want to understand things
the best possible way.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.750
More and more, right?

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.570
More information--
you guys know this

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.230
better than I do how
hungry people are

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.600
all the time for more
and more information.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.040
And yet, we are myopic, right?

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.730
I mean, there is only so
much we can see, right?

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.990
And there is a tension here
about wanting to know a lot

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.486
and not be able to everything.

00:12:03.486 --> 00:12:08.410
And from this creative tension
comes the output from science,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.640
right?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.520
So this poor eyesight
also has to do

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.310
with our perspective of
what reality is like.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.770
So now I switch gears and
I go back to 400 years

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.170
or so before Christ
to Plato's cave.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.670
OK?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.030
So Plato, in his "Republic"--
in book seven of "Republic"--

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.710
he wrote something called the
allegory of the cave, which

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:36.540
is absolutely a brilliant kind
of way of thinking about what

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.650
is the nature of reality
and how can we know?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.150
OK?

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.490
And the notion is about
more or less the following.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.500
Let's imagine that we
are inside a cave, OK?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.400
And you guys are the
slaves, because that's

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.860
how Plato framed the stuff.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.700
And the slaves were born
chained in such a way

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.050
that all they could
do is look forward.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.550
OK?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.135
So all you could
do is look forward

00:12:57.135 --> 00:13:00.640
to what's being projected on
the cave wall in front of you.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.140
Right?

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.130
So for these slaves, reality
was what they could see in there

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.550
and on this cave wall.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.740
That was reality.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.425
Now, they didn't know
that behind them there

00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:12.630
was this big, big fire.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.780
A roaring fire, and a
bunch of philosophers

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.200
are holding stuff up, right?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.310
And the projection-- the
shadows from these objects

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.140
were being projected
on the wall, right?

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.730
And what the slaves saw
was just a projection.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.560
So they would say,
like, you know, yeah,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.420
this is like one shape.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.730
When they have no idea
that the true shape is

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.760
like a rectangle, so to speak.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.960
And so here's a
variation on that

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.320
is when Neo visits
Plato's cave, right?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.280
Neo from "The Matrix," right?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.010
And as you probably know--
if you don't you probably

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.340
couldn't get a job here, right?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.280
So in "The Matrix,"
people thought

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.760
they would be seeing
reality, but they

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.510
weren't seeing reality, right?

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.260
So here goes Neo
to Plato's cave--

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.220
there is Keanu Reeves
with his machine gun--

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.900
and the guy next to him
says, "It is prophesied

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.170
that one day a
chosen one among us

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.070
will break free of
this world and reveal

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.040
to us the true
nature of reality."

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.580
Right?

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.720
And he says, "No way." and you
see there the slaves there,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.330
right?

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.380
And what do they see?

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.170
They see a unicorn
pooping, right?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.530
And they said, wow,
unicorns exist.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.250
And they defecate
just like we do.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.920
And what's really
going on is there

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.090
is that naughty philosopher
behind there making little hand

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.660
signs with his fingers and
projecting these things

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.400
onto the wall totally fooling
the slaves into believing

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.230
something that is not real.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.730
Right?

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.970
So the question is,
OK, who are we here?

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.480
You know, how much can
we see of the world

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.250
and be comfortable with the
notion of reality, right?

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.240
So now we go down to
science, and I broke this

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.660
into three parts.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.570
So three kinds of realities.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.240
The cosmic reality of the
universe, material reality,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.140
what is stuff made of,
and cognitive reality.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.480
How do we figure things
out with our minds?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.060
OK?

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.480
So to set the tone,
let me introduce

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.040
to the wonderful things called
scientific instruments that you

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.886
all know about, of course, which
are called reality amplifiers.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.870
And why do I call them
reality amplifiers?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.680
Well, because they
reveal invisible worlds.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.050
Stuff that we cannot see with
our eyes and hear, et cetera.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.370
And they tell you
things about the world

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.660
that you didn't know before.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.710
So to give a very specific
example, the microscope.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.830
So the microscope was invented
in the late 1600s, right?

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:48.900
Now, the conception of what
life is before the microscope

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.530
and after the microscope is
profoundly different, because

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.460
before the microscope
living things

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.250
were things you
could see, right?

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.530
And after the microscope, you
look into a drop of water,

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.670
and you see all these
"invisible" creatures

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.420
what were alive.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.455
So all sorts of new questions
like, how small can life be?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.450
Is there a limit to how
small it can be, and are

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.240
these things related to us?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.190
And are these things the
things that make us sick?

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.130
So this completely new
way of thinking about life

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.240
emerged from that
single instrument.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.330
The same, obviously,
with the telescope

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.300
and with a bunch of
different detectors.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.110
I have here on the bottom
two of my favorites.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.120
So anybody knows what this is?

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.950
The Hubble Space
Telescope, right?

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.530
Which is one of the most
amazing machines ever invented.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.110
Picture this, this is a
robot telescope, right?

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.530
So it's a robotic telescope
that is orbiting very far

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.530
away from earth.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.350
It is being controlled
by remote control

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.070
here on earth by
astronomers and technicians

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.380
and taking pictures that
have never been taken before,

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.930
and that completely
change the way

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.370
we understand the universe now.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.849
And on the right-hand
side is the Atlas Detector

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.230
from the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.390
which is the machine that
discovered that Higgs, right?

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.329
And, I don't know
if you can see this,

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.380
but there is a
little person here.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.010
It is huge.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.589
It's four stories high.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.290
It has more steel than the
whole Eiffel Tower in there.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:20.869
OK?

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.940
And that's this
giant thing we used

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.160
to study the smallest
things that exists.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.410
You know, the
particles of nature.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:27.910
OK.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.090
So cosmic.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.970
Let me just-- when we're talking
about the nature of reality

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.530
and the nature of
truth, just picture

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.670
the evolution of our
understanding of the universe,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.170
right?

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.710
So when Columbus got not
quite here, but close to here

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.390
in 1492, what kind of
universe did he believe in?

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.910
They all lived in an
earth-centered universe.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.480
The earth was static,
it didn't move.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.590
There was this kind of
verticality to their existence

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.990
in which the earth
was the center,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.200
then you had all these
planets around it,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.690
and afterwards you had this
view of the fixed stars.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.390
And outside all of that
was the realm of God.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.390
So there was this verticality
in which the universe kind of

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.030
mirrored what
people believed in.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.500
And they guided their
existence based on this,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.770
and this influenced not
just the way they lived,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.190
but the way they created things.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.290
So for example,
Medieval cathedral.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.162
They are all vertical, right?

00:18:26.162 --> 00:18:27.120
They are all very high.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.040
Why?

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.040
Well, because as
you go in there,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.250
you want to look up, right?

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.090
And why?

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.400
Well, because you want to
commune with God up there,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:35.900
right?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.180
So there was, like, this
reproduction of the macro

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.260
to be human scale
in the cathedrals,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.960
and it was mirrored
in their beliefs.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.320
So things made sense, right?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.930
And this is more or less
what Aristotle proposed way

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.830
before the Catholic church.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.270
But then comes
Copernicus in 1543

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.090
and said, sorry folks, the
earth is just another planet.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.577
It is nothing special.

00:18:59.577 --> 00:19:01.285
You know, it's just
like Jupiter, Saturn.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.579
There are eight--
well, at that time

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.870
there wasn't eight because
they only knew until Saturn.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.650
But there was then Pluto,
and then Pluto is gone.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.360
Poor guy, right?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.020
Which actually shows how
shifty science is, right?

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.360
So that's part of how
things evolve, right?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.190
What we call a
planet has changed

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.670
because we understand planets so
much better than we did before

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.250
that Pluto really
falls out, in a sense.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.180
But so he shifted
the order of things

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.430
and forced people to
kind of reconsider

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.760
this whole arrangement
that they had before.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.660
And people were very
confused by this,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.590
because that centrality
of the earth-- which

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.840
seemed so intuitive, right?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.105
You walk out, and
you do see the sky is

00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:43.390
turning around us, right?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.810
I mean, so intuitively
it makes a lot of sense.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.790
But science is, in
a way, a mechanism

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.470
we have to break with all
these intuitions, which

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.230
are false intuitions, right?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.690
So we can see deeper into
the nature of things.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.682
And then you cut to
the 20th century,

00:19:58.682 --> 00:20:00.140
and now our picture
of the universe

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.445
is completely different, right?

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:02.820
This photograph--
which I'm going

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.460
to repeat because it's just one
of the most awesome photographs

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.850
ever taken in history.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.110
I'm biased, but it's true.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.110
This is from the
Hubble, and it's

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.899
called the Hubble
Deep Field picture.

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:17.940
That means the following.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.730
They pointed the telescope
at a very narrow piece of sky

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.150
and collect light for
a very long time, OK?

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.802
So they can see stuff
that is really far away.

00:20:27.802 --> 00:20:30.260
So when you look at a picture
like that, you say, oh, yeah.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.760
Color.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.030
There are some galaxies here.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.836
Where's the Milky Way?

00:20:33.836 --> 00:20:35.367
If you guys are real smart.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.700
AUDIENCE: It's not in the photo.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.825
MARCELO GLEISER: Thank you.

00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:40.932
Not in this picture, because
to photograph the Milky Way,

00:20:40.932 --> 00:20:42.360
you have to get out of it.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.300
And we can hardly get to Mar.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.690
So it's a long way, folks,
to get out of the Milky Way.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:47.580
But still.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.209
So you have galaxies
here, and then

00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:52.000
you say, oh, what about
these little stars?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.100
Well, these are not stars.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.530
They are galaxies, too.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.720
They're just
further away, right?

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.610
So each point of light
here is a galaxy as

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.430
big as these big spirals,
which are closer.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.140
And each one of these galaxies
have about 200 billion,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.460
100 billion stars, just like
our Milky Way does, right?

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.451
So we live in the Milky
Way-- just to give you

00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:13.580
a little bit of
perspective here--

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.050
which is this big mass of stars,
about 200 billion of them.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.400
The sun is one, and the sun
has eight planets, right?

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.220
And when you look
at the planets,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.380
you say, OK, that's
not the whole story.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.120
Because planets have moons.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.250
So Jupiter, for example,
has over 60 moons.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.320
So nighttime on
Jupiter must be just

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.420
awesome to look at these moons.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.350
And that tells you that
in our galaxy alone

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.870
there are trillions
of different worlds.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.880
There are trillions of
worlds, and they're all

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.680
completely different
from one another.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.430
They may be somewhat
similar in some ways,

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.420
but there are no two
identical worlds.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.600
And then you look at this
and say, damn, you know,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.660
each each one of these
things is a galaxy.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.390
Each one of these galaxies
has these billions of stars.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.270
And so the numbers are
ridiculously staggering, right?

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.490
And how do we gather
information from this?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.240
Well, from light, right?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.730
And so, for example, when
you look at the moon,

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.990
you're seeing the
moon 1.2 seconds ago,

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.300
because that's how long light
takes to go from the moon

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.060
to us.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.525
When you're looking at the
sun, it's about eight minutes.

00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:21.000
It takes about eight minutes
for light to travel to us.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.780
As you know, the speed
of light is 186,000 miles

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.180
in a second, which is
another ridiculous number.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.010
Basically it means something
like, if you blink your eye,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.830
light goes 7 and 1/2
times around the earth.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.550
So blink your eyes, 7 and
1/2 times around the earth.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.120
And it takes eight minutes for
it to come from the sun to us.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.280
And it takes 2 million years for
light to come from the closest

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.440
this galaxy, which
is Andromeda, to us.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.480
So when somebody points a
telescope and sees Andromeda,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.140
he or she is seeing Andromeda
as it was 2 million years ago.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.570
Meaning when our
ancestors were beginning

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.890
to go bipedal in Africa, right?

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.577
That's when that
light left Andromeda.

00:23:01.577 --> 00:23:03.910
So what that tells you is
that when you look at the sky,

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.790
you're looking at the past.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.200
The sky's our giant time
machine looking at the past.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.240
And parenthesis here, actually
you are seeing me in the past

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.740
as well.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.450
You see me about one billionth
of a second ago, right?

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.250
Because that's how
long light takes

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.752
to travel some of this
distance, which basically means

00:23:22.752 --> 00:23:24.085
that the present does not exist.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.970
Now is a cognitive fabrication,
because every information

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.750
we gather takes time
to get to us, right?

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.090
And what happens though is
the light is so fast compared

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.300
to how fast our
brain can process

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.100
this information that it seems
that everything is integrated

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.850
into an instant, but it really
is not in an instant, you know?

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.680
So that's something to ponder.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.300
So what does that tell you?

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.320
Well, we now know that the
universe is not just this,

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.105
but is actually expanding.

00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:57.710
The universe is a
dynamic entity so when

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.479
people talk about the
expanding universe,

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:01.520
they always imagine that
there was this big bang,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.500
there was a bomb that exploded
at the beginning of everything

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.210
and the galaxies are sort
of like shrapnel moving out.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.760
That is completely wrong.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.180
That is really not what the
expansion of the universe

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.986
is at all.

00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:13.610
The expansion of the
universe is really

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.580
an expansion of the
fabric of space itself.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.110
It's sort of like if
the floor underneath

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.080
was made of rubber, OK?

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.810
And I pushed a button here,
and as I pushed the button,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.355
it started stretching into
two dimensional directions.

00:24:27.355 --> 00:24:29.080
You have two directions here.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.876
And you'd see everybody moving
away from you, you know?

00:24:31.876 --> 00:24:34.237
You'd look around and
say, hey, man, look.

00:24:34.237 --> 00:24:35.570
Everybody's moving away from me.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.940
I am the center of
the universe, right?

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.950
And the person next
to says, sorry, dude.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.750
I am also seeing
everybody moving away

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.820
from me so I am the center.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.870
Because there is no center.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.710
This is an expansion
of space itself

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.380
that is stretching outwards
and the galaxies are basically

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.110
being taken with, sort of
like a cork floating on water,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.750
you know, in a river, right?

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.300
So that's really
what's going on.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.490
And so we now know
that this expansion

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.860
has been going for about 14
billion years-- well, 13.8

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.110
billion years.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.840
Now, you put these
two things together,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.070
that light takes time to get to
and that the expansion started

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.770
in a finite time ago,
and that tells you

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.280
that light could only travel
so far within that time.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.010
And that tells you that
you can only see stuff up

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.055
to a certain boundary.

00:25:27.055 --> 00:25:28.889
We call it the horizon.

00:25:28.889 --> 00:25:30.680
Just sort of like when
you go to the beach,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.990
you know, there is
the horizon there

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.260
where the ocean hits
this sky, right?

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.810
And you know that the
ocean doesn't end there,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.549
but that's as far
as you can see.

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:40.590
That's very nice similar.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.740
In cosmology we have this light
bubble-- the fish in the bowl--

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.170
and we are inside
this light bubble.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.220
And there may be more universe
out there-- probably there is.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.350
People talk about
multiverses right now,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.760
which is something that you
may want to ask me-- hint,

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.280
hint-- about.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.260
But you cannot see it.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.910
So it's something that
is not just unknown,

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.510
it's unknowable, right?

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.320
Which is like, wow, so
science is telling us there

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.500
are things which are not
just we will figure them out?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.760
We cannot figure them out unless
you come up with a new physics

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.017
that says that the speed
of light is not the limit,

00:26:19.017 --> 00:26:20.850
and then, you know, all
bets are off, right?

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.070
Then you can say anything.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.130
When you break the conceptual
structure of something,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.880
everything can go.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.070
So there is your first
unknowable at the cosmic scale,

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.590
right?

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.180
That we really live in
a bubble of information,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.900
which is the cosmic horizon,
and we cannot see directly

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.540
what's going on out there.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.040
OK?

00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:40.820
OK.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.260
Now, just talk about material.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.380
So what is the world made of?

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.280
This stuff, right,
that we are made of?

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.700
So we are obviously
made of atoms, right?

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.560
And you know that atoms are
made of protons, electrons,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.300
and neutrons.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.000
Where would computers be without
the electrons flowing around,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.600
right?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.620
And that stuff, this
stuff that we are made of,

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.970
and we have about
92 stable chemical

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.870
elements that we have found
and that exist, everything else

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.170
is unstable.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.430
And all of these things
came from stars, right?

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.521
So when you ask where did the
chemistry of the universe come

00:27:19.521 --> 00:27:20.020
from?

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.260
Where is the calcium and
the iron that makes me?

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.780
Where does that stuff come from?

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.880
It came from stars that
exploded a very long time ago

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.580
before the solar system formed
in about 4.5 billion years.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.550
And so when people
say we are stardust,

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.010
that is absolutely correct.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.820
We really are
literally stardust.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.310
And so we are part of this cycle
of creation and destruction

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.050
where matter becomes recycled
from hydrogen into everything

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.904
else, you know?

00:27:51.904 --> 00:27:53.320
One astronomer
once said something

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.260
that I really like
which is like, people

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.840
is what happens to hydrogen
when you wait long enough.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.140
Which is exactly right.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.120
You know, it takes a
long time for hydrogen

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.070
to be processed into
the heavier elements,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.410
and then obviously
for life to develop

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.610
from that primal,
fundamental substance.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.380
But it turns out that, you
know, this stuff-- the electrons

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.640
and protons-- make up
5% of the universe.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.180
The rest we don't
know what it is.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.680
OK?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680
We know it's there.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.984
It's sort of like you're
going to make a cake,

00:28:24.984 --> 00:28:27.150
and it tells you, look,
there are three ingredients.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.470
I know that water is one
of them, and it's about 5%.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.010
And there are two others.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.930
And one is about 23
the other is about 73,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.390
but I don't know what they are.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:38.290
So figure it out.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.790
How are you going
to make that cake?

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.500
That is how we are picturing
the cosmos today, you know?

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.000
So these two items
mystery ingredients

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.420
are called dark matter
and dark energy.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.260
And dark matter is
most probably made

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.960
of particles that have mass
but have nothing to do with us.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.775
Like protons,
electrons, or if you

00:28:58.775 --> 00:29:00.620
want to go deeper
into particle physics

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.430
quarks or Higgs or
anything like that.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.470
They are something
else, and they sort out

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.140
float around, gravitationally.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.150
They are sort of like a
cloak around the galaxies.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.050
And they are in a
factor of one to five.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.950
So they are five
times more abundant

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.590
than our stuff in galaxies.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.920
And people have
been trying to catch

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.560
these guys for
about three decades.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.280
And we haven't been
able to do that.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.620
Actually, at Berkley
there is a very big group

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.690
that has been
trying to get these.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.610
And you can't,
because right now,

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.130
if dark matter has
really made a particles,

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.720
they are going through us.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.890
You know?

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.900
They interact so weakly with
us that we don't even know.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.200
Just like there is natural
radioactivity going

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.620
from the ground going
through you right now.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.400
And even more
spectacularly, the sun,

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.470
to fuse hydrogen
into helium, produces

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.920
particles called
neutrinos, right?

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.600
Which are called the
"ghost particles."

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.170
They go almost
through everything.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.355
And right now, per second, there
are about one trillion-- one

00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:03.050
trillion-- neutrinos going
through you per second, right?

00:30:04.145 --> 00:30:05.250
And we have no idea.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.670
So there is this
shower of stuff that

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.690
is invisible, but
yet very real, right?

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.060
Anyway, so we don't know
what the dark matter is yet.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.410
There are many possibilities.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.595
Fancy names,
supersymmetric particles.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.069
But we are not quite sure.

00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:23.610
And then there is
the big guy, right?

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:28.820
The 73%, the dark energy, which
was a complete surprise that

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.190
came in 1998, which was
one of these discoveries

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.740
that everybody was
praying to be wrong.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.600
Please go away.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.660
Because it is so weird
and so mysterious, really.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.560
Basically it says not just that
the galaxies are moving away

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.710
from one another, but about
five billion years ago they

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.150
start accelerating
away from one another.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.950
Sort of like if there is some
kind of repulsive force pushing

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.660
space apart and taking
these galaxies with, OK?

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.350
Now, what could do that?

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.770
Well, there are
candidates, right?

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.835
Einstein himself put a
term in his equations

00:31:04.835 --> 00:31:10.620
in 1917 where you can put
a term in the equations

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.630
that kind of does that.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.830
It induces this kind
of stretching of space,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.940
it's called the cosmological
constant, right?

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.330
But he abandoned it
afterwards saying

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.090
that was just very ugly stuff.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.750
He called it, "my
biggest blunder."

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.230
And lo and behold, here the
thing is, again, sort of.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.530
Or it could be something else.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.380
Something like an aether.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.860
I don't know if you guys
remember, in the 19th century

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.630
people believed
that light traveled

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.390
in some sort of
mysterious medium

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.120
called the aether, right?

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.400
And everybody believed that.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.150
And the aether was
just the weirdest thing

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.220
you can possibly imagine.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.340
Transparent,
weightless, and yet more

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.930
dense than steel in order
to be able to transfer waves

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.180
that fast, at the
speed of light.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.990
And people believed that
stuff because they could not

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.530
imagine that a wave could travel
in an empty space, in a vacuum,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.030
right?

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.795
And there goes dark
energy, and it sort of

00:32:05.795 --> 00:32:06.670
looks like an aether.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.470
It is sort of-- the same way
the air is everywhere here,

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.320
there is this thing
across the space that

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.240
is filling up universe making
it move outwards really fast.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.690
So fast that if
nothing reverses this,

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.670
in about a long time--
50 billion years

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.260
or so, so way ahead
of time-- the universe

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.090
is going to look completely
different than it does now.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.950
So if the astronomers of
50 billion years from now--

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.500
we can go talk about that later.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.329
That's a whole other talk--
but assuming that they're there

00:32:40.329 --> 00:32:41.870
and they are looking
at the universe,

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.786
they would see something
completely different.

00:32:43.786 --> 00:32:45.980
They would see almost
complete darkness,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.730
because the galaxies
would be just so far

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.890
out that the light could
not reach us anymore.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.160
So they would be sort of in
an island universe, you know?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.170
And not be able to see
anything out there.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:00.100
So the way you picture the
universe changes completely

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.330
as we advance in time.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.580
Let me just make a
note of what this is.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.180
So this is a self-portrait by
Rembrandt, the Dutch painter.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.450
And if you have seen any other
one of his self-portraits,

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.190
they are always kind of gloomy.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.520
But this one he did
when he was young,

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.110
and it's called Self-portrait
in the Likeness of Democritus.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.390
Now, Democritus
was the second guy

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.400
that came up with the
notion of atomism, right?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.630
That particles are made
of little bits, right?

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.470
That you can break matter
into fundamental little bits.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.370
And he was also called the
Laughing Philosopher, hence

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.630
the laughing Rembrandt there.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.140
And the reason why he was
called the Laughing Philosopher

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.390
is because he believed
that only if you

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.620
develop your faculty
of critical thinking

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.710
and free yourself from slavery--
the slavery of superstitious

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.980
belief-- can you
truly be happy, right?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.350
And he, of course, reached his
rational nirvana, in a sense.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.880
And he was a happy guy, and
that was his nickname, right?

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.870
So he was very much
anti-religious belief,

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.370
you know.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.870
And in fact, Lucretius, when
he wrote his famous poem

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.540
about the atomistic
structure of nature,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.730
he would use this image in
exactly in the same way.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:24.150
That to be able to think
critically about reality

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.500
is your way to break
free of slavery

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.989
from superstition, right?

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:32.780
It's better not to know
than to live like a fool

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.184
or be fooled by
belief so to speak.

00:34:35.184 --> 00:34:37.980
Anyway so of course
when we go and talk

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.860
about what we understand of
matter now at the quantum

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.560
level, there are all sorts
of technical questions

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.110
that we have to ask
which are really strange.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.130
So we, here, live in
our "classical" reality

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.915
where we can touch
things and there

00:34:52.915 --> 00:34:55.540
is an objective
separation between us

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.730
and everything else, right?

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.680
You know you have a
chair outside of you.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.880
You're sitting on it.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.280
When you go to
the quantum world,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.490
when you look at electrons
and your study them,

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.310
everything goes down the drain.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.780
First because you don't
see an electron, right?

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.400
You don't see a
fundamental particle.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.150
What you do see is a click
in a detector, right?

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.620
Or a little curve in a detector.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.270
And that thing appeared there
after being amplified a lot

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.710
by these photo multipliers.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.320
So the electron,
whatever that is,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.360
creates some sort of transfer
of energy and momentum.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.460
And this thing is
amplified, and then it

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.320
becomes a click that we see.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.040
There is a huge gap between
the reality of that electron

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.280
and our reality of looking
at data on a computer screen,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:45.950
right?

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:50.750
And so there is no immediate
connection with the very small,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.260
so to speak.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.210
And so when you look
at the equations

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.360
that describes these
things, and they were all

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.470
developed to kind of
make sense of data.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.440
I mean, people were
making experiments

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.005
with electrons and
fundamental particles that

00:36:04.005 --> 00:36:06.780
were very strange and
caused a lot of distress.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.970
Including Einstein, right?

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.040
Because what was apparent
is that you could not

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.360
have a deterministic way of
thinking about reality anymore.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.350
Everything was
really probabilistic.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.230
So the equations would say,
look, an electron could be here

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.900
or could be there with
a certain probability

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.830
after you measure it.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.450
Before, if you
take it literally,

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.410
the physics of
quantum mechanics,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.490
you can't even say
an electron exists

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.620
until it interacts
with a detector, right?

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.560
So that brings this interesting
philosophical question, which

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.260
is, hey, if the electron only
exists when I interact with it,

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.541
I am creating reality by the
way I interact with reality.

00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:47.040
Right?

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.860
So is reality dependent on us,
like an intelligent observer,

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.860
or is it just the detector
that is creating the reality?

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.040
There are all sorts of weird,
complicated philosophical

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.870
questions that I go into a
lot of detail in the book,

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.260
I can't in 40
minutes, obviously.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.240
But the interesting point here
is that in quantum physics

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.700
you have this deep connection
between the way we study

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.730
reality and the way that reality
manifests itself as opposed

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.260
to this separation
that you see a rainbow,

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.200
there is the rainbow.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.720
Right?

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.400
And with the electron, you
can see an electron as a wave

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.430
or as a particle depending
how you set up the experiment

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.090
to study an electron.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.010
So what is it?

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.720
Is it a wave?

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.530
Is it a particle?

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.435
And this sort of like
an endless debate

00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:35.560
which has to do with this
interpretation of quantum

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.450
mechanics.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.090
On the other hand, it is
the most successful theory

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.500
we have in physics, right?

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.360
It is when you make measurements
with quantum mechanics,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.190
you get a precision
to 12 decimal points.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.990
There is no theory
that can do that.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:54.080
I mean, gravity sucks compared
to that in terms of precision.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.330
And it's much older
than quantum mechanics.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.240
But when we interpret quantum
mechanics, the whole notion

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.690
of how deep can
you go into reality

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.550
becomes very convoluted.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.960
And essentially also the fact
that there isn't a fundamental

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.100
randomness to the way these
particles behave that we cannot

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:14.670
predict.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.530
So you cannot come up with
a theory that describes

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.750
if an electron that you're going
to measure is going to spin

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.450
this way or that way
when you detect it.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.750
So to make it simple, let's say
the electron can do two things:

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.810
go counterclockwise
and clockwise, right?

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.340
So we have 50%
probability of when

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.399
you detect it being this
way or the other way.

00:38:36.399 --> 00:38:38.440
And when you detect it,
you're going to find out.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.070
But you cannot do the
theory to predict that.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.620
So there is a
fundamental unknowability

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.150
at the very core of matter.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:50.870
So you go from the edge of the
universe, that we cannot know,

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:55.140
to the very core of matter, that
we also cannot know with this

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.000
precision that we want, right?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.030
So these are two sort of
very interesting unknowables.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.910
And they don't seem
to be going away.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.222
In particular, in the
case of quantum physics,

00:39:05.222 --> 00:39:06.680
I was really upset
that they didn't

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.105
get the Nobel Prize this year.

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:09.480
They gave the
Nobel Prize to guys

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.670
who developed the LED,
which is fair enough, right?

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.550
Very important, LEDs, right?

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.000
But I was rooting for the guys
who made these experiments

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.810
with the fundamental
questions of quantum physics,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:24.380
in particular can you find
a theory that could describe

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.710
the electron through
local forces?

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.740
You know, that could
explain if it's

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.740
going to spin this
way or that way.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.430
And what they found out, which
is really an amazing thing,

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.700
is that it's impossible
to build what

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.990
we call a "local theory"
of quantum mechanics

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.440
that explains this
"probability" as the result

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.360
of some fundamental,
underlying causality, right?

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.210
So Einstein was wrong.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:52.070
There is no way you can
create a theory that

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.726
explains this basic,
random behavior

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:56.350
at the fundamental
quantum level, which

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.470
is great for cartography, right?

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.780
I mean, this is going to be the
essence of quantum computers.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.230
So there is this whole big
quantum information theory

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.180
framework that is emerging
precisely from this.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.810
But on the other hand, from
this perspective of how much

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.460
can we know of the world,
you have a fundamental block

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.000
right there.

00:40:15.942 --> 00:40:17.650
And finally I just
wanted to make a point

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.650
that this is a quote
from Democritus.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:26.160
So he knew all these things,
but he knew also that careful

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.060
when you talk about truth.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.070
And a lot of scientists,
many colleagues of mine,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.540
make these big, bold
statements that should not

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.760
be made in public, you know?

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.890
Because sometimes they push what
science really is doing or can

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.300
do way beyond what
we really are doing.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.730
And that is a disservice,
I think, to science,

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:53.080
especially nowadays when
there is so much criticism

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.560
to what science can do.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.670
You know, you have all the
global climate deniers, right?

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.250
Who say, oh, these scientists,
they keep changing their minds.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.890
No, way, look.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.830
They found gravitational
[INAUDIBLE] from the big bang.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:04.330
Right?

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.000
In March there was is big stuff,
actually here in Stanford,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.920
you know?

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.000
I don't know if you guys
know the science people

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.620
like Andrei Linde
and all these guys,

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.440
like, there would be Nobel
Prizes all over the place.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.650
And it's BS, right?

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:23.180
So they had a press conference
before they had a peer review,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.110
and that is not what you
should be doing with science.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.219
So that just gives
ammunition to all these guys

00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:31.510
that want to say that we
don't what we're doing, right?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.490
So the book-- the way I'm
bring this together-- is really

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.230
an effort to bring back
this integrity into science

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.490
and say, look, this
is how we think.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.220
This is how scientific
knowledge is constructed.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.220
Let's be very careful about
these big, bold statements

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.440
about, yeah, we
understand the big bang.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.231
We do not understand
the big bang at all.

00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:53.480
You know, there are all sorts
of fundamental questions

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.080
we have no clue about.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.710
And you have to be very careful,
especially when it's, like,

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.310
Stephen Hawking that
says something like this.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.825
Anyway, just for the
last couple of minutes,

00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:06.060
I want to talk
about the last part.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.600
the cognitive part, right?

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.340
And first of all, we have
to say sorry to Descartes

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.590
because there is
no dualism, right?

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.026
There is no matter
and soul, right?

00:42:15.026 --> 00:42:16.890
There is just matter.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:19.720
And the big question in
cognitive neuroscience

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.980
is exactly how does
the brain engender you

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.620
with your sense of self, right?

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.650
So you have 85 billion
neurons, they are all

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.722
connected-- which is about the
same as stars in a galaxy which

00:42:32.722 --> 00:42:35.030
is kind of a cute
image-- and they're

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.670
connected to one another by
thousands of synapses, right?

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:43.000
And the question is, how is
that giving you your ability

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.890
to think and to be
yourself every day?

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.230
You wake up the next morning
and you're still you, right?

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.380
There is some sort
of continuity here,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.554
and we are all made
of the same stuff,

00:42:53.554 --> 00:42:54.720
and yet we are so different.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.980
So how exactly is that going on?

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.670
So at the bottom of this debate
is really the question can

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.420
we build artificial
intelligence machines, right?

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.960
I mean, is that
something that we can do?

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.629
And the effort for-- the
movement for starting this

00:43:14.629 --> 00:43:15.920
started at Dartmouth, actually.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.750
In 1956 there was
a conference there

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.190
which started artificial
intelligence communities

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.095
so to speak, right?

00:43:25.095 --> 00:43:27.380
With Marvin Minsky
and Claude Shannon

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.510
and some very smart people.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.210
And they said, of
course we can build

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.680
a machine that can
think like a human.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.550
You have to make a distinction
here, one thing is to think.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.950
The other thing is to
think like a human, meaning

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.560
emulate a human brain
through machines.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.040
And they were convinced that
was happening real quick,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.820
it was just a matter
of a few years.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.960
And here we are, right?

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.530
I mean, you know this
better than I do.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:56.020
We have the fastest
computers now

00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.200
at about 10 to 16 floating
point operations per second.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.490
The brain, it is "estimated"--
because we really don't know

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.530
exactly-- at about 10 to 18.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.170
So we're almost there.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.870
And this guy called
Henry Markram, who

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.950
got the biggest grant in
the history of science

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:18.150
for the Human Brain Project
in Europe, 1 billion euros

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:22.660
to emulate the human brain
in every possible detail,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.250
says-- or is convinced
that by 2018 we

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.490
will have machines
that will get to the 10

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.050
to 18 floating point operations.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.470
And so if that's true,
is that all you need?

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.340
That's the real fundamental
question, right?

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.980
Can you just then input
all these 85 billion

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.830
neurons, connect them?

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.510
And they even want to do the
flow of neurotransmitters

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.950
through synapses.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:47.450
You know, they
really want to create

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.500
some sort of
hydrodynamic code that

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.340
can mesh with the
sort of binary flip

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.160
on and off from the neurons.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.191
It's a beautiful,
ambitious project.

00:44:58.191 --> 00:44:59.690
But the question
is can you do that?

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.190
And so well, the problem
behind this-- and there

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.400
is a group of philosophers that
have the best name ever, it's

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.280
called the new
mysterians, right?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.450
And the new mysterians
say, we can't do that.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.650
We cannot understand the
human mind and certainly not

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.260
to reconstruct it in a machine.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.070
You may be able to
reconstruct or create

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.950
some mind, but not
the human mind.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:25.450
You know?

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.360
And that's an important
distinction because we cannot

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.750
understand consciousness, right?

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:33.110
So this is what's called the
hard problem of consciousness

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:37.510
is the notion that one thing
is to look at a painting

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.600
and monitor all the neurons that
are flashing because you see

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.760
the painting and you react
to the painting emotionally.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.880
The other thing is to understand
the subjective experience

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.605
of what it means to
look at the painting.

00:45:50.605 --> 00:45:52.890
They are two different things.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.930
There is a disconnect
between the two things.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.825
And also another
way of saying it

00:45:57.825 --> 00:45:59.394
is that when I
look at a painting,

00:45:59.394 --> 00:46:00.810
and you look at a
painting, we are

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.280
going to see the
same information.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.600
Like, there is a
painting, right?

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.766
But I'm going to react in
a very different way from,

00:46:05.766 --> 00:46:08.340
because I have
this consciousness

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.380
and this subjective experience,
which is not the same as yours.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:16.200
Which a third way of thinking
is that the brain cannot figure

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.460
itself out, right?

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.300
And no computer simulation
can simulate itself

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.630
or include itself in
the simulation, right?

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.700
And that's a problem in
computer science, right?

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.320
I mean, you cannot have a
computer simulation that

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.810
includes the computer in
the simulation itself.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.850
So we have a hard one,
essentially, here, right?

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.360
And that is the third
dimension, and of course I

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.430
couldn't come here
and not mention

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.220
that this issue of--
the question of living

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.040
in a simulation
or not is actually

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.230
a very serious,
complicated question.

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.240
And we cannot know, right
now, if we are living

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.170
in a simulation or not, right?

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.640
There was a paper last
year from some colleagues

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.090
that they said that if our--
if we are a simulation,

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:08.190
and they use a lattice to
simulate reality, which is,

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.100
say, a square lattice, for
example a cubic lattice,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.430
to be three dimensional.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.340
Every lattice, when
you simulate something,

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.360
has a spatial resolution.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.430
And in order to probe
very short distances,

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.460
you can shoot particles
at very high energies

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.820
to probe these distances
so it is, in principle,

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.940
possible to tell what would
be the spatial resolution

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.610
of the lattice that is
simulating us, right?

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.020
Because the aliens,
or whoever they are,

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.810
would need to save memory
by doing this lattice.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:41.620
No lattice is
infinitely thin, right?

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.710
You have to cut off at
some spatial resolution.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.636
And so, you know, the
point being here well,

00:47:48.636 --> 00:47:50.010
but, you know, if
it's very fine,

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.840
it's way beyond
anything that we could

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.440
create right now in terms
of energy say at the LHC.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.411
So we could be fooled, and
it's a really hard question

00:47:58.411 --> 00:47:58.910
to answer.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:00.260
Sort of like the Sims, right?

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.756
Think of the Sims
50 years from now.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.000
And we know that we
are playing the Sims,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.480
and they have absolutely
no autonomy, right?

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.300
But 50 years from now, you can
imagine that SIM characters are

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.160
going to be so developed and
so self-sufficient they're

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.790
going to believe that their
autonomous those individuals.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:20.710
So they will believe
that they are real.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.570
And, you know, our
grandkids or whatever

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:26.000
will be playing with them,
and they aren't, right?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.030
But they don't know.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.400
So the question is can we know?

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.560
And that is the other
complicated question.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.950
So just to wrap up
what is this notion

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.590
of the island of knowledge then?

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:39.430
Well, it's the way we really
construct scientific knowledge,

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.930
right?

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.910
So you have an
island, which is where

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.700
you put all your knowledge, and
this island can change in time.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.710
It can grow, as we
understand things.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.960
Sometimes it shrinks,
like the aether, right?

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.820
And it would be all jagged
because things are not linear.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.500
But there is an island that
is on the average growing,

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.170
and it's surrounded by this
ocean of the unknown, the stuff

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.980
that we don't know
about the world.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.520
And the idea then is
there are two ways, right?

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.430
So the native people would say,
hey, the island of knowledge

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.760
grows, grows, grows.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.390
And eventually there is not
going to be anymore unknown.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:09.580
It's the end of science.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.230
A lot of people
talked about this.

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.120
And that is complete
nonsense, right?

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.960
Because, as I try
to explain here,

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.730
as the island of
knowledge grows so does

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.670
the shore of our
ignorance, which

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.550
is the boundary between the
known and the unknown, which

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.380
basically means this
as we know more,

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.300
we become equipped
to ask questions

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.340
that we couldn't have
contemplated before.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.450
Going back to the example
of the microscope, right?

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.640
Nobody could have
predicted that life

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.790
would have been that small
before the instrument opened

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.050
a completely different
reality to people

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.570
and allowed people to
ask more questions.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.970
So the notion of
final truth, which

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:52.770
implies complete
knowledge, is absurd

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.530
because you can never
ask all questions.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.114
So if you can't ask all
questions, how the heck

00:49:59.114 --> 00:50:00.280
do you know all the answers?

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.390
Which is a much harder
thing to do, right?

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.070
So that's the essential idea.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.420
And so you have this
map over there, right?

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:11.250
And you have these unknowables
that I mentioned briefly here,

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:11.750
right?

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.920
So to take this
into contect, it's

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.094
not like, oh, damn, this is
such a defeatist kind of idea,

00:50:17.094 --> 00:50:18.135
because it isn't, really.

00:50:18.135 --> 00:50:22.150
It's really about how we make
meaning in the world, right?

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.030
We are always trying to
go beyond our limits,

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.120
and that's exactly
what it should be.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.150
And it's really searching
that makes us matter.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.750
It is wanting to know that
gives us value, you know?

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.170
It's trying to find the
meaning that gives us

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.670
value, not necessarily arriving
at the end of everything.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:46.560
And so to conclude, from the
way I picture things here,

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.310
what we call reality is really
a shifting map of ideas.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:55.290
Because, as you've seen, the
fundamental core of reality

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:59.610
has changed as our knowledge
of nature has changed in time.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:01.580
And there is no
reason to believe

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.040
that that's not going
to continue, right?

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.130
So we can talk about
what we know now

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.920
and what we knew
before, but not saying

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.760
that this is the
end of the story.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.510
This is just one beginning, and
there'll be many, many others.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.557
And that's it.

00:51:15.557 --> 00:51:16.390
Thank you very much.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.374
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:23.056 --> 00:51:24.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for you talk today.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.210
I don't know enough about
theoretical physics.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.340
So what are the
major problems there,

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.460
and if we solve them, what
are the major implications?

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:40.970
Like, what could we do
that we cannot do now?

00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:44.540
MARCELO GLEISER: Well, nobody
can answer that question,

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.039
right?

00:51:45.039 --> 00:51:46.770
Because-- but I
can tell you what

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.400
the big problems of physics are.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.792
It's kind of a boring,
but there is dark matter,

00:51:51.792 --> 00:51:52.500
that I mentioned.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.333
You know, what is the
nature of dark matter?

00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:56.340
What is the nature
of dark energy?

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.080
Turbulence.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.890
We don't know turbulence or what
causes turbulence in fluids.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.140
We don't know what's
beyond the Higgs particle.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.729
You know, are there any
other particles beyond that?

00:52:05.729 --> 00:52:07.395
So there are many
fundamental questions.

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:09.980
Is there a multiverse?

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.115
You know, sort of
is our universe

00:52:12.115 --> 00:52:15.760
the only universe that exists
or are there multiple universes

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.250
out there with
different laws of nature

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.920
and ours happens
to be the one that

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.321
allows for stars
and people to exist?

00:52:22.321 --> 00:52:22.820
Right?

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.280
And how can we tell?

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.700
See, the multiverse has a
very fundamental problem, too,

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.910
because if it
exists, we can't know

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:36.720
because the other universes
that are part of this multiverse

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.270
are beyond our
light bubble, which

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.850
means we can't get
information from them.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:46.480
And so physics, especially
this sort of out there,

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.960
more abstract physics, is going
through an interesting time

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.090
now where some questions
may not be answerable.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.445
And yet the ideas are
very nice and compelling.

00:52:56.445 --> 00:52:57.720
They are interesting, right?

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.120
But we may never know
if they are true or not.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.130
So that to me is
a serious problem

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:06.080
that we have to deal with.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.070
AUDIENCE: You're really
curious if you had,

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:12.070
say, infinite resources
and infinite time, you

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:14.640
presented a tremendous
number of questions.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.362
Which question would
you try to answer?

00:53:17.362 --> 00:53:18.320
MARCELO GLEISER: Right.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.890
Well, from a
realistic perspective,

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:26.360
like what can we figure out
first, I think dark matter.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.730
I think in the next 20
years we'll figure it out.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:29.990
You know, either it's there.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.310
We'll find it.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:33.360
Or it's not there,
and it's something

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.310
to do with our
theory of gravity.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.940
Because believe it or not, even
though we started with Newton

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.290
in 1686, it's the
least understood

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.550
of all forces of nature.

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:46.420
We understand electromagnetic
forces and the weak and strong

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.270
nuclear forces much better
than we understand gravity.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:52.050
So people are beginning to
say, is gravity even a force?

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.360
What the heck is going on?

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.680
You know, because it's
only attractive, it has--

00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.180
and so I think dark
matter will be the one.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:04.260
But the question that I'm
most fascinated right now with

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:08.500
is-- which has nothing
to do with this talk,

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.750
because that's my research--
I'm using information

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:14.860
theory to describe the emergence
of complexity in nature.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:19.420
So how can you quantify,
using information theory,

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.500
the complexity of objects
from a star to a leaf?

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.970
And the way you do that
is by-- every object

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:29.540
can, in principle, be described
by mathematical functions.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:33.990
These mathematical functions
can be decomposed into waves,

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.640
and you can find out the weight
that each one of these waves

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.670
would have for that
particular object,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:43.420
and you can extract some
information from that.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:46.020
You know, there's a whole theory
from Claude Shannon, the guy

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.590
that was the AI guy, and
I'm very interested in that.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.490
Because I think nature
has sort of-- you know,

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:57.164
we always know the nature
always saves energy, right?

00:54:57.164 --> 00:54:58.830
I mean everything
that happens in nature

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.538
uses the least possible
amount of energy.

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.800
And I think it does the
same with information.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.980
All the shapes are
optimized shapes.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.280
There is no-- so
you can-- I'm trying

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.880
to construct that principle.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.170
But it's very different
from these questions here.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.800
Yeah.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.860
Thanks.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.180
AUDIENCE: I find it hard
to disagree with all this,

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.210
but I don't talk to
scientists very much

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.850
and so I'm wondering
why did you choose

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.720
to write this book with
this topic right now?

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.910
Do you think this message
needs to be delivered now?

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.775
Is it a welcome message or
is it unwelcome for anyone?

00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:30.650
MARCELO GLEISER: That's
a very good question.

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:31.560
Thanks for asking.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.110
I think it's a very important
time to write this book.

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.640
I try to hint at this
in some statements

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:42.080
I made about, you know,
big, boasting pronouncements

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.310
by scientists saying that
science is doing this.

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:45.780
Science has solved this problem.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.110
That's wrong, and
that is just not true.

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:52.930
So I think that what we need
is sort of like to bring back

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:57.710
this kind of integrity,
really, to how science is done

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.960
and what science
can do, you know?

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.670
So that we protect ourselves
from these attacks.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:06.370
Because science is
under attack, right?

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.560
I mean 28% percent
of Republicans

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:17.559
only believe that the weather is
getting hotter because of-- we

00:56:17.559 --> 00:56:18.600
call it the anthropocene.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:23.660
So that's really bad.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.400
And so we need to do
something about that.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.150
And it doesn't help to
have these pronouncements.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.700
That's one.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.950
Second, and I think there
is a big confusion about how

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.260
science actually works.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.310
You know, how do we gather
knowledge about reality?

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:40.890
And I think to clarify
these concepts is

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.340
really important to people.

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:45.360
So you know, how
instruments play

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.110
a fundamental role
in all of that.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.370
The limits that they
impose on knowledge.

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.324
It's great.

00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.740
Because otherwise
you make science

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.281
into some kind of
religion, you know,

00:56:53.281 --> 00:56:54.592
that will solve everything.

00:56:54.592 --> 00:56:56.050
And it's just really
not like that.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.140
Science is a product
of our creativity,

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.590
and it's as wonderful
and fallible as we are.

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:05.440
And I'm trying to bring this
sort of sense of grounding.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.950
But, yeah.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.530
And you ask how
scientists react to it?

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.420
The humanists,
believe it or not,

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.495
are taking this much
better than the scientists.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.115
Some scientists
say, oh, you know,

00:57:17.115 --> 00:57:19.573
now you're basically saying
that we can't solve everything.

00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:21.300
It's like, yeah, so what?

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.290
You know, be real, right?

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.630
I mean that's-- we can't.

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:25.130
Period.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:26.360
That doesn't mean it's bad.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.750
It's fine.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.170
But so be it.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:31.237
Thanks.

00:57:31.237 --> 00:57:31.820
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.480
I had a question, like, if we
know the wave function of all

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.810
the particles in
the universe, can we

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.340
determine what's going to
happen tomorrow, for example?

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.180
MARCELO GLEISER: We can't
know the wave function

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.680
of all the particles
in the universe

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.360
from a fundamental
principle, which

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.850
is in order to know that you'd
need to know the position

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:52.220
and velocity of all the
particles at the same time,

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:52.886
instantaneously.

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.240
And you just can't make
that kind of measurement.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.790
So you know, it's
the initial condition

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:02.920
to solve this wave equation
that we can't get, right?

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.189
So no, we can't.

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:06.480
But you can say that there
is something called the wave

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.600
function of the
universe, but that's

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.730
a much vaguer way of thinking.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.540
There was a guy
called Laplace that

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.060
said that if there was
a supermind-- this was

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.850
in 1810-- if there
was a supermind that

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:22.220
knew the position and
velocity of all particles

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:26.130
at a given moment in time,
you'd just crank, you know,

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:29.280
the laws of physics, mechanics,
and you can predict the future.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.210
Like, that I'll be here
talking right now, right?

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.750
You'd have asked that question.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:37.089
But that is fundamentally
impossible for that reason,

00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:38.630
and also because of
the indeterminacy

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:39.750
in quantum physics.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.980
You can't know the
position and velocity

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.127
with arbitrary
precision of a particle.

00:58:44.127 --> 00:58:45.085
But that would be nice.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:47.389
We can't do it.

00:58:47.389 --> 00:58:49.680
AUDIENCE: But we assume that
such [INAUDIBLE]-- I mean,

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.300
the wave functions exist so
even though we can't find out,

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.975
can we assume that such a wave
function exists and so that

00:58:55.975 --> 00:58:57.891
our future is already
determined or something?

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:03.011
MARCELO GLEISER: I don't
think so, because, remember,

00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:05.010
I don't know if you were
here when I was talking

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.840
about the randomness at the very
fundamental level of particles?

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:12.260
And you can't get around that.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.830
So there is no way
of-- and the only way

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:17.490
we could do that
is to create what

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:19.580
we call a local theory
that explains cause

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.250
and effect at a point
in space and time.

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.079
But what people have found
is that the theories can only

00:59:25.079 --> 00:59:25.620
be non-local.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.182
Which is really weird, you know?

00:59:28.182 --> 00:59:30.040
It has something to
do with entanglement

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.690
that I didn't have
time to talk about.

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.730
And so you're really stuck.

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:38.080
You can believe that
there is something

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.030
which is an ultimate
reality out there.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.430
Probably, right?

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.480
I mean, the universe
is out there, right?

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.715
But that doesn't mean we
can get to it completely.

00:59:46.715 --> 00:59:48.625
We can only get to it partially.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.860
Which is OK.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.150
The more you see,
the better it is.

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:57.430
AUDIENCE: You mentioned about
consciousness at the end,

00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.590
and you also mentioned
a couple of slides

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:02.500
before that that
everything is matter.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.640
So I was wondering if
you are aware of models

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.580
that explain consciousness
as a non-matter entity

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:13.680
but still explain everything
else with that kind of a model?

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.940
I was just curious if you had
exposure to that kind of models

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.730
and what your
thoughts on that are.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:20.995
MARCELO GLEISER: You mean
models, scientific models?

01:00:20.995 --> 01:00:21.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.060
There are
non-mechanistic models.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.970
As you rightly
mentioned, there's

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:31.980
only so much-- each tool
has a range, you mentioned.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:37.250
So when you exhaust the tools
that can deal with matter,

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.360
it doesn't mean that there's
not another reality besides that

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.950
so how do you understand that?

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:47.895
MARCELO GLEISER: So
the way-- the sort

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.840
of typical response
to that is something

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.370
called the binding problem.

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.110
And the binding problem
is the following.

01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:55.650
If the brain is matter, right?

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:59.360
And something else out there,
call it whatever you want,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.570
right?

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.210
And as this something
else interacts

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.960
with the matter
of the brain, that

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.250
means it's exchanging some
kind of energy and momentum

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.935
or something, which
is really physical.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.902
And so you should be
able to measure that.

01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:16.360
And the binding
problem is that you

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.820
don't know how to bind this
immaterial with the material

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.490
without producing some effect,
which is a physical affect.

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.980
And so this is a
fundamental problem.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:32.600
So you can believe things
like that as an assumption,

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.140
but it would be very hard to
verify this scientifically.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.515
So from a scientific
perspective,

01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:39.390
we go, I don't know. right?

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.010
I mean, I hope not.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:45.280
I hope it's really all matter,
and matter is awesome already.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.950
Look at what it does, right?

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:50.520
I mean, and the fact that
it's such a complex problem,

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.230
the emergence of consciousness,
doesn't mean that may be

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.480
unsolvable, doesn't mean that it
needs to be explained by other

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.650
means that cannot be
verified scientifically.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.150
You know?

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:05.970
Unless you're kind of
integrating in your mind

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.100
other ways of knowing,
which is fine.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.210
I mean, people do that.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.254
I'm not Richard Dawkins here.

01:02:11.254 --> 01:02:12.920
You know, I'm a
[INAUDIBLE] kind of guy.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.040
And I'm totally
OK with that, but

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.407
from a scientific perspective
it's very hard to justify that.

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:20.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.680
MARCELO GLEISER: You're welcome.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.740
AUDIENCE: At Google
we are primarily

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.240
concerned with the universal
access of knowledge.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.460
So I think when you talk
about distrust of science

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.530
in the general
public at some sense,

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:36.730
do you think misinformation
is also a contributing factor?

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:40.230
And what does the
scientific community use?

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.540
Like, I believe there will
be some pages somewhere

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.170
on the internet which say Pluto
is classified as a planet,

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:46.670
right?

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:52.640
So how do we get people
the most up-to-date

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.980
scientific information?

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.020
And, you know,
like, does everybody

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.170
have to go through reams
of a scientific papers

01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.699
and journals to you know--

01:02:59.699 --> 01:03:01.490
MARCELO GLEISER: I can
read my blog on NPR.

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:07.520
No, I mean, the point is there
is no Google science page yet.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.690
Right?

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:10.390
Why not?

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.400
So you should get a
team of consultants

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.920
from different areas
of science that

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.830
will give you, like,
a weekly bulletin

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:20.820
with critical commentary
that people can go to.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.310
Hey, it's not a bad idea.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:26.770
But the point is there are some
sources that are trustworthy.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:30.810
But I was also mortified when I
saw the "Scientific American,"

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.270
the cover of
"Scientific American"

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:36.620
this month talking about
precisely this measurement

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.650
of gravitational waves
from the big bang, right?

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:43.530
And it makes a big bombastic
statement, and at the very--

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.910
on the inside, when you turn
the pages-- if it's true.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.920
Very tiny, right?

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.880
Which is a marketing thing.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.370
They got to sell
magazines, right?

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.620
So that's where the
confusion starts, OK?

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.820
And that's where the media,
hey, we want to attract viewers.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.290
So the God particle,
with the Higgs particle,

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:00.620
has nothing to do with God.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.100
Do you guys know the story
behind the God particle?

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.070
So this guy called
Leon Lederman,

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:09.270
who is Nobel Prize winner,
who has been looking

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.690
for this particle
for 20 years, OK?

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:15.280
And he was writing a book
called "The Goddamn Particle"

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.130
because he couldn't find it.

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.312
And his editor said,
take the "damn" out,

01:04:20.312 --> 01:04:22.020
and you're going to
sell many more books.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.660
And he did.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.705
And that is the real
story of the God particle

01:04:25.705 --> 01:04:28.610
and where it came from, because
I worked with him at Fermilab.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:31.420
So anyways.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.370
But people loved this, right?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.870
Oh, science and religion
are being-- scientists

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.470
are finding God through the
particle accelerator, right?

01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:40.580
That's awesome.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.125
So that's where
things get murky.

01:04:45.926 --> 01:04:47.550
And, you know, these
blogs-- especially

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.590
when I write about climate
change, you know, at NPR?

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:54.230
It's a war zone.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:58.880
It's unbelievable how people
get offended by the fact

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.166
that we're messing up, you know?

01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:03.330
And instead of doing
something about it.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.590
It's really remarkable.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:08.270
So there's no simple
answer to your question.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:09.910
One thing that
possibly could do is

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.410
that scientists
should go to schools

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:14.010
and talk to kids
more than they do.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:17.940
They are very-- I mean, how many
kids know scientists, really,

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.384
in grade school?

01:05:19.384 --> 01:05:20.300
Or even middle school?

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:22.890
And I think that's
something that we

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.850
can do that makes a difference.

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:26.130
Or the Google Science page.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.100
Hey.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.290
Thank you.

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:29.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:30.690
MARCELO GLEISER: Thanks.

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:31.540
[APPLAUSE]
