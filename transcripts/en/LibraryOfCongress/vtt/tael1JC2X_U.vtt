00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good morning.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.950
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.570
And welcome to the African
and Malaysian division

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.650
of the Library of congress.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.490
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
chief of the division.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.160
And I'm delighted to see you here
today for this exciting symposium

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.950
on the ancient city of Tyre.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.030
I want first to thank Dr. Maha
Chalabi, the founder and president

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.740
of the International Association
to Save Tyre, for her proposal

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.690
to hold this conference at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.950
I want to thank Congressman
Charles Boustany

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.010
who supported this initiative
from the start to finish.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.050
I also want to recognize all
those who have worked tirelessly

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.160 position:56%
for the past year to make this event
possible, including the entire board

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.170
of the American Committee for Tyre

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.060
and its president Ambassador
Killion.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.410
His wife is here to represent him
and to represent the association.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.440
I want to thank Randa Hudome
of Hudome International.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.580
I want to thank Rim Chalabi who's
been an incredible force behind

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.880
this event.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.390 position:56%
And the honorable Esther
Coopersmith, the goodwill ambassador

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
to UNESCO, who has opened
her home for us to meet.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.080
Jan Jiplan [spelling assumed], who
created a buzz around this event

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.610
with a great media event at the
National Press Club in February.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.910
And many others.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.010 position:56%
And of course I want to thank my
own division for all they have done.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.650
They have been fantastic.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.950
So have our media office.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.420
So have our videotaping
office and everybody else.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.620
When Dr. Maha Chalabi
approached me over a year ago

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.990
about holding a conference at the
library on Tyre, I was thrilled.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.340
It had been one of my goals while
at the library to do a series

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.450
of symposia on ancient
cities of the near east.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.400
So what better place to
start than with Tyre?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.190
One of the oldest cities in the
world that is still inhabited

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.060
and perhaps still inhabited
by some of the descendants

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.330
of the original denizens.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.840
What better place to start than
with a Phoenician civilization

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.050
that gave the world its
first phonetic alphabet,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.600
without which there would be no
books, there would be no libraries.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.870
At least not in the
form that we know today.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.840
Let me conclude with a quote from
the introduction to the catalog

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.660
of the most important exhibition
on Phoenicians ever held.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.460
It was held in the Palazzo
Grassi Museum in Venice in 1988.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.510
This quote could apply
to our symposium today.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.380
The conveners of the conference
wrote, "It is not our intention

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370
to present merely documentary
evidence and with that carry

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.070
out a work of diffusion and
burgeoning of knowledge.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.040
We believe that reproposing
the splendor

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.310
of this distant civilization
means a return to the continuity

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.340
of a culture which is
deeply Mediterranean.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.960
Certainly civilization is progress.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.420
It is continual modification,
permanent advancement.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.050
But we cannot act in the present
without an awareness of our roots

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.470
that penetrate deeply
into the past."

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.180
And now, to welcome you to
welcome you to the Library

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.460
of Congress is our chief
of staff Robert Newlen.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.500
Robert Newlen was appointed chief
of staff on December 14th, 2014.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.130
In this capacity he has
led library-wide programs

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.050
in management responsibilities
and also oversees the offices

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.410
of communications, congressional
relations, development,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.860
the office of the chief
financial officer, contracts,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.740
grant management, general counsel

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.150
and special events
and public programs.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.920
Robert Newlen joined the
library in November, 1975.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.500
In more than 39 years at the
institution he has served

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.960
in a wide range of areas and roles.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.230
He assumed the position of
assistant law librarian 2010 and as

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.740
such he oversaw the
collection, development, research

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.430
and reference services and outreach

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.610
to the law library's
diverse constituency.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.030
He also managed the law
library's development

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.930
and fundraising initiatives.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.850
And last year oversaw the
library's Magna Carta exhibition

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.750
and its related events.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.790
Princess Ann participated
in these events.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.510
And Robert really did a
fantastic, fantastic job.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.960
I don't want to go any further.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.270
I want you to hear from Robert.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.400
So thank you again.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.510
Thank you, Robert.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.080
[ Applause ]

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.980
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Thank you,
Mary-Jane, and good morning.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.380
And on behalf of the Librarian
of Congress, James H. Billington,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.320
it's my pleasure to welcome
you to the Library of Congress.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.280
I have the honor and privilege of
serving as chief of staff here.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.760
When Mary-Jane mentioned the
date, I started in December 2014.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.120
I thought she almost said 1914.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.300
[ Laughter ]

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.470
I'm old, but not that old.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.430
So I'm delighted to see
so many people here today

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.280
for this historic symposium
on the ancient city of Tyre.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.640
Although the library has
sponsored innumerable conferences

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.760
over the years, it's
my understanding

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.390
that this is the first
conference that has been held

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.970
on the Phoenicians and the
ancient cities they founded

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.340
on the Mediterranean.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.750
So we have a historic moment here.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.340
For this initiative I would
like to join Mary-Jane

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.860
in thanking the American Committee
for Tyre, the Tyre Foundation

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.450
and Dr. Maha Chalabi, the founder

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.870
of the International
Association to Save Tyre.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.400
I'd also like to thank the
honorable Charles Boustany,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.160
Jr. for his support
of the symposium.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.180
Ambassador David Killion,
the president and chairman

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.130
of the American Committee for Tyre.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.700 position:56%
And the honorable Esther Coopersmith
who is an honorary chair as well

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.330
as one of the original
founders of the committee.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.050
And among our very treasures
here in the Library of Congress,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.360
none is greater than Mary-Jane
Deeb, the chief of the African

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.510
and Middle East Division.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:08.050
[ Applause ]

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.800
Thank you, Mary-Jane for
your vision and leadership.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.390 position:56%
It's most fitting that we hold this
conference in the northeast pavilion

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.740
of the Thomas Jefferson building.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.180
As you entered the African and
Middle Eastern reading room

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.620
of the library, I hope you
noticed that Tyre is inscribed

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.850
above the very decorative door.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.950
Carthage, another Phoenician
city, appears on its left as well.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.010
So it's very fitting that
the founders and creators

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.590
of the library were very much
aware of the ancient civilizations

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.280
of the near east and had
the names and symbols

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.900
of these civilizations fixed
to the walls and ceilings

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.210
of this great Jefferson building.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.400
So I'm going to end and just
wish you a very enjoyable day.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.160
As we hear from a whole
range of celebrated scholars.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.840
And we thank all of the scholars
for their participation today.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.650
I would now like to
introduce our next speaker,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.330
the distinguished member from
the third district of Louisiana,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.530
Representative Charles
Boustany, Jr. Again, Congressman,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.480
we're enormously grateful
to you for your support.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.400
And I had the privilege
of just speaking briefly

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.800
with a congressman this
morning about his ancestors

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.890
and how they came to
America from Lebanon.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.620
And it's a fascinating story

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.000
and I hope we'll hear more
about it in the future.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.510
Thank you.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.490
[ Applause ]

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.790
&gt;&gt; Charles Boustany, Jr.:
Well thank you, Robert.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.090
And good morning to all of you.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.710
Thank you, Mary-Jane, for the
great work you're doing here

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.010
at the library.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.190
And I want to thank all
who have been involved

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.330
in putting this very
important symposium together.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.400
It's so relevant to
what's happening today.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.000
It's so important for us to
reflect back on important history

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.880
and the lessons to be learned.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.690
I come here with a
little bit of humility

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.980
because there's tremendous
expertise in this room

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.510
and in this very important room.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.270
In a section of the library
which is an incredible repository

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.370
of knowledge that cannot
be replaced anywhere.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.640
So this is a fitting place to
hold this type of symposium.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.410 position:56%
And again, this is daunting just
for me to stand here in front of you

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.140
and offer a few humble remarks.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:33.470
Let me just start by saying I've
been a longtime reader of history.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.770
I love history.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.990
And this came about because of my
grandfather who at the ripe old age

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:44.860
of 15 arrived alone from
Lebanon, trying to find his sister

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.800
in the state of Louisiana
who married someone here.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.480
I don't know how she ended up
in Louisiana to begin with.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.210
We need to find that out.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.560
But I learned a lot
from my grandfather,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.580 position:56%
who went from having nothing when he
arrived to becoming very successful

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.470
in business and banking and
giving me, two generations later,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.140
this tremendous opportunity
to stand before you.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.690
First as a very successful
cardiac surgeon and now

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.350
with a career in public office.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.920
And I owe so much to him.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.230
But one of the most important
things he told me and imbued

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.010
in me was not only a love of
reading and reading history.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.620
But he taught me about my heritage.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.950
I might not have known.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.920
And the first time I ever heard
about the Phoenicians was sitting

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.000
on the lap of my grandfather
when I was a young child.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.120
And his intense sense
of pride was amazing.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.390
And I remember he told me
after the first World War,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.020
he went back to Lebanon
to find his mother.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.290
His father had passed
away in the interim time.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.610
He found his brother who was
on the verge of starvation.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.790
And this is just one of many, many
stories I'm sure have been repeated

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.000
across America with
a Lebanese diaspora.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.880 position:56%
But when you reflect on the Lebanese
diaspora, it's quite amazing.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.690
Because there are people
all across this country

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.680
who have reached the pinnacle of
their professions or chosen line

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.080 position:56%
of work, whether it's the arts,
sciences, or professions in medicine

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.660
and law, education and so forth.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.960
It's quite amazing.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.930
And I wasn't really aware
of this until I actually got

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.570 position:56%
into public office and began to meet
so many across this great country.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.440
But my grandfather
taught me about history.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.360
And that love of history
never went away.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.500
And I embarked on reading

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.510
and studying ancient
Mediterranean history.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.930 position:56%
And fast forward, I took a course
on ancient civilizations in college.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.730
And there was a history
professor there, long deceased,

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.350
who had a profound impact on me
despite all my education science.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.060
This one class furthered
my love of history,

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.550
took it to a different level
for me and taught me one thing

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.290
that I have never forgotten,
that history is a living thing.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.520
It's not old dates and
artifacts that have gone away

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.930
and they're collecting dust.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.230
History is living.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.800
It affects us today.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.190
And I think that is
incredibly relevant.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.680
That's why this symposium
is so important.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.330
Just take for a moment, I'll give
you just a few more reflections

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.630
on that before I close.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.790
First of all, we all know what's
happening across the Middle East

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.590
with the tremendous chaos
and the difficulties,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.240
much of it playing out in Lebanon.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.540
Well, antiquity is being
destroyed across the world

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.960
as a result of some of this.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.240 position:56%
This is something that's not getting
the kind of attention it needs.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.790
And hopefully this symposium with
publicity surrounding it will put

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.490
that into the public domain.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.420
We are having conversations
about that in Congress.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.850
But it's so important to
preserve these antiquities

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.630
because they have impact
on us today.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.240
Let me just reflect for just a
moment on the city-state of Tyre

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.000
and what is now Lebanon but was
a Phoenician empire in days past.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.780
Tyre is regarded as the greatest
maritime trading civilization

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.080
in the world.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.900
And you all know the stories about
how the alphabet and so forth.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.070
Trade is critically important
and it's relevant today.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.990
This is a heated debate we're
having in Congress today

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.190
on whether America will embark
on a very aggressive trade policy

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.130
and provide that kind of
leadership to bring us together

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.450
through commercial relationships.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.530
I think an avenue for peace.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.910
Or will we back away from
trade, become more isolationist

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:29.580
in our own views and basically give
up American leadership globally?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.620
So what happened in ancient
civilization when the understanding

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.200
of the importance of trade was
not quite so well understood,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.390
the creativity of the Phoenician
civilization was quite amazing.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.720
And it was centered upon Tyre.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.350
So we have a lot to learn
by studying the history,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.620
learning from the mistakes
that were made,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.220
but also the great
advances that were made.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.410
So I want to thank you all
for putting this together.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.790
It's a very important symposium.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.610
I wish I could spend
the entire day with you.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.930
I've got duties calling at 10:00.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.700
But thank you for your insights.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.010
Thank you for your willingness
to put this together.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.520
And I look forward to learning
a whole lot more from all of you

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.200
as you embark further on making
this information public knowledge.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.500
Thank you very much.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.920
It's great to be with you.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.610
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Before I go any further,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.510
I would like to recognize
the two ambassadors

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.930
of the two parts of
the Phoenician world.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.500
The ambassador of Lebanon,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.400
Ambassador Shadig [assumed
spelling] is with us.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.580
So thank you very much
for being here.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.270
And then the colleague
ambassador of Tunisia.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.170
[ Applause ]

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.710
So we are delighted to have
them both here, our two worlds.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:57.080
So now we are going to have a very
special person, Ms. Rodi Kratsa,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:05.760
who is the president of the
Konstantinos Karamanlis Institute

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.900
for Democracy in Greece, and
the former vice president

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.000
of the European parliament.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.050
Rodi Kratsa started sociology
at the University of Geneva

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.430
and continued her post-graduate
studies at the Institute

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.750
of European Studies of
the same university.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.050
She has rich experience and
long tenure in European politics

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.690 position:56%
and in Euro-Mediterranean relations.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.150
She represented the European
parliament in high-level summits

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.930
and ministerial conferences
worldwide.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.760
She is a member of the European
parliament committee on economic

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.860
and monetary affairs, on
the committee of employment

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.540
and social affairs,
and other committees.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.380
Rodi Kratsa has always been very
active at the international level.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.060
She has worked systematically
for the deepening of EU relations

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.560 position:56%
with significant areas of the world.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.170
Especially the caucuses
and the south shores

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:06.290
of the Mediterranean
and the Middle East.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.180
Shh. You have to lower your
voices because of the echo.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.200
You see, we can hear
everything here.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.240
So I would like to
invite her to address us.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.940
And thank you, Ms.
Kratsa, for being with us.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.740
Thank you.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.240
[ Applause ]

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.870
&gt;&gt; Rodi Kratsa: Thank you
very much for the kind words.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.610
Excellencies, honorable members
of Congress, Mrs. President

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.360
of the Tyre Foundation,
ambassadors, Mr. Vice President

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.580
of the American Committee for Tyre.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.590
We are friends of Tyre,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.330
It is with great pleasure and
honor that I am participating

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.940 position:56%
in this symposium dedicated to Tyre.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.940
In an atmosphere from the legacy

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.120
of the historic metropolis
of Phoenicians.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.870
As an active member of
Tyre Foundation I believe

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.950
that it is an excellent privilege
and important opportunity to share

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.090
with this distinguished American

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:12.260
and international audience all
the concerns and commitments

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.470
for the protection of
the cultural heritage

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.700
and the highlights of
the legacy of Tyre.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.370
For this reason I would like
first of all to thank those

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.870
of you responsible for the
Library of Congress and the members

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.990
of the American Committee for
Tyre who give us this possibility.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:37.790
I'm sure that the symposium will
provide us valuable information

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.160
for the rich history of
Tyre, the role that it played

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.970
in the international community
of that period, the Mediterranean

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.270
and the near coast of the Atlantic.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:54.430
We become more aware of the
importance which the world carried

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:59.080
for ancient people for
the next generations.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:06.200
And we will also understand
that the challenges are

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.590
for the conservation
of the civilization.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.070
The last few years we have become
witnesses to extreme violence,

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:19.080
mainly for interim classes
and obscurities mentalities

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.660
with destructive inconsideration
for monuments

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.820
and symbols of world heritage.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:31.430
There could be other destructive
actions in cases of occupation

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:36.690
or even during periods of
peace due to indifference,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.710
ignorance or natural disasters.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.550
We can also recall where
there has been destruction

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.790
of religious monuments which
belonged to minorities.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.640
There has been of course legal
instruments for the protection

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.310
of cultural assets, such
as the NESCO engagement,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.280
or the Hague Convention
and its protocols.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.530
As well as the decisions
for the security consul

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.480 position:56%
of the United Nations for
emergency cases of foreign conflict.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.690
The most important issue though is
the prevention of the destruction

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.100
and the activation of
the domestic population

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.200
and the politician actors.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.850
I know that the American
society shares this political

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.210
and moral globalist possibility.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.140
I have opportunity to collaborate
with the American Congressmen

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.810
and the American institutions
in this area as vice president

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.250
of the European Parliament.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:47.510
I feel obligation to mention
that already from April 1863,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:53.440 position:56%
President Lincoln announced the
general directive for the protection

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.850
of cultural assets of war zones.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:02.270
Later on, on April
1935 in Washington,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.960
there was signed the Convention
for the Protection of Artistic

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.820
and Scientific Institutions
and Historic Monuments.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.330
But it also determined
about the cases

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.120
of protection for armed conflict.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.190
This addition interprets
sensitivity and the active interest

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.910
for the world heritage,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.960
in particular for the unique
history for Tyre and Lebanon.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.780
From today's symposium we will
also ascertain the inspiration

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.930
that the heritage could give us
for modern creative projects.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.990
This is another dimension
of the fantastic roles

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.190
of the Tyre Foundation

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.510
and the international
association to save Tyre.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:58.680
Here I would like to congratulate
the president and the founder,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.370
my friend Dr. Maha
El-Khalil Chalabi.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.660
As well as the partners and
members of the foundation

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.360
of that association
for their commitment,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.620
their creativity and
their efficiency.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:18.610
We mentioned further on the labels
of the symposium those projects

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.260
such as the institute, the
library and the Virtual Museum

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.430
for Canaanite, Phoenician
and Punic Cities in Beirut.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.460
The Lisa Dedoun Prize, the
Hangukuk village in Tyre.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.480
The revival and the reclamation
of the ancient civilization

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.840
of the Phoenicians
contribute to the radiance

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.270
of Tyre and Lebanon in general.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.690
This is also very important to
mention the league of Canaanite,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.700
Phoenician and Punic Cities
which is constituted of islands

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.620
and cities in the Mediterranean.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.430 position:56%
Stations in the role of Phoenicians.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.160
Greece, my country.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.030
A country with a great
naval tradition civilization

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.130
with historic interaction
with the Phoenicians.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.410
Participates actively
and we are in the process

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:18.910 position:56%
to create the Greek committee for
the enforcement of these activities.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.300
These initiatives offer many
opportunities for research

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.870
into the past, but also dialogue,
exchanges and collaborations

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.650
for common development
projects of mutual interest.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.030
In conclusion, ladies and
gentlemen, I would like to share

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:44.250
with you my feelings that today
we will have an exceptional day

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.230
for the exceptional Tyre.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.510
Thank you very much.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.060
[ Applause ]

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.360
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
And now we are going

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.020
to have really the
star of this event.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.240
Dr. Maha Chalabi is the initiator.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.980
She is the mover and shaker, not
only in Washington but in Paris,

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.770
in London, in Lebanon and
everywhere she has been.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.480
She is the person who
has put Tyre once again

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.230
on the map historically
and culturally.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:28.260
A native of Tyre in south Lebanon,
Dr. Maha Chalabi grew up surrounded

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.430
by the prestigious vestiges
of this ancient city

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.730
on which eight successive
civilizations have laid

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.030
their imprint.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:40.660
For almost 30 years, Maha
Chalabi has dedicated herself

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.480
to making Tyre better known.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.050
And I have to tell you she has
succeeded and succeeded very well.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:51.180
She graduated with a degree in
political science from the faculty

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.030 position:56%
of [inaudible] University in Beirut.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.260
And earned her doctorate in
history from the Sorbonne.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.200
Starting in the 1970's, she
worked hard to get Tyre recognized

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.570
as a world heritage site in
order to ensure its protection.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:12.220
Soon thereafter, starting in '78,
UNESCO recognized the necessity

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.820
of civ guarding the whole
of the archaeological site

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.730
of Tyre and its surroundings.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.480 position:56%
She received those recognitions by
the United Nations Security Council,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.770 position:56%
the European Parliament, the
American Senate, the House of Lords,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.630
the World Federation of Twin Towns
followed and all unanimously agreed

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.390
to declare Tyre a world
heritage site.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.500
Strengthened in her resolve
by this support emanating

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.300
from the world's highest
political organizations,

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.460
Maha Chalabi created the
International Association

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.800
to Save Tyre.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.510
Which assembled eminent
personalities from the worlds

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.500
of culture and science, all
deeply concerned about the future

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.800
of this ancient metropolis.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.320
On the 5th of May, 1980
during the Day of Tyre,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.940 position:56%
held at UNESCO's Paris headquarters,
the International Association

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.530
to Save Tyre received
official recognition.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.210
And Maha Chalabi was
elected secretary general.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:16.530
In February 1986 the French
president awarded Maha the [French

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.220
term], a medal for
exceptional services.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:24.290
In March 1986, the French minister
of culture named her [French term].

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.590
In 1988 the Lebanese
president named her officer

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.130
of the Natural Order of the Cedar.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.110
There is much, much more to
say about this fantastic lady.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.750
But I would like her
to say a few words.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.050
Thank you.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Maha Chalabi: My
dear distinguished audience,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.520
Mr. Ambassador of Lebanon,
Mr. Ambassador

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.410
of Tunisia, ladies and gentlemen.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:26:01.200
It's a great honor that we
launch the memorial day for Tyre.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.190
Paying tribute to this very
old city within the premises

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:11.820
of the eminent cultural
monument, the Library of Congress.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:20.420
Culture has always been a solid
bond between Lebanon and the US.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:26.240
With this series of
Lebanese-American writers and poets

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.210
from Ameen Rihani, Ria
Aboulmadi [assumed spelling],

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:37.800 position:56%
Michael Nami [assumed spelling],
and the famous Gibran Khalil Gibran.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.110
Today we go further
back into the past

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:47.460
to celebrate the Phoenician
city of Tyre.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.500
It's also with great delight that
we will comb the broad spectrum

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.910
of distinguished friends who came
from around the world to take part

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:05.750 position:56%
in this glorious meeting celebrating
Tyre, the queen of the seas,

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:12.270
the ship of perfect beauty and
the mother of civilizations.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.880
Some might wonder if it's
still timely to speak

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.320
about this Phoenician city.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.210
What can we add to all
that has been related

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.260
since ancient times to present day?

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.770
Despite the significance of what
has been written and published,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.670
we are confident that a
lot is yet to be revealed.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.520
All the discoveries remain
below what the future may unveil

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.910
about the history of this
city-state that has led the basis

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:59.120
of faithful globalization,
connecting ports and cities

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.560
of the ancient world
around the Mediterranean.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:09.070
Seeking for, establishing
a faithful exchange.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:14.870
Tyre was also the homeland of
great scholars who left their marks

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:20.440
on the human past and contributed
to its progress at a time

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.630
when the ancient world
was still primitive.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:31.630
Eminent philosophers
like Thales, Pythagoras

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:36.050
and [inaudible] contributed
to the glory of Tyre.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:43.490 position:56%
Kingdom of great kings and
builders like Hiram and Hiram Abiff.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.540
Motherland of Cadmous,
Elissa and Ropa.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:54.410
Tyre has yet to unveil its
countless hidden treasures.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:29:00.600
Scientists are still monitoring
recent archaeological excavations

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:07.470
which promise to disclose
more wonders.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.930
Here in the new world, the Library

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:16.490
of Congress recognized a long
time ago the prominence of Tyre

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:21.430
and its role in the development
of human civilization.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.030 position:56%
It's by no coincidence that the name

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:30.440
of Tyre tops the main
door of this hall.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.460
Today knowledge and
wisdom take its roots

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:40.990
from the glorious ancient world
and Tyre was one of its pillars.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.100
It's a great honor for us people

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:51.170
of Phoenician descent,
a source of noble pride.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:58.880 position:56%
Our gathering on this very day,
dedicated to Tyre within the Library

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.660
of Congress would not
have been possible

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:09.560
without the concerted efforts
of the head administrator

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:16.520
of this institute, Mr. James
Billington, the librarian.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.740 position:56%
And Mrs. Mary-Jane Deeb, head of the
African and Middle East division.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:30.490
Our appreciate goes also to
all present, loyal speakers

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.760
who are supporting our action
by their research and studies.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.470
You are the real engine
for moving forward.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:49.420
Honorable Congressman Charles
Boustany, we are very grateful

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:54.710
for his tremendous support,
sponsorship and commitment

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.310
to give Tyre such a memorable day.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:06.530
And finally, I wish to
thank all the participants

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.900 position:56%
for their great work and dedication.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.820
You are the real custodians
of culture

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.180
and committed promoters
of knowledge.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.510
God bless you.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.040
[ Applause ]

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.980
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you have
heard really from the person

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.740
who has made all this possible.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:41.950
And now last but not least I would
like to introduce Richard Arndt.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.340
Richard Arndt has a
bio which is so long

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:54.800
that it was very difficult
for me to cut it down.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.210
But anyway, I'll try briefly
to say he has been the chair

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.580
of the US Committee
for the Preservation

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.890
of Ancient Tyre from 2000-2014.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.840
He is the vice president, co-chair,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.340
advisory council of
Americans for UNESCO.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.740
He's the vice president of
the Fullbright Association.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.910
He's the founding editor of the
journal Prospects and Retrospects.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.630
He is the chair of a
five-nation selection committee

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.410
for the Fullbright Prize for
international understanding.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:33.340
He is the founding chair
of the Lois Roth Endowment.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.290
He has been a member of
the steering committee

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.840
for Fullbright legacy lecture
trips and professorships

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.950
at Pembroke College at Oxford.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.250
He has been the chair

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.030
of the National Peace
Foundation between '92 and '95.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.610
And the co-chair of the
Peace Builder Award.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:53.400
He has also been the advisor of
the Toda Institute for Global Peace

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.790
and Policy Research, the
East-West Center in Hawaii.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:03.930
Over and above this he has also
had a long and successful career

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.740
in the US foreign service where
he worked between '61 and '85

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.620
with the United States Information
Agency and the Department of State

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.600
in Washington, D.C. He also served
in the Department of State Bureau

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600
of Education and Cultural Affairs

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.200
where he was deputy
director for Latin America.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.840
But he has served at the American
embassies in France, Italy, Iran,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.350
Sri Lanka, Lebanon among others.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:38.510
So I would like to invite him
to round up this first panel.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.060
[ Applause ]

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.360
&gt;&gt; Richard Arndt: We're
running out of time.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.640
I brought some notes here, but
I don't think I'll read them.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.180
As Mary-Jane has told you,
I've led a very peculiar life,

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.920
scattered all over the place.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.540
But my original job was to greet
you and to welcome you on behalf

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.430
of the American committee, which
I have been asked to re-chair

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.410
in the absence of Ambassador
David Killion who is somewhere

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:12.350
between Korea and Los Angeles
at this very moment on a plane

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.650
which is heading this way.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.640
And we hope he'll be there
in time for dinner tonight.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.450
But that's the diplomatic
life for you.

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.970
The thing that I wanted to reflect
on very quickly, very quickly,

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.020
because we have lots of
interesting things to do,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.470
is that we are living today
in the presence of one

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:32.880
of the great mansions
of the American mind.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.870
This house here, as it were,

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.740
was founded by Thomas Jefferson
I suppose among others.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.690
And there's another one down
the street which was founded

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:48.400
by an Englishman named
Smithson and two professors

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.670
from Princeton named
Henry and Spencer Baird.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.230
And these two mansions of American
intellect and mind sit here

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.950
on the mall in a town
in which the use

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:07.510
of mind is largely
turned to other pursuits.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.150
[ Laughter ]

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.240
And the result being that questions

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:19.000
like Tyre often get
lost in the melee.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.180
In contrast, for example, to
1943 when a delegation came

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.030
to President Roosevelt and said,
"You're going to invade Europe.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.280
You've got to save the monuments."

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.750
And the so the monumentsmen,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.910
and you've all see I
suppose the film now,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.980
which is one tiny little fingernail

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:39.630 position:56%
about what the monumentsmen actually
did, went along with the troops.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:45.450 position:56%
And did what they could to preserve,
to maintain, to repair in some cases

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.700
and to restore to their
rightful owners some of the works

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.530
that had been disrupted by war.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.860
Surely the same thing is
happening in the Middle East now.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.380
The war that is raging makes
almost anything serious impossible.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.110
And yet civilized people --

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.660
and I believe we're all
that in this room --

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:10.020 position:56%
should get together to do something
in order to save Tyre for posterity.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.450
Now I did actually bring
this book only to show you

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.760
that someone is doing
something about it.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.260
This is the catalog.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.440
I can hardly lift it.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.850
It's the catalog of the exhibit
called Assyria to Iberia.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.860
That's just because
it rhymed you see.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.750 position:56%
Which took place at the Metropolitan
Museum this winter and spring.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.950
It was an astonishing show.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.110
Something like 130 museums

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.920
from around the world all pooled
their things together to talk

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.850
about the Hittites and the Meads

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.580
and all these strange people
that we all know about.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.580
But we don't quite
remember where they belong.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.730 position:56%
But the Phoenicians were right there
at the bottom all the way through.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:59.370
You open this book, you look and
page after page there is Phoenicia.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.870
There is Tyre.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:07.460
There is Sour, Tyre
and Sidon and so forth.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.670
And so it's all there and
yet it hasn't been done.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.470
There has to be a book, maybe
not quite as thick as this one,

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:20.340
but at least a serious book
about Tyre one of these days.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.920
And I would hope that
after the publication

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.830
that much emerged from
this symposium.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.890
And by the way, which
should probably be prefaced

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.660
by that remarkable introduction

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.720
that Ambassador Shadig made
last night at the embassy.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.990
Which was full of interesting
insights and new ways

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.030
of looking at the Tyre problem.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:48.090 position:56%
So it's with great hope that in the
mansions of mind and America and all

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.820
over Europe -- I count six
or seven different countries

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.250
who have sent scholars
to this symposium.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.130
Whereas in the old days we used to
fight with the French all the time.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.470
Now we're friends with the French.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.810
We work together on everything.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.110
Including in this show.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.840
So let us work hard to see
what we can do as human beings,

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.900
as civilized people for the
future of the world insofar

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:19.010
as that little pocket of water,
rocks and earth called Tyre is able

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.340
to be saved for humanity.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.510
Thank you.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.730
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So
now we've concluded

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.520
with our introductory panel.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.480
I thank you very much.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.510
Let's give them a hand.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.810
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So the
first panel is entitled Cradle

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.910
of Civilization.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:57.900
And we will begin with
Dr. Leila Badre.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.340
Dr. Leila Badre is the director
of the archaeological museum

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.180
at the American University
of Beirut.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:09.620
She holds a doctorate from
the University Paris Sorbonne.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.410
She has excavated numerous
sites in Lebanon and Syria,

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:20.350
as well as in Dubai, Jamaya in
'69-70 and in Yemen as well.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.920
She has directed the
archaeological work in Tell Kazel,

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.760
Syria between '85 and 2010.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.700
And in Tyre in 2012.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.130 position:56%
She considers her major achievement,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.810
despite all these incredible
achievements,

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.910
she considers her major achievement
to be the total renovation

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:44.910
of the American University
of Beirut's museum in 2006.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:49.530
And also the creation
of a new crypt museum

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.590
at the St. George cathedral
in Lebanon.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:57.640
She is the founder of the Friends
of the AUB Museum and the founder

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.900
of the Lebanese National Committee

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.690
for the International
Council of Museums.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.220
She's also the founding member

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.860
of the Lebanese National
Heritage Association.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.180
So Dr. Leila Badre.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.060
[ Applause ]

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Leila Badre: I'm
very honored to speak

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.360
in this prestigious institution,
the Library of Congress.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.970
Thank you, Maha, for
inviting me here.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:33.910 position:56%
The subject of my presentation is
the first Phoenician temple in Tyre,

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:41.410
which we have recently
excavated in Tyre.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.190
By launching a new excavation
project in Tyre, the main objective

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:50.230
of the American University of
Beirut museum team was first

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.420
to reach the Phoenician levels of
the famous Phoenician city of Tyre.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.620
The second target was to discover
the assumed temple whose possible

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.480
location was mentioned
to us by Mr. Badouwi,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.030 position:56%
the director of antiquities in Tyre.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.800
The early temples of
Tyre have been mentioned

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.320
in several historical sources.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.240
To mention but a couple,
first the legend of Karat

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.030
from the 14th century when King
Karat stopped building his district

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.830
at the shrine of [inaudible]
of Tyre.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.920
This temple was probably
located on the mainland.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.800
Second, Hiram's builders in the
5th century BC gave a detailed

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.030
description of the temple
of Heracles, the main temple

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.500
of Tyre which had two columns.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.880
One of gold and one of emerald.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:52.190
But the most important
iconographic source where the city

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.610
of Tyre is presented in a
sculpture believed from the palace

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:02.570
of Sennacherib in Nineveh,
dated to 690 BC.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:08.160
A temple, probably that of
Melkar is depicted above the port

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:14.640
with two free-standing columns as
you see it indicated by the arrow.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:22.420
The site which we selected
to excavate is located

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.100
on the island of Phoenician Tyre.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.820
It's a known fact that ancient
Tyre was originally a rocky island,

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.210
hence it's Phoenician name, Sour.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:38.110
Alexander the Great joined it
later to the mainland by a causeway

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.740
over which sand deposits
accumulated through the years,

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.730
forming an artificial isthmus.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:53.440 position:56%
This island appears now as a
peninsula stretching out to the sea.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:03.060
What did our site of sector seven
look like before the investigation?

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:09.270
After the departure of Emir
Shihab from Tyre at the break

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:15.200
of the Lebanese War in 1975, the
sector seven which is located

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.710
within the Phoenician island

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:22.650
of Tyre had been abandoned
for nearly 40 years.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:27.380
The consequence of this
abandonment resulted in the growing

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:33.280
of a four-meter high reed forest
which covered the entire area

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.170
to be investigated by
the AUB museum team.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:43.570
To our great surprise, some
ancient walls began to appear.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:49.340
But the greater surprise was that
the site had already been excavated

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.550
by Emir Shihab some 40 years ago
without anyone knowing about it.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.110
Not a single report or
archive were available

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.220
to indicate this earlier discovery.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:08.010
Yet in the process of my research
I discovered the following lines

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.650
written by Shihab in 1979
of the first Phoenician

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.870
and Punic Congress in Rome.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.720
He mentioned among other results
of his excavations in Tyre

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.710
in 1973 a large Phoenician monument

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:27.980
with a 10-meter long wall
that we will show later.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:33.380
It's obvious that Emir Shihab
did not recognize then the nature

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.520
of this vast monument
as he mentioned it.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.920
Our luck was that this
monument clearly refers

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.680
to the temple we were
about to excavate.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.610
Our task was therefore
to rediscover the site

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.330
and to complete Shihab's
excavation in view

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.450
of analyzing this important
monument, documenting it,

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.930
interpreting its function
and attempting

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:09.230
to determine its historical
chronology.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:18.040
The temple in sector seven was
located under the residential area

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:23.630
of the classical period, which
extended further to the northwest.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:27.220
What did we actually discover?

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.600
From the first two weeks and
after sketching a working plan

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:37.330
of the archaeological remains, we
could already assume that we were

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:42.880
in front of a temple due to the
presence of a massive construction

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.570
which could clearly and

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.020
yet tentatively be
identified as a podium.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:56.360 position:56%
The temple has a rectangular shape,
21 meters long and 6.50 meters wide.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:02.050
Its axis is oriented
northwest/southeast.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.480
Several structures were
found within the temple.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.760
First of all, the podium which
is two meter high structure.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.710
It consists of a foundation
course, surrounded by three courses

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:18.740
of very large blocks
in hard sandstone.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.830
The setting follows the structure
and [inaudible] which is well-known

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.970
in the Phoenician architecture.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.800
The blocks of this podium can
be compared in size to those

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.540 position:56%
of the podium of the Eshmun temple
that you can see on the lower photo.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:47.230
Which are close in length to ours
but are double in width and height

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.660
with a weight of two
tons and a half.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.740
Those of Eshmun.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.620
The Eshmun temple is a
gigantic one by its size.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.970
It is inspired by the
Babylonian Ziggurat.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:07.130
It is 22 meters high, but its
podium alone has been preserved.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.960
None of the temple
has been preserved.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:16.830
Our Tyre temple blocks were
constructed in the nearby quarries

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.980
which are partly under
the seawater today.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:28.170
Two sings that are
shown on the podium.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:33.550
One letter is M like
the McDonald M, and Z,

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.030
were incised on the upper block.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.780
These are probably the
signatures of the masons

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.900
which were used for
accounting purpose.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.230
Similar signs have been identified

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:50.670
on a contemporary documented
building in Byblos.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:54.910
On top of the podium,
an altar was placed.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:48:00.100
It is a very large monolithic
single-stone slab made

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.820
out of marine limestone.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:10.390
This altar presents a wavy surface
which may suggest hypothetically

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:14.810
that it was used intentionally
in order to make the flowing

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.900
of the sacrificial blood possible.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:25.340
A massive structure
located on the eastern end

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:34.050
of the temple is built opposite and
symmetrical to the podium you see

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.190
on the massive structure.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:40.500
And the podium on the upper part.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.530
One could imagine that this
structure could have been the

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:49.220
foundation of a massive
structure, maybe a tower.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:54.940
And that this tower may have
had a niche in which the deity

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.980
of the temple would have been
placed facing the podium.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.820
This was the case in
many oriental temples.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:09.430
The plan of the temple is
indicated by a large rectangle.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.760
The average preservation
of the walls is one course,

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.950
but sometimes six courses.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.910
They are made out of fine sandstone
blocks nearly half size compared

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.410
to the blocks of the podium.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.760
And this is how we could
immediately identify the podium.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.710
Because it's totally much
bigger blocks than the walls.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:39.550
The walls are generally set
in regular structure pattern

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:43.110
as you see in the lower photo.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:47.730
The two long walls of the temple
are built against the western wall

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.610
which is the western
limit of the temple.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:57.910
This view shows the inner
façade of the western wall.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.660
Its external façade is
beautifully decorated

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.420
with a long continuous
horizontal phrase

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.160
of what we call Egyptian courses.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.350
It consists of five
preserved courses

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.880
with finely dressed sandstone
blocks tightly set together

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:22.140
with very thin joints and
without any bonding material.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.650
The same architectural decorative
Egyptian gorges are known

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.830
from the Phoenician temple in
Amrit on the coast of Syria

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:38.480
where it decorates the
upper part of its towers.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:46.280
Similarly, at the Eshmun temple
near Sidon, the same type of blocks

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.320
with the Egyptian gorges
have been noted

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.890
by our team during a site
visit to the Eshmun temple.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:01.070
Some hydraulic installations,
wells and basins which are common

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:05.750
in the Phoenician temples have
been found around our temple.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:11.190
They testified to the important
role that water rituals played

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:15.960
in Phoenician therapeutic
cults as it is emphasized

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.780
in both Eshmun and Amrit temples.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:29.740
This basin has four steps
that leads to its bottom.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:41.090
It could have been used for
purposes in relation to the temple.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.990
The main problem we faced was

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:47.600
to find the temple entrance,
which we finally found.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.590
About the center of the
western wall we found this setup

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:58.010
or these structures.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:03.630
The lowest platform which will
present the earliest circulation

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:09.000
level of the temple built with
huge blocks about one meter long.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.170
It leads into a two-meter wide
opening with a door socket.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:20.940 position:56%
The width of which exists throughout
various areas of the entrance.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.860
The middle platform is built
directly on top of the earlier one,

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.540
and it is also dotted
with a door socket.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:36.610
A third paved platform entrance
was added to the two previous ones.

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:42.800
It is set between two
walls which were built

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.510
between the two lateral walls
of the temple and which served

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.930
as arch support for
this paved floor.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:56.010
We suppose as a hypothesis that
this pavement could have extended

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:57.360
with a slight ramp.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.200 position:56%
You can see it on the lower picture.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.250
Towards the east to
reach the embossed level

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:07.380
of the first course of the podium.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.370
With this hypothesis it is
possible to imagine the entrance

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.730
of the temple from the west side,

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:17.280
not the east as it
is usually the case

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.760
in the Phoenician or
oriental temples.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.930
This would lead directly
to the altar level in view

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:29.120
of the execution of the sacrifice.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:34.280
A kiln is built against the
eastern façade of the podium.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.940
Two oblique altar stands placed

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:41.710
in an inverted V shape
mark its doorway opening.

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:45.580
Black traces can be
seen on its upper part.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.890
And gray ashes are
found near the doorway.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:55.070
An important burn deposit
mixed with ashes

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.050
and small charcoal bits was
found opposite the kiln.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:02.690
A small section of this deposit
was collected and sifted,

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:06.780
producing 17 buckets
of small animal bones.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:11.470
It seems pretty obvious that
the animals of rather small

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:15.870
or medium size, which were
sacrificed on top of the altar,

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:20.030
were probably thrown directly
in the cremation kiln.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:27.740
The presence of a few items found
around the temple may be considered

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.770 position:56%
as offerings to the temple divinity.

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.710
Among these, one [inaudible] found

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:41.000
by our colleague Dr. Eddie
Curel outside the temple.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.070
The presence of few
items may be considered

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:59.630 position:56%
as offerings to the temple divinity.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:05.050 position:56%
One [inaudible], as I said, found by
Dr. Curel, two large stone anchors,

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:10.400
a few lamp fragments, not to
forget the burnt animal bones found

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.540
in the deposit in the
vicinity of the kiln.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:20.870
All these are extra evidence that
our monument is indeed a temple.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.210
Chronological conclusions.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:27.360
As we have indicated
earlier, in the total absence

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.820
of stratigraphic records and the
lack of pottery materials found

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.510
in C2, it's rather
difficult at this stage

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:39.160
to draw any final chronological
conclusions.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.860
Because most of the
pottery is mixed,

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:49.320
we can only draw some
post-antiquan periods, the end.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.180
From the Persian to
the Hellenistic period.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.250
On this basis, we may
tentatively conclude

00:55:56.250 --> 00:56:00.900
that the temple itself
belongs to the Persian period.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:06.270
This dating is enhanced by the
common architectural features

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:11.860
and masonry techniques which are
known from the neighboring temples

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:18.130
of the region, especially from the
Eshmun temple in Sidon and that

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:22.590 position:56%
of Armit in Syria as stated earlier.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:30.840
The underwater sounding [inaudible]
a group of Phoenician pottery.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:36.500
This explains the large number of
iron tools that have been collected

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.180
in various points, but not in C2.

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:46.200 position:56%
This preliminary assessment of the
pottery may hint to a continuous use

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:52.790
of this temple retaining its sacral
character from the Achaemenid

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:57.730
to the Hellenistic period and
possibly including the early phases

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:01.120
of the Roman occupation as well.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:06.910 position:56%
As it stands and with all the very
good results we have just presented,

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:13.070
we may conclude that our newly
rediscovered temple is the first

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.250
Phoenician temple in Tyre

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:19.920
and the first complete
Phoenician temple in Lebanon.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.610
Thank you.

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:23.990
[ Appllause ]

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:27.750
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: We will now
have a presentation in French,

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:32.570
but we have simultaneous
translation.

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:39.000
And this is a presentation by
Dr. Naji Karam, an archaeologist,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.900
former director of art
and archaeology department

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.040
of the Lebanese University.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.420
The scientific director MCP
research institute of Lebanon.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:52.350
Dr. Naji Karam holds a Ph. D in
archaeology from the Institute

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:55.530
of Archaeology and Human
Science University.

00:57:55.530 --> 00:58:00.860
Former professor of the Phoenician
archaeology department and director

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.770
of art and archaeology
in the department

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.910
of the Lebanese University
second division.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.140
He is the director of the Church
Cultural Heritage Committee

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.440
in Lebanon.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.460
A member of the Lebanese
organization [French term].

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:18.970
And he is the scientific director
of the institute for research

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:23.460
on Canaanite, Phoenician
and Punic civilization.

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.320
So Dr. Naji Karan, if you
would like to come up.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.620
Thank you.

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.510
[ Applause ]

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:44.050
[ Speaking French ]

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:45.390
&gt;&gt; So, ladies and gentlemen,

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:48.990
I am going to translate what
Dr. Naji Karam is going to talk

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:52.260
about today and he will give
you a chronological description

00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:00.510
of the prehistory and
history of the city of Tyre.

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:27.440
[ Speaking French ]

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.560
&gt;&gt; So the history of the
city of Tyre is rare.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.110 position:56%
We do not know a lot about the city.

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:39.720
And Dr. Karam is going to
give us a brief description

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.910
of the various archaeological

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:48.510
and stratigraphic layers
that are available.

00:59:48.510 --> 01:00:03.060
[ Speaking French ]

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.820
&gt;&gt; So the first phase
that he will mention is

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.720
from prehistory to history.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:16.510
So we are talking about the first
phase of settlement in Tyre.

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:46.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.080
&gt;&gt; So the first phase that actually
has been proven archaeologically

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.380
to exist goes back

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:57.190
to the Chalcolithic period
which is around 4000 BC.

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.990
And the Lebanese University
was given

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:11.510
in the '70's an archaeological
find that dates to that period.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:24.540
[ Speaking French ]

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:32.540
&gt;&gt; So a site known as [French name]
proves this archaeological find

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.710
which is a pottery
remain, pottery base.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:39.510
And he will describe it for us.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:02:01.120
[ Speaking French ]

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.350
&gt;&gt; So the second phase
is the bronze age period,

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.460
the early bronze age period.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:12.230
Which fits together with the
ancient Greek historian Herodotus

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:21.510
and it dates back to
the year 2750 BC.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:37.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.270
&gt;&gt; So an archeological
trench was dug

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:55.170
that reveals these various phases
from the 1970's that goes back

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.510
to the third millennium BC.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:12.730
[ Speaking French ]

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:16.890
&gt;&gt; In that period, Tyre begins
to develop its urban character

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:25.510
and it has two main ports, an
Egyptian one and a Phoenician one.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:42.140
[ Speaking French ]

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:47.140
&gt;&gt; There is an inscription in
Ebla in Syria in the site known

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:56.510
as [French name] and it
dates to the year 2300 BC.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:04:30.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.550
&gt;&gt; So the next phase
that we're moving

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:37.370
to is the middle bronze
age, the new bronze age.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:42.200
Which indicates that in the second
millennium BC there was an invasion

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.140
of Amorites in Tyre.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.210
Which indicated that
the city was plundered

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:53.510
and attacked heavily
by the Amorites.

01:04:53.510 --> 01:05:05.190
[ Speaking French ]

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:10.340
&gt;&gt; After the departure of the
Amorites, the city of Tyre

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:18.510 position:56%
and especially the port goes through
a peaceful phase of existence.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:26.310
[ Speaking French ]

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:31.500
&gt;&gt; So the third phase
is the late bronze age,

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:37.510
which is in the 15th century BC.

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:58.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:04.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So during that period in the 15th
century we have an Egyptian invasion

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:13.510 position:56%
that begins and several phases of it
and they last for several centuries.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:31.130
[ Speaking French ]

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:36.990
&gt;&gt; So during this phase there is
evidence of a continuous change

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:44.090
in the life of Tyre between
a peaceful and a war phase.

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:49.600
And in [French name] there is
evidence on tablets of the life

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.560
of the correspondence that
took place between Tyre

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.510
and this other city in Syria.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:06.050
[ Speaking French ]

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:12.110
&gt;&gt; The next phase is the early iron
age which is right at the beginning

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:19.510
of the invasion of the sea
people in the year 1200 BC.

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:28.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:34.480
&gt;&gt; The local people will begin
to develop an incredible economy

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.240
and this would be the golden
age of the Phoenicians.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:08:03.220
[ Speaking French ]

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:09.150
&gt;&gt; The dominance of Tyre in the
year 1000 BC rises to such a degree

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:14.590
that it expands towards Sidon and
there's a fusion between the cities

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:21.510
and Tyre dominates the
coast in that region.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:32.060
[ Speaking French ]

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:39.560
&gt;&gt; So we move towards the 7th
century where there is an invasion

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:46.510
on [French name] on Tyre
with remains in Tyre itself.

01:08:46.510 --> 01:09:09.140
[ Speaking French ]

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.160
&gt;&gt; And then we have the
Persians who invade the region

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.830
and invade Tyre in
the 6th century BC.

01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.630
And leave their traces
all the way down to Egypt.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:36.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.790
&gt;&gt; So we move towards the Greek
period, the 5th century BC,

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:44.300
the 4th century BC until we reach
the phase of Alexander the Great,

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.240
who besieged the city of six
months and it took him six months

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:55.510
to be able to take
Tyre, to take the city.

01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:11.580
[ Speaking French ]

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.380
&gt;&gt; And then we move
towards the Roman period

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:19.400
where Tyre becomes very
prosperous with the Pax Ramona.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:25.960
And during that phase Tyre
adopts urban characteristics

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:32.850
of a Roman city, including
a hippodrome, an aqua duct,

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:36.510
theater and so on and so forth.

01:10:36.510 --> 01:11:00.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.860
&gt;&gt; And we move then to
the early medieval phase

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.780
to the Byzantine phase, where the
economy of Tyre continues to rise.

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:13.280
And it becomes a very important
port for the city of Damascus

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.510
and there's a very strong
connection between both cities.

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:39.310
[ Speaking French ]

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:44.310
&gt;&gt; During the Crusader Period,
we have an increase in the rise

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:49.860 position:56%
of the prosperity of Tyre and there
are 93 villages surrounding the city

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.080
and there is a Byzantine
church that was built there.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.230
And the port itself becomes a
very important strategic location

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:04.510
for the crusaders in communication
with their original homeland.

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:20.580
[ Speaking French ]

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:26.470
&gt;&gt; And by the end of the
Crusader Period, in the year 1291,

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:32.640
we have the expelling of
the crusaders and arrival

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.850
of the Arabs, who take
over the city.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:41.510
And the city goes down
in liturgy and decay.

01:12:41.510 --> 01:13:17.040
[ Speaking French ]

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.080
&gt;&gt; And so we continue
all the way 700 years

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.090
in time towards the 20th
century and we would

01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:27.610
like to mention Earnest
Renol in the 1860's

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:34.420
who described the city has having
had a very prosperous past,

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:42.510
but for some reason it has
completely fallen into decay.

01:13:42.510 --> 01:14:02.080
[ Speaking French ]

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.710
&gt;&gt; And so in the -- could
you repeat the year please?

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:16.250
1943 with the independence, Tyre
begins to appear once again.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:26.510
And a focus on the history
is taken into action.

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:38.320
[ Speaking French ]

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:46.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tyre requires urgent and a lot of
attention in order to take its place

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:51.980
in its history and to be
given the right degree

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:57.510
of importance that it deserves.

01:14:57.510 --> 01:15:00.070
[ Applause ]

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.370
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Thank you very much.

01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:03.080
And thank you for the translation.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.430
That was spontaneous and wonderful.

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.940
So we really appreciate
your help, Aliya.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.170
And now we move to
our third speaker,

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:15.350
Dr. Francoise Briquel Chatonnet,

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:19.670
research director at
the [French name].

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:22.300
She's a deputy director

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:28.040
of the Eastern Mediterranean
Laboratory in Paris.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.470
She works on the Phoenician
history in the first millennium BC

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:34.520
and on the country of
eastern Christians.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.350
She's a member in the
[French name] in Paris.

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:46.090
[ Applause ]

01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:47.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Francoise Briquel
Chatonnet: Hello.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:49.580
First allow me to thank everyone.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.500
I am very honored to be here.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.380
I'm very pleased.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:16:01.420 position:56%
And so I want to thank everyone
either in the Tyre committee or here

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:07.420
in the library who have
made this event possible.

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:11.430
Speaking of the Phoenician
African diffusion that I was asked

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:17.270
to do is a huge subject that could
well have occupied the whole day.

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:22.070
So I will only be able to give a
few insights on this phenomenon.

01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:27.960
The diffusion of the
Phoenicians is well known.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.770
We are used to speaking
of the Phoenicians

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:34.030
as the inventers of the alphabet.

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:36.190
The subject of this
naturally takes place

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:39.150
in a series of talks about Tyre.

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:46.120
But I need first to give some
details on how I see this issue.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.300
The alphabetic system was invented

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.780
in the northwest [inaudible]
somewhere between Egypt

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:58.870
and [inaudible] in the middle
of the second millennium BC.

01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:01.200
The exact place, time

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.660
and circumstances are still
objectively questioned.

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:12.310 position:56%
But anyway, it is a period before
what we call Phoenician engineering.

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:15.840
And in the span of
time and evolution,

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.780
took place before we can call
the oldest properly Phoenician

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:26.800
inscription, that is the
royal inscription of Byblos.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.320
One is that of Elabal.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.830
It's a good representation.

01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:40.100
You have the Phoenician
inscription around the [inaudible].

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.880 position:56%
Here I will use this inscription as
a starting point and I will not take

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.770
into account the diffusion

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:50.930
of the alphabetic script
before the first millennium BC.

01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:56.110
That is for example south Arabian
branch of the alphabet tree.

01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:02.010
The second point I wanted
to stress is the meaning

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.060
and purpose of this diffusion.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.890
And of the form it took.

01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:12.220
What is clear is that purpose
of the inventor or inventors

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:18.560
of the alphabet was to conduct
local exchange without translation

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:26.530 position:56%
and convey local myth and literature
in their own language and script.

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:30.460
In a region where Egyptian
and Acadian languages

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:33.950
and scripts had been
used for centuries,

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:37.060
it was a question of identity.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.800
Which was the origin of
the invention and use

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.360
of the alphabetic script.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.070
Language as the expression
of a culture.

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:53.030
But also of a collective
identity of a group.

01:18:53.030 --> 01:19:01.690
The diffusion of the
Phoenician alphabet witnesses the

01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:03.280
same phenomenon.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.100
It can be interpreted in terms
of promotion of identities,

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.620
but also of meeting of cultures.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:17.350
It is this phenomenon that I will
illustrate through three issues.

01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:22.550
First, diffusion of Phoenician
writing outside Phoenicia.

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:28.770
Second the question of
bilingualism and bigraphism,

01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:31.480
writing with two scripts.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.520
And then the birth of
new alphabets stemming

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.300
from the Phoenician alphabet.

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:46.390
So first, diffusion of Phoenician
writing outside Phoenicia.

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:50.090
When speaking of the expansion
of the Phoenician world,

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.340
people only think of
the Mediterranean area.

01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:00.280
But this expansion went all around
Phoenicia and it can be illustrated

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:06.850
with these inscriptions made
by Phoenicians or by others.

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:11.110
And my first example will be
this inscription in Gingerly

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:15.380
from the 9th century
in the Luwian world.

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:16.820
A local king.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.820
So it's south of modern Turkey.

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:26.230
A local king of the
culture [inaudible] culture.

01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:31.430
And the local king with
the Luwian [inaudible].

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:38.300
It's a witness of the adoption of
the Phoenician language and script.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.710
The inscription is in Phoenician
language and Phoenician script.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:46.450
Probably for questions of prestige.

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.710
A local language in script existed

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:56.150
and we will see it,
but was not used there.

01:20:56.150 --> 01:21:03.880 position:56%
So we are still wondering why this
king did write in Phoenician and not

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:09.460
in his local language and script.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:16.340
A totally different
example is this seal

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:21.210
with Phoenician --
as shown by his name.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:27.470
And this seal was found
in Khorsabad, Assyria.

01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:31.870
It shows the presence of
a Phoenician individual

01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:37.210
of very high rank in
society having his own seal.

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:41.870
It was found underneath a
[inaudible] in Khorsabad.

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:46.530
And was probably not lost
accidentally but put intentionally

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:51.310
as a trace of the presence
of the owner.

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:55.000
So here it's really
Phoenician script done

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.360 position:56%
by a Phoenician and left in Assyria.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:05.880
This diffusion of Phoenician script
went through the Mediterranean.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:13.630
This example is an old Phoenician
inscription which attests links

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.850
to the homeland with the evocation

01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:22.500
of Lebanon [inaudible]
from the 8th century.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:28.100
And then to the west Mediterranean.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:35.620
This inscription of [inaudible] in
Sardinia is a strange inscription

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.450
and the meaning is still
a matter of debate.

01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:41.830
But anyway, it is Phoenician
language

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:44.540
and script from the 8th century.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:52.450
And to [inaudible] all the way
in the 8th century before Christ,

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:55.530
in Sardinia it's important.

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:59.930
It was probably not to be read,
because who would read that?

01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:02.070
I mean there were very few people

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:08.960
who could read Phoenician
in Sardinia at the time.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:14.510
It would more be to affirm
Phoenician presence through it.

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:20.160
It was a question of
a Phoenician presence.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.580
And once more, a question
of identity.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:27.540
Then the Phoenician
culture was inserted

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:32.490
in west Mediterranean
especially in [inaudible]

01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:36.150
and the culture and
script became Punic.

01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:39.520
This is a scale of [inaudible]

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:47.100
and on the right an official
inscription of the city of Katago.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:55.800
This pretty variant of
Phoenician can be compared

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.330
to have a comparison more speaking

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:05.210
to what [inaudible] French
is to French from France.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.780
In this case, a link is preserved
between language and script.

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:19.270 position:56%
So there was an evolution, but early
within the Phoenician ambience.

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:25.230
After the fall and destruction
of Katago, Punic language

01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:28.640
and scripts were preserved
for several centuries

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:33.330
in the Numidian regions
of Tunisia and Algeria,

01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:36.150
in Sardinia and in Libya.

01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:39.000
It was also there and an admission

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.380
of local identity within
the Roman Empire.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:48.490
But I will illustrate it
with something less known.

01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:58.630
An inscription on an [inaudible]
found near a shipwreck near St.

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:00.850
Tropez in France.

01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:05.660
With a name probably of the
owner of the ship still inscribed

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.890
in Punic in the first century BC.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:12.840
What you have at the
bottom is a copy

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.370
of inscriptions of some sailors.

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:23.880
And all these words were inscribed
in different languages in script.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.040
Notably, these in Punic.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.480
Which shows that crews were as
cosmopolitan as they are now.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:38.020
So that was the diffusion
of Phoenician scripts.

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:42.530
Then I come to my second point,
bilingualism and bigraphism.

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:45.940
That means inscriptions
in two different languages

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.970
and two different scripts.

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:49.810
Here we have another phenomenon.

01:25:49.810 --> 01:25:57.130
The meeting between cultures and
affirmation of a double identity.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:06.630
This inscription I go back in
time and go back to [inaudible].

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:12.400
Very near one we saw before.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:20.370
A confrontation between
Phoenician and Luwian inscriptions

01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:23.020
in a strictly Luwian context.

01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:25.150
So we have very big inscription.

01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:29.410
As for the moment this particular
inscription is the longest

01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:33.200
Phoenician inscription ever found.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.370
But it was bilingual and at the
bottom you have the Phoenician

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:44.280
inscription and at the top
part the Luwian inscription.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:55.790
And it was this inscription that
led to the decipherment of Luwian.

01:26:55.790 --> 01:27:00.780
So here we have someone in the
strictly Luwian environment

01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:07.350
who wrote the longest Phoenician
inscription every known.

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:12.410
Why? That's a good question.

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:18.210
Another inscription well known,
whose context is better understood.

01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:25.550
The Persian inscription, which
three tablets, gold tablets.

01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:30.570
Two in Etruscan and one in Punic.

01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:33.760
It was in the context
of a political alliance

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.790
between the king of
Chiri and Katago.

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:41.850
So the king of Chiri made
an inscription and also said

01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:45.990
that he was a devotee of Eshdat.

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:52.700
And then Greece was also a place

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.210
where there were meeting
of two cultures.

01:27:55.210 --> 01:28:01.920
Here is a [inaudible]
epitaph of a private person.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.810
A Phoenician died in
Greece in Athens.

01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:07.960
The inscription is in Athens.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:14.010
So that is a double inscription
in Greek to be led by locals.

01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:17.990
And in Phoenician to be
read by his own community.

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:26.960
But what you see is Phoenician
is first at the top and is longer

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.960
than the Greek counterpart.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:41.510
And then in Malta a dedication
for two different cultures.

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:48.050
[ Inaudible ]

01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:51.080
Here also Phoenician
comes first and is longer.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.640
It was dedicated by
Phoenician's brothers

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.410
who wrote everything in
Phoenician and Greek.

01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:07.480
The third part, the birth
of new alphabets stemming

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.690
from the Phoenician Alphabet.

01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:15.060
Either through systematic and
[inaudible] process of adaptation

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:20.220
and innovation or through a
progressive and natural evolution.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.770
I will only concentrate on two main
branches which were very productive

01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:29.450
and gave all the main
modern alphabets.

01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:34.020
On the first part, the
creation of the Greek alphabet,

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:39.210 position:56%
symbolized by the history of Cadmous
bringing the Phoenician letters,

01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:42.510
Phoenician gramata, to the Greeks.

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.390
A Greek tradition which
Phoenician adopted on their coins.

01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:52.540
And I think we will see them later.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:55.380
What we can see now
is the possibility

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.190
of a fusion intermediate
is now a subject

01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:01.050
of this fusion among specialists.

01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:04.970
So it goes to the oldest Greek

01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:12.330
and we only show this oldest Greek
inscription from the 8th century.

01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:17.390
What we see is that the form
of the letters is very close

01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:19.420
to the letters of Phoenician
alphabet.

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:27.730
It didn't have any evolution at the
time for those Phoenician letters.

01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:34.760
But the system is already
a new one with vowels.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.320
That was the main invention
of the Greeks.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:45.360
And for example, from right to left
you can see [inaudible] with an O

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:56.450
and this aleph already as an R.
And this alphabet was the origin

01:30:56.450 --> 01:31:03.850
of the Etruscan alphabet, ancestor
of our modern Latin alphabet.

01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:05.150
So that is well known.

01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:10.540
I will go quickly to the other
branch because I don't need

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:14.230
to explain the Latin alphabet here.

01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:19.040 position:56%
The second branch which is also very
interesting, perhaps less known,

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.300
is the evolution to
the Aramaic alphabet.

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:29.550
Here we don't have an
innovation, a fundamental change,

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:32.640
as there was in the Greek alphabet.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.180
It's a progressive evolution
from the Phoenician alphabet

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:40.720
without any revolutionary change.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.800
Here are inscriptions
of the 9th century.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:51.150
So about the same time as
the inscriptions of Byblos

01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.460
of which I showed one
at the beginning.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.560
An inscription of Hazal
and the second one

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.620
of Zaku mentioned in Baghdad.

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.820
Hazal and Baghdad are
well known from the Bible.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:08.210
So this way we can give
dates to these inscriptions.

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:09.740
9th century.

01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:15.030
The alphabet is exactly the same
as in Phoenician inscription.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:17.630
I mean, we can distinguish
the language,

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:22.050
but not the script of that time.

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:27.090
Then the alphabet was
used by Assyrians

01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:30.020
within the Assyrian empire.

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:33.240
It was diffused in the near east

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.130
through the deportation
of Aramaic population.

01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:42.160
And this fresco from [inaudible]
is very symbolic of the fact

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.190
that the Assyrian empire
used both a system --

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:52.750
cuneiform on clay tablets on
the right and Aramaic alphabet

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:56.840
on raw material on the left.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:06.470 position:56%
And then what was the Phoenician
alphabet was even written on tablets

01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:09.530
within the Assyrian civilization.

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:15.870
This from the Louvre.

01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.430
Yes, I am going quickly.

01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:22.090
So it diffused all around Asia.

01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:28.040
And I will just give you
examples with these inscriptions

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.550
which were found quite recently
on the antiquity market.

01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:39.090
And it's Aramaic inscription from
[inaudible] region corresponding

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:43.760
with north Afghanistan
and Uzbekistan.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.730
And it's an illustration
of the [inaudible] empire.

01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:50.550
So four centuries before Christ.

01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:57.050
And around 300 BC Aramaic
was used by Ashakur,

01:33:57.050 --> 01:34:04.430
founder of the first Indian Empire,
the Maurya Empire that he converted

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:07.280
to Buddhism and it's
written in Aramaic.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.570
A later variant of Aramaic,

01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:20.730
this script from Odessa
diffused to central Asia.

01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:22.030
You have the [inaudible].

01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:24.930
And up to China.

01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:29.820
The very famous [inaudible] from
the 8th century written in Chinese

01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:36.800
and Syriac, so Aramaic with
what was the original for that.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.610
At the end of antiquity,
the alphabetical system

01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:44.980 position:56%
of script was used from the Atlantic
coast of Europe and North Africa

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:48.100
to central Asia and
then China and India.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:56.100
And at the end I want you to
see also this alphabet coming

01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:01.150
to other languages and scripts.

01:35:01.150 --> 01:35:06.020
Alphabetic Aramaic used
in the Iranian context

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.420
in the 1st century
AD in central Asia.

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:16.910
And so that is the Aramaic
alphabet writing Iranian.

01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:22.350
Then transferred to
write an Indian language

01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:23.750
and becoming an Indian [inaudible].

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:30.520
And it's normal in
alphabets, but it's stemming

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.490
from Phoenician alphabet
through Aramaic.

01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:39.620
And last but not least, the
birth of the Arab script.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:45.980
With this inscription which
is also this picture tribute

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:49.940
to a friend Eric Gubal,
because this monument is

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:52.100
in [Foreign name] in Brussels.

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:58.870
This is an inscription 512
AD on the lintel of a church.

01:35:58.870 --> 01:36:03.040
And it was first dated
Arabic inscription.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:08.650
So you just see on the
top a Syriac inscription

01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:14.330
but just on the lower part.

01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:19.160
That is the oldest dated
Arabic inscription every known.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.490
Dated I mean.

01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:24.690
A trilingual inscription
[inaudible] Greek.

01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:30.010
So with this diffusion from
Phoenician to Arabic we come

01:36:30.010 --> 01:36:34.880
to the fact that Phoenician
was really the origin

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.350
of what is very important
in our civilization.

01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:40.050
Thank you.

01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.090
[ Applause ]

01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:44.730
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So
now Dr. Elizabeth Fontan,

01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:46.650
the honorary chief
curator of Heritage

01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:52.100
in France, will be speaking.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.540
After a stint at the National
Ceramic Museum of Sevres

01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:01.770 position:56%
and the generally respected museums,
the bulk of her career has been

01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:06.890
in the department of eastern
antiquities of the Louvre Museum.

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.800
Where she was responsible
for collections on Assyria,

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.810
Phoenicia, Palestine -- thank you.

01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:19.860 position:56%
Jordan, as well as those on Syria
and Cyprus in the 1st millennium BC.

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:25.600
She was a scientific exhibition
curator from Khorsabad to Paris.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.190
And the discovery of Assyria
at Louvre Museum in 1993.

01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:35.150
And from here to Carthage, the
Mediterranean of the Phoenicians

01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:39.260
and the Arab World
Institute in Paris in 2007.

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.560
She is one of the editors

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.340
of the catalog traditional
Phoenician sculpture at the Louvre,

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:47.780
and the department of
eastern antiquities.

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.780
She has worked in the international
cooperation program of the museum

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:56.610
with Jordan, Syria and Palestine,
with a lecture at the Louvre.

01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:01.140
Her publications in preparation
include the Ivories of [inaudible],

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:07.100
Syria and the consuls,
collectors and traders in Sidon.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.190
And we will have a big presentation
after which we will have a break.

01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:13.510
Okay. Thank you.

01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:16.040
[ Applause ]

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Elizabeth Fontan: Ladies
and gentlemen, it is a great honor

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.640
for me to speak in this place.

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.020
The first pieces from
Phoenicia entered the Louvre

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:27.280
in the middle of the 19th century.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:32.610
They came from Amrit,
Byblos and Sidon.

01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:36.360
The sarcophagus of
Eshmunazar was presented

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:42.800
to the Louvre by [inaudible]
in 1855.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:50.660
The collection from Tyre was
assembled a few years later

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:53.170
into three different ways.

01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:57.510
Scientific missions,
acquisition from local dealers

01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:02.550
and antiquaries and
official excavation.

01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:11.170 position:56%
The most important of the scientific
missions and the most famous is

01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:14.310
of course the one led me
Earnest Renan [French word].

01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:25.520
Renan was given by Emperor
Napoleon III a scientific mission

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.540
for the purpose of
conducting epigraphic

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:34.070
and archaeological research
in Palestine and in Syria.

01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:38.250
This mission happened to take
place right at the same time

01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:44.640
as the French military expedition
sent to protect the Christians.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.950
Renan sailed on October 21st,

01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:56.210
1860 and left Beirut the
following year on October 10th.

01:39:56.210 --> 01:40:04.270
He decided to split his research
into four campaigns from north

01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:12.380
to south, Rad and Amrit,
Byblos, Sidon and Tyre.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:19.830
He wishes to include in each
campaign the most important places

01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:24.750
and to survey as completely
as possible the surroundings.

01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:30.250
With the help of the French
army, especially the marine,

01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:34.390
this program was achieved
within six months.

01:40:35.770 --> 01:40:45.180
Renan started the exploration
of Tyre on March 4th 1861.

01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:49.120
He knew it would be difficult
to reach the deepest levels.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.880
The ancient city was
covered by the modern town.

01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:02.340
And he was afraid having no
reward in this prestigious site.

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:08.660
The oldest item found in
Tyre is this [inaudible] head

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:17.250
of a [inaudible] discovered
in an eight-meter deep trench

01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:21.140
on the location of the old Tyre.

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:25.310
This head was inserted in the
body made on the [inaudible].

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:30.730
See for comparison
figurine now in the Louvre,

01:41:30.730 --> 01:41:32.790
dating from the iron age too.

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:37.670
That is 8-7th century BC.

01:41:37.670 --> 01:41:40.740
Renan wished to explore
continental town

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.260
on the mainland called [inaudible].

01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:49.740
But he was not successful
in the surrounding area.

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:58.010
At Naphid he discovered a
fragmentary marble sarcophagus

01:41:58.010 --> 01:42:01.620
decorated with figures in
the Phoenician tradition.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:10.510
Caesar on the lid,
mixed with Roman motifs.

01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:23.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.250
In April, Renan started excavating
Umel-Ahmed, or as they said,

01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:31.840
Umel-Ahamed, ancient
[inaudible] situated

from [inaudible] to
be sent to Paris.

01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:08.330
Since 2012 it is on display in
the new late antiquity galleries

for the first time in
its complete composition.

01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:24.370
Another scientific mission provides
the Louvre with a piece from Tyre.

Albert Immanuel Gilbreth called
[inaudible] realized three missions.

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:40.250
During the third one in 1864-1865
he brought a stain showing a

veiled woman.

01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:47.490
It was supposed to come from
Tyre, but from the stylistic point

of view it was [inaudible].

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.540
Two families from Southern
Lebanon played a significant role

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.540
in the constitution of the
Phoenician collection of the Louvre

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:08.440
in the second half
of the 19th century

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:14.510

when he was a consul
for several countries.

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:33.900
France, Spain but also
the United States.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:38.980
His son moved to Sidon in 1853.

Vice consul of Franc, he was very
active in the search of antiquities.

01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:48.070
And he discovered the
sarcophagus of Eshmunanzar.

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:51.740
Later, he went to work
for the [French name]

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:53.220
and gave this marble relic

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.400

of the sons, Michel,
Sigmund and Ferdinand,

01:46:15.810 --> 01:46:23.190
were involved in the antiquity
market, mostly in their hometown.

01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:26.280
They didn't claim to be scholars.

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:34.900
Their trade was a way
of earning their living.

01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:38.810
They provided [inaudible]
with small artifacts.

01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:42.060 position:56%
Glass flasks, [inaudible] a fragment
of a stone basin which is said

in the vicinity of
the Egyptian harbor.

01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:52.030
It is inscribed with
a Phoenician name.

01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:55.100
They also saw [inaudible]

by the French scholar [French name]
to continue the site exploration.

01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:13.830
They found a series of male statues

Veiled woman and a
couple facing each other.

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:19.900
This type of structure
was unknown to Renan.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:33.050
And we still do not know the
precise location they were found

01:48:38.490 --> 01:48:43.460
in the site.

01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:11.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.590
And assembled a fine collection.

01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:18.870
He bought in the village of
Mashuk an inscription dated

01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:26.350
to the 53rd year of Tyre and he
sold it to the Louvre in 1885.

01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:37.060
In Sour they discovered pieces
of an inscribed monument looking

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:44.190
like a [inaudible] which was sent
to the museum by [inaudible].

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.880
At the beginning of
the last century,

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:59.830
the Jesuit father Sebastian [French
name] was able to buy some pieces

01:49:59.830 --> 01:50:01.750 position:56%
with fund supplied by [French name],

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:09.650

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:43.580
And also lead weight showing
on one side and the sign

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:46.790
of [inaudible] on the other.

01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:56.850
After the first World War,
official excavations were organized

01:50:56.850 --> 01:51:01.730
in Lebanon by [French name]
during the French mandate.

01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:07.700
[French name] was in
charge of excavating Tyre

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:17.060
and its surrounding
in 1921 and 1922.

01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:21.750
[French name] conducted a
[inaudible] at [inaudible] in 1921.

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:32.660
In the 1930's the Jesuit father
[French name] realized a survey

01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:41.950
and submarine excavation
in the Tyre harbor.

01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:45.300
Later [French name]
resumed excavation

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:49.910
in [inaudible] in 1943-45.

01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:55.060
But at the time there
was no longer any sharing

01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:58.410
of the records of the excavation.

01:51:58.410 --> 01:52:04.660
And the pieces discovered are now
in the National Museum in Beirut.

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:08.430
Since the end of the French
mandate, the collection

01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:13.510
in the Louvre was completed
by a few purchases.

01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:18.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.950
Which is said to have been
found on the seashore at Sour,

01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:26.400
and is inscribed with
dedication to [inaudible] in Tyre.

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:32.440
A marbles stone with a full line
dedication to [inaudible] also.

And [inaudible] statuettes from a
deposit at the bottom of the sea.

01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:43.730
To conclude this brief
overview we can see

01:52:43.730 --> 01:52:45.540
that in the Phoenician collection

01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:52.400
of the Louvre very few pieces were
found on the island of Tyre itself.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:55.320
Many more come from
its surroundings,

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.590

[ Applause ]

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:45.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Frederique Duyrat:
Well, first of all,

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:51.030
I wanted to thank the association
for the invitation of speaking

01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:52.930
at the Library of Congress.

01:55:52.930 --> 01:55:57.160
Being myself a member of
staff of a national library,

01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:00.170
it's a great honor to be here.

01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:04.770
But I'm here to speak about the
coinage or Tyre in antiquity.

01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:09.480
Tyre was one of the most
prominent cities during antiquity.

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:12.140
Its coinage reflects its power.

01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.240
One of the first names active

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.040
in its coinage is an important
tool to write the history.

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.530
Beginning a little before the
middle of the 5th century BC,

01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:26.350
it did appear during
the 3rd century AD.

01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:30.590
Before using coinage,
Tyre like other cities

01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:35.780
in the east used commodity money
or what we call hack silver.

01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.340
That means fragments of silver.

01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.730
Either pieces of jewelry
or any silver.

01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.260
Weight to now the values.

01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:48.140 position:56%
On this you can see that even coins,
Greek coins, were used like that.

01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:51.930
Cut as if it were just
silver [inaudible].

01:56:51.930 --> 01:56:57.280
From the latter half of the 6th
century BC silver coins started

01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.450
circulating in the east.

01:56:59.450 --> 01:57:02.980
The oldest coin known was found in
the [inaudible] north of the mouth

01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:10.220
of the [inaudible] river and
was buried around 525-520 BC.

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:13.970
It only contained foreign
coinage struck

01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:18.620
in Macedonia, Thrace and Cyprus.

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:21.070
So foreign coins.

01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:24.230
By the end of the 5th century,
[inaudible] bear witness

01:57:24.230 --> 01:57:28.810
to the first strikes of finished
coins from Sidon and Tyre.

01:57:28.810 --> 01:57:33.910
Tyre built a complete monetary
system from the beginning.

01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:40.510
The major denomination was the
shekel, weighing around 13.5 grams.

01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:46.110
And it has a complete succession of
diffusion from the quarter shekel,

01:57:46.110 --> 01:57:49.650
the thirty-second of
shekel and even tiny coins

01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:56.480
that weighted only 0.06 grams, so
really tiny, tiny silver coins.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.310
During the 4th century
there were even brown coins.

01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:01.840
Compared to the variety

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.330
of the Phoenician city
coinage during the same period,

01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:09.350
Tyre's typology is
limited to two main groups.

01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:15.250
The [inaudible] shows a dolphin
jumping above a wave with a shell

01:58:15.250 --> 01:58:18.510
in the [inaudible] on the rivers.

01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:26.090
[ Inaudible ]

01:58:26.090 --> 01:58:28.650
This first group was spread
during the 5th century.

01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:33.170
On the second group,
the largest by far,

01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:35.710
struck during the 4th century BC.

01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:39.040
A bearded god rides a
winged seahorse to ride

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.350
above waves and on a dolphin.

01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:47.650
The rivers is represented the same
way as in the 5th century group.

01:58:47.650 --> 01:58:52.920
This 4th century group has totally
different profile from the 5th one.

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:55.650
The Phoenician coins
gain an increasing place

01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:59.500
in circulation during that period.

01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:03.580
They even constituted [inaudible].

01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:09.200
Sidon vastly dominates with nearly
half of [inaudible] and the area

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.320
of circulation that
goes beyond the limits

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:14.550
of its home regional
zone of influence.

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:18.880
But Tyre has produced nearly
of 10% of whole specimens

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.610
and its coins circulate
rather widely.

01:59:22.610 --> 01:59:27.150
The image chosen by the Tyrians
too strike their coins provides

01:59:27.150 --> 01:59:29.440
indication of what the city wanted

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.750
to be considered as
its official banner.

01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:37.130
The [inaudible] during the
whole Persian period is a hawk

01:59:37.130 --> 01:59:40.220
with a hawk body wearing
the Egyptian insignia

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:43.420
of power, a scepter and a flame.

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:47.430
The Egyptian influence reminds
us of the long-lasting commercial

01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:52.470
and political relationship of
the Phoenician cities with Egypt.

01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:56.150
Which is peculiar to Tyre, but
also sometimes from [inaudible]

01:59:56.150 --> 01:59:59.630
and Sidon is the importance
given to the sea.

01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:03.850
A dolphin jumping above
a wave, the shell,

02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:07.240
the bearded god riding a
seahorse are all related

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.750
to the sea power of Tyre.

02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:14.510
The interesting thing is
that the seahorse is winged.

02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:18.670
It is at the same time
a sea and sky animal.

02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:22.010
Such an [inaudible] which
is completely abnormal

02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:26.600 position:56%
in the Greek context is not puzzling
since the Phoenicians gods can have

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.160
at the same time power
of earth and sky.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:35.460
Therefore such an animal
is a convenient mount.

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:42.150
At the end of 333 BC, Alexander
the great won the battle of Issus

02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:46.490 position:56%
and entered Phoenicia to consolidate
his victory by the diminishing

02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:48.940
of the Mediterranean coast.

02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:52.640
The control of the coastal cities
of Cyprus would guarantee him

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.560
that the Persian fleets
would be kept away

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:00.620
when it could have [inaudible].

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:05.410
Raddus, Byblos and Sidon
almost immediately submitted

02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:08.510
to the Macedonian king.

02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:12.070
[ Inaudible ]

02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:16.450
To the considerable
benefit of Alexander.

02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:20.020
He acted quickly, prompting
the [inaudible]

02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:23.240
of the city and their fleets.

02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:25.160
Rapidly thereafter,
fleets of [inaudible]

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:27.540
and Cyrus joined his camp.

02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:32.850
But Tauria and Giza remained
the only cities to resist.

02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:39.150
The siege of Tyre lasted
from January to July 332 BC.

02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:42.430
However, after he had
conquered the city,

02:01:42.430 --> 02:01:45.040
it seemed that Alexander
didn't change the regime,

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.170
the political regime.

02:01:47.170 --> 02:01:51.290 position:56%
At this part of the resistance,
Tyre kept a king designated by order

02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:55.090
of Alexander from among the
members of the former royal family.

02:01:55.090 --> 02:02:00.830
All the formerly Phoenician cities,
Raddus, Byblos, Sidon and Tyre,

02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:05.330
already issued coins in 333.

02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:08.620
They quickly started to
strike with Alexander's type.

02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:09.980
The head of Heracles.

02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:13.450
Alexander sitting on the throne,

02:02:13.450 --> 02:02:17.120
an eagle in his right
hand on the reverse.

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:22.120
You can see on that coin, few
Phoenician coins on the reverse

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:25.470 position:56%
of the coin, just in front of those.

02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:28.450
It is the name of the
reigning Tyrian king.

02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:32.070
It's the first and the last letter

02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:35.630
in Phoenician in the
name of the king.

02:02:35.630 --> 02:02:38.560
Phoenicia was the theater
of an essential [inaudible],

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:41.000
the monetary history of Alexander.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.420
The creation of a gold
coinage after July 332.

02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:49.480
And the surrounding of Tyre.

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.180
This will explain the novel
reverse type he chose.

02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:58.110
A [inaudible] holding
what we call a stylus,

02:02:58.110 --> 02:03:01.260
a long tool she's got
on her left shoulder.

02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:03.620
The stylus was the
banner for [inaudible],

02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.260
usually taken as a
trophy by the winner.

02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:12.870
And it is here a keen reminder of
his victory on the city of Tyre.

02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:19.820
After Alexander's day in 323 BC,
the [inaudible] was at war due

02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:23.750
to the competition between
Alexander's companion.

02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:27.150
[Inaudible] silver and gold
coins with Alexander's types

02:03:27.150 --> 02:03:30.710
and his name in very large amounts.

02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:33.110
And Tyre was one of the main mints.

02:03:33.110 --> 02:03:35.620
The circulation of these
coins was very wide,

02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:40.010
as far as Alexander's
treks in the east.

02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:48.300
After 301 Phoenicia was part
of a wider region called Syria

02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:52.770
and Phoenicia in the hands of
Ptolemy I, new king of Egypt,

02:03:52.770 --> 02:03:55.710
and former companion
of Alexander the Great.

02:03:55.710 --> 02:03:58.300
He and his son, Ptolemy II,

02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:01.380
completely transformed the
monetary system of the kingdom

02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:05.160
and its dependencies by
introducing a standard [inaudible]

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.600
and the [inaudible] standard
with have been widely used

02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.100
as Alexander chose
it for its coinage.

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:16.500
Ptolemy I created a closed monetary
system with mandatory exchange

02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:19.970
at borders, excluding
all foreign coins.

02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:23.800
In Egypt, the sole mint was
Alexandria, but in Syria

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.310
and Phoenician several mints
were opened, one of them Tyre.

02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:32.500
From 260 the local mints
seem to have supplied most

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:35.030
of the needs of the area.

02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:40.050 position:56%
Tyre signed its prediction with a
monogram written with Greek letters.

02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:44.060
But you can see the front
of the eagle on the rivers.

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.380
And the club.

02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:52.030
Distinctive attributes of the god
protector of the city, Melqart.

02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:56.030
At the beginning of the second
century, [inaudible] king

02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:59.970
of Syria grabbed Syria
and Phoenicia.

02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:03.060
However, he didn't change
the monetary system.

02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:06.110
It is only at the end
of the second century BC

02:05:06.110 --> 02:05:08.510 position:56%
when the [inaudible] dynasty weakens

02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:12.950
that Tyre started its
own autonomous coinage.

02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:18.410
From 126 BC Tyre issued
this autonomous coinage.

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:23.910 position:56%
That means coin with its own type
and the name and titles of the city.

02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:26.180 position:56%
From the iconographic point of view,

02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:29.400
the coinage of Tyre
was relatively poor.

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:33.810
These symbols were most common
during the Persian period.

02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:38.650
[Inaudible] and shells
are secondary symbols.

02:05:38.650 --> 02:05:43.720
A palm tree and Melqart
were all common.

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:47.860
This god patron of the
city was represented young,

02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:50.600
wearing a laurel reef.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:54.650
His identities of use thanks
to the associated club

02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:56.840
that you can see here
on the reverse of the.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:00.700
And the appearance of the god
himself with a stout neck,

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:05.300
strong chin, his head occupying
all the available surface

02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:06.600
of the [inaudible].

02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:13.510
It is a mighty god whose power
comes from its physical strength.

02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:16.040
[ Inaudible ]

02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:20.170
And then a symbol of an
economically reliable coinage.

02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:21.880
A monogram of the city and its name

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:26.660
in full letters appear
on the reverse.

02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:30.450
Sometimes on other
coins a Atike goddess

02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:33.510
of the city fortune is
represented on autonomous bronze

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:35.600
with a palm tree on the reverse.

02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:38.200
She's probably the Greek
representation of Serte,

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.480
protective goddess of the city.

02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:43.240
All other deities of city,

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:47.780
skills and politics are
absent from the coinage.

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:52.640
A political object, coins bear
the image of gods in charge

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:57.440
of the political activity
of the community.

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:01.460
Syria would transfer into
a Roman province in 64 BC.

02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:05.180 position:56%
Syria brought change to the coinage.

02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:08.100
Tyre kept its autonomous
types and its issues

02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.740 position:56%
of autonomous silver coins continued
during the first century AD.

02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:15.980
So real change occurred
during the 2nd century AD

02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:19.570
with in particular the
development of references

02:07:19.570 --> 02:07:22.290
to founding myths and local cults.

02:07:22.290 --> 02:07:27.940
The latter were evoked through
a picture [inaudible] positional

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:31.350 position:56%
[inaudible] objects related to
religious festivals and comparisons.

02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:35.030
Agonistic palms of
victory and so on.

02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:37.040
[ Inaudible ]

02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:39.800
During the Hellenistic
period detailed depictions

02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:41.100
of founding myth.

02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:48.010
So you have here one example
of the coin in the 1st century.

02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:52.580
Here you can see the change
because the reverse --

02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.100 position:56%
on the obverse you have the emperor.

02:07:54.100 --> 02:08:00.360
On the reverse you have a very
detailed scene depicting what we

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.590
call the Ambrosian works.

02:08:02.590 --> 02:08:04.240
They were erected in the shrine

02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:07.770
of Heracles Melqart
under an olive tree.

02:08:07.770 --> 02:08:09.660
They were associated
with the foundation

02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:14.530
of the city though the particulars
of the foundation remain unknown.

02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:16.920
They are presented as Talas

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:20.630
on bronze coins spread
during the 3rd century AD.

02:08:20.630 --> 02:08:23.960
So identification is clear
since the name is written

02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:27.080
on them, Ambrosia Petra.

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:32.200
Under the exit line, a dog
and a [inaudible] remind us

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:37.340
of the myth explaining how the
[inaudible] were discovered.

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:42.180
The famous Tyrian purple was
extracted from this shell.

02:08:43.450 --> 02:08:49.640
Another coin struck between
244 and 249 AD shows Cadmous.

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:53.020
I'm sorry for the quality, but
this is a very, very rare coin

02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:56.680
and this is the one we've
got in the library in Paris.

02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.090
So you can hardly see it
here, but it's very clear

02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:02.350
when you read it directly.

02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:08.150
So it shows Cadmous, king of Tyre
on the right, giving a [inaudible]

02:09:08.150 --> 02:09:10.420
to three men on the left.

02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:13.730
If it's not just with emirs.

02:09:13.730 --> 02:09:18.660
You've got a legion and
there's the exit line.

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:22.060
Because you have the first
letter of the work Elanos

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.250
at the feet of the three men.

02:09:24.250 --> 02:09:25.550
And there's a man on the right.

02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:27.480
You have cad for Cadmous.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.590
The scene represents Cadmous
giving the alphabet to the Greeks.

02:09:31.590 --> 02:09:35.230
An eastern heritage for
the Greek civilization.

02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:38.550
Then the 2nd and 3rd
century AD coin designs

02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:42.280
of Tyre are multiple
educational and political.

02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:47.120 position:56%
They contrast strongly with the more
enigmatic sobriety of the issues

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.860
of the Persian and
Hellenistic periods.

02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:52.580
They bear witness to changes
in the religious practice

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:55.320
from the 2nd century AD in contrast

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:58.530
to the preceding long-lasting
religious rights.

02:09:58.530 --> 02:10:02.690
They are also a political program
enhancing the central relationships

02:10:02.690 --> 02:10:06.540
and heritage between Phoenicia
and the Greek world at a time

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:10.080
when Phoenicia was deeply
influenced by Greek culture.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.600
and consulting scholar
in the near east section.

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.460
Over the past two years he
has pioneered the exciting

02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:49.920
interdisciplinary field of
biomolecular archaeology

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.510
which is yielding whole new
chapters concerning human ancestry,

02:10:54.510 --> 02:10:58.560
medical practice and ancient
cuisines and beverages.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.320
He has excavated extensively in
the Middle East, including Lebanon,

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.440
Canaanite and Phoenician Sarafond.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:10.990
He is the author of Ancient
Wine: The Search for the Origins

02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:16.470
of Viniculture, published
in 2003-04.

02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:20.940
And most recently Uncorking
the Past: The Quest for Wine,

02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:24.210
Beer and other Alcoholic Beverages.

02:11:24.210 --> 02:11:28.510
Without further ado,
Dr. Patrick McGovern.

02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:31.040
[ Applause ]

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Patrick McGovern: Thank you.

02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.640
I'm very happy to be here.

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:36.560
And I'm thankful to the Tyre
committee for inviting me to talk

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:39.120
about two of the technological

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.300
and artistic creations
of the Phoenicians.

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:45.100
I mean, the Phoenicians are
responsible for a great deal.

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:46.480
We've heard about the alphabet,

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.730
we've heard about some
coinage, ship building.

02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:52.160
There's metalworking, glass making.

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.880
And I'm going to talk about
royal purple and wine.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:59.820
My first experience in
archaeology was actually in Lebanon

02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:03.250
at a site not too far
from Tyre called Surepta,

02:12:03.250 --> 02:12:06.600
or Sarafond which is
only about 11 kilometers

02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.350
as the crow flies north of Tyre.

02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:12.660
So I have a great affinity
for Lebanon

02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:15.260
and what it really represents.

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:20.250
Because I think it took technology
and art and transferred them

02:12:20.250 --> 02:12:24.540
across the Mediterranean and
eventually to the whole world.

02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:29.650
So it's a very special country
and I think we need to find

02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:30.950
out a great deal more about it.

02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:35.870
I mean, I'm really saddened by
the events since the civil war

02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:38.820
and so forth, and how difficult
it is to excavate in that country.

02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:43.350
But I think it holds secrets
that we really can't imagine.

02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:45.620
I think architecture too.

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:48.800
We've heard about the Tyre temple
and we're going to hear more

02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:50.360
about that this afternoon.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:57.840
So I think architecture and temple
worship, religion, theater, music.

02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:01.930
There's a whole series of
contributions that the Phoenicians

02:13:01.930 --> 02:13:06.410 position:56%
and the Canaanites, the predecessors
of Phoenicians, contributed.

02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:10.990
So I'm going to talk about
royal purple as a good example,

02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:14.830
or Tyrian purple we can call it.

02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:19.430
Because there's a Greek
myth you could say

02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:23.510
that the Phoenicians are the ones
who developed purple initially

02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:25.190
or even back to the Canaanites.

02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:30.000
And that the words for
Phoenicia and Canaan do derive

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.850
from ancient words for purple.

02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:37.140
So this is very integral to the
Canaanites and the Phoenicians.

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:38.770
Now here we see this myth

02:13:38.770 --> 02:13:45.790
of Heracles walking along the
shore of Tyre with his dog.

02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:49.250
And the dog is biting
into different shells.

02:13:49.250 --> 02:13:53.790 position:56%
And this is the Greek idea of how
maybe it could have been discovered.

02:13:53.790 --> 02:14:05.030
The dog bites into a murex shell
which has the purple dye gland.

02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:07.130
And I'll show that to
you a little bit later.

02:14:07.130 --> 02:14:13.040
And that inspires Heracles
then to take the dye and make

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.620 position:56%
up textiles for his consort goddess.

02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:22.460
And so begins the royal
purple dye making.

02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:26.900
But we have more definitive
archaeological evidence.

02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:33.130
And it comes from the site of
Surepta where I worked in 1974

02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:37.700
as Israeli jets pounded
the local Palestinian camp.

02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:43.070
You had to be very intrepid to
work at Surepta in those days.

02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:45.660
And Leila Badre can attest to that

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.890
because she was there
at the same time.

02:14:47.890 --> 02:14:52.980
And it is a site that's
located between Tyre and Sidon,

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:55.230
about halfway in between.

02:14:55.230 --> 02:14:59.920
And when they started getting
down into the late bronze,

02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:05.080
early iron age levels, this is
from about 1300 BC to 1100 BC.

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:10.720
This is one of the few homeland
Canaanite/Phoenician sites

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:12.020
that has been excavated.

02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:13.770
Now Sidon is getting
a lot more information

02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:16.800
and we hope that Tyre will as well.

02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.690
We came down onto an
industrial area.

02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:22.020
This is done by the University
of Pennsylvania Museum

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:27.320
under James Pritchard who some
of you may know or have heard of.

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.390
We started finding Canaanite jars.

02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:33.650
I was a graduate student at
this time, so I was working

02:15:33.650 --> 02:15:36.870
on the pottery and going
through it very carefully.

02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:41.930
And you'll see here that this
industrial area had kilns

02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:43.450
for making the pottery.

02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:50.100
But in addition it also had purple
colored shards on the inside

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.120
of amphoras or Canaanite jars.

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:57.400
And also processing
vats for making the dye.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:02.380 position:56%
And when we saw these purple colored
shards, our immediate instincts was

02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:07.580
that these were possibly
real Tyrian purple.

02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:12.580
Now they could be from an inorganic
coloring like manganese or iron.

02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:15.740
But if they were the
real Tyrian royal purple,

02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:18.340
they would be an organic compound.

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:22.630
And we had just started in
on doing organic analyses

02:16:22.630 --> 02:16:24.390
at the University of
Pennsylvania museum.

02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:28.040
First I'd work on pottery
and glass and so forth.

02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:30.340
And then I was always very
interested in organic chemistry.

02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:34.160
And we were just developing the
techniques 20 years ago to be able

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:40.190
to analyze organic compounds and
see what the ancient dye might be

02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:42.260
or ancient food or whatever.

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:47.930
And so this is a very small shard
that we worked with from Surepta

02:16:47.930 --> 02:16:50.190
that had the purple
color on the inside.

02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:52.410
It was from an amphora.

02:16:52.410 --> 02:16:55.310
And for those who are
chemically challenged among you,

02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:57.060
I'm not going to give
you all the details.

02:16:57.060 --> 02:17:01.350
We've published extensively
on the chemical results.

02:17:01.350 --> 02:17:05.060
And we have used spectroscopic
techniques.

02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:07.830
Mass spectrometry works very well.

02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:12.850
And there's a particular
vat dye test that you can do

02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:15.910
that almost certainly
shows that we're dealing

02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:19.670
with what's called
6-6-prime dibromoindigotin.

02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:22.220
It's an indigo compound
that has two bromines,

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:24.160
one on each side of the molecule.

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.690 position:56%
And the indigo of course gives blue.

02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:30.330
But if you put the bromines on, it
switches the color over to purple.

02:17:30.330 --> 02:17:33.680
And there's a lot of
fascinating details about this dye

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:37.220
and I'll refer you again to some
of the articles I've written about.

02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:41.500
It comes from a gland,
as I mentioned,

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:45.180
in the murex mollusk that's
found in the Mediterranean.

02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:47.030
There's three different species.

02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:54.650
And this is an example where you
can see it's a yellowish fluid

02:17:54.650 --> 02:17:57.890
that comes out of this gland,
called the hypobranchial gland.

02:17:57.890 --> 02:18:01.370
And when it's exposed to light
and air, it changes to purple.

02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:04.450
So it's something that people
could have discovered quite easily.

02:18:04.450 --> 02:18:08.180
And there's related species of
mollusks all over the world.

02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:11.500
So the ancient Mayans, Chinese,

02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:15.090
Incans and so forth
discovered related species.

02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:18.280
And if you're using it as
a food source and you start

02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.450
to handle the Murex, you're
going to get it on your fingers.

02:18:21.450 --> 02:18:24.560
And it is a very fast dye.

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.550
It's very hard to remove.

02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:30.410
So people would have realized
it was a good textile dye

02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:33.080
and started using it
for that purpose.

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.410
Okay, so that is a little
glimpse of the royal purple.

02:18:37.410 --> 02:18:39.260
You know, there's lots
more I could say about it.

02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:42.320
But now I want to move
on to another luxury good

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.390
which also has technological

02:18:44.390 --> 02:18:48.210
and artistic ramifications,
and that's ancient wine.

02:18:48.210 --> 02:18:49.730
Which I've written a book about.

02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:52.450
So you're welcome to ask me about.

02:18:52.450 --> 02:18:54.440
And I also hope we'll be having --

02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:59.310 position:56%
on that first slide at the beginning
I showed a view of the Baca valley

02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:03.630
where winemaking has probably
gone on for thousands of years.

02:19:03.630 --> 02:19:09.630
Now this is a map that shows in
purple, appropriately enough,

02:19:09.630 --> 02:19:12.460
and I'm glad that some of
you are wearing purple today.

02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:17.710
Where the wild grapevine,
the wild Eurasian grapevine,

02:19:17.710 --> 02:19:20.300
vitis vinifera, grows today.

02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:22.880
And we think that basically
it's the same region.

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:27.570
And you'll notice that the
area -- well before I do that,

02:19:27.570 --> 02:19:30.580
you'll notice that Lebanon is

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:35.920
at the most southerly extent
of the wild grape vine.

02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:42.020
So when humans came out of
Africa say 100,000 years ago

02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:46.300
and they crossed over the Sinai
and up into the near east,

02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:52.000
they would see the grape for
the first time in Lebanon.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.510
And I think that they would be
quite interested in this fruit.

02:19:58.510 --> 02:20:01.310
[ Laughter ]

02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:04.190
And so they would maybe
start experimenting with it.

02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:07.610
But now so far we have a
project now up in Georgia

02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:12.630
in the Caucuses looking at the
earliest evidence for winemaking

02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:16.440
and for the domestication
of the grapevine.

02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:21.060
It appears that the
domestication occurs somewhere

02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:22.820
in the mountainous
region of the near east.

02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:25.640 position:56%
It could be up in the Caucuses, but
it could also be near eastern Turkey

02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:28.690
and the Taurus mountains,
over to the Zagros mountains.

02:20:28.690 --> 02:20:31.280
But even down into Lebanon.

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:37.620 position:56%
And unfortunately we've had no real
gathering of grapes and DNA analyses

02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:43.280 position:56%
in Lebanon to test you know, whether
it could have first merged there.

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:48.240
But we do know that the Canaanites

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.320
and then the Phoenicians
are very much involved

02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:54.160
in spreading the wine
culture, wherever it emerges.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:59.140
And by wine culture mean
something like Lebanon today,

02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:01.250
where wine can become very much --

02:21:01.250 --> 02:21:03.280
of course you have
Ararack and what have you.

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:06.840
Wine can become very
central to the economy,

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.840
the social life, the religion.

02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:14.820 position:56%
And sort of embeds itself right into
the culture in a very profound way.

02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:20.480
But we do see in later periods
how this wine culture then spread

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:24.740
principally from the
Canaanite Phoenician area.

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:29.860 position:56%
So around 4000 BC -- we probably had
the emergence of the wine culture

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:33.390
around 6000 BC in the
mountainous areas of the near east.

02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:37.010
Then by 4000 BC it had spread
down to the Jordan valley.

02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:39.940
And we have grape seeds
of domesticated grape

02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:42.230
that have been found
about that time.

02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:44.450
And then ultimately
it goes on to Egypt

02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:48.390
where you'll notice Egypt did
not have the wild grapevine.

02:21:48.390 --> 02:21:51.930
You had to bring in the
domesticated grapevine.

02:21:51.930 --> 02:21:53.820
And who did that?

02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:55.890
Well it was the Canaanites
and the Phoenicians.

02:21:55.890 --> 02:21:58.890
And I'll show you a few more
slides to illustrate that.

02:21:58.890 --> 02:22:04.240
But then the Phoenicians also
took the grape and wine culture

02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.660
across the Mediterranean.

02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:10.820
And we've done a lot of analyses
now on vessels from Crete

02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:15.100
and other parts of even the
western Mediterranean that show

02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:21.850
that at least by 2200 BC
wine was being made on Crete.

02:22:21.850 --> 02:22:26.180
So the Greeks are absorbing
the wine culture.

02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:31.540
And the earliest shipwreck in
the Mediterranean from Uluburun,

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.900
which is just off the
southern coast of Turkey,

02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:39.680
dated about 1350 BC,
is a Canaanite ship.

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:44.610
So here the Canaanites were
transporting all sorts of goods

02:22:44.610 --> 02:22:47.300
and spreading out into
the Mediterranean,

02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:49.660
establishing colonies and so forth.

02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:52.440
And you'll see there
are some amphoras.

02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:54.430
This is a reconstructed view

02:22:54.430 --> 02:22:57.300
of what the Uluburun shipwreck
would have looked like.

02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:03.020 position:56%
Because a lot of the goods were
spread out along a very steep slope.

02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:08.700 position:56%
So they tried to figure out what the
weight, the ballast would have been

02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:12.610
on certain parts of the ship and
the different sizes of amphoras.

02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:17.210
And we are just publishing
an article that shows

02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:20.000
that they had wine
on board this ship.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.030
This has been sometimes
controversial.

02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:26.040
[ Laughter ]

02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:28.390
I think if you're Canaanites you
have wine on board your ship.

02:23:28.390 --> 02:23:35.400
And then we did an analysis of
other amphoras that were found

02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:42.080
in shipwrecks from the 8th
century BC off of Ashkelon.

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:46.920
And they were carrying an
enormous number of amphoras.

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:52.150
This is a photograph by
remotely operated submersible.

02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:55.760
But it showed hundreds
of amphoras in the ships.

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.160
And there were two ships.

02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:03.540
And they were given the ships
Tanit, and Elissa or Dido.

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:08.150
And they were carrying,
according to our analysis, wine.

02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:11.880
Now the wine in this case
also has a resin in it.

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:14.610
It could be pine resin
or terabinth resin.

02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:17.990
And that helps to keep
it from spoiling.

02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:22.680
So they then went out across to
Greece and Crete as I mentioned.

02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:27.650
And I think ultimately, according
to another article that we've done

02:24:27.650 --> 02:24:31.070
in the proceedings from the
National Academy of Sciences --

02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:33.850
and these are available on my
website if you're interested.

02:24:33.850 --> 02:24:36.970 position:56%
The French ultimately got winemaking

02:24:36.970 --> 02:24:40.720
and the wine culture
through the Etruscans.

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:44.410
This occurs around the
8th, 7th, 6th century BC.

02:24:44.410 --> 02:24:46.650
But my belief, and I
think it will be shown

02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:49.180
as more shipwrecks are excavated,

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.010
is that the Phoenicians
are really the ones

02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:53.640
that transferred the wine culture

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:56.480
and the domesticated
grapevine to the Etruscans.

02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:58.840
And then ultimately to the French.

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.460
So the beginnings of winemaking in
France go back to the Phoenicians,

02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.960
which is not all that surprising.

02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.510
I hope I'm not upsetting anybody.

02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:14.250
[ Applause ]

02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:18.110
And just to give you
some examples from Egypt

02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:21.700 position:56%
of how important the Canaanites were
there, one of the earliest tombs

02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:30.020
of a pharaoh is one of Scorpion
I at Abidos around 3150 BC.

02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:37.080
And he had 700 jars of
wine, about 4,500 liters

02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.430
of wine put into his tomb.

02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:42.180
So the king was buried on a bed

02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:44.700
on the back there with
his mace in hand.

02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:48.340 position:56%
And then there was beer and bread
and so forth in the middle chambers.

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:52.020
And then there were three sort
of wine cellars, you know,

02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.830
stacked up with these jars.

02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:58.100
And we were able show that
this again was a resinated wine

02:25:58.100 --> 02:25:59.730
that had figs put into it.

02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:03.770
It also had thyme and savory.

02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:06.610
You were eating zatar this morning.

02:26:06.610 --> 02:26:08.790
We have shown that some
of the earliest wine --

02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:11.390
and this was probably, according
to the neutron activation analyses

02:26:11.390 --> 02:26:15.460
of the pottery, it comes from
the Jordan valley in this case.

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.410
And the surrounding hill country

02:26:17.410 --> 02:26:20.210
where the wine was
then exported to Egypt.

02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:23.330
And that gave the Egyptians
the impetus to set

02:26:23.330 --> 02:26:28.440
up their own wine industry
around 3000 BC.

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.500
And we have these beautiful
depictions of course

02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:32.250
as probably some of
you have seen in Egypt

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.860
of how the winemaking was done.

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:37.320
Well, this is a pretty
sophisticated system that goes back

02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:38.850 position:56%
to the beginning of the old kingdom.

02:26:38.850 --> 02:26:41.160
I mean, I'm showing a fresco
here from the new kingdom.

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:44.170
But there's equal examples
from the old kingdom.

02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:49.060
It shows how they were able
to have arbors or pergolas

02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:52.940
with grapes growing up
high, which blocks the sun.

02:26:52.940 --> 02:26:55.590
Because you're in a very hot
climate in the Nile delta.

02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:59.020
So it's the Canaanites who are
transplanting the grapevine

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:03.170
to the delta, setting up the
winemaking industry there.

02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:05.970
And using very advanced
horticultural methods.

02:27:05.970 --> 02:27:08.850
They even had irrigation
of single plants we see

02:27:08.850 --> 02:27:10.510
in some of the illustrations.

02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:15.040
And of course doing the stomping
operation, putting it into jars,

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:20.010 position:56%
knowing how to seal it, how to do
the fermentation and how to keep it.

02:27:20.010 --> 02:27:27.960
And this influence
ultimately comes from Lebanon.

02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:32.000
We know from the textile evidence
of the Greeks and so forth

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.350
that Lebanese wine, especially
Bybline or Byblos wine,

02:27:36.350 --> 02:27:40.960 position:56%
was renowned in the ancient world as
being the equal of any Greek wine.

02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:44.220
They said it was comparable
to the Lesbos wine.

02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:49.110
And it was very much a part
of ceremonies in Lebanon.

02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:54.030
We have from the Ras Shamra texts
that they had special worship

02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:58.010
and meals and ceremonies
for the ancestors,

02:27:58.010 --> 02:28:00.740
which features lots of wine.

02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:06.190
Which also the gods Baal and
Hel sometimes overindulged in.

02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:11.990
So we've got a culture there that
is definitely a wine-based culture.

02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:14.580 position:56%
And yet we know very little about it

02:28:14.580 --> 02:28:18.520
because we have not done
any analyses of vessels

02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:24.730
from the homeland of Phoenician
area that we can really rely on.

02:28:24.730 --> 02:28:29.180
Or at least there might be some
in progress that suggest Cartamum,

02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:31.450
but I kind of wonder about that.

02:28:31.450 --> 02:28:36.370
But we've got these spectacular
vases, the mushroom-lipped juglet

02:28:36.370 --> 02:28:39.830
and the amphora and so forth
that need to be analyzed.

02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:46.390
And on this particular
sarcophagus of Hiram of Byblos,

02:28:46.390 --> 02:28:49.270
we see him holding
a cup in his hand.

02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:51.090
And what was that cup filled with?

02:28:51.090 --> 02:28:53.620
Well, we would think
it would be with wine.

02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:55.950 position:56%
But we still have yet to prove this.

02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:59.170
And we really need a lot
more work and protection

02:28:59.170 --> 02:29:02.390
of the antiquities in Lebanon.

02:29:02.390 --> 02:29:04.030

Dr. McGovern.

02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:15.000
Our next speaker is
Dr. Peter Von Dommelen.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:20.170
He's an archaeologist studying
cross cultural interactions

02:29:20.170 --> 02:29:24.050
and colonial connections in
the ancient Mediterranean.

02:29:24.050 --> 02:29:27.270
Especially in the Phoenician
and Punic worlds.

02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:32.320
His research concerns topics like
migration, rule of households,

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:37.280
ancient agriculture and landscapes
in the western Mediterranean

02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:40.730
in both ancient and
more recent times.

02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:47.000
They also structured long-term
field work and ceramic studies

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.600
on the island of Sardinia, Italy.

02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.540
He's the Dukowski family professor
of archaeology and professor

02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:59.220
of anthropology at Brown University
in Providence, Rhode Island.

02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:07.110 position:56%
And has held visiting professorships
at University of Valencia in Spain,

02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:11.070
[Spanish name] in Spain
and Cagliari in Italy.

02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:16.490 position:56%
Recent publications have appeared
in the Journal of Roman archaeology,

02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:22.250
[foreign name] and the Annual
Review of Anthropology.

02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:29.470
They also include rural
landscapes of the Punic world,

02:30:29.470 --> 02:30:35.290
and the Cambridge prehistory of the
bronze and iron age Mediterranean.

02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:37.740
He also serves as co-editor
of the Journal

02:30:37.740 --> 02:30:42.330

&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Dommelen:
Thank you very much

02:30:50.350 --> 02:30:51.650
for your kind introduction.

02:30:51.650 --> 02:30:55.190
And of course also, my thanks
to the committee for Tyre.

02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:58.700 position:56%
Because it's an honor to speak
here, but also a great pleasure here

02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:02.090
to talk to you about
Phoenician archaeology.

02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:05.880
As you heard in the
introduction, I'm an archaeologist

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:08.470
and working particularly
on cultural interaction.

02:31:08.470 --> 02:31:12.140
So what happens when people
migrate, go and work somewhere else

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:14.230
and how they learn
things from others,

02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:16.350
how they start doing
things in different ways?

02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:20.000
And in the process sort of come
up with novel ways of doing that

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.180
or consuming things as well.

02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:27.980
And most of my research over
the past 25 years has been

02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:29.540
involving Phoenicians.

02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:34.710
But without going into Lebanon
myself, which is still a place

02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:36.770
where I have to go, I must confess.

02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:39.390
Because all of my work in
fact has been concentrated

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:42.990
in the west Mediterranean and
that is what I will be speaking

02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:44.290
about here.

02:31:44.290 --> 02:31:46.910
So it's under the heading
of material connections.

02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:51.380
Because the fate of Tyre is, as
we've heard and as we've seen

02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:55.000
to some extent or a large
extent, based on the city itself.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.960
But not just and not only that,

02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:58.970
but it's also on the
overseas connections,

02:31:58.970 --> 02:32:03.610
what Tyrians were doing
overseas and what they were

02:32:03.610 --> 02:32:06.350
up to in those faraway places.

02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:10.410
And archaeology is actually crucial
for understanding these things.

02:32:10.410 --> 02:32:13.510
Archaeology is about stuff,
about things that you find,

02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:16.700
and hence they make up
these material connections.

02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:22.870
Because this is obviously a huge
and vast topic, I'm only going

02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:26.010
to be touching on a
couple of points today

02:32:26.010 --> 02:32:27.810
because of the constraints of time.

02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:32.740 position:56%
And what I want to highlight is to
take you on a kind of whirlwind tour

02:32:32.740 --> 02:32:36.320 position:56%
across the Mediterranean and
highlight some of the rapid advances

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:39.720
that the discipline of
archaeology has been making

02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.020
in this regard as well.

02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:43.580
And really in sort of recent years.

02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:46.450 position:56%
And I'm beginning here straight away
with this sort of introductory slide

02:32:46.450 --> 02:32:49.490 position:56%
which I'm not going to say much more
about, other than you're looking

02:32:49.490 --> 02:32:52.850
at this wonderful view, which is on
the island or just off the island

02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:58.740
of Sardinia where the peninsula in
the background is the colonial site

02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:01.190
of Bitia, southeast Sardinia.

02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:03.840
And we're looking at
it from the Tophart,

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:07.240
which is one of those weird
sites that were created

02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:10.990
in the wester Phoenician
colonial world.

02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:14.220
And again, one of the things -- I
don't have time to go into detail,

02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:18.890
but we might touch
on it here or there.

02:33:18.890 --> 02:33:21.510
Tyre and its overseas connection.

02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:24.180
Because it's not just archaeology

02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:25.750
that gives us information
about these.

02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:29.120
Of course, as we've already seen in
previous talks, there's all sorts

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:34.170
of iconographic sources,
illustrations of various kinds

02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:39.600
as we see here in these
reliefs or in this bronze plate.

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:45.210
That was originally fixed on a gate
in Balawat in neo-Syrian period.

02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:48.720
And of course there's all
kinds of literary sources.

02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.160 position:56%
But even when we look at these
epigraphic and iconographic sources,

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:58.160
we can see very well that
they show us lots of stuff,

02:33:58.160 --> 02:33:59.730
lots of things in the archaeology.

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:05.780
We see trees, timber being
transported in forms of tribute

02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.290
that we just heard a lot about,

02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:10.250
these Canaan amphorae
being transported.

02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:13.420
And to some extent the amphorae
themselves, the clay vessels.

02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:15.340
But of course it wasn't
just about the vessels.

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.370
It was clearly, as we heard,
all about the contents of them.

02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:20.230
So there's a lot of these.

02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:23.560
Even if we look at nonmaterial
sources, it's sort of the material

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:27.760
that sort of makes up those
connections that's paramount there.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:30.070
But with archaeology we can
actually do something more.

02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:31.640
And that's more what
I want to talk about,

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.300
sort of these material connections.

02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:35.870
They give us insight
in everyday life.

02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:40.160
We can talk about what was life in
those colonial oversea settlements?

02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:41.890
And what were people up there --

02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:45.280
how were they building a
life in faraway places?

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.710
So the places I want to
sort of briefly touch

02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:49.490
on here is of course Carthage.

02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:52.770 position:56%
How could we not talk about Carthage
when we talk about the west?

02:34:52.770 --> 02:34:55.240
But as you can see there the
concentration on the island

02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:57.850
of Sardinia, which has all
to do with that as a place

02:34:57.850 --> 02:35:00.170
where I conduct my fieldwork.

02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:04.170
But very important of course
is the Spanish peninsula,

02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:06.620
the Iberian peninsula
where we haven't heard much

02:35:06.620 --> 02:35:07.920
about so far today.

02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:12.220
But the city Cassis situated
just outside the Mediterranean,

02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:13.600
on the Atlantic shores.

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:21.960
That is a key element of this
Phoenician/Tyrian expansion.

02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:23.840
So first Carthage.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.860
Carthage, famously founded by Dido
Elissa, and we'll hear much more

02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:32.430
about it in a later talk as
I gather from the program.

02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:36.820
And we have from our literary
sources, historical sources,

02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:40.540
traditional foundation
date of 814 BCE.

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:43.990 position:56%
And there has been a long discussion
whether that would be reliable.

02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:45.600
Because most of the
archaeology was coming

02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:47.450
up with somewhat younger dates.

02:35:47.450 --> 02:35:51.470
But in fact it is excavations
that have been carried out first

02:35:51.470 --> 02:35:55.610
by University of Hamburg and then
more recently by the Universities

02:35:55.610 --> 02:35:57.780
of Amsterdam and Ghent in Belgium.

02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:00.640
At the site of the
so-called [foreign name]

02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:07.440
that have actually come up with
all different kinds of evidence.

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:10.210
Particularly from the
[foreign name] site

02:36:10.210 --> 02:36:15.400
that recent radio carbon dates have
actually been pushing back to sort

02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.310
of the first presence of
settlement at that site

02:36:18.310 --> 02:36:19.610
to the end of the 9th century.

02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:22.550
So that sort of brings us within
touching distance as it were

02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:25.400
of that sort of traditional
foundation date.

02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:28.110
So that's sort of one
important achievement

02:36:28.110 --> 02:36:30.190
that I would like to highlight.

02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:32.050
But what you see in
the larger photo,

02:36:32.050 --> 02:36:35.900
which is sort of not
particularly enticing or sort

02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:37.650
of attractive you might think.

02:36:37.650 --> 02:36:39.810
But in many ways it
is, because in one

02:36:39.810 --> 02:36:43.260
of those industrial
or artisanal areas.

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:48.380
And in this case a fairly
early ironworking site

02:36:48.380 --> 02:36:51.460
at ancient Carthage.

02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:57.710
Another important settlement
site where Phoenicians settled

02:36:57.710 --> 02:37:01.200
down very early is on the
southeast, of the southwest,

02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.150
sorry, of the isle of Sardinia.

02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:06.200
In fact on a little island just
off the island of Sardinia itself.

02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:08.750
The little Island of Santiago
where the ancient site

02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:13.310
of Sulkey was established right
in the middle of the modern town,

02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:16.130
as you can see on this aerial.

02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:19.670
There you can see most of
the remains are Roman period

02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:21.850
or Punic later and so on.

02:37:21.850 --> 02:37:24.870
But it's within that
highlighted area there.

02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:26.170
That's why there's one area

02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:29.370
where much older foundations
of a house were found.

02:37:29.370 --> 02:37:34.070
And particularly, zooming much
more in detail at those remains,

02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:36.370
we've actually got foundations

02:37:36.370 --> 02:37:40.730
of a house probably possibly two
houses here that were established

02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:42.960
in the early or mid-8th century.

02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.270
So that's a little bit later
than the sort of evidence

02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:46.890
that we've been getting
from Carthage.

02:37:46.890 --> 02:37:50.120
But here what was very
important to establish as well,

02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:52.420
these were new foundations.

02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:53.720
There was nothing before that.

02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:56.030
These were established
on an empty site.

02:37:56.030 --> 02:38:00.380
And the life from the
materials as we can find,

02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:01.700
that people were living here.

02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:04.690 position:56%
The kind of houses that they were
building there, they seem to be sort

02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:07.600
of fully fledged Phoenician houses.

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:09.900
And some of the pottery
sort of illustrated

02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:12.960
in that drawing there actually
find some very close matches

02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.860
to material known from Tyre.

02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:21.080
But what also should be noted here,
Sardinia wasn't empty of course.

02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:24.110
The island was already
inhabited by local Sardinians,

02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:26.350 position:56%
people of so-called Nuragic culture.

02:38:26.350 --> 02:38:29.200
And some of their material culture,
some potsherds have been found

02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:34.350
within this early Phoenician
context as well.

02:38:34.350 --> 02:38:37.300
Moving further west, really
sort of into the far west

02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:39.910
of the Mediterranean,
if not just beyond,

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:44.270
as we're just outside
the Strait of Gibraltar

02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:48.330
in Cadis on the modern Lucia.

02:38:48.330 --> 02:38:51.520
And here we are overlooking
the area, the salt marshes.

02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:56.610
The vast wetlands that sort of
make up that part of the coast.

02:38:56.610 --> 02:38:59.300
This has been long an
archaeological problem here.

02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:01.560
Because stray finds
we're turning up,

02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:04.470
like this little Phoenician
statuette that was actually dragged

02:39:04.470 --> 02:39:07.380
up from the sea, so without
any precise foundation.

02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:11.030
So if you look it up in
literature of on web sources,

02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:15.970 position:56%
you will find widely varying dates
for this little statuette because by

02:39:15.970 --> 02:39:18.470
and large it cannot be
dated with any precision.

02:39:18.470 --> 02:39:21.190
Various kinds of Phoenician
amphorae clearly recognizable

02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:22.990
as such were turning
up from various places.

02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:25.980
But not with any sort
of clear contexts.

02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:30.620
But all of this has now sort of
been changed in a very dramatic way

02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:34.120
because of what really has
been commercial excavations,

02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:38.210
salvage interventions going
on to do with building

02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:42.920
within the historical town of Cadis
over the last ten years or so.

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:47.400
And evidence that has sort of
only just been published really.

02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:50.210
Now what's been found there at
the site called [foreign name]

02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:55.560
because it's actually under
this historical theater

02:39:55.560 --> 02:40:00.440
in downtown Cadis, that a whole
Phoenician neighborhood basically

02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:01.950
has been brought to light.

02:40:01.950 --> 02:40:05.760
There's eight houses contained
in three separate buildings

02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:08.660
with a street and a small
side alley connecting to it,

02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:11.220
sort of connecting them up.

02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:14.780
From the nature of the evidence,
it's actually very clear

02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:17.900
that several of the buildings
at least had several stories

02:40:17.900 --> 02:40:20.660
as you can see in this
reconstruction here.

02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:23.250
And the site has actually
recently been made accessible

02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:25.240
to the public under the theater.

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:28.200
So if any of you would
happen to go to St. Lucia,

02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:32.160
Cadis should definitely
be a place to go there.

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:35.600
The excellent state of
preservation and excavation

02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:38.140
of this evidence has clearly,

02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:42.720 position:56%
very clearly demonstrated the people
here were living Phoenician style.

02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:48.150
There's no less than five
or six bread ovens really

02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:51.980
to make this flatbread that have
been found in those places there.

02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:55.830
Again, all of this dating to
the very end of the 9th century,

02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:57.130
sort of early 8th century.

02:40:57.130 --> 02:41:01.160
So we're back at the very early
dates, coinciding roughly in time

02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:02.860
with the foundation of Carthage.

02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:07.240
And what's remarkable therefore,
at that very early date,

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.330 position:56%
people were already going as far as
the very edges of the Mediterranean,

02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:18.240
venturing out at least into
the opening up of the Atlantic.

02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.340
So what we have here clearly
therefore is a Phoenician migrant

02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:26.430
community setting themselves up
not just for making a few bucks

02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:30.240
on the shoreline or exchanging
something on the beaches or so.

02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:31.680 position:56%
This is something totally different.

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.350
This is a very substantial,

02:41:33.350 --> 02:41:38.610
well-established trading
and migrant settlement.

02:41:38.610 --> 02:41:40.790
What's interesting though, and
that's a little fragment you see

02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:42.280
in the very middle
of my slide there,

02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:45.800 position:56%
is it's not just Phoenician material
culture that's being found here.

02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:50.870
This pot that you see there is a
vessel from the island of Sardinia

02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:52.640
and interestingly not
a Phoenician one.

02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.930
But this is one, a so-called
Nuragic jug that belongs

02:41:57.930 --> 02:42:00.380 position:56%
within the Nuragic/Sardinia culture.

02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:03.640
So the island of Sardinia,
sort of situated centrally

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:06.790
in the west Mediterranean, is
one of those important places.

02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:09.920 position:56%
A very large island, one of the
largest islands of the Mediterranean

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:11.920
that really played a key role

02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:14.590
in Phoenician expansion
and its contacts.

02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:18.120
The creating of those
contacts across and spanning

02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:20.530
over the entire Mediterranean.

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:24.790
And you're looking here at
this wonderful bay which is one

02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:28.830
of the best anchorages in this
part of the Mediterranean.

02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:35.800 position:56%
This site and the next one that I'll
be talking about, these two dots

02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:37.640
that you see here, the
sites of St. Bernia

02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.220
and Suraki actually have
come up with evidence.

02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:44.580
And again in the last
5-10 years with evidence

02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:47.300
of a different mode of being.

02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:50.220
A different mode of
migrating and a different mode

02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:54.710 position:56%
of commercial interaction within the
Phoenician world that we have seen.

02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:56.310
Because these two sites, St. Bernia

02:42:56.310 --> 02:42:58.490
and Suraki are not
Phoenician settlements.

02:42:58.490 --> 02:43:01.940
These are indigenous Nuragic
Sardinian settlements.

02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:06.260
But we've got clear evidence
here of Phoenician activities

02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:10.120
and in fact sort of fairly
permanent presence in those sites.

02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.240
And in fact, the amphora that you
see here is a local production.

02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:15.700
It's not a Canaanite jar.

02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:17.160
It's not a Phoenician amphora.

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:18.460
It's locally produced.

02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:21.150
The type is sort of
specific to Sardinia.

02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:26.110
But it is clearly sort of based
on the Phoenician prototypes.

02:43:26.110 --> 02:43:29.900
And this type of jar is called
St. Bernia jar because that's

02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:32.860
where it was first recognized,
has actually been found

02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:34.920
in Carthage itself as well.

02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:37.800
And probably now in Spain too.

02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:40.500
And all of this goes together
with all of those other elements

02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:42.570
that make up these
material connections.

02:43:42.570 --> 02:43:43.870
There's some Greek pottery,

02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:46.070
some very early Greek pottery
as you can see as well.

02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:47.990
We're talking near the
end of the 9th century.

02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:52.690
So again we're back to the very
early horizon Phoenician expansion

02:43:52.690 --> 02:43:54.000
in the west.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:59.140
And of course those sort of
shapeless blocks that are lying

02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:00.490
at the foot of the amphora.

02:44:00.490 --> 02:44:03.320
These are broken up bronze ingots.

02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:08.010
So again, sort of trade in metal
very well demonstrated here.

02:44:08.010 --> 02:44:12.730
This slide gives you an indication
of that site of St. Bernia

02:44:12.730 --> 02:44:15.430
which you clearly see this
is totally alien in a way

02:44:15.430 --> 02:44:17.480
to Phoenician architecture.

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.090
Because in fact it isn't.

02:44:19.090 --> 02:44:22.280
It is what the site of
St. Bernia looks like.

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:25.180
Typical late bronze age,
iron age architecture

02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:28.210
with all the specificities
that I won't be going into.

02:44:28.210 --> 02:44:29.510
But what we're looking

02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:33.850
at is therefore present
Phoenician context that's

02:44:33.850 --> 02:44:39.110 position:56%
in this case difficult to say within
a well-established local complex.

02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:42.280
For better understanding of
how that sort of embedding

02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:48.380
of the Phoenician complex could
work in a Nuragic Sardinia context,

02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:49.740
we need to look at this other side.

02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:54.410
Suraki, sort of lower down
the west coast of Sardinia,

02:44:54.410 --> 02:44:57.160 position:56%
which is in fact the site where I
am directing the excavation project.

02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:01.340
At the moment we have got
very extensive evidence

02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:04.440
of Phoenician material, like
this mushroom lipped jar

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:06.860 position:56%
which actually comes from this site.

02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:08.790
And some other Greek
and local material.

02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:10.240
But it is mostly through --

02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:12.570
and again sort of connecting
to the previous paper,

02:45:12.570 --> 02:45:17.390
through archaeometric,
technical, scientific investigation

02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:18.690
where the pottery was made.

02:45:18.690 --> 02:45:22.410
But also through X-ray analysis
understanding how handles are

02:45:22.410 --> 02:45:26.770
shaped, how the pot itself was
shaped, how rims were connected.

02:45:26.770 --> 02:45:30.570
That gives us an insight into the
very small details of the skills

02:45:30.570 --> 02:45:32.850
of artisans, of the
ceramic artisans.

02:45:32.850 --> 02:45:38.940
This shows us actually that even if
pots look they are Sardinian style

02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:44.060 position:56%
or they are Phoenician style, we can
see that we must have had masters

02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:46.830
and trainees of different
cultural backgrounds.

02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:48.440
Because we can see a mixing up,

02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:51.680
the body of the pot made
in a Phoenician style.

02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:55.400 position:56%
The pot made to look like a
Phoenician cooking pot for instance.

02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:00.430
But the handle or the rim made
with Nuragic indigenous techniques.

02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:03.890
So it's really the kind of
interactions that you can only get

02:46:03.890 --> 02:46:06.370
when people are sort of
living and working together

02:46:06.370 --> 02:46:09.740 position:56%
on the same place for quite a while.

02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:13.250
And it would land here,
this brief survey,

02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:16.600
with another material dimension
of what those connections are.

02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:18.150
It's actually the ships themselves.

02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:20.810
We've heard about the
Uluburun wreck.

02:46:20.810 --> 02:46:23.890
We've heard a reference to
the [inaudible] wreck earlier.

02:46:23.890 --> 02:46:26.260
This is another sort of
one that's just beginning

02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:29.660
to make the literature
because it's so recent.

02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:33.610
This is one of two ships that
were found just off the beach

02:46:33.610 --> 02:46:37.020
of [inaudible] south of
[inaudible] in [Spanish name]

02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:40.720
on the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:45.300
This has been excavated and that
actually dates to the 7th century

02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:48.460
and it gives us some
material evidence as well.

02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:51.440
And it's associated with the sort
of pottery that you see there.

02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:55.280
But the other object that you
see on this slide is actually --

02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:58.470
it's a model as you
can see on this slide.

02:46:58.470 --> 02:47:00.170
It's a bronze model.

02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:02.820
That is typically Sardinian
Nuragic model.

02:47:02.820 --> 02:47:04.900
And I want to use this
to connect back

02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:08.150
to what I've been reminding
you of, is all this interaction

02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:09.450
that I've been talking about.

02:47:09.450 --> 02:47:11.820
Yes, the Phoenicians clearly
were sailing the whole

02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:13.120
of the Mediterranean.

02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:15.350
They were setting up shop,
literally in many cases

02:47:15.350 --> 02:47:17.020
on the other side of
the Mediterranean.

02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:19.150
But they were not the
only ones doing that.

02:47:19.150 --> 02:47:21.420
They didn't venture
into a Mediterranean

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:22.960
where they were the first ones.

02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:25.040
And you can just remind
yourself when you're going

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:28.050
into those sometimes dangerous
seas, particularly the Strait

02:47:28.050 --> 02:47:30.460
of Gibraltar, some of those
places, the Straits of Sicily,

02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:33.260 position:56%
these are not easy seas to navigate.

02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:34.980
Local knowledge, local pilots,

02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:37.730
local advisors must have
been very important.

02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:41.120
And although we don't have any
concrete evidence of Nuragic

02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:45.890
or Iberian shipwrecks yet, I
should add, I would hope to add,

02:47:45.890 --> 02:47:49.380
it is bronze models like this
one that give us a little glimpse

02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:53.130
of those other indigenous
native seagoing skills

02:47:53.130 --> 02:47:55.090
that must have existed.

02:47:55.090 --> 02:47:58.660
And with whom Phoenicians
must have worked as well.

02:47:58.660 --> 02:48:01.950
And it's easily imaginable that
just as has been demonstrated

02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:06.330 position:56%
for the Uluburun wreck in an earlier
period, the crew was very much sort

02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:08.120
of culturally mixed
and international.

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:14.660
The same must have been true
in these later periods as well.

02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:18.640
So what I want to conclude
therefore on two points is

02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:21.800
that this brief survey of
archaeological finds sort

02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:23.580
of with the shipwrecks --

02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:26.920
again underscores this conventional
representation of the definitions

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:29.280
of skilled sailors and navigators.

02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.810
And particularly the evidence

02:48:30.810 --> 02:48:34.450
of the [inaudible] spells
it out in great detail.

02:48:34.450 --> 02:48:38.430
But at the same time, the Sardinian
evidence of the local embedding

02:48:38.430 --> 02:48:42.620
of those Phoenician traders,
travelers and sailors as well

02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:48.110
as recognizing those Phoenicians
within Carthage and Spain shows

02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:49.430
that it is highly unlikely

02:48:49.430 --> 02:48:51.910
that these Phoenicians were
the only ones plying the seas

02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:54.400
of the Mediterranean in the
early 1st millennium BC.

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:57.680
As we take all this
together therefore,

02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.900
the new evidence has just been
coming up in these last decades

02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:04.910
and richly established accounts
considerably by both detailing

02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:07.190
and by complicating
our understanding

02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:09.770
of Phoenician overseas
connections and interactions

02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:12.090 position:56%
with west Mediterranean communities.

02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:14.510
Thank you for your attention.

02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:18.090
[ Applause ]

02:49:18.090 --> 02:49:20.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Van Dommelen.

02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.180
Our next speaker, Mr. James
Fitzpatrick is a senior partner

02:49:25.180 --> 02:49:29.440
at the Washington Law
Firm of Arnold and Porter.

02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:33.390
For many years he was
the responsible partner

02:49:33.390 --> 02:49:38.650
for the legislative public
policy group in the firm.

02:49:38.650 --> 02:49:43.340
He was involved in major
legislative proceedings dealing

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:47.900
with the auto safety issues,
revision of national standards

02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:49.870
for copyright protection,

02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:53.540
for the recording industry
and professional sports.

02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:57.730
As well as the congressional
hearings defending officials

02:49:57.730 --> 02:50:00.110
of the Clinton administration.

02:50:00.110 --> 02:50:04.680
Senior officials of major
universities and corporate leaders

02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:07.300
under fire from Congress.

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:12.770
For 25 years Mr. Fitzpatrick
represented art dealers, museums

02:50:12.770 --> 02:50:14.690
and collectors in legislative

02:50:14.690 --> 02:50:18.700
and judicial proceedings
establishing fundamental rules

02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:22.220
of law at federal and
international level.

02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:24.710
Relating to the movement
of antiquities

02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:27.980
and cultural properties
around the world.

02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:29.890
For 10 years he has taught a course

02:50:29.890 --> 02:50:35.430 position:56%
at Georgetown Law School entitled
Indiana Jones and the Elgin Marbles:

02:50:35.430 --> 02:50:39.760
Dealing with the Legal System
relating to Cultural Properties.

02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:42.010
Mr. Fitzpatrick received
his law degree

02:50:42.010 --> 02:50:44.810
from Indiana University Law School.

02:50:44.810 --> 02:50:48.520
He read economics at Corpus
Christie College, Cambridge.

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:51.390
And taught at the London
School of Economics

02:50:51.390 --> 02:50:54.070
and Trinity College Dublin.

02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:58.440
He has been a central player
in the 1990's culture wars,

02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:01.150
in which critics attempted
to shut down federal support

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.780
for the National Endowment
of the Arts.

02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:08.750
Those battles were fought in the
congress, the courts and the press.

02:51:08.750 --> 02:51:13.210
Mr. Fitzpatrick has led a number
of civil rights, civil liberties

02:51:13.210 --> 02:51:15.470
and human rights organizations
pressing

02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:18.770
for essential liberties
under the law.

02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:21.510
Mr. James Fitzpatrick.

02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:26.040
[ Applause ]

02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:27.340
&gt;&gt; James Fitzpatrick:
Thank you so much.

02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:31.870
This has really been an
intellectually engaging morning.

02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:33.800
We've had wine.

02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:39.190
All of us can go home now and have
that third glass of wine feeling

02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:42.510
that you had history on your side.

02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:44.610
We've had the Bible,
we've had archaeology,

02:51:44.610 --> 02:51:46.930
we're going to have numismatics.

02:51:46.930 --> 02:51:55.600 position:56%
This has been really a quite
strikingly engaging set of lectures.

02:51:55.600 --> 02:52:02.060
I must say that this presentation
-- the movies are over, folks.

02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:04.520
This is not going to be
a slide presentation.

02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:07.330
We're going to go back
to the 19th century

02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:12.860
where we converse verbally
rather than visually.

02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:17.930
Now one of the basic
laws of lawyering

02:52:17.930 --> 02:52:24.280
and advocacy is particularly
when you're last on the program,

02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:28.060
you never want to talk
too long to a group

02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:31.070
of hungry judges and a hungry jury.

02:52:31.070 --> 02:52:34.920
And I'm sure that, Mary Jane,
that's the same thing here.

02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:39.620
I'll try to be quick.

02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:46.020
My assignment is not, in contrast
to everyone else, Tyre-specific.

02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:49.970
What I have been asked
to talk about is

02:52:49.970 --> 02:52:54.520
in a broader vector
law and antiquities.

02:52:54.520 --> 02:53:01.720
And this is a sprawling subject
involving international law,

02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:04.520
national law, US law.

02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:08.800
Patrimonial laws around the world.

02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.910
Criminal and civil law and
the standards that are created

02:53:12.910 --> 02:53:17.560
by museum associations and
architectural associations.

02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:20.910 position:56%
To get the full play of all this,
you're going to need to have to come

02:53:20.910 --> 02:53:23.910
to Georgetown University
and take my class.

02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:26.810
And I welcome you all there.

02:53:26.810 --> 02:53:31.260
I'm going to talk about
basically two issues

02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:36.580
in this quite comprehensive field.

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:43.740
One is the law as it
relates to or doesn't relate

02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:50.320
to this heartbreaking destruction
in the mid east by ISIS,

02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:53.900
the Islamic State, of antiquities.

02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:59.970
And does the law -- what
can the law do about that?

02:53:59.970 --> 02:54:06.110
The second thing I want to
talk about briefly is the law

02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:13.040
and repatriation of items
that are found in museums

02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:16.110
and collections around the world.

02:54:16.110 --> 02:54:22.300
Both of these are matters of
significant contemporary import.

02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:28.380
One of the joys of teaching
this class at Georgetown is

02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:32.770
that I can clip the New York
Times and the Wall Street Journal

02:54:32.770 --> 02:54:38.150
and the art newspaper every
week and have something to talk

02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:41.930
to my students that
is this week's news.

02:54:41.930 --> 02:54:50.260 position:56%
So these are two topics that I think
illustrate the interplay of the law

02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:56.570
and the broad issue
of who owns the past.

02:54:56.570 --> 02:55:04.590
That ultimately to me is one
of the most challenging issues.

02:55:04.590 --> 02:55:14.100
And it's played out in the legal
literature in two elements.

02:55:14.100 --> 02:55:18.680
One approach to who owns
the past is what is thought

02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:21.160
of as an international approach.

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.080
The whole world has a stake
in the culture of the world.

02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:30.620
This is not narrowly national.

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:36.230 position:56%
The second view is a source country,
a country that produced material,

02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:40.260
had first dibs to those materials.

02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:45.090
And they are not part of the
common heritage of mankind.

02:55:45.090 --> 02:55:48.400
This is a tough ongoing issue.

02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:54.480
And I would tell you my bias,
having worked on the museum side

02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.100
of this issue and the collector
and dealer side of this issue --

02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:01.170
I have a bias and I
will try to as we go

02:56:01.170 --> 02:56:05.530
through here tell you
what's bias and what's fact.

02:56:05.530 --> 02:56:11.040
In this debate which
essentially pits the museum

02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:15.440
and the collector community
that supports the view

02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:21.550
that the world has a right to
antiquities on the one side.

02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:25.740
And essentially the archaeological
community and the community

02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:34.750
of source countries, this is very
energetic debate that plays out

02:56:34.750 --> 02:56:37.330
and has played out in Congress.

02:56:37.330 --> 02:56:39.510
Has played out at the
State Department,

02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:43.180
plays out in the courts,
plays out in the press.

02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:49.650
And plays out very dramatically
in professional organizations.

02:56:49.650 --> 02:56:53.900
And my admonition to my students

02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:58.420
when we start this course
is be very skeptical

02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:01.630
of anything anybody
says in this area.

02:57:01.630 --> 02:57:04.460
Because everybody is coming
at this question as to

02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:07.370
who owns the past with
a point of view?

02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:12.770
I do when I bring in
archaeologists to speak.

02:57:12.770 --> 02:57:14.370
They have a point of view.

02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:19.420
This is an area to me that one has

02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:24.460
to impose healthy skepticism
about anyone's view.

02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:27.000
I don't think in this debate

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:32.920
between the museum community
-- let the borders be open.

02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:35.410
Let's have free trade in objects.

02:57:35.410 --> 02:57:37.730
And an archaeological community

02:57:37.730 --> 02:57:40.900
which has a legitimate
opposite view --

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:45.980
I don't think anybody's 100%
right and no one's 100% wrong.

02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:50.230
Let's talk about these two issues.

02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:55.960
First, the issue of the
return of iconoclasm

02:57:55.960 --> 02:58:00.920
with the emergence
of ISIS and Taliban.

02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:04.330 position:56%
And this isn't an abstract question.

02:58:04.330 --> 02:58:07.810 position:56%
You pick up the papers,
particularly in the last two months.

02:58:07.810 --> 02:58:13.110
And in one sense your heart
breaks at what's happened at some

02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:19.580
of these treasures
in Iraq and Syria.

02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:22.700
In Mosul, the tomb of Jonah.

02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:28.720
The museums where you had
pictures of ISIS fighters going

02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:34.360
in with sledgehammers
breaking down objects.

02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:42.400
The Negal Gate where the ISIS
people were taking jackhammers

02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:51.780 position:56%
to these beautiful statues which you
see also happily, safely in the Met.

02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:56.370
In Syria, five of six world
heritage sites have been

02:58:56.370 --> 02:58:58.370
significantly damaged.

02:58:58.370 --> 02:59:04.070
ISIS has just gone into Palmyra
and there is no indication

02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:08.370
of specifically the damage that
has already happened there.

02:59:08.370 --> 02:59:11.840
But at a moment's notice,
some of the great treasures

02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:16.150
of humanity could be destroyed.

02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:21.060
Earlier you had the same
issues played out in Kabul

02:59:21.060 --> 02:59:26.000
where the Taliban went into
the museum there with hammers

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:30.460
and destroyed non-Islamic items.

02:59:30.460 --> 02:59:37.590
And then you had this
totally unbelievable moment

02:59:37.590 --> 02:59:42.250
where rocket launchers were
aimed at the majestic statues

02:59:42.250 --> 02:59:44.740
of Bamiyan and destroyed.

02:59:44.740 --> 02:59:52.260
Statues of Buddha that were 160 and
140 feet high reduced to rubble.

02:59:52.260 --> 02:59:59.520
The rationale is that this
is -- my light at least --

02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:02.190
this is the rationale of a zealot.

03:00:02.190 --> 03:00:08.490
This short quote came from a
transcription of a YouTube --

03:00:08.490 --> 03:00:16.280
a transcription of a tape that
described the destruction.

03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:21.310
"The ruins that are behind me, they
are idols and statues that people

03:00:21.310 --> 03:00:25.020
in the past used to
worship instead of Allah.

03:00:25.020 --> 03:00:30.160
The so-called Assyrians and others
looked to gods for war, agriculture

03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:33.600
and rain to whom they
offered sacrifices.

03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:35.620 position:56%
The prophet Muhammed took down idols

03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:39.100
with his bare hands
when he went into Mecca.

03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:43.750
We were ordered by our prophets to
take down idols and destroy them.

03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:48.180 position:56%
When God orders us to remove and
destroy them, it becomes easy for us

03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:52.260
and we don't care even if they
care millions of dollars."

03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:56.300
I don't think that this is
anything other than the narrow view

03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.200
of the people wreaking the hammers.

03:00:59.200 --> 03:01:05.040
Huge numbers of scholars
and wise commentators

03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:09.280
from the Muslim community have
deplored this destruction.

03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:17.340
But this is the animating sense
behind what they are doing.

03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:20.150
In an acumenital sense they
are doing the Lord's work

03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:25.900
by destroying these items.

03:01:25.900 --> 03:01:31.820
The question is -- oh, one point.

03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:37.500
Nobody in the west can be
overly sanctimonious about this.

03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:42.740
We all recall Cromwell going
into Ireland and desecrating

03:01:42.740 --> 03:01:46.750
and destroying statues
in Catholic churches.

03:01:46.750 --> 03:01:50.010
And we all recall in the
19th century the British

03:01:50.010 --> 03:01:52.860 position:56%
and French armies going into Beijing

03:01:52.860 --> 03:01:55.630
and absolutely destroying
the Summer Palace.

03:01:55.630 --> 03:01:58.740
So this sense of idolatry

03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:05.130
and sanctimony is not
limited to any one group.

03:02:05.130 --> 03:02:12.770
But it is an animus, an
impetus that has to be resisted.

03:02:12.770 --> 03:02:21.020
This sort of bigotry and absolutism
is the most potent element

03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:24.510
in destroying the world's culture.

03:02:24.510 --> 03:02:27.340
You know, there are three
issues by my lights.

03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:31.910
There are three issues
going on in this fight.

03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:34.220
One is the religious impetus.

03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:38.780
Second, I think this is
the element of destruction:

03:02:38.780 --> 03:02:41.920
is a way to exercise power

03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:47.770
and to terrify the populace
that is being overtaken.

03:02:47.770 --> 03:02:53.700
One is beheading statues just
as one is beheading individuals.

03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:59.990
It is a power play to press
into submission the people

03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:04.930
in the territory which
you have overtaken.

03:03:04.930 --> 03:03:07.900
The third element is
an economic element.

03:03:07.900 --> 03:03:11.780
There has been a lot
of press about the fact

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:17.210
that ISIS has taken small
items, small objects

03:03:17.210 --> 03:03:19.240
and put them into the black market.

03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:23.180
But I don't think that
the reality is

03:03:23.180 --> 03:03:26.930
that that's what's
funding ISIS today.

03:03:26.930 --> 03:03:30.430
There's oil, there's money
coming from supporting countries.

03:03:30.430 --> 03:03:36.330
We all know that in the commerce,
the black market of antiquities,

03:03:36.330 --> 03:03:39.890
the people that got it out of the
ground and the people that gave it

03:03:39.890 --> 03:03:42.280 position:56%
to the first traders get a pittance.

03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:44.860
It ain't got big dollars
until it gets

03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:47.850
to the west end or
the upper eastside.

03:03:47.850 --> 03:03:51.570
So I think though economics
is one rationale.

03:03:51.570 --> 03:03:56.080
To me that is not the
critical issue.

03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:01.160
Now the question is, what
can the law do about this?

03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:04.000
Can it stop the destruction?

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:09.270
The sad reality is that
legal institutions,

03:04:09.270 --> 03:04:14.230
international legal
institutions have little power

03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:17.260
to stop this destruction.

03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:21.060
There are some high-minded
international conventions --

03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:26.820
the Hague Convention in 1954,
a UNESCO convention talking

03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:30.480
about every nation
has the responsibility

03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:33.730
to guard cultural properties.

03:04:33.730 --> 03:04:38.630
That is really in this
situation cheap talk.

03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:45.930
There is no effective
enforcement mechanism to go in

03:04:45.930 --> 03:04:50.050
and stop this destruction.

03:04:50.050 --> 03:04:54.820
It ultimately is going to
be, and this is not the kind

03:04:54.820 --> 03:04:57.240
of world we would like it to be --

03:04:57.240 --> 03:05:04.090
it ultimately is going to be a
matter of who wins the hearts

03:05:04.090 --> 03:05:06.970
and minds and the military.

03:05:06.970 --> 03:05:08.270
This is going to be a military

03:05:08.270 --> 03:05:11.510
and political solution,
not a legal solution.

03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:15.620
There are some things that
can be done by the law.

03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:21.430
One thing is you can have either an
international or a national embargo

03:05:21.430 --> 03:05:26.100
against the import of any of
these items that might be smuggled

03:05:26.100 --> 03:05:31.280 position:56%
out of Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria.

03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:35.360
That will only work
if it's international.

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:40.080 position:56%
With an international market it does
no good to close down the markets

03:05:40.080 --> 03:05:44.860
on 57th Street in New York
if there's a thriving market

03:05:44.860 --> 03:05:49.240
in the Emirates or in
London or in Paris.

03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:52.270
There has to be an
international response.

03:05:52.270 --> 03:05:58.330
But there can be some efforts
beyond rhetoric to try to deal

03:05:58.330 --> 03:06:04.500 position:56%
after the fact with the consequences
of the destruction and looting.

03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:07.020
And once something is found,

03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:11.140
then it's clearly a
candidate to be sent back.

03:06:11.140 --> 03:06:13.960
If something is actually
intercepted by customs,

03:06:13.960 --> 03:06:19.750
it isn't the easiest thought in
the world where you send it back.

03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:27.050 position:56%
Do you really want to send something
back to Syria at this point?

03:06:27.050 --> 03:06:28.840
Or do you hold it?

03:06:28.840 --> 03:06:33.830
My preference would be you
make clear this is Syrian

03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:38.600
or this is Iraqi and you hold it
for the moment until one's assured

03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:44.800 position:56%
that it can go back to a safe venue.

03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:49.190
There are also some
extralegal steps.

03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:54.360
And though this is not directed
to the specific geography

03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:59.020
of what we're talking about,
this is a step that any nation

03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:04.510
which is endangered with
the kind of override

03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:06.330
that we've seen in the mid east.

03:07:06.330 --> 03:07:11.330
It requires a very careful
inventory of what's in the museum.

03:07:11.330 --> 03:07:15.490
That wasn't in the Baghdad
museum when it was looted.

03:07:15.490 --> 03:07:18.350
No one could really
figure out what was there.

03:07:18.350 --> 03:07:26.760
One needs a process of inventory
and one needs an emergency plan.

03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:31.950
Many museums have found their
treasures have been saved

03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:34.550
because they've been
taken out of the museum

03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:38.460
and sent to some safe place.

03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:42.440
It's much like the Louvre
in the second World War.

03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:49.410
Where the treasures in the
Louvre were removed and sent

03:07:49.410 --> 03:07:52.880
around the French countryside
to safety.

03:07:52.880 --> 03:08:03.360
So that part of my discussion
ends on sort of a cautious note.

03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:07.900
The law is great in
terms of principle.

03:08:07.900 --> 03:08:13.430
The law in this particular
area is not very good in terms

03:08:13.430 --> 03:08:16.660
of execution and stopping.

03:08:16.660 --> 03:08:22.310
Very quickly I just want to
note about the reparation issue.

03:08:22.310 --> 03:08:27.030
I'm sure many of you have read
and followed the great controversy

03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:32.640
between the Met and the Getty and
Italy and Greece on some objects

03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:37.410
that were bought in
very shady circumstances

03:08:37.410 --> 03:08:43.220
by both the Met and the Getty.

03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:46.070
Where it was essentially
look the other way

03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:48.900
and don't worry too
much about provenance.

03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:53.280
These are such beautiful objects,
that justifies their buying.

03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:57.890
The basic legal rule, the
basic legal rule as set

03:08:57.890 --> 03:09:01.950
down by international
conventions is the nation

03:09:01.950 --> 03:09:07.980 position:56%
where an object is found has control
over it, has ownership over it.

03:09:07.980 --> 03:09:11.680
And that's very easy to
define as a matter of policy.

03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:15.490
It's not that clear
it's the right rule.

03:09:15.490 --> 03:09:20.180
What if the nation where something
is found has no cultural connection

03:09:20.180 --> 03:09:21.910
with the object itself?

03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:25.560
It's found in the mid east which is
the product of political boundaries

03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:30.960
that were designed right
after the first World War.

03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:34.720
What if there is no connection
between Turkey and Ephesus?

03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:37.970
There's an economic connection,
but there's no cultural connection

03:09:37.970 --> 03:09:42.100
between the Ottoman
Empire and the Greek

03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:45.050
and Roman treasures in Ephesus.

03:09:45.050 --> 03:09:49.300
Does Turkey have first
dibs to those objects?

03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:56.690 position:56%
What happens where you have a county
that doesn't have the capacity

03:09:56.690 --> 03:10:00.610
to take care of an
object or has no interest

03:10:00.610 --> 03:10:02.040
in taking care of an object?

03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:06.940
For a long time the Elgin
marbles debate turned on the issue

03:10:06.940 --> 03:10:13.670
of whether there was an
adequate resource in Athens

03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:15.500
to take care of the Elgin marbles.

03:10:15.500 --> 03:10:18.730
That's all been preempted
now with the construction

03:10:18.730 --> 03:10:23.850
of a magnificent 21st,
22nd century museum there.

03:10:23.850 --> 03:10:27.930
Third and finally, what
happens where a nation --

03:10:27.930 --> 03:10:32.380
should a nation have control and
ownership of an object or objects

03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:35.960
which are abhorrent to the
people that are living there?

03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:40.780
Do they really have first
dibs on those objects?

03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:46.900
My own view on repatriation, and
this is bias, this isn't fact,

03:10:46.900 --> 03:10:52.990 position:56%
is that one ought to approach
questions of repatriation cautiously

03:10:52.990 --> 03:11:00.000
and work through the issues
of whether or not the country

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:07.520
where one is sending
it has authority.

03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:09.420
The hook has come.

03:11:09.420 --> 03:11:12.390
I've got to stop.

03:11:12.390 --> 03:11:14.980
I've enjoyed talking to you.

03:11:14.980 --> 03:11:20.420
If anybody wants to continuing
arguing or archaeologists want

03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:23.570
to punch me in the nose,
we'll be around at lunchtime.

03:11:23.570 --> 03:11:25.510
Thank you all very much.

03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:35.080
[ Applause ]

03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:41.660
&gt;&gt; You've been a tremendously
patient and very fine audience.

03:11:41.660 --> 03:11:43.570
And we are now in our third panel

03:11:43.570 --> 03:11:49.520
in this extremely interesting
conference on the ancient

03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:52.740
and medieval and Byzantine
city of Tyre.

03:11:52.740 --> 03:11:56.720
Most people in the United
States at least know of Tyre

03:11:56.720 --> 03:11:58.600
through the Biblical narratives.

03:11:58.600 --> 03:11:59.980
And so it's only fitting

03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:04.670
that we have our last panel
on the Bible and on art.

03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:10.010
Now our first speaker is Professor
Mhammed Fantar who is an expert

03:12:10.010 --> 03:12:13.530
in western Semitic languages
and Middle East civilizations,

03:12:13.530 --> 03:12:18.200
especially Phoenicia and
its colony of Carthage.

03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:21.010
He is the former director
general of the National Institute

03:12:21.010 --> 03:12:26.280
of Archaeology and Art
of Tunis from 1982-1987.

03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:32.260
He is the director of research
at the [French name] and NIMP,

03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:36.310
and the director of the Phoenician
Punic Civilization Studies Center

03:12:36.310 --> 03:12:39.440
and Libyan Antiquity Center.

03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:43.850
Professor Fantar is the
founder of Repal Magazine

03:12:43.850 --> 03:12:46.220
that publishes the research
papers of that center.

03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:49.850
He is also a professor of
ancient history, archaeology

03:12:49.850 --> 03:12:54.640
and religious history at the
Tunis and Zitouna Universities.

03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:57.790
I'd like to welcome
Professor Mhammed Fantar

03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:59.880
who will be delivering
his lecture [French term]

03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:05.980
and the lecture will be translated.

03:13:05.980 --> 03:13:08.510
Thank you so much.

03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:14.740
[ Speaking French ]

03:13:14.740 --> 03:13:17.510
&gt;&gt; It's time for the break.

03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:41.410
[ Speaking French ]

03:13:41.410 --> 03:13:48.020
&gt;&gt; The Phoenician's dream and they
pull us into their dream as well

03:13:48.020 --> 03:13:57.510
and it is necessary to dream with
them to enjoy the trip, I think.

03:13:57.510 --> 03:14:14.290
[ Speaking French ]

03:14:14.290 --> 03:14:19.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I will try to present Tyre to you

03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:23.220
in all its importance
in the Mediterranean.

03:14:24.590 --> 03:14:30.350
On one side in relation to the
mythology and on the other side

03:14:30.350 --> 03:14:35.510
on the archaeological evidence of
the sites in the Mediterranean.

03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:56.490
[ Speaking French ]

03:14:56.490 --> 03:14:59.820
&gt;&gt; And so before I start
my discourse I would

03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:09.510
like to thank this sacred library
for inviting me to do this lecture.

03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:31.350
[ Speaking French ]

03:15:31.350 --> 03:15:35.680
&gt;&gt; And I mostly would like to thank
Ms. Chalabi for having invited me

03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:41.130
to this place and for having
joined the north and the south

03:15:41.130 --> 03:15:47.510
and hopefully this joining
will lead to a marriage.

03:15:47.510 --> 03:16:05.890
[ Speaking French ]

03:16:05.890 --> 03:16:13.070
&gt;&gt; So Tyre and the
mythology during the period

03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:19.510
when we were still talking about
Canaanites and not Phoenicians.

03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:40.530
[ Speaking French ]

03:16:40.530 --> 03:16:44.430
&gt;&gt; So the first evidence
goes back to [French name]

03:16:44.430 --> 03:16:52.630
who is the first reference
for the Phoenician presence

03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:57.510
and for the Canaanite existence.

03:16:57.510 --> 03:17:20.040
[ Speaking French ]

03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:25.150
&gt;&gt; So we are discussing
two characters,

03:17:25.150 --> 03:17:26.540
two brothers [French names].

03:17:26.540 --> 03:17:34.320
And these two brothers managed
to start the first phase

03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:39.510
of Phoenician exploration
in the Mediterranean.

03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:46.800
[ Speaking French ]

03:17:46.800 --> 03:17:49.110
&gt;&gt; So it's the first step

03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:56.510
of a Mediterranean ship
travelling from east to west.

03:17:56.510 --> 03:18:16.040
[ Speaking French ]

03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:25.080
&gt;&gt; So we witness the kidnapping
of a Tyrian princess called Europa

03:18:25.080 --> 03:18:35.510
and she is lured and kidnapped by
Zeus the god because of her beauty.

03:18:35.510 --> 03:19:00.370
[ Speaking French ]

03:19:00.370 --> 03:19:06.990
&gt;&gt; And so I am not going to go
through the entire love story

03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:11.600
that is related to
both Europe and Zeus.

03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:16.360 position:56%
But it is a symbol for the joining,
for the connection between the east,

03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:22.290
Europa, the Tyrian princess,
and Zeus representing Greece.

03:19:22.290 --> 03:19:25.510
So the joining between
east and west.

03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:55.030
[ Speaking French ]

03:19:55.030 --> 03:20:04.310
&gt;&gt; So the kidnapping of Europa
towards Greece led to a myth

03:20:04.310 --> 03:20:11.200
and to a story around
this beautiful princess.

03:20:11.200 --> 03:20:19.150 position:56%
And so it represents this connection
and it is of high importance

03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:25.510
to all the upcoming historians.

03:20:25.510 --> 03:20:38.530
[ Speaking French ]

03:20:38.530 --> 03:20:45.850
&gt;&gt; So Agenor the king
asks his son Cadmous,

03:20:45.850 --> 03:20:52.220
the brother of the princess, to
follow her and to look for her

03:20:52.220 --> 03:20:59.510
and never to return to
Phoenicia without finding her.

03:20:59.510 --> 03:21:26.030
[ Speaking French ]

03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:31.600
&gt;&gt; So the word Cadmous actually
presents the oriental man

03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:36.920
or the orientalist and the word
comes from the Hebraic Cadum.

03:21:36.920 --> 03:21:45.170
And Europa on the other hand
represents Europe, and so the rise

03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:48.970
of the sun from the east
and towards the west.

03:21:48.970 --> 03:21:55.510
The sunset is very
symbolic of this story.

03:21:55.510 --> 03:22:29.090
[ Speaking French ]

03:22:29.090 --> 03:22:31.670
&gt;&gt; So this myth, this
legend became the subject

03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:39.860 position:56%
of many ancient historians and
thinkers and even poets such as Vid.

03:22:39.860 --> 03:22:43.080
And it even continued
to be a subject

03:22:43.080 --> 03:22:51.510
of study towards the late
periods until the 20th century.

03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:57.540
[ Speaking French ]

03:22:57.540 --> 03:23:03.600
&gt;&gt; So Herodotus in the 5th century
introduced Cadmous to his readers

03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:09.510
because he brought the
alphabet to the Greeks.

03:23:09.510 --> 03:23:45.550
[ Speaking French ]

03:23:45.550 --> 03:23:50.220
&gt;&gt; So the fact that Cadmous left
Phoenicia and went to Greece

03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:53.600
on his own and was away
from his fatherland

03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:59.980
for a very long time meant that
he adopted a different mentality.

03:23:59.980 --> 03:24:04.590 position:56%
That he became an individual and the
fact that he is a unique individual

03:24:04.590 --> 03:24:08.260
and that he created a whole process

03:24:08.260 --> 03:24:11.810
by introducing the language
is something extraordinary.

03:24:11.810 --> 03:24:19.510
And there is no country without
the effect of one individual.

03:24:19.510 --> 03:26:03.040
[ Speaking French ]

03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:05.060
[ Applause ]

03:26:05.060 --> 03:26:09.480
&gt;&gt; So to translate and make
it as short as possible,

03:26:09.480 --> 03:26:18.460
in the Old Testament we have
proof of the importance of Tyre

03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:23.740
through the fact that the Old
Testament mentions the temple

03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:32.270
of Solomon being built by cedar
wood that was given by David.

03:26:32.270 --> 03:26:38.470
And I got mixed up now.

03:26:38.470 --> 03:26:42.180
So the wood is coming
all the way from Lebanon

03:26:42.180 --> 03:26:49.510
and Tyre has a very important
role in that process.

03:26:49.510 --> 03:27:08.190
[ Speaking French ]

03:27:08.190 --> 03:27:12.500
&gt;&gt; So the Phoenicians and the
Tyrians have a very important role

03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:19.640
as well by travelling from
Tyre to Jerusalem in order

03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:26.510
to bring gold from the temple.

03:27:26.510 --> 03:28:07.120
[ Speaking French ]

03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:11.400
&gt;&gt; So basically they not only
travelled the Middle Eastern coast.

03:28:11.400 --> 03:28:16.960
They also travelled towards Spain,
towards Cadiz and towards Carthage.

03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:24.510
And they dispersed the
Phoenician tradition.

03:28:24.510 --> 03:29:10.360
[ Speaking French ]

03:29:10.360 --> 03:29:15.410
&gt;&gt; So as we heard my predecessors
talking about the inscriptions,

03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:19.420 position:56%
the Phoenician inscriptions that are
spread all over the Mediterranean,

03:29:19.420 --> 03:29:23.610
we see the similarity between
the Phoenician language

03:29:23.610 --> 03:29:26.490
in the first three letters
versus the Greek language

03:29:26.490 --> 03:29:32.380
and the first three letters
which are A, B and C. As well

03:29:32.380 --> 03:29:34.900
as the same in the Greek version.

03:29:34.900 --> 03:29:38.360
So we have an incredible
assimilation

03:29:38.360 --> 03:29:43.510
of Phoenician culture
and Phoenician language.

03:29:43.510 --> 03:30:33.510
[ Speaking French ]

03:30:33.510 --> 03:30:38.510
[ Applause ]

03:30:38.510 --> 03:32:08.310
[ Speaking French ]

03:32:08.310 --> 03:32:15.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So with the Phoenician
travelling they arrived to Carthage.

03:32:15.280 --> 03:32:20.040
And Carthage is a very
unique site because it is one

03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:24.920
of the first democracies or the
first democracy in the world.

03:32:24.920 --> 03:32:29.750
And even Aristotle
himself supposedly said

03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:33.710
that he prefers the
political system of Carthage

03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:38.510
because it is more
balanced than his own.

03:32:38.510 --> 03:33:08.310
[ Speaking French ]

03:33:08.310 --> 03:33:12.210
&gt;&gt; So what we find in Carthage is
not only a Phoenician tradition

03:33:12.210 --> 03:33:17.670
but a mid eastern tradition
including the traditions that come

03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:20.660
from the Mesopotamian world.

03:33:20.660 --> 03:33:30.720 position:56%
And what happened in Carthage proves

03:33:30.720 --> 03:33:39.400
that the Middle Eastern world
had its expansion there.

03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:42.550
Contrary to what is happening
now with the Islamists

03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:46.510
and how they are destroying it.

03:33:46.510 --> 03:34:37.080
[ Speaking French ]

03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:40.630
&gt;&gt; And so if we are talking
about Mesopotamia he would

03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:45.750
like to highlight the evidence
found in Ebla and the site of Ebla

03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:49.600
and the tablets that
are found there.

03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:56.130
And their importance and the
danger that they are inflicted to,

03:34:56.130 --> 03:35:03.510
because the loss of these tablets
would be a loss for humanity.

03:35:03.510 --> 03:36:32.510
[ Speaking French ]

03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:36.170
[ Applause ]

03:36:36.170 --> 03:36:39.840
&gt;&gt; So our next speaker, Dr. Eric
Gubel who's the general director

03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:42.660
of the Royal Museums
of Art and History.

03:36:42.660 --> 03:36:46.610
He has authored more than 150
contributions to the history,

03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:50.570
art history and archaeology of
the Phoenician civilization.

03:36:50.570 --> 03:36:53.660
He was the co-editor of the
Studia Phoenicia Collection,

03:36:53.660 --> 03:36:55.420
as well as the [French name].

03:36:55.420 --> 03:37:00.290
And coordinator of the publication

03:37:00.290 --> 03:37:02.490
of Phoenician sculpture
in the Louvre.

03:37:02.490 --> 03:37:07.060
As an expert for UNESCO he
repatriated several antiquities

03:37:07.060 --> 03:37:10.570
stolen during the civil
war back to Beirut.

03:37:10.570 --> 03:37:14.550
He is now coordinating several
international scientific projects,

03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:17.780
preparing the edition of the final
reports of the American University

03:37:17.780 --> 03:37:23.340
of Beirut excavations led by
Dr. Leila Badre at Tell Kazel.

03:37:23.340 --> 03:37:26.110
And more recently Tyre.

03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:29.630
Besides a monograph on
Phoenician seals and a second one

03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:31.970
on Phoenician art and
how to read it.

03:37:31.970 --> 03:37:34.990 position:56%
And he has found time
nevertheless to come to us to speak.

03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:36.290
Please.

03:37:36.290 --> 03:37:41.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eric Gubel: I would also
like to thank the authorities

03:37:41.690 --> 03:37:47.610
of the Library of Congress and of
course Maha for bringing us here.

03:37:47.610 --> 03:37:50.780
So thank you all very much.

03:37:50.780 --> 03:37:57.330
This lecture is about Kind
Solomon's temple in the Jerusalem,

03:37:57.330 --> 03:38:01.080
belonging to the first
temple period.

03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:07.080 position:56%
It was constructed in honor not of
YHWH but in honor of the name of God

03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:11.200
in line with the biblical
allegorical tradition.

03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:18.050
It's iconology of value stands out
as one of the mightiest metaphors

03:38:18.050 --> 03:38:20.210
of the pre-classical world.

03:38:20.210 --> 03:38:24.950
On its stern, the Free Masons'
tradition also emphasizes the role

03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:31.730
of Hiram, son of the widow, as
the Tyrian king Hiram's tradition.

03:38:31.730 --> 03:38:34.970
An architect who eventually
realized one

03:38:34.970 --> 03:38:40.210
of the most ambitious building
projects, which lasted seven years.

03:38:40.210 --> 03:38:44.900
In doing so he also introduced
the asper masonry technique

03:38:44.900 --> 03:38:49.630
of Phoenician architects that
used it as a legacy of the past

03:38:49.630 --> 03:38:52.290
since several generations.

03:38:52.290 --> 03:38:54.740
Both biblical sources as well

03:38:54.740 --> 03:39:00.440
as Judeo-Christian iconography have
yielded lots of representations

03:39:00.440 --> 03:39:05.920
of the temple and its
furnishings based merely

03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:10.330
on the descriptions
in the book of Kings.

03:39:10.330 --> 03:39:16.680
Invariably in the absence,
total absence of actual remains.

03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:21.020 position:56%
So most of them entirely fictitious.

03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:26.820
In the present paper I would
like to emphasize the importance

03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:33.090 position:56%
of the archaeological representation
from Hiram's homeland.

03:39:33.090 --> 03:39:38.130
It's time to bring this
into the discussion.

03:39:38.130 --> 03:39:43.380
Documentation pertaining to the
engineering and designing skills

03:39:43.380 --> 03:39:45.970
of his specialized labor.

03:39:45.970 --> 03:39:50.740
The [inaudible] no doubt
travelled overland.

03:39:50.740 --> 03:39:55.200
The cedar logs had to
be shipped via cabotage

03:39:55.200 --> 03:40:00.660
from southern Phoenicia
straight to the biblical land

03:40:00.660 --> 03:40:04.750
of Kabul, present day Galilea.

03:40:04.750 --> 03:40:13.220
And where 20 settlements were later
granted by Solomon to Hiram of Tyre

03:40:13.220 --> 03:40:19.440
as part of his investment
in the project.

03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:24.550
In this context the
archeological site

03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:30.250
of [foreign name] is a very likely
candidate indeed for the location

03:40:30.250 --> 03:40:34.380
with Kabul and Israel
as a halting place

03:40:34.380 --> 03:40:39.010
for the cedar beams'
transport to Jerusalem.

03:40:39.010 --> 03:40:43.610
This is not only suggested by the
layout of a fort or small sanctuary

03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:49.550
in Sidil, but as well by
the presence of cedar logs,

03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:56.760
numerous Phoenician oil containers
and several Phoenician artifacts.

03:40:56.760 --> 03:40:59.860
Now in order to supply new data

03:40:59.860 --> 03:41:05.270
on today's topic we will now
review several items documenting a

03:41:05.270 --> 03:41:09.800
plausible reconstruction
of the Jerusalem temple.

03:41:09.800 --> 03:41:14.780
These fall into three main groups,
namely architectural elements.

03:41:14.780 --> 03:41:16.360
The core differences.

03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:21.720
And last but not least, the
temple's cultic furnishings.

03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:25.700
I start with, as you can see
on your slide, [inaudible].

03:41:25.700 --> 03:41:31.520
So as for the first case example
I refer to the description

03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:35.800
of the Solomonic temple windows.

03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:42.120
And those of this nearby
palace called the House

03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:44.280
of the Forests of Lebanon.

03:41:44.280 --> 03:41:51.010
The latter specifies the
[French term] pardon my French.

03:41:51.010 --> 03:41:54.810 position:56%
In other words, the windows to be --

03:41:54.810 --> 03:41:57.680
and here we go again
-- [French term].

03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:00.440
Etymologically three times.

03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:03.370
Which resulted in very confusing

03:42:03.370 --> 03:42:07.840
and contradictory translations
of the Old Testament.

03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:12.010
But if we are indeed allowed
to translate triple instead

03:42:12.010 --> 03:42:19.150
of three times and the description
becomes straightforward reference

03:42:19.150 --> 03:42:25.930
to the typical Phoenician window
base with their [inaudible].

03:42:25.930 --> 03:42:28.690
Such windows are depicted on dozens

03:42:28.690 --> 03:42:34.940
of 9th-8th century Phoenician
ivories, serving as some equivalent

03:42:34.940 --> 03:42:38.060
for the Egyptian window
of appearances.

03:42:38.060 --> 03:42:41.390 position:56%
Here however reserved for Phoenician
goddesses of the [foreign word]

03:42:41.390 --> 03:42:47.060 position:56%
like Jezebel about whom Isaiah said,
"Thou hast the forehead of a whore."

03:42:47.060 --> 03:42:51.020
She did not have a
hole in her forehead,

03:42:51.020 --> 03:42:57.550
but she was wearing these
jewels on her forehead

03:42:57.550 --> 03:43:02.410
which characterized
her as a priestess.

03:43:02.410 --> 03:43:07.090
A priestess of Baal of course.

03:43:07.090 --> 03:43:14.440
So it's fitting that Solomon would
already have windows decorated

03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:19.390
in the ancient style of
the Tyre Sidonian kingdom

03:43:19.390 --> 03:43:28.550
with straightforward
reference to the cult of Baal.

03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:29.850
Poor YHWH.

03:43:29.850 --> 03:43:34.410
The false window of a Sidon
[inaudible] -- sorry, no.

03:43:34.410 --> 03:43:42.410
I was just calling your
attention to the fact --

03:43:42.410 --> 03:43:49.120
you see the plasters have the form
of floral curling, drooping leaves.

03:43:49.120 --> 03:43:56.220
A detail also characterized in set
of bronze accessories not only used

03:43:56.220 --> 03:44:00.140
as you can see here as
lampstands and torch holders,

03:44:00.140 --> 03:44:03.550
but also as braziers
for roasted meet,

03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:06.490
libation and incense offerings.

03:44:06.490 --> 03:44:10.390
Within the walls of
sanctuaries and banquet halls all

03:44:10.390 --> 03:44:14.300
over the Phoenician Mediterranean.

03:44:14.300 --> 03:44:21.560 position:56%
The false window of a Sidon born
deceased buried in part of Cyprus is

03:44:21.560 --> 03:44:24.310
of the same type and
although less detailed,

03:44:24.310 --> 03:44:28.510
we should add the depiction
of Sidon's windows.

03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:37.360
Buildings at the time of
Sennacherib's campaign.

03:44:38.470 --> 03:44:46.420
In 1 Kings 6:29 we learn
that Solomon and I quote,

03:44:46.420 --> 03:44:50.600
"Decorated the walls of
the house, the temple,

03:44:50.600 --> 03:44:55.060
roundabout with carved
figures of cherubim

03:44:55.060 --> 03:44:59.640
and palm trees and open flowers."

03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:04.010
This description clearly
points to sculpture

03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:09.590
and possibly also to
painted freezes.

03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:13.350
Since one picture tells
more than a thousand words,

03:45:13.350 --> 03:45:15.980
I am showing you here
the typical 9th century,

03:45:15.980 --> 03:45:18.760
8th century Phoenician ivory strip.

03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:22.590
Which represents exactly

03:45:22.590 --> 03:45:28.490
in all details what the
biblical text refers to.

03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:36.620
And I will add it to the argument,
when the text further expands

03:45:36.620 --> 03:45:40.040
on the open flowers,
the open flowers are

03:45:40.040 --> 03:45:46.370
of course the lotus flowers opening
up and used for freezes again

03:45:46.370 --> 03:45:52.140
in 9th, 8th century Phoenician art.

03:45:52.140 --> 03:45:57.370
There is also Ezekiel who learns us

03:45:57.370 --> 03:46:02.400
that the temple's door
jams were decorated

03:46:02.400 --> 03:46:07.140
with [inaudible] on either side.

03:46:07.140 --> 03:46:12.790
Such capitals nicknamed
proto-aoic are abundantly attested

03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:17.090
in many sites south of
Caramel, including Jerusalem.

03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:23.630
But also at Ramit-Rahel in
combination with Asper masonry

03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:26.320
and triple recessed windows.

03:46:26.320 --> 03:46:29.690 position:56%
And I think I have here some slides.

03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:33.450
Considering the fact that the
same combination is attested

03:46:33.450 --> 03:46:39.550 position:56%
in Phoenician realm as attested
here, more precisely at the entrance

03:46:39.550 --> 03:46:43.550 position:56%
of a royal tomb [inaudible], Cyprus.

03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:48.260
The often repeated qualification
of the proto-oic capital

03:46:48.260 --> 03:46:54.170
as a typical Israelite invention
can no longer be sustained.

03:46:54.170 --> 03:47:00.390
You all remember of
course from the book

03:47:00.390 --> 03:47:08.400 position:56%
of Kings the detailed description of
the seraphim whose wings overlapped.

03:47:08.400 --> 03:47:14.350
These of course are the
typical winged sphinxes used

03:47:14.350 --> 03:47:17.380
in Phoenician cabinet making.

03:47:17.380 --> 03:47:24.960
And a nice example is of course
the coffin of Hiram king of Byblos.

03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:36.040 position:56%
Who reused a relieved sarcophagus of
the 12th century BC around 1000 BC.

03:47:36.040 --> 03:47:39.600
His forefather is represented
on the throne which is flanked

03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:46.560
by the two winged sphinxes who
were actually the [inaudible]

03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:50.410
of the cherubim of
the Solomonic temple.

03:47:50.410 --> 03:47:53.730 position:56%
Now also place your attention for --

03:47:53.730 --> 03:47:56.010
oh no, I can't point
this out to you.

03:47:56.010 --> 03:47:57.310
No, it's on the touch screen.

03:47:57.310 --> 03:48:00.250
Sorry. On the footstool,
the footstool.

03:48:00.250 --> 03:48:02.900
If you have a look at the
footstool you will say, "Hey,

03:48:02.900 --> 03:48:06.310
this resembles these
proto-ioc capitals."

03:48:06.310 --> 03:48:10.020
For yes indeed, there
is another prototype

03:48:10.020 --> 03:48:14.270
of what we find some generations
later in the Solomonic temple

03:48:14.270 --> 03:48:18.360
because it was constructed
by a Phoenician architect.

03:48:18.360 --> 03:48:22.720
And then we also have
this tripod table

03:48:22.720 --> 03:48:30.420 position:56%
and this tripod table was still used
in the third temple of Jerusalem.

03:48:30.420 --> 03:48:33.360
And now we are in the
1st century BCE.

03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:36.190
This is a [inaudible] coinage
of [Foreign name] the Great

03:48:36.190 --> 03:48:40.350
and you see a tripod table.

03:48:40.350 --> 03:48:45.550
A typical Phoenician invention
which was still connected

03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:50.580
with all kinds of temple
furnishings.

03:48:50.580 --> 03:48:55.720
And already in the early 1st
millennium BCE, as can be seen

03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:00.420
on these pieces, inspired
on the Phoenician prototype.

03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:07.270
The sphinx throne, the cherubim
throne was always associated

03:49:07.270 --> 03:49:09.690
with a footstool and a tripod.

03:49:09.690 --> 03:49:18.960
And this gives us the origin
of a type of cultic item used

03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:20.610
through that 1st millennium

03:49:20.610 --> 03:49:24.810
by Phoenician artists
as a typical Phoenician.

03:49:24.810 --> 03:49:31.000
And now we are going to
present another cultic item

03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:36.140
which is associated with the
temple, namely the cupboards.

03:49:36.140 --> 03:49:37.440
Cut boards.

03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:42.460
Here we have a tiny ivory
plaque from 9th century BCE,

03:49:42.460 --> 03:49:46.080
which can be perfectly well dated
because of the form of the black

03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:48.730
on red juglet which is
represented at the top of it.

03:49:48.730 --> 03:49:50.530
Classical Egyptian type.

03:49:50.530 --> 03:49:54.650
On the right you have
the Egyptian prototype.

03:49:54.650 --> 03:49:59.120
Well, this type of
cupboard, which was used

03:49:59.120 --> 03:50:06.690
to chest libation vases
used for ritual libations,

03:50:06.690 --> 03:50:15.440
also figures on one of the reliefs
of [inaudible] around 700 BC.

03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:18.150
[Inaudible] already
Phoenician inscriptions.

03:50:18.150 --> 03:50:19.930
It was indeed a site in Phoenicia

03:50:19.930 --> 03:50:22.280
of the very strong
Phoenician influence.

03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:24.880
So here we have this cupboard.

03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:29.630
And what is funny about cupboard
is that it is placed upside down.

03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:32.680
You see the round, the
whole round segment

03:50:32.680 --> 03:50:36.820
which actually should
be the roof of a tent,

03:50:36.820 --> 03:50:39.650
like the tent of the tabernacle.

03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:42.220
It's placed upside down.

03:50:42.220 --> 03:50:45.100
One might think that
this is due to the hands

03:50:45.100 --> 03:50:50.780
of an inexperience sculptor,
were it not that on the theory

03:50:50.780 --> 03:50:54.450 position:56%
of [inaudible] in the eastern delta.

03:50:54.450 --> 03:50:59.060
A priest, an officiating
priest, is standing on a cupboard

03:50:59.060 --> 03:51:04.820
of exactly the same type and
it's reversed once again.

03:51:04.820 --> 03:51:07.560
[French term] as we say in French.

03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:14.190
So this means that we are dealing
here with a Phoenician reproduction

03:51:14.190 --> 03:51:20.070
of an Egyptian cupboard which
is datable to roughly 700 BC.

03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:22.800
And the question is if cupboards

03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:25.480
of this type were already
used in the temple.

03:51:25.480 --> 03:51:28.220
And here I'm going
to skip a chapter.

03:51:28.220 --> 03:51:30.760
Not to raise any suspicion,

03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:36.220 position:56%
just know that the last part will be
a bit more what was in the cupboard.

03:51:36.220 --> 03:51:39.700
Well what was in the cupboard
was, as I told you already,

03:51:39.700 --> 03:51:46.310
a set of vessels used for
liquid offerings for libations.

03:51:46.310 --> 03:51:49.890
And the prototype was
the Egyptian situla.

03:51:49.890 --> 03:51:52.050
My colleague and good friend,

03:51:52.050 --> 03:51:55.900
the Syrian archaeologist
[Foreign name] just found a series

03:51:55.900 --> 03:52:00.660
of the situlae during
his excavations at Amrit.

03:52:00.660 --> 03:52:03.930
And I was asked to
prepare a publication.

03:52:03.930 --> 03:52:10.390
They were found together with
small amulets showing a priest

03:52:10.390 --> 03:52:12.720
in the middle of a libation.

03:52:12.720 --> 03:52:17.370
It always goes together in
the 7th, 6th century BC --

03:52:17.370 --> 03:52:22.880
situlae and these Egyptian bronzes.

03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:27.850
The same set was found in
Ashkelon which is normal

03:52:27.850 --> 03:52:33.080
because our friend Patrick McGovern
showed us the town with shipwrecks.

03:52:33.080 --> 03:52:39.000
These are saucer jars from Tyre
which they were on the road

03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:41.890
for Ashkelon and not
the other way around.

03:52:41.890 --> 03:52:48.700 position:56%
The biggest such cluster of
situlae was found at Memphis, Egypt.

03:52:48.700 --> 03:52:52.460
More precisely in the
necropolis of the sacred animals.

03:52:52.460 --> 03:52:58.510
And this necropolis was situated
in the shadow of the temple of Fah.

03:52:58.510 --> 03:53:01.640
And this brings us to
Herodotus who described

03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:10.040 position:56%
at this very spot near the temple of
Hapshepsut, the camp of the Tyrians.

03:53:10.040 --> 03:53:13.140
Thus for the first time we
have proof of the presence

03:53:13.140 --> 03:53:16.000
of these Phoenician
artists in Memphis.

03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:21.140 position:56%
If we look at some of these situlae,

03:53:21.140 --> 03:53:24.240
certain details are
completely un-Egyptian,

03:53:24.240 --> 03:53:28.660
such as a scarab with
two pairs of wings.

03:53:28.660 --> 03:53:35.410
You have to look for them, but if
you look for them you find them.

03:53:35.410 --> 03:53:39.630
We know already of three situlae
with Phoenician inscriptions

03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:40.950
from the 7th, 6th century BC.

03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:46.440
The one in the Louvre
alas un-deciphered as yet.

03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:52.040
This brings us to another of the
context [inaudible] of the temple.

03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:53.630
The sea of bronzes.

03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:58.280
Sources agree upon
the fact that the sea

03:53:58.280 --> 03:54:00.840
of bronzes is actually a reference

03:54:00.840 --> 03:54:07.060
to the wheeled carts
of the late bronze age.

03:54:07.060 --> 03:54:11.170
Most of them produced in Cyprus,
but other ones in the [inaudible].

03:54:11.170 --> 03:54:16.260
And here I'm showing you an
example just to make a point.

03:54:16.260 --> 03:54:22.450
In Phoenician mints, and I'll
show you the late 9th century seal

03:54:22.450 --> 03:54:23.750
of Shina.

03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:26.750
Here we have a gold statue,
and if you look closely you see

03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:32.400
that the god is standing with
his feet on a wheeled cart.

03:54:33.650 --> 03:54:40.250
And this brings us to
a kind of [inaudible].

03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:42.550
We speak of a tabernacle.

03:54:42.550 --> 03:54:47.060
Looking around during
ceremonies in Sidon

03:54:47.060 --> 03:54:50.400
on local coinage of the period.

03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:52.490
And you see that the top

03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:55.570
of the [inaudible] you have
these four palm branches.

03:54:55.570 --> 03:54:58.920
If you go to the Shina
cemetery in Tyre

03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:05.020 position:56%
for example during the age people
also placed these four palm branches

03:55:05.020 --> 03:55:08.930
on the graves of their deceased.

03:55:08.930 --> 03:55:13.100
And actually such real [inaudible]
have been excavated at Beirut

03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:17.090
and other places in the near east.

03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:23.830
A couple of months ago, almost
a year ago, there were a couple

03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:25.670
of shrines [inaudible] in Israel.

03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:30.230
And were immediately
described as the prototypes

03:55:30.230 --> 03:55:31.880
of the temple of Jerusalem.

03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:39.110 position:56%
You can actually see a little model
reproduced or enlarged to the right.

03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:45.030
Shows for the first time a very
important element of the temple

03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:49.660
of Jerusalem upon which I am
going to end this presentation.

03:55:49.660 --> 03:55:51.780
Namely the curtain.

03:55:51.780 --> 03:55:54.130
The temple's veil.

03:55:54.130 --> 03:55:59.680
A kind of a barrier which was
hiding the most sacred place,

03:55:59.680 --> 03:56:03.770
the innermost holy of
holies in the temple.

03:56:03.770 --> 03:56:06.160
I still have 10 minutes, perfect.

03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:07.590
Oh, I have five minutes?

03:56:07.590 --> 03:56:09.260
I have to rush a bit.

03:56:09.260 --> 03:56:12.960
What you see here is -- well
the curtain you don't see

03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:16.980
because it's wrapped around a
rail upon which it was hung.

03:56:16.980 --> 03:56:18.350
Okay, wrapped around.

03:56:18.350 --> 03:56:24.460
That is a very, very, very simple
way of getting rid of your curtain.

03:56:24.460 --> 03:56:25.760
Then you just let it down.

03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:32.180
And Maha of course recognizes one
of the shops in the site of Tyre,

03:56:32.180 --> 03:56:35.460
more precisely in the
Sidonian harbor.

03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:39.250 position:56%
Okay, this is the idea, the curtain.

03:56:39.250 --> 03:56:41.870
Please, please, please follow me.

03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:48.020
Although tablets, cuneiform
tablets from 13th century BC,

03:56:48.020 --> 03:56:52.990
there is question about
the violation of something

03:56:52.990 --> 03:56:56.780
and about people getting
the asylum right

03:56:56.780 --> 03:57:00.800
because they touched the
veil of the temple of Sidon.

03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:05.640
This is the very first time that
we hear about the asylum right

03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:08.320
and a veil in the temple.

03:57:08.320 --> 03:57:11.350
A prefiguration of the veil
in the temple of Jerusalem.

03:57:11.350 --> 03:57:13.710
And once again we're in Phoenicia,

03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:19.350
in what was to become the
Tyre Sidonian kingdom.

03:57:19.350 --> 03:57:25.910
Now I cannot show you a photograph
at the end of this expose

03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:27.800
of the temple of Jerusalem.

03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:31.880
In that case I would be a
National Geographic billionaire.

03:57:31.880 --> 03:57:35.970
But I can show you a document,
a contemporary document,

03:57:35.970 --> 03:57:37.280
contemporary with the temple.

03:57:37.280 --> 03:57:42.210
Which is as good as the
best photo will ever get.

03:57:42.210 --> 03:57:43.740
A Phoenician bull.

03:57:43.740 --> 03:57:46.580
And the Phoenician
bull which represents

03:57:46.580 --> 03:57:52.900
by four times not a zoo
with exotic animals.

03:57:52.900 --> 03:57:59.990
But the structure of the
innermost of the Jerusalem temple

03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:02.780
with its veil as described.

03:58:02.780 --> 03:58:11.860
And now going back to
my text, 2 Chronicles 3.

03:58:11.860 --> 03:58:16.600
What we are looking at is a
veil embroidered with figures

03:58:16.600 --> 03:58:18.690
of falcon-headed winged sphinxes.

03:58:18.690 --> 03:58:21.350
The cherubim of 2 Chronicles 3.

03:58:21.350 --> 03:58:25.250
Fixed by means of what you
see here on the drawings.

03:58:25.250 --> 03:58:28.480
Fixed by means of a
trail-less fringe with tassels

03:58:28.480 --> 03:58:30.110
in the form of pomegranates.

03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:32.940
Pomegranates also adorned the robes

03:58:32.940 --> 03:58:36.810
of the priests officiating
in the Jerusalem temple.

03:58:36.810 --> 03:58:43.170
And once again this is preceded
by the outfit of priests in Ugarit

03:58:43.170 --> 03:58:47.180
where even the mold for the
gold pomegranates has been found

03:58:47.180 --> 03:58:50.660
in the course of the excavations.

03:58:50.660 --> 03:59:01.540 position:56%
And in 2 Chronicles 14 it is said,
"He, Solomon, made interwoven chains

03:59:01.540 --> 03:59:04.700 position:56%
and put them on top of the pillars."

03:59:04.700 --> 03:59:10.180
So forget all about these
representations of Jakan and Baals

03:59:10.180 --> 03:59:11.820
in the temple of Solomon.

03:59:11.820 --> 03:59:16.100
There is no question of capitals
in the form of the pomegranates.

03:59:16.100 --> 03:59:20.330
Here the pomegranates are
here at the top of the curtain

03:59:20.330 --> 03:59:24.080
which represents these
cherubim as I showed you,

03:59:24.080 --> 03:59:28.530
as I pointed out on this slide.

03:59:28.530 --> 03:59:33.470
Now finally, as a special
present for Maha,

03:59:33.470 --> 03:59:35.070
three more minutes, Mr. President.

03:59:35.070 --> 03:59:37.920
As a final present, a couple

03:59:37.920 --> 03:59:42.370
of years ago the Spanish excavation
brought to light this model

03:59:42.370 --> 03:59:47.870
of a shrine and everyone thought
that, what could this possibly be?

03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:51.570
Well, now that I told you about
the temple, about the importance

03:59:51.570 --> 03:59:55.730
of the temple and the temple's
veil and about the tradition,

03:59:55.730 --> 03:59:59.480
the Phoenician tradition of veils,
embroidered veils in the temple,

03:59:59.480 --> 04:00:04.710
what if I showed you this
model as a model of temple

04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:09.420
with a temple veil blowing
out of the inner space?

04:00:09.420 --> 04:00:16.350
And if you don't believe me, I
have you by a recitation, quoting.

04:00:16.350 --> 04:00:21.450
This has everything to do with
the lost temple, the third temple.

04:00:21.450 --> 04:00:25.680
The letter of Istaios,
one of these said --

04:00:25.680 --> 04:00:27.930
and I cannot translate
this into English

04:00:27.930 --> 04:00:30.110
because the French is so beautiful.

04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:35.510
So you will ask for some of
your colleagues afterwards.

04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:40.040
[ Speaking French ]

04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:41.840
The veil of the temple.

04:00:41.840 --> 04:01:10.040
[ Speaking French ]

04:01:10.040 --> 04:01:11.340
So much for the temple.

04:01:11.340 --> 04:01:14.550
So much for the song
of the widow or Hiram.

04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:17.230
For the first time now illustrated

04:01:17.230 --> 04:01:21.380
with archaeological
documents from the homeland.

04:01:21.380 --> 04:01:24.450
And this is something we
should have done a generation

04:01:24.450 --> 04:01:26.090
or two generations ago.

04:01:26.090 --> 04:01:30.820
Because we were given a pair of
ears, we were given a pair of eyes.

04:01:30.820 --> 04:01:35.620
And in the best of cases
also, like my compatriots,

04:01:35.620 --> 04:01:38.810
[inaudible] called
the gray little cells.

04:01:38.810 --> 04:01:40.110
Let's use them.

04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:41.730
Thank you.

04:01:41.730 --> 04:01:44.050
[ Applause ]

04:01:44.050 --> 04:01:45.870
&gt;&gt; I have to say a
personal note about how all

04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:48.740
of these speakers are taking me
back to graduate school days.

04:01:48.740 --> 04:01:51.600
And people like Javier Texador

04:01:51.600 --> 04:01:54.860
and Morton Smith talking
about these same sites.

04:01:54.860 --> 04:01:58.050
Thank you for opening,
reopening my eyes on this.

04:01:58.050 --> 04:02:01.660
We are coming to the end
of this marvelous symposium

04:02:01.660 --> 04:02:05.180
with a very intriguing
speech if I may say so.

04:02:05.180 --> 04:02:10.760
A topic that is only coming into
the fore the last decade or two.

04:02:10.760 --> 04:02:14.170
And that would be by Mrs. Rodi
Kratsa who was born and brought

04:02:14.170 --> 04:02:17.020
up on the Island of
Zakynthos, Greece.

She handled a significant portfolio

04:02:38.450 --> 04:02:41.680
such as the conciliation
procedure with other institutions.

With important initiatives
in rich parliamentary work.

04:03:12.450 --> 04:03:15.920
In parallel, Mrs. Kratsa
has always been very active

04:03:15.920 --> 04:03:17.600
at international level.

04:03:17.600 --> 04:03:20.140
She has worked systematically
for the deepening

where there is discrimination
and violence as well

04:03:42.280 --> 04:03:44.830

04:04:16.180 --> 04:04:19.490
Mrs. Kratsa has been honored by
heads of state, religious leaders

04:04:19.490 --> 04:04:21.240
and international bodies.

04:04:21.240 --> 04:04:24.330
She is an honorary doctor
of two fine universities.

04:04:24.330 --> 04:04:26.210
She is also one of
the four laureates

04:04:26.210 --> 04:04:30.670
of the Elissa Dido Award for 2014.

04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:33.400
And this afternoon she
finishes the conference

04:04:33.400 --> 04:04:36.420
by addressing Elissa Dido.

04:04:36.420 --> 04:04:38.860
Mediterranean women.

04:04:38.860 --> 04:04:40.660
Mrs. Kratsa.

04:04:40.660 --> 04:04:43.420
[ Applause ]

04:04:43.420 --> 04:04:46.480
&gt;&gt; Rodi Kratsa: Thank you for
your kind and generous words.

04:04:46.480 --> 04:04:50.560
Ladies and gentlemen, let me
at first thank you once again

04:04:50.560 --> 04:04:55.210
for your continuous
presence and attention.

04:04:55.210 --> 04:04:59.900
Perhaps some people will
wonder why is this cultural

04:04:59.900 --> 04:05:03.480
and historical symposium ending

04:05:03.480 --> 04:05:07.070
on an issue regarding
women in the Mediterranean?

04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:10.720
I believe that the
organizers and the designers

04:05:10.720 --> 04:05:15.940
of the program had the correct
thought and choice with this issue,

04:05:15.940 --> 04:05:21.480
which has value both
historical and contemporary.

04:05:21.480 --> 04:05:27.450 position:56%
It would be a deficient presentation
of Tyre as a center for culture

04:05:27.450 --> 04:05:31.050
for the Phoenicians and
of the Mediterranean

04:05:31.050 --> 04:05:37.470
and if we do not mention the women
figures which played a vital role.

04:05:37.470 --> 04:05:43.430
Homer mentions that women of the
Phoenicians were fantastic warriors

04:05:43.430 --> 04:05:47.680
and supplied the merchants
throughout the Mediterranean

04:05:47.680 --> 04:05:52.220
with their fabric, which
were a symbol of the culture

04:05:52.220 --> 04:05:56.280
of the Phoenicians
particularly in purple color.

04:05:56.280 --> 04:06:01.640 position:56%
But Tyre also gave to the world
figures of women which played a role

04:06:01.640 --> 04:06:08.080
in genealogies and alliances
which determined the ancient world

04:06:08.080 --> 04:06:11.690
and which continue to this day.

04:06:11.690 --> 04:06:14.750
I mentioned at first Europe.

04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:21.920
A mythological but fatal figure
as mentioned by Professor Fantar.

04:06:21.920 --> 04:06:29.910
As he said, the god Zeus to
Europa to arrive in Crete

04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:33.700
where they had children
like king Minos,

04:06:33.700 --> 04:06:37.660
founder of the Minolian
civilization.

04:06:37.660 --> 04:06:42.130
And as he also said,
the myth continues.

04:06:42.130 --> 04:06:47.000
Cadmous, Europa's brother, came
to Greece searching for her.

04:06:47.000 --> 04:06:50.580
And just I would like to add

04:06:50.580 --> 04:06:56.600
that during his stay he
built a city, Thebes.

04:06:56.600 --> 04:07:03.770
Which existed till today, which
is about an hour from Athens.

04:07:03.770 --> 04:07:08.860
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Phoenician princess Europa came

04:07:08.860 --> 04:07:11.970
from the orient, gave
her name of course

04:07:11.970 --> 04:07:15.120 position:56%
to the continent which welcomed her.

04:07:15.120 --> 04:07:19.480
And I would like to say
that the myth of adoption

04:07:19.480 --> 04:07:26.170
of Europa symbolized the
globalized world of that period.

04:07:26.170 --> 04:07:31.960
And throughout time, the close
relations of the European countries

04:07:31.960 --> 04:07:37.780
and the European Union today
with the countries from the south

04:07:37.780 --> 04:07:40.210
and base of the Mediterranean.

04:07:40.210 --> 04:07:45.220
The institutional framework of
these relations is called today

04:07:45.220 --> 04:07:47.820
Euro-Mediterranean partnership

04:07:47.820 --> 04:07:51.690
and constitutes the union
for the Mediterranean.

04:07:51.690 --> 04:07:57.180
I come now to the main
subject, Princess Elissa

04:07:57.180 --> 04:08:03.000
of Venetia is associated
with the myth of the creation

04:08:03.000 --> 04:08:07.480
of Carthage in today's Tunisia.

04:08:07.480 --> 04:08:13.300
The myth is a mix of historical
evidence for the environment

04:08:13.300 --> 04:08:17.400
of Phoenicia, and with
literary evidence

04:08:17.400 --> 04:08:20.590
from the Hellenic and Roman world.

04:08:20.590 --> 04:08:26.420
In the epic work of Vergil, Elissa
is mentioned by the name Dido.

04:08:26.420 --> 04:08:35.340
The center person, Elissa, Dido
for the Romans, and Didon coming

04:08:35.340 --> 04:08:39.350
from the barbaric tradition
for the Tunisians.

04:08:39.350 --> 04:08:45.050
She incorporates the courage, the
initiative, the determination,

04:08:45.050 --> 04:08:48.210
the creativity and the fidelity.

04:08:48.210 --> 04:08:52.630
Displays from Venetia
due to domestic disputes

04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:56.880
which deprives the life
of her [inaudible],

04:08:56.880 --> 04:09:02.320
she managed to take those faithful
with her as well as young women

04:09:02.320 --> 04:09:06.110
from Cyprus towards Tunisia.

04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:11.510 position:56%
She builds Carthage in contradiction
with the domestic powers.

04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:17.310
She sacrificed herself to
[inaudible] who had lost life.

04:09:17.310 --> 04:09:22.630
Building on the symbolic reference
of this, a legendary area,

04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:29.700
Tyre Foundation launched in
corporation with Med 21 the program

04:09:29.700 --> 04:09:35.350
of the Institute for Prize
related to Mediterranean Legacy.

04:09:35.350 --> 04:09:42.500 position:56%
And Didon goes outward off Carthage,
who causes Tunisian women actions

04:09:42.500 --> 04:09:49.130
in the world with the name
Elissa Dido for the promotion

04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:53.140
of women condition
in the Mediterranean.

04:09:53.140 --> 04:09:58.430
It will be awarded every year
to two distinguished ladies.

04:09:58.430 --> 04:10:03.480
One for the north shore and
one for the south shore.

04:10:03.480 --> 04:10:08.630
Winners are selected based on a
significant contribution they made

04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:11.630
to promote principles and values

04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:17.050
and complete achievements
in all sector areas.

04:10:17.050 --> 04:10:22.470
Culture, economics, education,
politics and the promotion

04:10:22.470 --> 04:10:25.400 position:56%
of the status of women and equality.

04:10:25.400 --> 04:10:30.280
An important condition of the award
is the promotion of cooperation

04:10:30.280 --> 04:10:33.140
with the north and the
south of the Mediterranean.

04:10:33.140 --> 04:10:36.570
Linking people and actions.

04:10:36.570 --> 04:10:42.380
The award will be attributed
every year during the festivities

04:10:42.380 --> 04:10:47.170
of the League of Canaanite,
Phoenician and Punic Cities.

04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:56.310
[ Inaudible ]

04:10:56.310 --> 04:11:00.160
There has already been the
first award ceremony in Athens,

04:11:00.160 --> 04:11:03.010
the previous October at
the Acropolis Museum.

04:11:03.010 --> 04:11:07.770
I have the honor to be one of the
Laureates for this first edition,

04:11:07.770 --> 04:11:11.550
due to the long-term
advocation of the promotion

04:11:11.550 --> 04:11:15.720
of the Euro-Mediterranean
relations and the role of women.

04:11:15.720 --> 04:11:20.690
The other Laureates, which were
four in total, only for the case

04:11:20.690 --> 04:11:26.490
of the first edition are
Lady Cochrane Yvonne Shoushak

04:11:26.490 --> 04:11:27.790
from Lebanon.

04:11:27.790 --> 04:11:33.560
Awarded in recognition of her
commitment to the protection

04:11:33.560 --> 04:11:37.240
of the legacy of the
Lebanese cultural heritage

04:11:37.240 --> 04:11:42.300
across different sectors,
architecture, art, environment.

04:11:42.300 --> 04:11:46.710
The second one is Cherifa Kheddar
from Algeria in recognition

04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:51.700
of her commitment to promote human
rights, in particular the rights

04:11:51.700 --> 04:11:54.780
of the victims of violence.

04:11:54.780 --> 04:12:02.040
And Souhair Belhassen from
Tunisia in recognition of her fight

04:12:02.040 --> 04:12:07.390
for the rights of men and
women in international level.

04:12:07.390 --> 04:12:14.360
The importance of this award is
great because it serves many goals.

04:12:14.360 --> 04:12:18.370
It reminds us of the
role of women in history,

04:12:18.370 --> 04:12:21.830
something that historians
often forget.

04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:26.500
It gives visibility and
leadership to the work of women

04:12:26.500 --> 04:12:30.570
in the modern society,
something which the mass media,

04:12:30.570 --> 04:12:36.070
the political parties and the
academic community also forgets.

04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:42.350
It brings to the surface women
as role models and as examples

04:12:42.350 --> 04:12:48.550
to follow towards the encouragement
for action and participation.

04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:53.450
Not only for other women,
but for the society.

04:12:53.450 --> 04:12:56.120
The Elissa Didon Prize

04:12:56.120 --> 04:13:03.970 position:56%
as a directive method emphasizes the
human diversity, the equal rights

04:13:03.970 --> 04:13:08.880
and opportunities between men and
women are occurring everywhere

04:13:08.880 --> 04:13:12.690
and especially around
the Mediterranean.

04:13:12.690 --> 04:13:15.490 position:56%
The Mediterranean with its countries

04:13:15.490 --> 04:13:19.590
and its people is not
a uniform zone.

04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:25.150
At some places women suffer from
unemployment and the degradation

04:13:25.150 --> 04:13:29.300
of their standard of living
such as in the north shore

04:13:29.300 --> 04:13:33.530 position:56%
as the result of an economic crisis.

04:13:33.530 --> 04:13:35.290
Along the south shore,

04:13:35.290 --> 04:13:40.440
besides economic problems women
are continuing to suffer violence

04:13:40.440 --> 04:13:43.710 position:56%
and oppression from fundamentalists.

04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:46.350
It is important that we promote

04:13:46.350 --> 04:13:50.340
on the international level
these problems and issues.

04:13:50.340 --> 04:13:56.940
But also that we all know the
exceptional women giving a voice

04:13:56.940 --> 04:14:00.410 position:56%
and support to the vulnerable women.

04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:05.070
And who succeed in spite
of the difficulties

04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:08.780
and make important work
advancing the society.

04:14:08.780 --> 04:14:15.010
And the encouragement of
peace, cooperation and justice.

04:14:15.010 --> 04:14:19.620
The Tyre Foundation also has
a goal to give the opportunity

04:14:19.620 --> 04:14:24.880
to the laureates of the prize to
meet each other and create networks

04:14:24.880 --> 04:14:27.520
of cooperation and solidarity.

04:14:27.520 --> 04:14:32.320
For the success of this goal,
your support is valuable.

04:14:32.320 --> 04:14:37.860 position:56%
Initially, your participation in the
giving of the award Elissa Didon,

04:14:37.860 --> 04:14:43.800
and other activities,
is so that you can honor

04:14:43.800 --> 04:14:47.810
and meet these women
and know their work.

04:14:47.810 --> 04:14:51.900
You can also support the effort of
the Tyre foundation in this field

04:14:51.900 --> 04:14:56.140
through donations, through the
programs of research centers,

04:14:56.140 --> 04:15:00.330
foundations and international
organizations.

04:15:00.330 --> 04:15:03.480
The Congress which
is hosting us today,

04:15:03.480 --> 04:15:07.940
as well as the American Civil
Society supports with passion

04:15:07.940 --> 04:15:12.360
and generosity the
respect of human rights

04:15:12.360 --> 04:15:15.680
and especially women's rights.

04:15:15.680 --> 04:15:22.220
We have ascertained these past
few years how important education,

04:15:22.220 --> 04:15:27.980
justice, equal opportunities
and the advancement of women are

04:15:27.980 --> 04:15:34.860
in all countries everywhere,
even those that are far.

04:15:34.860 --> 04:15:40.110
So we can have peace
and prosperity globally

04:15:40.110 --> 04:15:44.190
and in our societies,
in each society.

04:15:44.190 --> 04:15:50.240 position:56%
In conclusion, ladies and
gentlemen, I would like to thank you

04:15:50.240 --> 04:15:55.070

will have many opportunities

04:15:55.070 --> 04:16:02.340
for collaboration in supporting the
Tyre Foundation issues and goals

04:16:02.340 --> 04:16:04.110
for the promotion of women.

04:16:04.110 --> 04:16:06.510

04:16:51.820 --> 04:16:58.850 position:56%
I hope that we will continue working
on ancient cities that have shared

04:16:58.850 --> 04:17:08.360
with us and the basis of our
civilization as we know it today.

04:17:08.360 --> 04:17:12.070
Just a word of thanks.

04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:13.730
