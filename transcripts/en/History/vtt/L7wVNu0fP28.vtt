00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.620
[music playing]

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.960
RICHARD DOLAN: August 19, 1952,
the Scout leader, this man

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.540
named Sonny DesVergers.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.790
He sees unusual activity
in this forested area.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.960
He stops the cars and says
to the boys, wait here.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.710
So he had three Scouts with
them, from ages 10 to 12--

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.170
Bobby Ruffing, David
Rowan, and Chuck Stevens.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.880
He gets a machete
and a flashlight,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880
and he goes into these woods.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.420
He says at a certain point
he's under a dark circle

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.830
with a light on it, and
he hears a hatch opening.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.330
And then a red flash
of light comes out

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
and there's this red mist, he
said, that kind of envelops

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.580
him.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.710
And then he blacked
out at that point.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.880
The boys can't see
what's happening to him.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.670
They run out and
try to get help,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.080
eventually getting
law enforcement

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.750
to come and take a look.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.210
But DesVergers, apparently,
was out for quite some time,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080
and then comes to and he's
got these burns on his body

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.750
and has this story.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.920
And that's when
people wondered, well,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
do we believe this guy or not?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.380
DR. JACQUES VALLEE: A
member of the Air Force

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.250
was very skeptical of landings.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.120
If it didn't fly and it
was seen on the ground,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.790
they suspected a
psychological case or a hoax.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.250
RICHARD DOLAN:
Captain Edward Ruppelt

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.790
went down physically to
investigate this case,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.790
spoke to DesVergers, wasn't
impressed by DesVergers at all,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.580
but admitted that he was baffled
by the nature of this evidence.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.120
He didn't know
what to make of it.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.460
DR. JACQUES VALLEE: They did
do the tests of the traces

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.250
around the place where
the object had been,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.920
and they found that
the top of the plants

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.250
was not affected, that
the routes had been

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.210
exposed to high temperature.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.500
And that was an
indication that there

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.420
was some physical effect
that was not understood

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.120
that took place there.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.170
RICHARD DOLAN: In fact, they
took the grass samples to a lab

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.920
to try to recreate the
effect that was done to them,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.250
and it required something
like 300 degrees

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.500
to have been applied,
and that seems

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
completely beyond the
capability of Sonny DesVergers

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.170
to have done that.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.250
DR. JACQUES VALLEE: The Air
Force concluded that it was

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.000
a hoax or it was psychological.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.620
In retrospect, I think Ruppelt
was impressed with the fact

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.830
that there were physical effects
that had not been explained.
