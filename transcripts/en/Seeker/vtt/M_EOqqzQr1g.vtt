00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.970
Always wash your hands. Always. Be in a constant
state of washing your hands. I'm washing my

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.379
hands right now.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.190
Hi everybody, Trace here for DNews. Simple
question: Do you wash your hands after using

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.360
a public bathroom? If you’re like the American
adults surveyed in 2010, 96 percent of you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.100
said yes. Which means 6 percent of you are
liars. That’s according to a 2013 Michigan

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.230
State study published in the Journal of Environmental
Health. Go green!

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.390
To be fair, you can’t expect people to self-report
accurately, especially if it’s on something

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.160
like handwashing, where we all feel the pressure
to be hygienic. And a 90 percent wash rate

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
is still pretty darn spiffy. But the bigger
question is: how many people wash their hands

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.679
correctly?

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.329
That’s the real answer that the Michigan
State study was searching for. To find it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.769
they had a dozen research assistants post
up in bathrooms across Lansing and take notes.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.289
As long as they didn't go to the Landshark,
amirite guys? The assistants were trained

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.600
in the art of stealth so as not to draw suspicion.
They watched over 3,700 bathroom goers and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.289
organized their results by gender, age, time
of day, bathroom cleanliness, hand dryer availability,

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
time spent washing, sink type, pretty much
every variable you can think of.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.000
According to their findings: 10 percent of
people didn’t wash, 23 percent of people

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.400
just wetted their hands and called it a day,
and 67 percent of people used soap. But here's

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.190
the thing: just using soap isn’t enough.
The goal here is to kill bacteria, and to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.960
do that you’ve got to give your hands a
good long scrub. The researchers found only

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.160
5 percent of people washed their hands with
soap for 15 seconds or longer. If 15 seconds

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.290
sounds like overkill, the Centers for Disease
Control actually recommend scrubbing for twenty

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.420
seconds. Their guidelines for safe washing
encourage you to hum happy birthday from beginning

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.040
to end twice, as though the tune wasn’t
agonizing enough once a year. But to reiterate,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.230
only 5 percent of people wash their hands
correctly using this one weird trick.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.590
That trick, is using soap. Why soap? Because
of it's unique properties. A soap molecule

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.050
looks like a snake. The head is a carboxylate
that loves water and the tail is a hydrocarbon

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.740
chain that hates it! When these molecules
are mixed with H2O, they form little structures

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.520
called micelles, with the heads on the exterior
and the tails inside, kind of like circling

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.019
the wagons. Like most things in nature, they
are polar, they carry an electrical charge.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.709
Since they're all negatively charged, the
micelles repel each other distributing throughout

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.180
the water. When these micelles come in contact
with grease and oil, the hydrocarbon part

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.579
(on the inside) grabs the oil, trapping it,
lifting it off your skin and suspending it

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.609
in the water so it can be washed away. This
behavior allows you to scrub the microbes

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.629
under the dirt into oblivion, and is also
why alcoholic hand sanitizers aren’t as

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.180
effective at killing germs on dirty and greasy
hands.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.389
You may be tempted then to splurge for antibacterial
soap -- but though it sounds good, it’s

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:47.170
actually the worst. The key ingredient, triclosan,
does kill 99 percent of bacteria, but 42 years

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.849
of FDA research has shown it’s not much
more effective at killing harmful bacteria

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.810
than regular soap and friction. And a side-effect
of the unnecessary overuse of antibacterial

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.450
triclosan is bacteria have adapted to be resistant
to it. Thus, there's no way to kill those

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.439
superbugs effectively when we need to. Like
when people get sick from diseases that could

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.279
have been prevented from washing their hands
in the first place. 31 percent of diarrhea

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:15.159
cases and 21 percent of respiratory illnesses
like colds can be avoided just with some scrubbing.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.319
See, washing your hands is a win against harmful
bacteria on every level, and it feels good.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.709
Just remember, stick to regular soap, give
your hands a nice long scrub, and don’t

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.180
forget to get under the fingernails where
most microbes live.
