﻿Hi. My name is Andy Brown.

00:00:02.574 --> 00:00:06.856
This hex semester I’m going to be teaching an Introductory Physics Course called Landmarks In Physics.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:10.259
This class is going to use some of the major discoveries in physics

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.261
as a way to teach you the important concepts of physics.

00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.044
I’m going to be traveling throughout Europe

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:19.037
to some of the places where these important discoveries were made.

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:21.577
On each location, we’re going to interview experts,

00:00:21.577 --> 00:00:25.868
talk to some physicists and figure out how this problem had been solved

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:29.468
and over the course of the unit we’re going to solve it ourselves.

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:33.792
Now, don’t worry if you don’t have any experience in physics

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:38.105
as long as you have a basic idea of algebra, you’re going to succeed.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.464
By the end of this course, you’re going to know the basics of data analysis,

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.131
uncertainty in measurement and how to design an experiment,

00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.089
and of course, some of the important concepts in physics;

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.163
for example, the conservation of energy.

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.199
See you in class.
