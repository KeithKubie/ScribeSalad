Hey, Joanna, did you notice this?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.990
Well, talk back is pretty repetitive for
this list.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.900
Can you call Dan?

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.180
&gt;&gt; Hey folks.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.230
What's up?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.000
&gt;&gt; Just wondering if you
looked at talk back support?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.610
&gt;&gt; I think we did something.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.700
I remember something about
content descriptions.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.020
&gt;&gt; Well, the content
descriptions are pretty awkward.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.910
Not very helpful.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150
This is basic accessibility stuff and.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.700
&gt;&gt; This is why we're here, right guys?

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.120
To help make sure Sunshine is
a great app for all of its users.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally agreed and
not at all intentional.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.479
This is something that
should never be an Apple

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.070
product-
&gt;&gt; Hey,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.990
I'd be happy to take care of making
Sunshine accessible, but, Dan,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.369
does that mean you forgot to
do localization work as well?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.900
Got it.
Okay, I'll take care of that as well.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.850
Sound good?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.460
I'm going to go out and
test sunshine outside,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.030
and try out these new improvements.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.570
They do seem like they
will be really helpful.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.190
Nice work, Dan.
