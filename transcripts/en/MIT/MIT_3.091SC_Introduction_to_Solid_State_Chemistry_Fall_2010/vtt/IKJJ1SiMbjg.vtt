JOCELYN: Hi.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.960
Jocelyn here and we're going
to go over fall 2009 exam

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.060
three problem number three.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.280
As always, let's read the
question first. Calcium

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.110
ammonium phosphate dissolves
in water according to the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.070
dissolution equation, for
which the value of the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.630
solubility product, ksp, has
been determined to be 4.4

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.050
times 10 to the -14.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.880
Calculate the solubility of
the compound in water.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.730
Express your answers in units
of molartiy, ie moles of the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.910
compound per liter
of solution.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.080
So the first thing we want to
do is write down what the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.610
question's asking.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.150
Part A--

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:17.760
how much calcium ammonium
phosphate

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.790
can dissolve in water?

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.930
And we're going to
call this cs--

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.020
or the saturation
concentration.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.330
Next we need to figure out how
to find this out, right?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.720
So it gives us that the ksp--

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.630
4.4 times 10 to the -14.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.580
So we need to know something
about the ksp and although

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.410
it's called the solubility
product, it's the same as

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.270
other equilibrium constants.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.590
So equilibrium constants tells
us about the concentrations at

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.210
equilibrium and therefore
the maximum solubility.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:28.080
Looking at the equation, we
have calcium ammonium

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.760
phosphate dissolving--

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.680
which is a solid--

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:45.490
dissolving into calcium
ions, ammonium ions

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.190
and phosphate ions.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.290
As with every equilibrium
constant, we can write down an

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.725
equation relating to the
concentration of the species.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:11.983
So our ksp is the product
of the concentration.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.240
And a common mistake made
on this problem

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.250
was that people included--

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.870
students included the calcium
ammonium phosphate solid on

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.400
the bottom as you
normally would--

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.170
where you would normally
put the reactant.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.030
However, remember that for
equilibrium constants, we

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.130
don't put solids in
there because the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.440
activities don't change--

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.900
or the concentration
doesn't change.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.680
It doesn't really make
sense to add it in.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.810
So here we just look at the
solvated ions and we see that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.510
we have a 1:1:1 molar
ratio here.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.590
That's going to make our life
a little bit easier.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.170
So now we need to figure out
what the solubility of the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.380
compound is and to do that,
we want to look at

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.010
this chemical equation.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.380
We see that for one mole--

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:22.590
so one mole of calcium ammonium
phosphate dissolved

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:38.790
gives you one mole of the
calcium ion, the sodium ion

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.490
and the phosphate ion.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.900
Thus, we can say the amount of
calcium ammonium phosphate

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.910
dissolved, which we called Cs,
is going to be equivalent to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.330
each of these concentrations.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.900
Because we're asked for how
much of the compound is

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.410
dissolved, but we're given the
ksp, which is in terms of the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.600
concentrations of these
solvated ions.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.270
This doesn't equal
the product.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.520
These are all equal.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.010
Now we can plug the
Cs into our ksp

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.380
equation that we had before.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.880
So instead of the
concentration of

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.650
calcium ions, we have--

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.550
it's equal to the
concentration of

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.840
the compound dissolved.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.470
The same goes for the ammonium
and the phosphate, because

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.050
again, we have 1:1:1:1
stoichiometric coefficients.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.790
And we can be a little
more concise.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.030
Now it's just a matter of
solving for the saturated

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.560
concentration.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:18.650
So doing some algebra here.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.970
Then we plug in the numbers.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:36.330
And we get that the solubility
of calcium ammonium phosphate

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.210
is 3.53 times 10 to
the -5 moles--

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.290
molar, sorry.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.440
So that means 3.53 times -5
moles per liter of water.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.450
That's not very much.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.030
So we can say generally or
relatively this calcium

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.120
ammonium phosphate is not
that soluble in water.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.490
So let's move on to part B.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.890
Part B says, calculate the
solubility of calcium ammonium

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.060
phosphate in 2.2 molar
calcium bromide.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.890
Express your answer
in units molarity.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.310
Assume that in water, calcium
bromide completely

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.440
disassociates into
calcium 2 plus

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.740
cations and bromide anions.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.790
This is basically asking
us for the same value.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.280
It's asking us for the
solubility of calcium ammonium

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.240
phosphate, but under slightly
different conditions.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.920
So we want to write those
conditions down.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.050
Now we have to ask ourselves
why would the fact that we

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.920
have a concentration of calcium
bromide affect the

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.440
solubility of calcium
ammonium phosphate?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.640
And the thing to remember
here is the

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.330
common ion effect, right?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.590
2 molar calcium bromide will--

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:21.130
when dissolved in water, the
concentration of calcium from

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.870
just the calcium bromide will
be 2.2 molar, right?

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.610
Because we're told that it
completely disassociates.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.140
So if we look at the
disassociation reaction, we

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.190
see that for every mole of
calcium bromide, we get one

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.480
mole of calcium and two
moles of bromide.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.330
So having calcium bromide will
alter our answer from the

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.300
previous problem because the ksp
will always be the same.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.200
It's an equilibrium
constant, right?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.960
So even though it has to do
with calcium ammonium

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.570
phosphate, we have to take into
account that we already

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.340
have calcium in the system.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.590
So before we start plugging in
any numbers, we should think

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.190
about this problem.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.780
Do we think that already having
calcium in the system

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.350
will increase or decrease the
solubility of the calcium

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.600
ammonium phosphate?

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.560
Hopefully we can agree that it
would probably decrease the

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.690
solubility because you already
have those calcium ions.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.800
So putting more calcium ions
into the water is going to be

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.820
harder and therefore less
calcium ammonium phosphate

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.180
will dissolve.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.420
Now that we know what kind of
number we're looking for, we

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.080
can start doing the actual
calculation.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.520
So again, we'll start with our
equation for the ksp, which

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.010
for calcium ammonium phosphate
has not changed.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.240
I'm just going to rewrite
it on this board here.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.650
But now instead of having
each of these be equal

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.920
concentrations, we
already have some

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.000
calcium in the system.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.450
So we need to take that
into account.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.900
And I'm going to call the
saturation concentration Cs

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.280
star because we're under
different conditions, right?

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:55.400
The calcium bromide does not
contribute any ammonium or

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.420
phosphate ions so those
concentrations will just be

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.470
determined by how much
of the calcium

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.710
ammonium phosphate dissolves.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:12.600
From before, we can use what we
found in part A to simplify

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.630
this a little bit.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.600
So in part A, we know that
without anything else, without

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.620
a common ion effect, that we
have decided will decrease the

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.940
solubility.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:31.240
We have 3.35 times 10 to the
-5th molar solubility.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:41.650
Therefore, we can say with
good certainty that our

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.710
saturation concentration with
the common ion effect will be

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:52.090
much, much less than 2.2 molar
because 2.2 molar is much

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.610
greater than our pure
solubility.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.070
Going back to our equation
over here, that

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:09.308
means we can have--

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.360
and now we have a fairly simple
algebraic problem.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:29.300
Dividing by 2.2 and then taking
the square root, we get

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.460
that the saturation
concentration under these

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.030
conditions--

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.320
2.2 molar calcium bromide--

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:45.360
will be 1.41 times 10
to the -7 molar.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.750
And going back to our answer
from part A, we see that this

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.600
is indeed a lower solubility.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:59.720
There's less calcium ammonium
phosphate that can be

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.170
dissolved and that makes sense
from our previous thought

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.360
about this problem.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.888
And so now that you've
found the answer, box

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:12.530
it and we're done.
