00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Six

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
types of

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.155
unhealthy father sons relationships

00:00:03.155 --> 00:00:04.735
In romantic comedy

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:08.155
drama film garden state main character Andrew

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:11.565
returns to his hometown to attend his mother's funeral

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.695
Andrew's father, a psychiatrist

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.185
blamed Andrew for his mother's death

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:16.940
and put him on medications to try and control his emotions

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.965
and put him on medications to try and control his emotions

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:21.815
Believing it was Andrew's anger

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:24.525
that triggered his mother's accident

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.555
People often say sons grow up to be as great as their fathers

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:30.555
But what happen to those of us who

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.355
grew up without a dad or had a tough

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:36.015
upbringing from them? We want to inform the public

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:39.025
just how important it is to understand

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.165
how toxic family dynamics can affect

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:43.965
the individuals state of being

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.045
Here's six types of unhealthy father son relationships

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.825
One. The absent father.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.795
A special shout out goes to coffee drop who mentioned

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.275
the absent father in our recent video

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:58.415
six types of unhealthy father daughter relationships

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.495
If you haven't already, please check it out after this

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.515
The absent father was never around

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:05.015
when you needed him

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:06.615
CEO and co-founder

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:08.535
of psych2go Tai Khuong

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.285
can strongly relate to this

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:13.725
His father left Tai and his family when he was little

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:15.685
Tai's father is a businessman

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:18.115
who is constantly sucked into his work

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.705
There's nothing wrong with being passionate about your career

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.385
But his father has an unhealthy obsession with making money

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.705
As a result

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:28.595
he lost sight on finding a purpose from his work

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:31.635
causing him to spiral down in dark empty holes

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:34.675
Tai was never emotionally and physically nurtured by his father

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.815
Tai was never emotionally and physically nurtured by his father

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:42.975
This abandoned man can be detrimental to the son's emotion and physical development over time. Tai learnt what not

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:45.975
to become from his absent father and his passionate

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:49.035
about growing psych2go into a bigger platform

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:49.535
hoping to raise mental health awareness and help others who have been through similar struggles as him

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:51.375
hoping to raise mental health awareness and help others who have been through similar struggles as him

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.545
hoping to raise mental health awareness and help others who have been through similar struggles as him

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:57.395
Two. The addict father.

00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.415
The addict father is someone who struggles with some sort of addiction

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:00.775
whether its

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:03.795
alcoholism, gambling, drug abuse or pornography

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.045
unfortunately, Tai also relates to this one. Due to his father's unhappiness

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:06.545
unfortunately, Tai also relates to this one. Due to his father's unhappiness

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.965
unfortunately, Tai also relates to this one. Due to his father's unhappiness

00:02:08.965 --> 00:02:11.265
Due to his father's unhappiness and competitive nature of being money hungry

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.855
he struggles with alcoholism

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.805
If you haven't already, please check out our video later

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:19.935
Seven ways alcoholic parents affect their children

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.375
Sons with an addict father

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.115
have a fear of being vulnerable

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:28.295
because of their emotional instability their fathers instilled within their lives

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.285
They are often scared to open up to others

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:34.105
afraid of being let down, hurt and rejected

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:37.045
This can strongly affect their ability to form

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:40.045
close intimate friendships and

00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:42.555
relationships with romantic partners

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:45.675
Three. The harsh father

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:48.315
This type of father is overly strict and tough on his son

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:50.805
with frequent angry outbursts

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:52.385
The family often does not feel safe

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.605
making mistakes and showing their

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:57.335
flaws around them

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.215
The harsh father could be

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:02.165
and expects everyone in the household to follow his rules

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.015
and regulations. Sons who

00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:07.325
grow up with this type of father usually feel like

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:10.075
their upbringing was more constricting

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:11.155
than life giving

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.115
Often the father guilt trips the son

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:16.225
blaming him for not being good enough

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:19.035
rather than teaching him on how to get better in something

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:19.535
This type of father

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:21.485
is usually moody

00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:24.585
unpredictable and feared by his son

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.635
Four. The performing father

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.405
The performing father is someone who often

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:33.305
immerses himself in work or hobbies

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:33.820
He doesn't

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.675
enjoys sitting down with his kids

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.615
and spending quality time with them. Instead

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:41.155
he always feels like he has to keep busy

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:44.075
and has a hard time relaxing. The performing father

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:44.575
is obsessed

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.795
with performing well and always

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:49.395
pushes himself to get better. Goal-oriented

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.495
he focused on result, success and achievements

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:55.755
In the workplace, he usually has a great reputation

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:58.615
and many of his co-workers find him

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:01.735
responsible, reliable and level-headed

00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:03.615
At home, however, sons of

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:06.375
the performing father feel neglected

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.365
and rarely ever get their own needs met. As a result

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.935
they missed out learning important life skills

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:14.855
and they struggled with low self-esteem issues

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.365
Feeling like they can't meet the high standards of their

00:04:17.365 --> 00:04:18.615
own father.

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.395
Five. The passive father

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:21.895
Similar to

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:22.395
the

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.985
performing father

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.255
the passive father also has a great work ethic in the workplace

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:30.175
But instead of being busy at home too. The passive

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:32.955
father leads a very uneventful

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:35.505
life after he clocks out from work

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.135
Emotionally unavailable, he leaves

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:38.635
all the work

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:40.335
and chores up to the mum

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:43.355
including picking up the kids from school

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:45.695
all and spending quality time with them

00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:48.725
This father although he is still physically present in the family

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.125
His often emotionally distant

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:54.045
and doesn't interact much with his son. I grow up

00:04:54.045 --> 00:04:57.065
with a passive father and even to this day

00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:59.735
it's hard for me to bond with him

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.075
Six. The abusive father

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:05.115
The abusive father forms intense emotional and physical wounds household

00:05:05.115 --> 00:05:07.635
He often mistreats his son

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:10.595
through physical, verbal, emotional

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.965
and or sexual abuse

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:15.765
This can take a massive toll on the sons's emotional and

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.715
physical development and can deeply hurt the self esteem

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:21.095
Often, sons of abusive father

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.145
can grow up either being abusive themselves

00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:25.305
or victims

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:27.725
of abusive romantic relationships

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:29.905
Which type of unhealthy father son

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.675
relationship do you resonate with

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:35.335
We know how hard it is to talk about toxic

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.605
family dynamics and want to be

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:39.855
a safe non-judgmental place for you

00:05:39.855 --> 00:05:42.215
Please share your story with us down below

00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:45.275
We also want to remind you that you are worth

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.695
so much more than the mistreatment

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.515
you have experienced in your childhood. Toxic patterns

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:52.995
are hard to break out of. But with an heart

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.305
of awareness and courage

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:56.605
they can be conquered

00:05:56.605 --> 00:05:57.105
