[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:06.150
SHIVA SHIVAKUMAR:
Fundamentally, more people

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.691
are moving to cities
and whether this

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.699
is Sau Paolo, or Beijing,
or Mumbai, or Singapore.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.490
And it's actually
putting a lot of pressure

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.310
on the underlying
systems in cities,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.690
so the roads, the public
transit-- buses and trains--

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.545
and more importantly,
the commuters who

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:22.110
are commuting every single day.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.860
So we're looking at
how to use technology.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.680
So a combination
of spatial insights

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.125
can also behavioral incentive
to change this ongoing problem--

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.000
this growing problem.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.510
BALAJI PRABHAKAR: I think
the first moment was just

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.850
noticing that cities deal with
congestion by regulating road

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.970
or transport network
use, and they do this

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.290
by sort of increasing charges.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.170
This is the economic
way of driving up

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.070
demand when there's
an excess of it.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.190
And then you soon realize
that this solution is not

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.820
easy to sell.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.580
Commuters don't like to be
paying for something that they

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.460
didn't have to do before.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660
And then the "aha moment" was
could we incentivize commuters?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.800
Could they be given monetary
incentives or social incentives

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.070
for nudging their behaviors?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.519
And so, that's for
example, an "aha moment."

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.060
SHIVA SHIVAKUMAR:
Fundamentally, when

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.279
you're looking at
analog data, there's

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:19.820
a whole bunch of
new things that need

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.990
to be solved in that context.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.780
So on the data processing
side, in terms of scale,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.570
in terms of the new algorithms
that actually can help

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.830
us understand that
data a lot better.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.680
And also the
visualization systems

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.600
that actually can help us
get much more deeper insights

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.004
into both the spatial side,
as well as the data side.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.420
So essentially
what we're doing is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.690
we're building our new systems
that are much higher scale

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.440
and dealing with this
new class of data,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.179
and also visualizing
that to give

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.470
fundamental insights to people.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.011
So what we are
looking for are people

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.140
who have a shared passion of
making urban living better,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.020
and also building out
these new systems that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350
have not been done before.
