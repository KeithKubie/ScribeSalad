00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.320
We’re rolling, Julian.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.320
What?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.550
We’re rolling!

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.550
What?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.470
Are you deaf?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.820
… What?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.210
What’s up my knowledgeable audiophiles,
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.250
I don’t know if you’ve heard but scientists
have recently made a breakthrough restoring

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.230
the hearing of mice who had been deafened
by loud noises.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.940
Researchers from the University of Michigan
and Harvard Medical School manipulated the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.480
genes of mice so their inner ears made more
of the protein Neurotrophin-3, or NT3.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.079
Then they partially deafened them with loud
noise, presumably by blasting nickelback.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.770
After 2 weeks, mice with increased levels
of NT-3 showed much improved hearing compared

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.810
to the control group.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.489
So how does it work?

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.950
Well the nerve cells connected to the hair
follicles in your cochlea have a special structure

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.140
at the synapse, called a ribbon, so named
because it looks nothing like a ribbon.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.039
Ribbon synapses allow for super fast, precise,
and sustained neurotransmission, which makes

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.159
them ideal for transmitting sight and sound.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.770
In your ear, these synapses get damaged with
noise or age.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.250
That’s where the NT-3 comes in.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.539
NT-3 helps keep older neurons alive and promotes
the regeneration of new neurons and synapses.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.189
Dr. Gabriel Corfas, who led the study, is
optimistic increasing NT-3 can restore hearing

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.979
in partially deafened humans too.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.529
He even believes it can be done with a drug
instead of the gene therapy they used for

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:33.529
the mice.

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.099
That’s big news, considering that 50 million
americans have hearing loss in at least 1

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.950
ear and 47% of adults over 75 have difficulty
hearing.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.249
When you consider that ear buds are ubiquitous
and can basically project a rock concert directly

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.579
into your ear, that percentage is going to
be much higher by the time my generation is

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.639
septuagenarians.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:57.709
So thanks to Dr. Corfas, I’m going to go
ahead and keep rocking out on the subway guilt-free,

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.429
even if it’s clearly weirding everybody
out.

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.459
For more proof that loud music damages your
hearing, Tara sounds off about it here.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.950
So, is the risk of hearing loss worth having
your tunes at all times?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.679
Do you ever really think about it?

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.979
Let me hear about it in the comments.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.319
Trust me, I hear everything.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.709
See you next time on DNews.
