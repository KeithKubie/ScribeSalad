00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.336
When I heard those bars

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.600
slam hard,

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.840
I knew it was for real.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.480
I feel confused.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.760
I feel betrayed.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.680
I feel overwhelmed.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.480
I feel silenced.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.080
What just happened?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680
How could they send me here?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
I don't belong here.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.256
How could they make such a huge mistake

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.680
without any repercussions
whatsoever to their actions?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.496
I see large groups of women

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.856
in tattered uniforms

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.416
surrounded by huge walls and gates,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.736
enclosed by iron barbed wires,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.080
and I get hit by an awful stench,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.400
and I ask myself,

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.320
how did I move

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.160
from working in the respected
financial banking sector,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
having worked so hard in school,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.576
to now being locked up

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.816
in the largest correctional facility

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.920
for women in Kenya?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.656
My first night

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.816
at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.040
was the toughest.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.456
In January of 2009,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.136
I was informed that I had handled
a fraudulent transaction unknowingly

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.960
at the bank where I worked.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.296
I was shocked, scared and terrified.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.280
I would lose a career
that I loved passionately.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.376
But that was not the worst.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.520
It got even worse
than I could have ever imagined.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.520
I got arrested,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.576
maliciously charged

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.840
and prosecuted.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.016
The absurdity of it all
was the arresting officer

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.176
asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.480
and the case would disappear.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.040
I refused.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.296
Two and a half years on,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.056
in and out of courts,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.536
fighting to prove my innocence.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.536
It was all over the media,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.696
in the newspapers, TV, radio.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.280
They came to me again.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.576
This time around, said to me,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.080
"If you give us 50,000 US dollars,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.280
the judgement will be in your favor,"

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.560
irrespective of the fact
that there was no evidence whatsoever

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.696
that I had any wrongdoing

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.000
on the charges that I was up against.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.736
I remember the events

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.616
of my conviction

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.216
six years ago

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.920
as if it were yesterday.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.896
The cold, hard face of the judge

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.696
as she pronounced my sentence

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.880
on a cold Thursday morning

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.040
for a crime that I hadn't committed.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.136
I remember holding

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.080
my three-month-old beautiful daughter

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.400
whom I had just named Oma,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.736
which in my dialect
means "truth and justice,"

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.616
as that was what I had longed so much for

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.840
all this time.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.576
I dressed her in her
favorite purple dress,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.040
and here she was, about to accompany me

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.576
to serve this one-year sentence

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.960
behind bars.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.016
The guards did not seem
sensitive to the trauma

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.000
that this experience was causing me.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.400
My dignity and humanity disappeared

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.280
with the admission process.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.000
It involved me being
searched for contrabands,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.976
changed from my ordinary clothes

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.896
to the prison uniform,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.600
forced to squat on the ground,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.280
a posture that I soon came to learn

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.936
would form the routine

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.440
of the thousands of searches,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.696
number counts,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.200
that lay ahead of me.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.480
The women told me,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.320
"You'll adjust to this place.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.880
You'll fit right in."

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.336
I was no longer referred to
as Teresa Njoroge.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.096
The number 415/11 was my new identity,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.936
and I soon learned that was
the case with the other women

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.280
who we were sharing this space with.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.720
And adjust I did to life on the inside:

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.160
the prison food,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.960
the prison language,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.896
the prison life.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.680
Prison is certainly no fairytale world.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.336
What I didn't see come my way

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.280
was the women and children

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.920
whom we served time and shared space with,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.456
women who had been imprisoned

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.536
for crimes of the system,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.320
the corruption that requires a fall guy,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.136
a scapegoat,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.016
so that the person who is responsible

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.240
could go free,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.256
a broken system that routinely
vilifies the vulnerable,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.576
the poorest amongst us,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.696
people who cannot afford to pay bail

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.920
or bribes.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.880
And so we moved on.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.696
As I listened to story after story

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.936
of these close to 700 women

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.920
during that one year in prison,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.256
I soon realized that crime

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.440
was not what had brought
these women to prison,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.680
most of them,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.080
far from it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.240
It had started with the education system,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.160
whose supply and quality
is not equal for all;

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.240
lack of economic opportunities

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.096
that pushes these women
to petty survival crimes;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.256
the health system,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.496
social justice system,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.936
the criminal justice system.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.376
If any of these women,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.256
who were mostly from poor backgrounds,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.976
fall through the cracks

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.056
in the already broken system,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.856
the bottom of that chasm is a prison,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.080
period.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.736
By the time I completed
my one-year sentence

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.120
at Langata Women Maximum Prison,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.560
I had a burning conviction

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.856
to be part of the transformation

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.416
to resolve the injustices

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.136
that I had witnessed

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.896
of women and girls

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.696
who were caught up in a revolving door

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.256
of a life in and out of prison

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.520
due to poverty.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.496
After my release,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.360
I set up Clean Start.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.816
Clean Start is a social enterprise

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.816
that seeks to give these women and girls

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.280
a second chance.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.896
What we do is we build bridges for them.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.696
We go into the prisons, train them,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.775
give them skills, tools and support

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.216
to enable them to be able
to change their mindsets,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.559
their behaviors and their attitudes.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.816
We also build bridges into the prisons

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.816
from the corporate sector --

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.976
individuals, organizations

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.976
that will partner with Clean Start

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.416
to enable us to provide employment,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.496
places to call home,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.656
jobs, vocational training,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.976
for these women, girls,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.456
boys and men,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.040
upon transition back into society.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.560
I never thought

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.176
that one day

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.096
I would be giving stories

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.656
of the injustices that are so common

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.960
within the criminal justice system,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.800
but here I am.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.600
Every time I go back to prison,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.440
I feel a little at home,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.096
but it is the daunting work

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.056
to achieve the vision

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.360
that keeps me awake at night,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.096
connecting the miles to Louisiana,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.520
which is deemed as the incarceration
capital of the world,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.096
carrying with me stories

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.416
of hundreds of women

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.616
whom I have met within the prisons,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.176
some of whom are now
embracing their second chances,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.440
and others who are still
on that bridge of life's journey.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.280
I embody a line

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.880
from the great Maya Angelou.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.576
"I come as one,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.480
but I stand as 10,000."

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.200
(Applause)

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.096
For my story is singular,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.920
but imagine with me

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.176
the millions of people

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.440
in prisons today,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.960
yearning for freedom.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.216
Three years post my conviction

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.656
and two years post my release,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.656
I got cleared by the courts of appeal

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.216
of any wrongdoing.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.000
(Applause)

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.816
Around the same time,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.016
I got blessed with my son,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.296
whom I named Uhuru,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.376
which in my dialect means "freedom."

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.456
(Applause)

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.976
Because I had finally gotten the freedom

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.880
that I so longed for.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.856
I come as one,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.456
but I stand as 10,000,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.136
encouraged by the hard-edged hope

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.936
that thousands of us have come together

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.200
to reform and transform
the criminal justice system,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.256
encouraged that we are doing our jobs

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.560
as we are meant to do them.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.496
And let us keep doing them

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.320
with no apology.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.256
Thank you.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.800
(Applause)
