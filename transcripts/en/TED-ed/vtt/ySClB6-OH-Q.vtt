00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.082
Imagine if half the people
in your neighborhood, your city,

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:12.995
or even your whole country were wiped out.

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:16.336
It might sound like something out of 
an apocalyptic horror film,

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:19.049
but it actually happened 
in the 14th century

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:22.898
during a disease outbreak
known as the Black Death.

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.869
Spreading from China through Asia,
the Middle East, Africa and Europe,

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.743
the devastating epidemic destroyed 
as much as 1/5 of the world's population,

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:36.469
killing nearly 50% of Europeans
in just four years.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.585
One of the most fascinating
and puzzling things abut the Black Death

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:42.478
is that the illness itself
was not a new phenomenon

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:45.654
but one that has affected
humans for centuries.

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:48.921
DNA analysis of bone
and tooth samples from this period,

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:54.091
as well as an earlier epidemic known as
the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE,

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.471
has revealed that both were caused
by Yersinia pestis,

00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.077
the same bacterium that causes
bubonic plague today.

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:06.100
What this means is that the same disease
caused by the same pathogen

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.244
can behave and spread 
very differently throughout history.

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:14.377
Even before the use of antibiotics,
the deadliest oubreaks in modern times,

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:17.804
such as the ones that occurred
in early 20th century India,

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:21.277
killed no more than 3% of the population.

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:24.509
Modern instances of plague
also tend to remain localized,

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.058
or travel slowly,
as they are spread by rodent fleas.

00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:31.091
But the medieval Black Death,
which spread like wildfire,

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.002
was most likely communicated directly
from one person to another.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:39.713
And because genetic comparisons of ancient
to modern strains of Yersinia pestis

00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:43.247
have not revealed any significantly
functional genetic differences,

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:46.292
the key to why the earlier outbreak
was so much deadlier

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:49.599
must lie not in the parasite but the host.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.397
For about 300 years during
the High Middle Ages,

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:54.839
a warmer climate
and agricultural improvements

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.777
had led to explosive population growth
throughout Europe.

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:00.634
But with so many new mouths to feed,

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:03.687
the end of this warm period spelled disaster.

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.600
High fertility rates
combined with reduced harvest,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.899
meant the land could no longer 
support its population,

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.048
while the abundant supply
of labor kept wages low.

00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:16.402
As a result, most Europeans
in the early 14th century

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.489
experienced a steady decline
in living standards,

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.681
marked by famine, poverty and poor health,
leaving them vulnerable to infection.

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:28.216
And indeed, the skeletal remains
of Black Death victims found in London

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:32.626
show telltale signs of 
malnutrition and prior illness.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:37.271
The destruction caused by the Black Death
changed humanity in two important ways.

00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:40.362
On a societal level,
the rapid loss of population

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:43.717
led to important changes in
Europe's economic conditions.

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:45.535
With more food to go around,

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:49.836
as well as more land and better pay
for the surviving farmers and workers,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:55.221
people began to eat better and live longer
as studies of London cemeteries have shown.

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:58.955
Higher living standards also brought
an increase in social mobility,

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:03.244
weakening feudalism,
and eventually leading to political reforms.

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:06.786
But the plague also had an important
biological impact.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:10.357
The sudden death of so many of
the most frail and vulnerable people

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:14.042
left behind a population with
a significantly different gene pool,

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:17.299
including genes that may have helped
survivors resist the disease.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.357
And because such mutations 
often confer immunities

00:03:20.357 --> 00:03:23.269
to multiple pathogens 
that work in similar ways,

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.638
research to discover the genetic
consequences of the Black Death

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:29.287
has the potential to be hugely beneficial.

00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:32.328
Today, the threat of an epidemic 
on the scale of the Black Death

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:35.528
has been largely eliminated 
thanks to antibiotics.

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:40.596
But the bubonic plague continues to kill a
few thousand people worldwide every year,

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:43.103
and the recent emergence of a 
drug-resistant strain

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:45.983
threatens the return of darker times.

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:49.278
Learning more about the causes and effects
of the Black Death is important,

00:03:49.278 --> 00:03:53.212
not just for understanding how
our world has been shaped by the past.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.686
It may also help save us from 
a similar nightmare in the future.
