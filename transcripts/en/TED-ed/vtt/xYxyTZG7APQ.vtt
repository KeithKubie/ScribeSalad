00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:12.131
Just now, somewhere in the universe,
a star exploded.

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:14.520
There goes another one.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.694
In fact, a supernova occurs every second
or so in the observable universe,

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:23.771
and there is one on average
every 25 to 50 years

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:28.106
in a galaxy the size 
and age of the Milky Way.

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:31.351
Yet we've never actually been able
to watch one happen

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.784
from its first violent moments.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.104
Of course, how would we?

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.604
There are hundreds of billions
of stars close enough

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:42.171
that we could watch 
the supernova explosion

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.486
break through the surface of the star.

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:48.274
But we'd have to have our best telescopes
focused on the right one

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:52.066
at precisely the right time
to get meaningful data.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:57.171
Suffice it to say, the odds of that
happening are astronomically low.

00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.886
But what if we could anticipate 
a supernova before its light reached us?

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:03.622
That may seem impossible.

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:07.573
After all, nothing travels faster
than the speed of light, right?

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:10.134
As far as we know, yes.

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:13.740
But in a race, fast doesn't matter
if you take a detour

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.300
while someone else beelines it
for the finish line.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.088
For exactly that reason,

00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:22.307
photons don't win 
the supernova race to Earth.

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:25.162
Neutrinos do.

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:26.665
Here's why.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:29.234
There are two types of supernova.

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:34.148
Type 1 is when a star accumulates
so much matter from a neighboring star,

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:40.985
that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites
and causes it to explode.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:44.745
In type 2, the star runs out 
of nuclear fuel,

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:47.346
so the gravitational forces pulling in

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:51.905
overwhelm the quantum mechanical 
forces pushing out,

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:57.687
and the stellar core collapses under
its own weight in a hundredth of a second.

00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:01.569
While the outer reaches of the star
are unaffected by the collapsed core,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.459
the inner edges accelerate 
through the void,

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.462
smash into the core,
and rebound to launch the explosion.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:12.234
In both of these scenarios,

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:16.184
the star expels an unparalleled
amount of energy,

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:18.528
as well as a great deal of matter.

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:24.433
In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel,
including elements like gold and silver,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:28.519
only form in supernova reactions.

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.314
In type 2 supernovae,

00:02:30.314 --> 00:02:33.207
about 1% of the energy 
consists of photons,

00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:35.353
which we know of as light,

00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:39.501
while 99% radiates out as neutrinos,

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:44.961
the elementary particles that are known
for rarely interacting with anything.

00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:46.993
Starting from the center of the star,

00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:50.710
the exploding matter takes 
tens of minutes, or even hours,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.067
or in rare cases, several days, to reach
and break through the surface of the star.

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:02.073
However, the neutrinos, 
thanks to their non-interactivity,

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:04.423
take a much more direct route.

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.179
By the time there is any visible change
in the star's suface,

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:13.091
the neutrinos typically have a several
hour head start over the photons.

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.926
That's why astronomers and physicists

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:18.580
have been able to set up a project
called SNEWS,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.313
the Supernova Early Warning System.

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.839
When detectors around the world
pick up bursts of neutrinos,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.538
they send messages 
to a central computer in New York.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:33.423
If multiple detectors receive 
similar signals within ten seconds,

00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:37.729
SNEWS will trigger an alert warning
that a supernova is imminent.

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.876
Aided by some distance and direction
information from the neutrino detectors,

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:44.640
the amateur astronomers 
and scientists alike

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.361
will scan the skies and share information

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:50.680
to quickly identify 
the new galactic supernova

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.395
and turn the world's major 
telescopes in that direction.

00:03:55.395 --> 00:04:01.019
The last supernova that sent detectable
neutrinos to Earth was in 1987

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.295
on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:07.206
in the large Magellanic Cloud,
a nearby galaxy.

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:12.699
Its neutrinos reached Earth about
three hours ahead of the visible light.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.917
We're due for another one any day now,
and when that happens,

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:21.305
SNEWS should give you the opportunity
to be among the first to witness something

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:25.193
that no human has ever seen before.
