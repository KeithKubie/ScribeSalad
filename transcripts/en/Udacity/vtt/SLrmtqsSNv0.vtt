00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.660
So let's talk a little bit about
vision in your visual field.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.469
So as you know, you've got two eyes,
well you started out with two eyes for

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:07.083
most of us.

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:09.641
Each eye is about 160 degrees and

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:14.839
they overlap at about 120 degrees,
which means, if you do the math,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.458
it means you have about 200
degrees total field of view.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.950
Different animals are different,
by the way.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.542
Some animals, the ones that are prey,
and supposed predator.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.083
Their eyes are back here.

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.538
So they have a wider field of view,

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:29.045
and that is they can see more behind,
further behind them,

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:32.110
which you might want to do if
you're worried about a predator.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.190
But of course,
it means you have less stereo vision.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.890
But remember, we were talking
about nerves coming out and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.420
crossing this area
called the optic chiasm?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.090
Let's take a look at that
a little more carefully.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.450
The human vision system does,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.250
well you're probably quite familiar
with your motor control system, right?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.440
That the left part of your brain
controls the right arm, and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.840
the right part of your
brain controls the left.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.070
And if you have a stroke on the left
side of your of your brain you'll,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.060
you'll lose some motor function
also some sensory function.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.780
Well, you probably didnt
stop to think about that

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.250
the eyes have a tricky problem, right?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.792
So the stuff that I see over here is
seen in this eye and in this eye.

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:13.042
And the stuff I see over here is
seen in this eye and in that eye.

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.080
How does the brain deal with that?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.510
Well, the way it does it is,
it actually splits the eyeball in half,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.070
in terms of where
the projections come from.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.830
So here we see the right visual field,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.340
which is looked at by this
left side of the eye.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.695
Which is the temporal side of the left
eye and the nasal side of the right eye.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:37.850
Tho, both of those come in
through the optic chiasm

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.640
going to the left side of your brain.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.167
So the left side of your
brain is looking at

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:46.793
this stuff over here on the right
in both of the eyes, okay?

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:51.611
And likewise, the right side of my right
eye and the right side of my left eye,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.947
which is looking at the stuff
on the left-hand side,

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:58.083
is projected to the right-hand
side of my brain.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:02.274
And so just the same way that your
sensation on your right arm is in your

00:02:02.274 --> 00:02:06.920
left brain, the sensation in your right
visual field is at your left brain.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.450
Also in this other view of the sort
of the projection of the optic

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.380
system into the brain, you can see
these other structures, right?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890
So we get here to
the lateral geniculate,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.240
again on both sides,
project into the superior colliculus.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.010
And here you can see that there
are these projections out

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.810
to this whole area of visual
cortex which is in the back.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.208
And we'll look at that.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.429
One of the implications of
this right half, left half,

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.059
the right part of your brain looking
at the left half, vice versa, is if,

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.632
if you have a some sort of the
degeneracy or stroke or something, and

00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:44.029
let's say you were to lose some
function on one side of your brain

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:48.459
you'd experience what's referred to as
here it's written, hemifield neglect.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.773
'Kay, and what that means is that,
so you've had a damage, let's say,

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.554
to the left side of your brain,

00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:57.793
the whole right side area would
just sort of not be there.

00:02:57.793 --> 00:03:00.927
And what's interesting, and, and we'll
see an example of this a minute when we

00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:04.280
talk about blind spots and stuff, you
don't feel like there's a hole there.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.670
You just feel like this
is my field of view.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.820
I don't actually know what's over there.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.190
Okay, so it's not like right now
I feel there's a hole back here.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.360
Despite what my wife says,
there's no hole in the back of my head,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.270
I don't think.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.720
But I just don't, I just know that
I can't see what's back there.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.160
Well what happens is if your brain
sort of starts not knowing what's over

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.496
here, it just kind of, you know,
it just doesn't worry about it.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.980
You know and in fact, what will happen
is that it'll fill in some stuff for

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.510
a little bit, kind of like you do
with the rest of your visual field.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.790
We'll talk about that in a minute too.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.883
But, but I don't want you to get a sense
that you would feel like there was

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.930
a great big black hole
sitting over there.
