00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.280
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Thank
you very much.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.930
And thank you very
much Laurence,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.790
you know, for welcoming me.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.900
I have, over the years,
really enjoyed the talks

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.350
that I've attended here
and it's very special to be

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.230
at the Library of Congress
to share some of my thoughts

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.280
and work from my new book, which
I love, which I absolutely love.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.970
So, I've been told that
I need to stay here.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.070
I normally tend to walk around.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.260
But, I will, I will stay put
to have my words captured

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160
by the microphone, all right.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.460
Thank you.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.590
So, to begin with
the obvious question.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.190
What do science and seduction
have to do with each other.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.500
Eliza Haywood 1719
seduction novel,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.780
Love In Excess provides
an answer.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.580
The character, the Matchless
Melliora mingles grief

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.450
for her father's death with
sexual desire for her guardian,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.450
who is married, and,
with a degree

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.700
of self-awareness concludes that
her guardian is an object not

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.490
to be safely gazed at.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.140
Her guardian, Count
D'elmont, has a bitter fight

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.750
with his wife and, afterwards,
encounters Melliora reading.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.090
He finds her beautiful
and alluring, as you see,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.790
lying on a green bank in a
melancholy but charming posture,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.740
so completely engrossed
in reading

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.020
that she saw not the Count
till he was close enough to her

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.810
to discern what was the
subject of her entertainment.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.260
D'elmont manages
Melliora's reading

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.490
as an occasion for flattery.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.640
And, he compliments her.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.740
These compliments results in
their first sexual encounter.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.630
The inaugural moment,
in the novel,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.660
when they act upon
their mutual desire.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.390
And, there's an edition,
a wonderful first edition

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.110
of the novel over on the side.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.160
So, what is Melliora reading
with such focus and commitment

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.820
and which makes her look
so alluring and beautiful?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.350
A Volume of Philosophy by
Monsieur Le Fontenelle.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.290
The work for which Fontenelle
was most famous was a volume

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.560
explicating Copernican
and Cartesian cosmology,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.690
with Fontenelle on her lap,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.610
D'elmont sees love
in Melliora's eyes.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.700
Now, Haywood's reference
to Fontenelle transpires

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.710
within a an establish tradition
of figurative associations

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.460
that couple sexual seductions
with scientific knowledge.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.360
Natural philosophy texts,
beginning with Francis Bacon,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750
frequently presents
scientific practices

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.830
as heteronormative
neurotic quests.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.160
Consider Bacon's metaphors

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.600
which expressly identify
the early scientists

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.320
as a masculine seducer.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.840
The naturalists,
according to Bacon,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.330
wants to penetrate the
inner, into the inner

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.390
and further recesses of nature
and to find a way, at length,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.300
into her inner chambers.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.820
If the natural philosopher
seduces, then, nature submits.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.530
It is no wonder if nature
will not give herself

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.410
into their hands.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.790
When Bacon's writings
represent nature as female,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.120
the imagine that scientific
scrutiny is both a form

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.970
of sexual analysis and
an occasion for conquest

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.930
and containment by the
masculinized naturalists.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.770
Within the rational
of draconianism,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.460
sexual effective relations
permit the practice of science

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.760
and the production of
scientific knowledge.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.630
Abraham Cowley Ode Upon
Doctor Harvey from 1657,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.670
describes Harvey's discoveries
about the circulation

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.880
of blood and, in so
doing, presents nature

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.460
as a coil virgin who,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.350
when Harvey's violent passion
she did see began to tremble

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.030
and to flee while
he pursues her.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.200
My topic today concerns
seduction plots

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.830
and texts devoted to
teaching scientific ideas.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.340
For they picture characters
undergoing an intellectual

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.850
conversion to its principles.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.860
And, my focus is on two
dialogues translated

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.520
into English from
French and Italian.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.060
Fontenelle's study of Copernican
and Cartesian cosmology

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.340
from 1686 and Francesco
Algarotti's rendering

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.640
of Newtonian optics in 1737.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.930
So first Fontenelle.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.030
Bernard Le Bovier de
Fontenelle was a major figure

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.070
of the French Enlightenment
for the duration

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.490
of his long nearly
100 years of his life.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.620
In 1686, he published
his most famous work,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.740
Entretiens sur la pluralite
des mondes, an explication

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.490
of Copernican and
Cartesian cosmology.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.500
It was, in France, an
instant best seller resulting

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.850
in 4 editions in 3 years
and 33 more editions

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.170
up to the author's
death in 1757.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.630
And, a sign of his influence and
his radicalism, it was placed

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.800
on the Papel Index
[assumed spelling] in 1687.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.550
and Fontenelle was elected
to the french Academy

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.430
in shortly thereafter.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.350
In 1697, he began
his appointment

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.420
as Perpetual Secretary of
the Academy of Sciences

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.790
which he held unto 1740.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.760
He was, in short, a gatekeeper
of French science studies.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.730
Now, Fontenelle uses dialogue
to challenge Heliocentrism.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.280
This is the belief
held by the character

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.580
of the Martianess
[assumed spelling]

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.060
when she first meets
the philosopher,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.630
her interlocutor
in the dialogue.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.190
Fontenelle's lady is of a
superior rank to her tutor.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.220
And, Algarotti follows
this example.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.790
Throughout the pages
of the discovery,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.800
the philosopher teaches
the Martianess

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.200
about Copernican cosmology
and Cartesian physics,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.160
specifically the theory of
Fortesis [assumed spelling].

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.400
In the Cartesian understanding,
particles are always in motion

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.230
and always in contact with
each other each spinning

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.970
like a planet.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.710
Decartes' Vortices were
disproved by Newton's theory

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.230
of gravity the year

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.980
after Fontenelle
published the Discovery.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.930
But, Cartesian physics remained
intellectually plausible

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.500
for the next 50 years.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.800
And, this is something
that I always want

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.370
to underscore with may students.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.100
Even though a theory may have
been disproven immediately,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.530
the original theory continues
to linger and seem plausible.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.450
You don't have historical
change overnight.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.890
And, Fontenelle, himself,
expresses admiration for Newton

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.540
but he was not convinced by him.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.430
Now, the genre that
Fontenelle chooses is important.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.200
It's a dialogue between a
philosopher and a noble woman

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.050
which allows for, in
Fontenelle's words,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.430
liberty of natural conversation.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.070
The dialogue's dialectic quality
enacts the process of learning.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.300
Making mistakes and having them
corrected is part of learning.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.430
It's not an occasion
to abandon the inquiry.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.060
The French Salon culture,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.090
in which powerful women
were active leaders,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.560
was especially amendable to
these sorts of conversations.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.680
Fontenelle's was a world
organized by elaborate rules

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.650
of social etiquette, practices
that reflected the ideals

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.070
of lightness, gallantry
and gallantry.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.250
These social norms shaped some
of the earliest reputations

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.950
of enlighten philosophers.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.280
All of this gets incorporated

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.670
into how Fontenelle
imagines the conversation

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.560
between the noble
woman and her tutor.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.950
Within the dialogue, Fontenelle
eludes to the genre of romance,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.660
a reference that has the effect

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.100
of easing the dialogue's
conjunction

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.400
of science and seduction.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.940
In his preference, he explains,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.290
I'm going to give
you a long quotation.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.690
He writes, it is not to
penetrate by force of mediation

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.200
into a thing that's obscure
in itself or anything

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.320
that is obscurely explained, tis
only to read and to represent

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.650
to yourselves at the same what
you read and to form some image

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.900
of it that may be clear and free
from perplexing difficulties.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.970
I ask of the ladies, for this
system, that the same attention

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.130
that they must give
the Princess of Cleves,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.600
if they would follow
the intrigue and find

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.070
out the beauties of it.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.590
Though, the truth is that the
ideas of this book are not

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.520
so familiar to the most
part of ladies as those

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.580
of the Princess of Cleves.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.670
But, they are not more obscure
than those of that novel,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.500
and yet, they need not
think above twice at most.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.750
And, they will be capable
of taking a true measure

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.840
and having a just
sense of the whole.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.170
Now, to set back for a
moment, Fontenelle's point is

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.960
that reading about Natural
philosophy, beginners reading

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.260
about natural philosophy is
just as foreign as reading

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.380
about love affair in the
16th century French court.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.990
With this illusion to
Madame de Lafayette's novel,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.810
Fontenelle enjoys his readers
to interpret the discovery

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.880
as though they were attending to
the detailed nuances and turns

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.210
of seduction narrative.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.440
Such reading is an
active engagement

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.170
in the process of
representation.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.090
Near the conclusion
of the discovery,

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.380
the Martianess reflects
upon the effect

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.810
of the scientific education
on her sense of self.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.840
She says I find the
worlds, the heavens,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.310
and the celestial bodies,
so subject to change

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.200
that I am altogether
returned to myself.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.510
This return to myself is
not an attempt to reject

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.690
or renounce the self-subjective
bias, but, to welcome it.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.210
Learning requires the
ability, in Fontenelle's words,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.370
to represent to yourselves
at the same what you read,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.330
to form some image of it
and maybe clear and free.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.800
In the Lochian Lexicon
[assumed spelling],

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.660
this is the imagination
which fiction writers

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.910
in the 18th century
understood as enabling learning

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.400
through fiction and feeling.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.250
Fontenelle insists that a
good reader is a good learner.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.820
And, this individual actively
engages the imagination

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.240
to apprehend new ideas,
concepts, and materials.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.350
Anyone conversant in
the language of romance,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.870
such as La Princess de
Cleves, is equally capable

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.170
of using her attention
and imagination

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.830
to understand Copernicus
and Decartes.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.260
Now, the genre of romance
has long been associated

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.970
with absorptive reading,

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.140
beginning with William
Congreve's preface in 1692

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.990
to Incognita in which he
declares that romance elevates

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.660
and surprises the reader
into a giddy delight.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.110
Scholars often oppose
the romance

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.310
to the novel stipulating
the former is infatuated

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.240
with the extraordinary,
the latter with the real.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.400
So, this idea that romance
really is talking about things

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.720
that could not possibly be,
it's fantasy, extraordinary,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.190
and the novel is grounded
I a notion of realism.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.580
Within this critical tradition,
romance pertains to things

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.310
that are un-observable
that can never be observed.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.460
And, it's a classic description

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.520
that refuses experimental
verification.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.530
So, that's a kind of
truism in the field.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.590
So, what I want to point
out is that none other

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.540
than Robert Boyle is a founding
member of the Royal Society,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.250
a father of chemistry, and
an extraordinary scientist.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.130
None other than Robert Boyle
challenged the perception

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.180
that romance exclusively obtains
to unverifiable experience.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.770
Among his many intellectual
pursuits,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.370
Boyle pondered the principles of
romance and natural philosophy,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.090
the purportedly antithetical
realms

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.890
of the imaginative
and the observable.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.190
He offered a text,
it's now lost,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.170
but it called Apology
for Romances.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.500
He also published
his own romance

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.190
which he panned as a young man.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.400
In a text that he published
in 1671, the Excellency

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.810
of Theology Compared
with Natural Philosophy,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.070
Boyle makes a comparison
similar to the one

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.600
that Fontenelle makes
in preface.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.200
The experience of
nature and romances,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.620
Boyle argues, is analogical.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.800
In the Book of Nature, as
in a well contrived romance,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.380
the parts have such a connection
in relation to one another

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.850
and the things we would
discover are darkly

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.730
or incompletely knowable
by those that perceive them

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.460
that the mind is never
satisfied till it comes

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.830
to the end of the book.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:26.220
In other words, the intricacy
of the natural world correlates

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.470
to that of the romance world.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.380
The connection supposes, though
it does not fully depict,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.390
a philosopher and a
reader who share the skill

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.020
of careful observation.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.580
Romance may induce an absorptive
reader, but it also primes

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.350
that reader to perceive
the meaningful data

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.780
of the natural world.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.130
Now, Fontenelle's choice
of La Princess de Cleves,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.950
as an intellectual model,
also establishes an early link

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.250
to the seduction plot.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.930
La Princess de Cleves
is a seduction story

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.930
that follows the effective
tangle of the married woman

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.020
and a nobleman, the
narrative trajectory

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.890
and the educational imperative

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.120
in Fontenelle's text require
a conversion to Copernican

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.850
and Cartesian principles.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:22.770
And, Fontenelle understands this
conversion as a seduction story.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.610
In other words, seduction
allows Fontenelle

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:30.080
to take a literary plot and uses
it to narrate how one learns

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.890
and comes to believe
natural philosophy.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.390
In the first dialogue,
the Martianess

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.180
and the Philosopher enjoy a
walk in the garden after supper

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.540
as they discuss the
beauty of the night sky.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.610
It is a time, they determine,
most amenable to lovers.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.680
The philosopher's
description is luxurious.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.540
We have the moon
shining through the trees

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.410
that checkers the paths beneath
a most resplendent bite upon

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.810
the green.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.350
The stars looked all like pure
polished gold whose luster was

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.960
extremely heightened by
the deep assured field

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.170
on which they were placed.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.310
When the philosopher praises
the beauty of daytime,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.270
the Martianess turns to
metaphor, day and night as fair

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.550
and dark ladies, the
latter of whom are superior.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.740
She also insists that that the
Philosopher agree with her.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.220
Nighttime and dark haired
women produce soft effects

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.060
that lead to romance.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.270
She says, as you see,
how comes it that lovers

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.230
who are the best judges of
what is pleasing and touching

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.350
to always address
themselves to the night

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.140
in all their songs and elegies?

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.760
Both the Martianess and the
Philosopher become averted

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.770
in how daylight obscures
the stars.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.220
The star filled night sky
facilitates or roving fancies

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.950
about the universe in a
way that daylight cannot.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.360
Enlightenment occurs in
the absence of the sun.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.100
The Martianess says she has
always felt those effects

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.930
of night you tell me, I love the
stars and could be hardly angry

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.900
with the sun for taking
them from my sight.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.070
Her sentiment prompts the
Philosopher to explain,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.990
I cannot forgive the sun's
taking from me the sight

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.360
of all those worlds
that there are.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.150
With that, the Martianess's
curiosity is peak

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.800
and also insatiable.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.020
Worlds, she said, what worlds?

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.980
This is the question the
forms the provocation

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.630
for the ensuing scientific
dialogue.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.090
The Philosopher immediately
sees the swerve from Romance

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.550
to cosmology as a loss

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.650
of an opportunity
for sexual seduction.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.010
And, he's afraid he'll
be faulted for this.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.800
He says, oh Madam, I shall
never endure to be reproached

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.810
with that neglect of
my own happiness, that,

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.390
in a grove at ten o'clock
at night, I talk of nothing

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.380
but philosophy to the
greatest beauty in the world.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.990
No Madam, search for
philosophy somewhere else.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.570
He resists, she insists,
and the moment

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.960
for seduction seems to be lost.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.680
Astronomy displaces eroticism.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.250
However, rather than abandon
the seductive framework

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.510
that he evokes here, Fontenelle,
instead, re-calibrates it.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.300
The garden bathed in moonlight
first allows the Philosopher

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.240
to articular his own
double seduction.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.430
He is seduced by the prospect of
other worlds and he is seduced

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.110
by the intellectual
desires of the Martianess.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.180
The text explicitly
characterizes the Philosopher

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.870
as succumbing to the
Martianess's seduction.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.360
He says, but twas in vain
to put here off by excuses.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.110
From a novelty she was already
but too much pre-possesed with.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:03.090
He says there was a necessity of
yielding and all I could do was

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:08.700
to prevail with her to be secret
for the saving of my honor.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.980
Cosmology and the
Martianess are both alluring.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.680
They both seduce
the Philosopher.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.570
He capitulates the desires
for the language of surrender.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.880
I found myself engaged
past retreat.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.640
Such enjoinder, such resignation
could easily be transported

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.550
from the voice of
the desperate heroine

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.850
in a seduction narrative.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:38.240
Now, even if one is tempted
to dismiss this opening scene,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.750
which really precipitates
the entire dialogue,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.680
as merely a contrivance.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.780
Fontenelle returns
to the same process

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.520
of seduction on the fifth night.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.990
At this point, the Martianess

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.440
and the Philosopher
are discussing those

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.620
Cartesian Vortices.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.370
The topic supplies fanciable
and humorous [inaudible].

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.780
The Martianess says,
for example,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.580
let my brains turn round
if they will as if you're

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.610
on a spinning world and
everything about us is spinning.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.340
Amidst this conversation,
the Philosopher confess

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.380
that his one distemper is love.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.540
They, wherein the turbilones
[assumed spelling] are not

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.840
concerned at all.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.210
An infinite multitude of other
worlds may render little this

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.520
in your esteem, but they do not
spoil fine eyes, a pretty mouth,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.810
or make the charms
of whit ever less.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.270
These will still have their
true values, still bear a price

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.320
in spite of all the
worlds and universe.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.820
So, what he's saying is that,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.960
in spite of all the
astronomical discoveries

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.240
and cosmological discoveries
he might encounter and all

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.430
of these discoveries that might
changes one's view of the world,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.420
none of this will challenge
is ideas about love.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.980
The Martianes laughs and
states, love sames himself

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.560
from all dangers and
there's no system

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.380
or opinion that can hurt him.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.730
Now, the dialogue's
turn to love does more

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.030
than offer the Philosopher

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.230
and the Martianess an
excuse for reporte.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.950
And, they are endlessly kind
of charming and flirting

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.030
with each other in this way.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.620
Falling in love is the
process of giving oneself

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.960
over to the possibility
of seduction.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.960
And this acts as a model

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.150
of [inaudible] acquisition
within the text.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.590
Scientific education, within
Fontenelle's dialogue,

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.310
requires that a learner,
fundamentally, be seduced.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.580
Since we are always in the humor

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.580
of mixing some little
gallantries

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.920
with the most serious
discourses, give me lead

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.170
to tell you that
mathematical reasoning is,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.760
in some things, near
a kin to love.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.350
You cannot allow the smallest
favor to a lover, but,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.610
he will soon persuade
you to yield another,

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.880
and after that, a little more.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.800
And, in the end,
prevails entirely.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.420
So, if you grab the least
principles to a mathematician,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.140
he will instantly draw
consequences from it,

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.140
which you must yield also, and
from that another, and a third,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.580
and maugre all your
resistance in a short time.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.550
He will lead you so far
that you cannot retreat.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.720
And, this is one of the
most remarkable lines.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.370
These two sorts of men, the
lover and the philosopher,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.700
always take more
than is given them.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.640
Persuasion here is seduction.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.370
Fontenelle's Philosopher
recounts the step

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:46.010
by step process wherein one
figure inculcates another

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:51.280
into a new world view, whether
it concerns amatory relations

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.330
or cosmology.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.790
The process of seduction
is inherently social,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.830
whether it is embodied between
two lovers or whether it is

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.430
in virtual between a
learned text and a reader.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.560
And, it relies upon
the lure of reading

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.960
as one finds oneself swept
up on a rushing current

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.420
of proposition after
proposition.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.620
The leading cosmology
results from a series

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.380
of actions enacted by another.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.250
Those actions transport
an individual from one set

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.910
of beliefs to another, a dynamic

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.960
that mimics the narrative
structure of seduction stories.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.030
The conclusion whether
an intellectual

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.680
or amatory terms is submission.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.570
While the Philosopher, in the
opening pages, positions himself

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.170
as succumbing to the
Martianess's ardent desire

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:49.080
to know about cosmology, he,
here, turns to the Martianess

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.060
to tell her you are too
far engaged to retire

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.590
and therefore you
must generously yield.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.610
Submission confirms
consent and agreement.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.550
She says, I yield and confess
you overcharge me with worlds

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.300
and terbiens [assumed spelling].

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.130
She announces her confession.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:18.230
I am extremely in love with
these ideas you give me.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.350
In Fontenelle's text,
we see the delineation

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.000
of scientific education
that draws upon and in

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.170
so doing revises
the torpid seduction

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.040
so often associated
with sexual coercion.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.320
The setting of nighttime
being bathed

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.650
in moonlight could be
seen and generally is seen

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.990
as anticipating a
neurotic encounter.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.660
But, it is an equally
appropriate environment

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.310
for a discussion of cosmology.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.310
Of course, sex and the cosmos
are never far from each other.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.750
The subject position
that Fontenelle imagines

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.590
for his Martianess depends
upon careful observation

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.920
and learning.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.120
And, it also depends upon
her willingness and ability

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.240
to be seduced into
the Copernican

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.940
and Cartesian imaginary.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.890
Now, I want to, the
last portion is

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.340
to talk a little bit
briefly about Algarotti.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.180
Francesco Algarotti
published his text,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.930
and I don't have Italian,
but, it's translated

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.750
by Elizabeth Carter as Sir Isaac
Newton's Philosophy Explained

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.300
for the Use of the Ladies.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.870
He published it in 1737.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.150
The title pages means Naples is
a place of publication, though,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.560
it was printed in Milan under
somewhat covert circumstances.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.950
And I'd love to know more about
this but, it's a murky history.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.640
Newton for the Ladies went
through six Italian editions

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.770
in the six years after
its original publication

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.040
with ten more by 1812.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.160
And, it was also translated,
as you can imagine,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.180
quickly in the English,
French, Russian, Swedish,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.310
German, and Portuguese.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.620
So, it moved across
national linguistic borders

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.950
and it moved across the century.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.810
So, Newton for the Ladies does
not denounce Copernicanism.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.480
And therefore, it, just as
Fontenelle's text was placed

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.430
on the Catholic Church's
index of forbidden books.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.490
Also, like his predicessor,
Algarotti uses the genre

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.200
of the scientific dialogue.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.080
Algarotti's appropriation

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.460
of the seduction plot
demonstrates the persistence

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.760
of this plot as a means to
enact scientific education.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.800
The science he teaches
is different.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.110
But Algarotti models
his dialogue explicitly

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.570
on Fontenelle's.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.460
At the moment that
the Noble Woman,

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.280
insists upon an education,
this time in Newton's theories

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.610
of light and color, Algarotti
evokes his predecessor.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.960
In response to the Noble Woman,
the Philosopher begs she would

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.430
at least had patience
till evening,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.330
telling her that the night had
always been the time consecrated

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.410
to philosophical affairs,

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.850
explaining that the
most polite philosopher

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:11.230
in France had made use of it in
a circumstance resembling mine

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.590
and made no scruple of
entertaining a fine lady

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:19.220
with philosophical discourses,
and would at midnight.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.210
Yet, Algarotti's Noble
Woman is impatient.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.140
She spoke with this, she spoke
this with an era of authority

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.290
that enforced her commands
in the most amiable manner

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.370
and made it a pleasure to
obey, says the Philosopher.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.320
The Martianess's refusal here to
accede to the Philosopher desire

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.760
to nighttime [inaudible]
reflects her agency

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.420
and her greater rank of course
and also has the effect of,

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.560
surprise, surprise, increasing
the Philosopher's desire

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.050
to be seduced by her
intellectual philosophy.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.200
When the Philosopher fails to
seduce the Martianess sexually,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.810
he finds herself, instead,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.580
seduced by her epistemological
desires.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.860
Philosophers, argues the
Philosopher, are no different

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.620
from mistresses, for, both
have the obligation, he says,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.100
to make good on their promises.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.910
A mistresses must accede to
enter into a sexual relation

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:20.640
and a philosopher into
an intellectual one.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.130
But, the pathway of
seduction works both ways.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.930
If the Martianess seduces the
Philosopher with her desire

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.600
to return, to learn,
the Newtonianism,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.730
presented by the Philosopher,
in turn, seduces her.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.530
As in Fontenelle,
mathematicians are like lovers.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:43.330
If what you grant them, at first
be ever so little, they know how

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.540
to make so good an
advantage of it

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.630
as to lead you insensibly
farther

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.100
than you've ever imagined.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.110
Even though the Martianess
demurs, he says,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.750
I have as little skill
in the artifices of love

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.490
as in the those of
philosophy and mathematics.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.720
She's enchanted by
and ultimately seduced

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.840
by the principles
of Newtonianism.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.960
Her epistemological
craving returns throughout

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.380
their dialogues.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.020
She felt, as you see,
the utmost impatience

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.640
to be more learned than hugan.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.480
She was not for losing
a moment's time

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.350
but would continued our
discourses upon vision the next

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.650
morning as soon as
ever we were up.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.260
This was all the
optics she could get

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.000
from me in the morning.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.550
Following an extensive
discussion concerning the

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.400
refrangibility of light,
the Philosopher responds

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.910
to the Martianess in terms
that points to the structure

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.220
of desire and to the
plot of seduction.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.780
Tis in philosphy, as in
all other human affairs

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.080
where the accomplishment

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.350
of one desire often
gives birth to another.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.520
And, you have that same process
that you saw in Fontenelle.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.030
As soon as you learn a little
bit, you want to learn more

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.460
and you want to learn more,
it's a structured desire.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.050
So, the female reader of
Algarotti's text is imagined

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.950
as an eager recipient
ready to be swayed

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.440
by the seductive allure
of Newtonian science.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.430
She is an effective being.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.290
And, the plot of
seduction is appropriate

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.750
because it concerns affect,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.520
namely a subject's heart
rather than her mind.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.030
And, in this way, Algarotti

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.880
and Fontenelle are a
little bit different.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.530
Algarotti writes, the marvelous

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.050
of which the heart always
desires of being effected is

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:36.260
so fond happily arises in
true philosophy of itself

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.560
with out the help of machines.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.930
And then, he asks,
is there anything

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.750
in which a writer should omit
any endeavors to move the heart.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.050
So, the role of affect

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.610
and seduction introduces the
possibility that the conversion

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.880
to Newtonianism may not succeed.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.170
Because, she perceives
rather than understands,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.430
she is effected by and
receives Newtonianism,

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.410
the Martianess second
guesses herself.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.290
When they discuss
the refrangibility

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.350
of light, she panics.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.230
She asks have I acted
wrong in suffering myself

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.960
to be too easily convinced?

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.070
The Philosopher assures her that
a lady cannot err in this point.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.640
Uncertainty does not derail
the conversion process.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.600
She says, let me intrigue you
to make me a complete Newtonian.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.060
I plainly see, by my conversion,
I so shall inquire the knowledge

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.410
of truth without
losing that pleasure

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:40.440
which I found in being deceived.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.310
And, the end of their six
dialogues accomplishes her

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.310
desire for conversion.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:50.950
If the Martianess is seduced by
the ideas of Newtonianism, then,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.690
she provokes a philosopher

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.560
by placing Newton himself
within such a plot.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.950
You seem to represent nature
as a coquette she says,

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.720
and Sir Isaac Newton
as a jealous lover

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.430
who never thinks
he has proof enough

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.940
of the fidelity of his mistress.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.780
The Martianess's portrait of
Newton recalls a scientific

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.080
and erotic legacy

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.530
of masculinized intellectual
mastery commonly found

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.890
in Bacon and his followers.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.810
The process of acquiring
natural philosophical knowledge

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.970
that then can be distributed

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.770
to alkalies requires endless
experimentation and pursuit.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:35.800
A single experiment does
not satisfy a philosopher.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.890
The Philosopher answers this
was the only object of his love.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.450
He confirms the legitimacy
and compares them and suggests

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:48.630
that Newton's rightful posture
was of a jealous love driven

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.430
to distraction to find out any

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.500
and all secrets of
the natural world.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.570
Newton, as a natural
philosopher,

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.410
embodies the suspicion
of a controlling lover.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:04.730
However, Algarotti's Philosopher
presses for a key difference.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:08.090
So, Newton exhibits
philosophical jealousy.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.260
And this very vividly
binds the seduction revert

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.610
to scientific discovery.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.480
Under writing the
process of seduction

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.000
that the Philosopher here
and the Martianess undergo,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.570
is a super structure that
understands seduction

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.600
as a relation of
power and control.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.040
Newton's knowledge acquisition
does not reside an ecstatic

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.250
realm but forcibly
encounters nature, its subject,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.800
and bends nature to its
practitioner's will.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.240
The Philosopher qualifies
the admission

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.310
that Newton too has the
desires of a seducer.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.020
At the text's conclusion,

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.360
he distinguishes the
Martianess's passions

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.910
from Newton's moderation.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.810
So, the Philosopher says, the
moderation of our philosophers

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.140
in never affirming
anything to be true

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.850
which was not demonstrated
by observation,

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.600
may serve for an example
for most rash asserters.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.080
In spite of the Martianess's
enthusiastic response,

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.790
the findings of Newton,
insists the Philosopher,

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.100
are sober and reasoned.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.990
He says they are not assertions
but they are discoveries.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.950
Now, Algarotti's text we've
witnessed the multi-valient

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.870
nature of the seduction paradigm
in ways that accord with

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.110
and differ from the
precedent of Fontenelle.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.470
In Fontenelle, the Philosopher
reports the Martianess seduces

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.250
him and the Martianess
admits that she is seduced

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.450
by her scientific education.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.030
These are moments of learning.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.230
But, Algarotti privileges a
woman's power of perception

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.190
over her understanding,
a form of cognition

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:47.130
that excused Fontenelle's
celebration of the imagination

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.710
and it presents feeling
as a mode of learning.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.360
Algarotti's texts highlights the
imperative for seduction built

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.000
into the project of natural
philosophy as a practice.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.480
And, in this final
seduction, the producer

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.300
of knowledge seduces a
vulnerable and feminized nature

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.150
in the process of revealing
the gender an sexual politics

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.630
of knowing and being known.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.530
To conclude, through their
evocation and adaptation

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.110
of the seduction plot, these
scientific dialogues demonstrate

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.980
that believing in science
is not merely a matter

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.900
of rational understanding.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.960
The idea of virtual
witnessing that is written

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.000
into the early scientific
project which is reading

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.840
and believing experiments,
establishes textual mediation

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.420
as a vital technology
of scientific inquiry.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.440
It ultimately depends up on
readers reading and imagining

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.720
and thus corroborating the
accuracy of reported findings.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.090
But, the seduction plot
reveals another technology.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.830
Understood as a transformative
process,

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.010
seduction plots move an
individual from one circumstance

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.260
or one set of beliefs
to another.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.750
Seduction acts upon the
individuals who experience it.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:08.050
It pushes one beyond the limits
of rational disbelief or belief

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.920
and it exacts submission.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.920
To use the seduction
plot as a model

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.570
for scientific education spells

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:20.020
out the conversion one must
undergo, the conversion

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.810
to which one must be subjective

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.100
to become a modern
enlightened subject.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.900
Thank you very much.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:32.760
[ Applause ]

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.560
&gt;&gt; Anyone have any
questions or any comments?

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.730
[ Background noise ]

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.030
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.580
&gt;&gt; My [inaudible] which around
nature is one of more abuse

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.030
and rape than seduction.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.260
Am I misinterpreting?

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:55.560
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: So, when
I, and I'm speaking here

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.800
in the microphone so I.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.540
So the question here is
why Bacon's language seems

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.410
to be much more about abuse
and rape rather than seduction?

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:13.390
So, my evocative seduction
draws upon a body of literature

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:21.180
that is looking at seduction
more generally as a continuum,

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.040
that rape, that includes rape.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.620
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: And so, it
is a taking over of someone

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.890
without their consent, okay.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:37.290
And, definitions of rape in
the 17th and 18th century are

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:43.120
in no way commensurate
with how define it today.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.840
Whether one could be
raped depended upon one's

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.140
subject position.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.970
And, it reveals all sorts
of ideology, but, seduction,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.860
more generally and the kind of
moving from rape to marriage,

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.050
I'm evoking the work
of Toni Bowers here,

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.570
is using the same logic, the
same logic of submission, yeah.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.870
So, thanks for that
question, yeah.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.760
It's very jarring to
our modern eyes, right.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.910
But, I think it's important to
remember that the whole idea

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:17.330
of companion marriage
itself use that same logic.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.610
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: So, even
institutions and structures

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:26.250
that seem not to be
dependent upon violence

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.950
and abuse are inherent,

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.060
have that inherent
structure within them.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.740
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, so
Toni Bower's work,

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.280
the book in particular, it's
called By Force or Fraud,

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:47.060
and she's quoting satan
there, describing, you know,

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.250
how shall we take Eden.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.740
Shall we do it by
force or by fraud?

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.600
Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:02.930
&gt;&gt; Several, you know, Fontenelle
and [inaudible] continental.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.230
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.730
&gt;&gt; And translated by [inaudible]
and Elizabeth Carter.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.030
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.320
&gt;&gt; And, I'm wondering
what, how do you see,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.700
if you see a cultural
transformation

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.330
in continental understandings
in romance

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.910
and plot over [inaudible]?

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:32.250
And, why I'm thinking that is
because often there's a sense

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.690
that a French example of romance
is so much more psychological.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.990
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.960
&gt;&gt; Than English, it's more
rooted into a different,

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.960
rather than to plot to
scheme they're rooted

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.500
into map and actually observe.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.070
And so then, I was
just wondering

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.510
if you had done anything
with the the appropriation,

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.020
also appropriation and
maybe transformation?

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.480
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah,
that's a really nice point.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.860
So, the, what I did
not have time to talk

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.670
about is the acts
of translation.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.600
So I'm, you know, I'm writing
about the British enlightenment.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.520
And, one of the things I'm
very interested in thinking

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.940
about is the porousness
of these [inaudible]

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.090
and linguistic borders.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:25.280
I draw upon the translations
as imagining them as, you know,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.650
this is one of the key ways
that they were available

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.560
to the British reading public.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.860
[Inaudible] so first,
a few things,

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.630
one translation was a way
that women writers made money,

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:39.640
one of the, and you know,
it was kind of open to them.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.190
And, Elizabeth Carter
made a sizable amount

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.090
for her translation
of Algarotti as well

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.620
as her other things,
she was very learned.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.470
We don't have as
much of a record

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.330
of her imprint in the text.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.810
We do with Alfred Baynes.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.390
A few things, she takes
Fontenelle's name off the title

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:03.160
page and puts hers on there.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.590
She has, right, so claiming
that kind of authority.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.590
She also has an extended
treatise about translation,

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.310
and the, within that,
she makes a number

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.970
of scientific arguments
discounting

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.390
Fontenelle's science.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.400
So, she's putting her mark
as a scientific expert

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.610
through the process
of translation.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.950
So, the second, the next
thing I would say is

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:36.410
that I chose her translation
for a number of reasons.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.210
There were other, you
know, Glanvill Fellow

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:43.280
of the Royal Society and
there was an Irish translation

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.580
that was immediate.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.800
And, those are very, you know,
they take the French references

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.040
and they make them English,
you know, very explicitly,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.520
not nationalist, but make
them very, particularly

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.530
with Glanvill, and
this becomes a way

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.450
of pumping up the Royal Society.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:06.110
What Baynes is interested in,
because she has the variety

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.570
of writing, kind of,
and experienced writing,

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.870
why I find her translation

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:15.260
so much more interesting is
she focuses in on this quality

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.070
of fancy that is
absolutely central

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.410
to my reading of the romance.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.580
So, this is to get to your other
question about or your question

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.980
about the mobility of
the seduction plot.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.540
And so, Fontenelle is
using this idea, he evokes,

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.500
she translates it as fancy.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.840
That fancy is an
intellectual technology.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.500
And, that becomes a kind of
gateway to think about what,

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.650
in my larger work,
I call literariness.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.550
So, that's literary knowledge,
the fancy comes away to think

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.100
about literary knowledge.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.400
I think your point

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.970
about seduction being
intellectual versus, you know,

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.230
if you just compare the 17th
century tradition between France

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.330
and Britain, I mean,
in the 17th century,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.160
late 17th century English
edition, it's violence.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.560
These are, it is, it's
rapes, its constant kind

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.260
of physical sexual assaults.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.190
And, that is so called
seduction, right,

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:16.490
versus the psychological, right.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.410
So, I think that's a nice
point to keep in mind.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:25.360
And so, there's a kind of
importation that seduction has

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.860
to do with sex and bodies,
but, it also has this other way

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.990
of working intellectually, yeah.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:34.580
And, I think that's way
it's such a productive plot

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.460
and narrative trajectory
for thinking about the world

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.330
in a radically new way, yeah,

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.300
that challenges everything
you've ever thought of.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:49.370
And, how do you come
to believe that?

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.670
Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.710
&gt;&gt; I have a connection that men

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:59.390
in early modern society only
know how to [inaudible].

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:06.060
He wants position,
he wants money.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:12.060
But this is the only language
he knows how to use to approach.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.080
And, I think that
stretches across the period.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.770
So, do you think
that has any barring

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:25.870
on choosing this vocabulary
this paradigm of seduction,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.130
the only way that a male
can approach a female is

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.560
in a sexualized context?

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.210
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: That's
an interesting question.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:40.630
So, that's, these two texts
are designed, they say they're

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:46.170
for women readers and they
imagine the woman, right.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:50.330
Their readership was
imagined much more broadly.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.840
So the, you know,
Fontenelle imagines,

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.910
and he says quite specifically,
I am writing for men and women.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.580
So, in a sense, within
the fiction of it,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:10.230
she's seduced but, within the
reading practice of discovery,

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.290
anyone, it's a subject
position that's open.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:18.090
It may be feminized, but it's
open to and it's imagined,

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:22.230
Fontenelle imagines through the
Salon culture, right, that men

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.280
and women are going to
be reading this and have

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.750
that process of learning
science is one of seduction.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.440
And so, this is why you
have the Philosopher

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.900
in both texts imagine
being seduce.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:44.150
And, this is why, so, I agree
with you in a certain way, but,

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.160
I think it has a greater
flexibility within the text.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.010
So, there is that
subject position of kind

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.140
of imagining a young
woman or, in this case,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.470
it's tricky because
these are women of rank.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.310
&gt;&gt; But they're still women.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.360
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: They're still
women, they're women of rank,

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.790
their tutors are
of a lower rank.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.870
We're at the time where
gender and rank are still,

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.780
rank is still, in many
ways, going to trump gender,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:21.140
not completely, I mean on a
long term feminist scaler.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.740
So, I see what you're saying.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.570
But, I think, one of the
things that I'm interested

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:30.110
in is how this trope comes
to explain and becomes a way

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.400
of convincing people
about empiricism.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.080
I think that gets lost in
the history of science,

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.510
absolutely gets lost in
the history of science.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:43.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[inaudible] yeah.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:52.460
So you have, this is also a
world in which what we think now

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.100
as the disciplinary knowledge

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.830
of science being absolutely
a million miles away

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.790
from the disciplinary
knowledge of the humanities,

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.490
that disciplinary
difference doesn't exist.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:07.200
And so, to be learned and
educated, one was fluent

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.000
or had some kind of fluency.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.700
So, these texts operating
in that kind

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.180
of marketplace as well.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.300
You could buy a ticket
and go see, you know,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.570
Benjamin Martin who, he
has a guide book over there

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:23.150
and it's addressed to
young gentlemen and ladies.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.070
And, the fiction is, it's
a brother coming back

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:29.130
from university teaching
a sister.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.880
But, this was available to
anyone who was, you know,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.530
picking up a novel,
going to the theater,

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.610
going to learn a little bit
about [inaudible], yeah.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.850
Yeah.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.080
&gt;&gt; Thanks for a fascinating
talk.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.380
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Thank you.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.050
&gt;&gt; My question is do you
think that Fontenelle

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:56.530
and Algarotti here, the primary
motivation is to lay expositions

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:02.560
on [inaudible] or are they
simply printing manuals

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.190
for the scientific education?

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:08.400
What is their, you're making
it sound like, you know,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.900
they're really thinking
about this whole,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.330
I just want to understand
[inaudible].

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.630
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.880
&gt;&gt; Or, are they just trying

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.600
to help the [inaudible]
regarding science?

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.060
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: I, they
can, it's [inaudible].

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:30.460
So, to promote the scientific
theories, they have to chart

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:36.080
out how one comes to believe
them because you don't have,

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:42.530
because the information,
in a sense, is so radical.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.630
So, there's no precedent.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.980
It is how do you kind of
radically convince someone

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.640
of that, the sun is not
the center of the universe?

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.980
And so, when that is such a kind

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:02.980
of experiential diurnal
notion of what the world is.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.720
So, I think that, for
both of them, they're,

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.550
the choice of a dialogue
signals right off the bat

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:13.850
that they are interested

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.540
in demonstrating the
process of learning, yeah.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.490
And so, that is a
very kind of that back

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.940
and forth a bit by bit.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.760
They could've written
it as a treatise,

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.060
this is, you know, from start.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.530
There are lots of
different genres

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.870
that would've been available.

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.290
But, they choose a dialogue

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.130
and the choose a
scientific dialogue,

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.680
and they choose these
particular characters, yeah.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.590
So, I think you can't, for them,
it's absolutely bound together.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.240
Yeah. Yes hi.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
[inaudible].

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.230
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Okay.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:53.010
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask a
question on experiential.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.310
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:49:02.780
&gt;&gt; In terms of [inaudible]
science, there's a lot

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:09.580
of thinking about how
learning or doing, sort of,

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:20.750
the way in which people really
best absorb information.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:31.640
How does the sort of promoter
being the seduction [inaudible]

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.940
because you're devoid

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.710
of actually looking
or actually doing so.

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.010
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Right.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.960
&gt;&gt; I mean like you don't
have the prism, right.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.330
So, how are you understanding
[inaudible],

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.870
when you don't have the
telescope to look, [inaudible].

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.100
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Not, right
not generally yeah, yeah.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.400
Was there more to that?

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.700
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.000
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.010
So, there is, absolutely,
what we think of now

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.820
as scientific knowledge
is generated

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.570
through artisanal practice.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:08.560
So, you have Hook and all of
those people doing, you know.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.260
And Ian Hacking talks
about experiment is doing.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:18.180
So, there is that realm in
which discoveries are made.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:22.440
I mean, I'm using the
passive [inaudible], right,

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.570
which they make discoveries.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:29.120
The challenge, and this is where
my work is thinking about Shapin

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.300
and Schaffer, Leviathan
and the Air-Pump,

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:34.920
but really pushing well beyond.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.170
Because what they
had, what Shapin

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:43.720
and Schaffer have given
us is an understanding

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.220
that for scientific
knowledge to be corroborated,

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:53.820
which it always needs to be
corroborated, there are only

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.400
so many people who can
look under a microscope.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.570
And, so, they use this idea,

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:06.060
which you might be familiar
with, of virtual witnessing,

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:11.240
which is a, and what they mean

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:16.880
by that is readers
reading the experiment

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.600
and imagining that
they can do it.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:26.040
And that becomes a
mechanism of authorization.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.860
So, you have built in to the way

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.540
that early scientific
knowledge is produced,

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.130
the experiential
and the literary.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.910
And then literary requires
the imagination of the reader

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:47.710
to visualize something
as plausible.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:55.100
And that realm of plausibility,
and that realm of imagination,

00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:02.550
is, it gets obscured because we
think facts are facts, right?

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:11.360
It gets obscured, but that
is the, that can only happen

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.300
through a literary imagination.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.490
So, the step to a
seduction plot is to say,

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:21.050
this is another literary
technology

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.050
that accomplishes
the same thing.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:28.040
And, so, it is, there is also
the, you know, there's the sense

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.050
that these things are available.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.320
You can buy a microscope, you
can look through a telescope.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.490
Eliza Haywood's Female
Spectator talks about, you know,

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:39.990
she and her friends go out
to the country, and they look

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.290
at all sorts of things
through a microscope,

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:47.730
they go to a neighbor's house
and look through a telescope.

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.620
But the, so there are
these moments of praxis.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.040
But, what is absolutely
central are these moments

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.570
of representation
of that praxis.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:06.750
And, so that the, you
know, it's the rule of the,

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:11.790
one of these I'm really
interested in is the role

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.660
of the imagination in
empirical knowledge.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:21.120
And it is, you know, Boyle talks
about this, Hooke, you know,

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.400
it's in their own literature,
their own way of understanding.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.700
But, I think, in the history
of science, we've really,

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.130
and the kind of triumphalism
that science is objective,

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.430
like the history
of objectivity is,

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:28.730
obscures the subjective,
and degrades it.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:30.030
And, I think that, what I
want to recover is the fact

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.330
that it is not degraded,
absolutely central

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.630
to the artisanal and
the experiential.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:33.930
Yeah?

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.230
&gt;&gt; I would completely
agree with you.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.530
But, I'm just, I'm wondering
if there's also an assumption

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.830
on the part of these male
authors that, I mean,

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:39.130
I guess it's maybe a
gender based argument,

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.430
because you find, at least in
the middle of the 18th century,

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:41.730
[inaudible], like this
is for the ladies.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.030
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.330
&gt;&gt; Sort of water it
down, distill it,

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.630
to get ladies to understand.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:46.930
And it just, [inaudible] when
you look at the manuscript books

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:48.230
of ladies, right, they wall
want to know this information.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.530
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:50.830
Yeah.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.130
&gt;&gt; So, they don't need
it to [inaudible].

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.430
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Right.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.730
&gt;&gt; Majority the same way.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.030
So, I'm just wondering, is
there gender mechanisms?

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.330
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:58.630
&gt;&gt; Because I completely think
you're right, [inaudible].

00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:59.930
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.230
&gt;&gt; And we need that
more [inaudible].

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:02.530
And maybe it takes an
interdisciplinary [inaudible].

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:03.830
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Kind
of pulled that out.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.130
So, it's a, one I'm
going to say is a version

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.430
of what I was saying to Sabrina.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:07.730
So, that you do how, you
tete-a-tete, it's such and such

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:09.030
for the ladies, such
and such for the ladies.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.330

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.930
But, and you know, Alfred
Bayne says, was it [inaudible],

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.230
I think they both say,
this is for women,

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.580
and men of leisure,
it's for everyone.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.050
But, it gets addressed
as for the ladies.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:25.020
And, then, if you look at the
readership of these texts, and,

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.570
which is a whole other world,
but the readership of it shows

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:33.050
that these are being sold to
gentlemen, like Samuel Pepys.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:38.540
So, you know, Newton
for the ladies is,

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.290
it is now just for women.

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.750
You know, Newton, he's
impossible to understand, right?

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.650
So, that just becomes, in a
sense, if you want to say,

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:53.060
it's a kind of marketing
technique that actually alludes

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.180
to a much broader audience.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.590
And, I would, you know, Bill
Warner makes this argument

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.520
about the novel, more
generally, that the, you know,

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.200
what we think of as amatory
fiction, and the domestic novel,

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.970
that that is, that that kind of,

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:15.040
the idea that that is just
imagining and produced

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.910
for a female, young
impressionable female reader,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.110
is historically very misleading.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:25.300
And it misses the kind of
pleasure of a reader entering

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.720
into that space, and that
absorptive reading, itself,

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.780
is about being, kind
of, being seduced

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.930
and subjective to the text.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.490
But, I think, you know, and if
you start looking at, kind of,

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:42.500
diaries and things like that,
these texts are being pursued

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:49.390
by a much broader category than
just, quote unquote, the ladies.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:50.690
Yeah.

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:51.990
&gt;&gt; But then [inaudible]
a way which you put it

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:54.830
out there is watered
down for the ladies,

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.860
that's really the whole
patriarchal paradigm.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.500
That's reinforcing, right?

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.800
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yes.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.100
&gt;&gt; That's reinforcing
male superiority

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.810
and female inferiority.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:10.260
So, there's no reason why
men wouldn't read that.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.050
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: So, let me
point to a key difference

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:17.150
between Fontenelle and
Algarotti, to get at this.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.000
So, Algarotti has,
he talks about,

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.030
I'm going to keep this
simple, I'm not going

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.650
to use any of the calculations.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:31.690
It was also, I mean, Newtonism,
like I said, no one read,

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:35.630
I mean, so, he's already
starting off with, kind of,

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.450
making a claim that's ludicrous.

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.310
As if she has, kind
of, primary knowledge.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:43.700
But he said, I'm only going
to take us to the temple door.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.090
And then, Portico, that's
what Newton for the ladies is.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.660
Fontenelle is very different.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.730
Fontenelle says, I am writing
for those who are experts,

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:59.140
as well as the gentlemen and
women who are not experts.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:04.520
So, this trope, if you
will, can be utilized

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.920
in a variety of different ways.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.240
Someone like, and I think it's
really important that someone

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.950
like Elizabeth Carter is doing
the translation of Algarotti.

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:16.560
She is the one who
brings Newton home.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.170
She was known, you know,
Samuel Johnson said,

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.470
she was smarter than,

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.060
the smartest person
he had ever met, okay?

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.980
She had a reputation
for learning.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:30.820
And this was as, weirdly,
the you know, Newton going

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.560
through Algoratti
and then coming back

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.610
through Carter was how Newton
came to be known mid century on.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:41.110
And it is through
this incredibly,

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.570
incredibly brilliant
learned woman.

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:46.540
So it, yeah, I mean it's,
there's not a clear cut,

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.840
and that's why I
think it's important,

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.240
we have to keep all
this in mind.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.770
And it's not that anything
written to the ladies imagines,

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:58.460
you know, it's just, kind of,
offensively imagining women

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:04.750
as stupid, or as, kind of,
idealistically imagining women

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:08.960
as all knowing, right,
or intelligent.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.420
But the power of these, I think,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.550
is really important
to keep in mind.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:17.240
And how it becomes, anyway, so.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.470
[ Background noise ]

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:22.660
&gt;&gt; I think that's interesting
in terms of experiential,

00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.290
that removed to that,
because that also,

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:29.040
problem [inaudible] is gender.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.340
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.100
&gt;&gt; In a sense of his experience.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.700
And the idea, too, of
seduction as a tool.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:40.100
I'm just kind of thinking
of what all of the audience,

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.870
and you, had brought out in
this discussion, so it's a,

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:44.460
kind of, comment, here.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:49.270
But, when we see the effects,
not in romances, but in novels,

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:50.570
of the attention to detail.

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.870
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:54.130
&gt;&gt; Because of the microscope
and the [inaudible],

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.090
the believability of
uncovering what isn't seen,

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:01.360
and making that,
that's different.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.660
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.080
&gt;&gt; That is, actually,
not metaphoric.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.120
It's a tool for details for
trades, where you're talking

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.590
about seduction as a technology
for movement, you know,

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:19.110
rather than one is, I put the,
has a passive recipient, too.

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:20.410
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Right.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:21.710
&gt;&gt; You know.

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:23.010
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Right.

00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:24.310
&gt;&gt; That's with seduction.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.610
So, I mean, it just, these
kind of influences of all

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.910
of these ideas at the time.

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:28.210
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.510
Yeah.

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:30.810
&gt;&gt; And just the way seduction
can be taken in different ways,

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:32.110
so could experiential.

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:33.410
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:34.710
&gt;&gt; And who is learning,
and who is authority,

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:38.120
and who is viewed could
be, you know, seen.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.710
Which you think, too, we're
talking about seduction

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.360
and what is, when
we see it ourselves.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.890
And then you have something
that's certainly not romance,

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.870
but for some reason,
I started thinking

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:55.690
about Defoe's Apparition of
Mrs. Veal, that his, you know,

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:58.240
the observation,
he's playing with us.

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.330
But, of course, we think
of this as a ghost story.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:04.070
Or is it? Did she come back,
and what you can't attest to.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:07.860
So, it just seems, and that's
totally a different discourse

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.560
that's going on on one side.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.160
&gt;&gt; This transformation
from seduction.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.460
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.760
&gt;&gt; But it's playing with some

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.670
of the same ideas,
minus the seduction.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.060
So, I guess, I see, in a way,
what this seduction is in.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.680
I'm not asking what
the seduction

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.510
and who has been supplying
with this seduction of that.

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:31.960
[ Background noise ]

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.580
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: So, one of
the things that, I think,

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:39.860
it is also key to the way
that literary knowledge

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.180
and science operate is

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:51.110
that alongside this pedagogical
model, which is based

01:00:51.110 --> 01:01:00.130
on pleasure, there are gestures,
and there are celebrations

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.780
of a version of what
you're talking about,

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.950
detailed observation.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:08.680
Detailed observation
is at the core

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.860
of experimental knowledge
production.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:19.550
And someone like Haywood, to go
back to the female spectator,

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:24.630
she is making an argument there,
particularly around the uses

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:28.350
of the microscope, and uses
of the scientific technology,

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:34.300
that this is a good practice,
specifically, for women,

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:39.190
and specifically, you
know, the main voice

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:41.790
of the female spectator
is a reformed coquette.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:46.350
And, so, coquette is a
highly sexualized figure.

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:48.310
She's an epistemolant [assumed
spelling], she's a social

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:52.470
and ideological problem,
because she refuses to agree

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.840
to get married to anyone.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.750
She's holding the moment
of courtship at abeyance.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.330
But she's also a
problem of knowledge.

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.770
You can't know what
her heart is.

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.450
Okay? So, you can't know her.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.420
She's an epistemological
problem.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:13.530
So, Haywood takes that
figure, and reforms her.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.180
That's her, that's the
female spectator is a

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.540
reformed coquette.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:22.520
And, part of what the
use of, the praxis,

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.320
the artisanal experience
of science, can do,

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.810
is to help self improvement.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:32.010
And a coquette, a reformed
coquette, is really good

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:34.120
at science, because
she knows how

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.070
to look closely and carefully.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.100
All that experience
looking at clothing,

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.330
all that experience analyzing
society, all that experience,

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.790
kind of, that close examination.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:52.150
So, she's an unlikely, but a
very pervasive examplar of a,

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:55.170
kind of, enlightened
scientific subjectivity

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.380
that becomes available
from this.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.170
And, one of the things
that I really want to do,

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:01.940
to bring to this table, to the
table, is through this, kind of,

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.550
capacious archive that
I'm describing to you is

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:09.670
to think much more broadly
about scientific subjectivity.

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:13.360
And it's the ways in which
women have access to it

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.860
in different ways, and men have
access to it in different ways,

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.170
and different ranks,
and so forth.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.930
So, the reformed
coquette, I think,

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:22.270
is just a remarkable
moment for her.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:24.270
Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:27.450
&gt;&gt; So, let's thank Miss Chico

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.780
for a very interesting,
and enlightening.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.080
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: Yeah.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.380
&gt;&gt; And the [inaudible]
have brought

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.160
out some very interesting
volumes

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.890
that we should take a moment to
have the opportunity to look at.

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.040
And anyone who wants
to come [inaudible]

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.830
after [inaudible] conversation.

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:46.130
&gt;&gt; Tita Chico: And can I say,

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.450
thank you all, it
was really nice.

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.750
Thank you.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.050
Thanks so much.
