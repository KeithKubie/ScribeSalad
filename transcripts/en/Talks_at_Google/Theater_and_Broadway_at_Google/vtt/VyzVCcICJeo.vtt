[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:09.260
KUNAL: It's a dark--
just so you know,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.890
Jesse Eisenberg wrote
a beautiful play.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.925
We're going to show
you-- in the beginnings,

00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:15.800
it's a scene from the
beginning, pretty much,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.590
right when the play starts.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.370
We play roommates.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.000
This is Ben's apartment.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.270
He is an aspiring filmmaker.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.069
I'm getting my MBA at NYU
Stern School of Business.

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.860
And I'm from Nepal.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370
And then, we just begin acting.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.920
Cool.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770
JESSE: OK.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.620
KUNAL: More nervous to do
this now than on stage.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.120
JESSE: Yeah.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.145
KALYAN: Hey, oh, hey, Ben,
did you film anything today?

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:45.520
BEN: Nothing needed
to be filmed.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.950
KALYAN: Mm, I saw this thing
I think you might have liked.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.100
I know how you are
always trying to capture

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.580
real and dramatic
moments for your film.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.330
BEN: Compelling.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.230
Not dramatic,
there's a difference.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.938
KALYAN: Yeah, OK.

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:53.760
Sorry, compelling.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.669
I saw this compelling
situation I

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:56.960
think you might have liked, OK.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.390
So, there's a man eating
food out of a garbage bag

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.850
that he had clearly
torn open himself.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.620
And then a dog
ran up and started

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.270
eating out of the same bag.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.744
And the guy didn't mind.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:11.160
Like they were eating the same
food-- the man and the dog.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.920
It was so strange
and disgusting,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.861
but it was also
peaceful, in a way, made

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.610
me feel like we can
just all coexist, even

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.350
in this gruesome way.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.000
BEN: All right,
wrap it up, buddy.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.660
Long story short.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.368
KALYAN: Yeah, OK.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:23.050
Sorry, I'm just--
I'm getting to it.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.090
So this rich looking-woman
approaches, right?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.922
And she grabs the dog
away by the collar,

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:30.130
and yells at it for eating
the food from the garbage.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.210
She says something like,
she says, oh yeah, she says,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.330
Baxter, no.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.070
We don't eat food
from the garbage.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.120
She said, we.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.215
Like Baxter, the dog, and she
eat the same kind of food.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:43.090
But the food from the
garbage was good enough

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.740
for the homeless man.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.230
I just thought it was so sad to
see how human beings can value

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.120
animals over another person,
like another stranger who

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.557
happens to be a human being.

00:01:53.557 --> 00:01:55.890
And I just it might be really
interesting for your film.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.850
BEN: Yeah, all due respect, man.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.801
It's not really
that interesting.

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.550
I mean, I see shit
like that all the time.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.410
And it's kind of cliche to
show like a sad, homeless dude

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.510
eating garbage.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.980
KALYAN: Yeah, it's probably
not the most original thing

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.330
in the world--

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.770
BEN: It's probably the most
un-original thing in the world.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.960
And that's the fucking problem
with these NYU assholes.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.335
You know, it's like they take
a picture of a homeless guy

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.237
and they call it, art.

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:15.070
It's like, fuck you.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.704
That's not art.

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:17.120
Might be art if
you were homeless,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.700
but then you wouldn't be at
fucking NYU now would you.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.955
KALYAN: Yeah, you're right.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:20.520
You're right.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.690
BEN: Yeah, and I'm sorry.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.050
I'm sorry to put that NYU, I
know you're still happy there.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.984
KALYAN: Well, they
didn't kick me out.

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:30.400
BEN: Yeah, well, you're in the
business school, my friend.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.450
It's a much different
pile of shit.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.760
OK, and they didn't
kick me out either.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.030
We had a mutual falling out.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.500
KALYAN: I know you did.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.580
BEN: OK, and the
graduate department

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.910
can suck my shit, because
they didn't know what they

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.030
had on their hands with me.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.290
All right, they didn't know what
to think of me, all right, what

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.350
fucking little box to put me in.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.180
Well guess what?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.290
KALYAN: What?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.790
I know what.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.437
BEN: When my movie comes out, I
will get an honorary Ph.D. OK,

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:46.520
a fucking Ph.D. And don't
think I won't accept it,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.561
because I will accept it.

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:49.214
Yes, yes, I'll
fucking accept it.

00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:50.630
And I'll even make
a classy speech

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.160
and I'll even say, thank
you, and even shake hands

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.080
with those fuck wads.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.910
Because if there's
one thing I've

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.740
learned from my struggling,
it's that the best revenge

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.690
is a life well lived.

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.380
KALYAN: That's very sage.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.080
BEN: Thanks, man.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.780
You want some weed?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.210
KALYAN: No.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.390
BEN: I'm going to smoke
some, nonetheless.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.889
KALYAN: OK.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.980
BEN: Yo.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.850
KALYAN: Mm?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.170
BEN: I had a shitty day, Bunty.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.170
I mean, I mean shitty
compared to my other days,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.600
not compared to world
events or anything.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.550
KALYAN: What happened?

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.200
BEN: So I'm crossing Third
Avenue, and I run into this kid

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.862
that I went to elementary
school with, Ted.

00:03:25.862 --> 00:03:27.070
He said he's getting married.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.625
What a douche bag, right?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:29.574
[SNICKERS]

00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:30.740
KALYAN: I don't know, is he?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.070
All I know is that
he's named Ted

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.950
and that he's getting married.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.896
BEN: Yeah, so he says
to me, he says to me,

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:36.770
can you believe I'm
actually getting married.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.900
He says, can you believe
I'm finally settling down.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.800
So I said, yes I can.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.500
You're a boring Jew-y
douche bag from New Jersey

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.560
who never had a girlfriend.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.690
Of course, I can
you're settling down.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.315
What the fuck else
are you going to do?

00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:46.440
Mow someone's lawn?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.415
KALYAN: I hope you
actually didn't say that.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.654
BEN: No, no, I said,
congratulations.

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:53.820
Yeah, but I was thinking
that pretty loud and clear.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.620
So, message received.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.980
Yeah.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.070
Anyway, Ted got a job
working on Wall Street.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.620
He's some kind of hotshot
fuck or something.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.030
KALYAN: Hey really?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.990
Did you ask him, which firm?

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.300
BEN: Yeah, I asked him
for his whole life story.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.920
We were crossing
the street, Kalyan.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.900
I didn't get into all that shit.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.400
KALYAN: Well, did you ask him
if there was a job opening?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.460
BEN: You don't want to
work on Wall Street.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.020
KALYAN: No Ben, that's
exactly where I want to work.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.010
Why else you think I'm here?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.140
BEN: What.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.010
You're here to learn, OK.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.550
You're here to learn.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.810
And I told you, you
don't need a job.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.590
I don't want rent from you.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.310
Your money's no good here.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.240
KALYAN: I don't
want to rely on you.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.204
I want to pay you rent.

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:16.870
BEN: Fine, then.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.010
I'll ask him if
there's a fucking job.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.899
Man, get off my jock.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.480
He gave me his number.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.010
KALYAN: Fine, if it's a
problem, just let me know.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.280
BEN: No, no, he actually
said-- he actually wanted

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040
to hang out with us, he did.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.690
He said, we should get
together for drinks.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.249
Yeah, dude.

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.790
KALYAN: What?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.410
BEN: Come on, what kind of
bourgeois bullshit is that?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.519
Get together for drinks.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.560
Come on, you never hear
someone in the Democratic

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.100
Republican of the
fucking Congo say,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.406
let's get together for drinks.

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:39.280
KALYAN: Especially
because there's a drought.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.897
BEN: Nah, that's
actually funny man.

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:43.730
You know, your sense
of humor is burgeoning.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.460
KALYAN: Thanks, I
learned from the best.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.630
BEN: I'm the best.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.730
Anyway.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.100
You want to hear the
fucking kicker of it all.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.340
The real salt in the wound
of this whole thing--

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.230
guess who this guy is marrying.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.486
Sarah Newburgh.

00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:01.860
KALYAN: I don't
know who that is.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.240
BEN: What?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.120
She's the first girl I
ever got an erection for,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.078
Sarah fucking Newburgh.

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:07.180
KALYAN: Really, like
your first crush, huh.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.045
BEN: Yeah, yeah, and
it pisses me off.

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:13.090
Ah, if I'm being honest, Bunty,
it really does piss me off.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.500
KALYAN: I know it does, buddy.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.337
BEN: Man, the world is not fair.

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:18.170
Well, you know that.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.210
You're from Nepal.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.060
But-- but it's unfair
here too, sometimes.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.590
I just feel like everything
is so fucked, sometimes.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.610
Sarah was like-- Sarah
was really nice to me.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.984
KALYAN: It's going
to be OK, man.

00:05:30.984 --> 00:05:32.164
BEN: What?

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.330
KALYAN: It's going to be OK.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.163
BEN: Yeah, I-- what?

00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:34.680
I know that.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.280
Dude, I fucking
know-- I know that.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.620
KALYAN: OK.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.690
BEN: Dude, anyway,
she's probably like ugly

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.490
as shit, by now.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.740
She probably turned into her
mother, all hips, no ass,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.323
but she was cute,
if I'm being honest.

00:05:42.323 --> 00:05:43.870
KALYAN: Hey, are
you jealous of Ted?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.130
BEN: Jealous?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.850
KALYAN: Yeah, it's
OK if you are.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.230
I'm jsut--

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.340
BEN: Fuck no.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.880
He's an idiot.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.590
He's a fucking banker.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.080
I'm actually doing
something with my life.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.690
OK, and I don't have time
for some bitch in my ear,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.020
anyway, taking me
away from my work.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.920
KALYAN: Yeah, you're
going to do great things.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.180
BEN: Oh, come on.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.370
Dude, come one.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.960
I'm not saying all
bankers are idiots.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.920
He's a fucking Jewish
banker from New Jersey.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.750
All right, he's a
fucking Shylock,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.510
perpetuating stereotypes
that, frankly, I

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.040
don't need right now.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.160
It's different than
you being in finance.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.560
KALYAN: How is it different
than me being in finance?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.550
BEN: Look, it's kind
of hard to describe,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.390
because you're not from here.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.060
OK, but, if you're born in
the states, and you're white,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.810
and you're (WHISPERING)
fucking Jewish,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.725
and you're middle class, banking
is seen as an easy way out.

00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:10.970
It doesn't have the
nobility that you think.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.110
KALYAN: Wait, I don't think
it's necessarily noble, Ben.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.130
I wouldn't call it noble.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.140
I don't think its any more or
less noble than any other job.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.560
I found it interesting,
and I think it's a good way

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.120
to make a living.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.470
BEN: OK, fine.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.830
But for a Jewish kid
from the suburbs,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.920
and I'm fucking speaking as a
Jewish kid from the suburbs,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.795
it's not interesting.

00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:24.420
And it's a shitty
way to make a living.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.200
OK, look it's like if
I-- hey, it's like,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.575
if I was born in
Nepal, like you,

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.510
OK, and I wanted to be
a Sherpa, or a Gurkha,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.160
or a parka, or whatever,
that would be like-- that

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.270
would be an easy way out.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.580
KALYAN: Gurkhas are considered
the preeminent fighting squad

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.030
in the world.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.600
BEN: I'm sure they're great.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.430
KALYAN: Sherpas can summit
Everest without oxygen.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.690
BEN: Fine.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.920
KALYAN: Parkas keep you
insulated from a cold breeze.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.482
BEN: Uh-huh.

00:06:42.482 --> 00:06:43.190
That's very cute.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.220
OK, that's very-- you're funny.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.700
OK, but what I'm
trying to say is

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.660
that-- I'm trying to
basically not insult you--

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.240
is the fact that you're
from a fucking poor country,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.150
I'm sorry, a poor country,
and you've come to the states

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.030
to study business is
admirable, in a way that,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.196
for a fucking Jew, sorry,
for a Jew from the suburbs

00:06:55.196 --> 00:06:56.027
is predictable.

00:06:56.027 --> 00:06:57.110
KALYAN: What about movies?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.690
BEN: What the fuck about movies?

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.180
KALYAN: You want to make
movies, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.590
You do make movies, right.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.934
Isn't the movie industry
disproportionately Jewish?

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:09.600
BEN: Yes, and I have
two answers for you

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.220
that I've already thought of,
because I think about this shit

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.680
all the time.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.060
OK.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.640
One is that I'm not
going to be some fucking

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.670
rich-casting-couch-like
film executive, OK.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.350
And the other is
that arts and cinema

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.210
can reflect life and
push boundaries in ways

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.620
that moving money around
to make more of it

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.150
will simply never
be able to, OK?

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.900
And I was getting a
degree in film theory.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.090
I'll be making fucking pittance
and I'm perfectly OK with that.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.548
KALYAN: And you could always
borrow money from your father.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.390
BEN: You want a hit?

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.220
KALYAN: Is it still marijuana?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.800
BEN: Yeah.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.300
KALYAN: No.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.580
BEN: My father is a prick, ok?

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.380
Hey, Bunty--

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.574
KALYAN: Yeah.

00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.240
BEN: Yo, Bunty, can
I tell you a secret?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.580
KALYAN: Yeah, of course, please.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.080
BEN: OK.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.820
Wait, have I offended you
with the banking comments?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.130
No, because if I've
offended you, I'm sorry.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.950
But I'm also frankly
uncomfortable moving forward,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.500
if I've offended you.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.020
KALYAN: I'm not offended.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.340
BEN: OK, because I
couldn't live with myself.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.180
I would actually-- I'd fucking
kill myself, in some way,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.830
if I've offended you.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.140
And I can't keep
moving forward thinking

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.450
I've hit an animal in the road.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.820
No, I can't keep driving
forward thinking there's

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.440
a dead animal behind me--

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.260
KALYAN: There's no dead animal.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.200
BEN: Because I think you're
a fucking awesome person.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.075
OK, and the fact that
you are like from Nepal

00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:05.630
and you're studying
business at NYU,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.430
whatever, makes you an awesome
friend and an awesome roommate.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.210
And I am proud as shit
that we know each other.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.060
KALYAN: I'm also proud
of this relationship.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.587
BEN: Yeah?

00:08:15.587 --> 00:08:17.170
You know you're a
stand-up guy, Bunty.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.920
KALYAN: Thanks.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.900
BEN: All right,
here's my secret.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.290
KALYAN: OK.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.915
BEN: Thank you.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.570
OK so, when I was
eight years old,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.660
I had a dream about Sarah
Newburgh, this fuck face's

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.430
new fiance.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.390
KALYAN: Wait, like a sex dream.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.806
BEN: It was more
than a sex dream.

00:08:32.806 --> 00:08:36.162
It was um-- hey, is
it cool if I tell you

00:08:36.162 --> 00:08:37.370
something kind of disgusting.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.470
KALYAN: I think so.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.267
BEN: Are you easily nauseated?

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:43.600
KALYAN: Uh, in Kathmandu, I
had giardia for four months,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.461
so I have a pretty
strong stomach.

00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.460
BEN: Dude, I'm sorry to
hear about your giardia.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.350
KALYAN: It's OK,
It's all cleared up.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.500
BEN: Yeah?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.041
KALYAN: Yeah.

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:49.927
BEN: All right.

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:51.760
So when I was eight
years old, I had a dream

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.330
that I was lying on the floor
of my second grade classroom.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.010
I had pushed the desks
against the wall.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.400
And I had spread newspaper
neatly all over the floor.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.050
And I was lying
on the newspaper.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.940
I was face up and naked.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.924
And-- now here's
the disgusting part,

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.340
I'm kind of
embarrassed to say it.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.030
KALYAN: Go ahead, please.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.150
BEN: Yeah?

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.400
KALYAN: Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.880
BEN: Ok, so Sarah Newburgh
the uh-- well, the presumably

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.670
respectable fiance of the
douche bag I just ran into,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.270
was actually standing over me.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.940
She was straddling my face.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:29.060
She was also naked and well
she was shitting on me.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.180
KALYAN: She was
defecating on you?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.960
BEN: Yeah, on my
face, on my face.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.010
Yeah.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.760
I've got to feel fucking
awful about this.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.700
I'm so mortified.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.220
Oh my god, I've never
told anyone this before.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.900
Do you know what it's like to
go through life with this image

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.899
stuck in your dumb head--
a naked eight-year-old

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.340
girl shitting on your face.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.190
Oh god, hey Bunty, am I awful?

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.614
KALYAN: Let me
think for a moment.

00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:56.280
BEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.155
Take your time buddy.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.470
KALYAN: OK.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.100
Yeah, I mean, I
think if you-- OK,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.721
I think if you had the dream
now and Sarah was still

00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:11.220
the 8-year-old girl, then, yeah,
that would be pretty awful.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.720
Right?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.967
But seeing as you were both
eight at the time of the dream,

00:10:15.967 --> 00:10:17.550
I think it's perfectly
natural to have

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.760
those sorts of tendencies.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.350
I don't think that you
need to be ashamed at all.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.020
And, in fact, in
fact, Ben, I think

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.320
it's very brave that
you admitted it.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.170
BEN: Dude, how do
you always know what

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.150
to say to make me feel better.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.060
KALYAN: I also have another
thought that I think

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.900
might make you feel better.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.066
BEN: Another thought that
might make me feel better?

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.290
Sorry, I fucking love you.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.910
Go ahead.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.890
Sorry.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.090
KALYAN: OK, I think it's very
responsible the way you laid

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.500
out newspaper in your dream.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.660
I think it says a lot
more about your character

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.840
that you laid down
newspaper to protect

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.530
the floor of the classroom and
to catch the fecal matter that,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.860
I take, had missed your face.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.130
Then, it does a part
your sexual deviances.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.380
In fact, I don't think that
you need to be embarrassed

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.680
about that dream, at all.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.490
I think it shows a great
character and an ability

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.670
to love another person despite
their off-putting bodily

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.600
functions.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.400
The fact that she's
doing that on your face

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.575
and you still love her--

00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:19.390
BEN: Yeah.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.125
KALYAN: --is so sweet.

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:24.750
Makes me feel like you're going
to make some other woman really

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.387
happy someday.

00:11:25.387 --> 00:11:26.470
BEN: Who the fuck are you?

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.550
You are the most perfect
person that ever exists.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.000
I've been haunted by
this for 20 years.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.800
KALYAN: Listen to me though Ben.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.570
Having said all of this, I
do have one piece of advice

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.900
that you can either choose
to heed or not to heed.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.030
BEN: Yes, of course,
please advise.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.640
Of course, I'll heed, you
perfect fucking specimen

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.139
of a friend.

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:42.240
KALYAN: If you asked to make a
speech at the upcoming wedding,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.657
I would leave this story out.

00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:47.240
BEN: You are the
best fucking roommate

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.364
I have ever had in my life.

00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:49.160
Do you know that?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.400
Dude, you really fucking are.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.780
And you know what,
oh my god, you

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.279
know what, I would actually
love that Wall Street douche bag

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:57.900
to meet you.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.160
Oh, I would fucking love that.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.030
My crazy Nepalese roommate.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.670
Yo, let's get that fuck
over here for some drinks.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.420
KALYAN: Thank you.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.850
BEN: Thanks so much.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.467
KALYAN: Suck it.

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:12.550
INTERVIEWER: I'm so sorry.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.570
I forgot the [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.590
That's why you should let
real professional actors do

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.155
the heavy lifting.

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:17.050
JESSE: Oh, right, yeah.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.505
KUNAL: Oh, no, no.

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:19.910
It's funny talking about it then
suddenly getting into and doing

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.010
it.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.430
JESSE: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.890
KUNAL: Right?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.710
JESSE: Yeah, strange.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.720
INTERVIEWER: So I had a
chance to see the show--

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.440
JESSE: Oh, great.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.790
INTERVIEWER: --last weekend.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.930
And it was a reception similar
to this, people got it,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.250
they were into it.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.777
And, just overall, it was
just a great experience

00:12:32.777 --> 00:12:34.610
at the theater-- acting,
directing, writing.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.830
And that set is awesome.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.580
JESSE: Oh, thanks.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.502
KUNAL: Oh, thanks.

00:12:37.502 --> 00:12:39.210
INTERVIEWER: So you're
here and thank you

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.990
for coming to Google
this afternoon.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.770
And we'll sort of alternate with
some questions for a little bit

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.269
then ask the gang
if they would like

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:47.850
to step up and ask a couple.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.780
So I'll start from
my left, Jesse,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.010
you're someone now--
you've actually

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.119
got a pretty continuous
career as a playwright.

00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:58.660
This is your third off-Broadway
production, here in New York.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.740
And you act and you write.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.512
And so, for you,
when did you start

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:05.470
feeling like you wanted
to write down the stuff

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.428
that you wanted to act?

00:13:06.428 --> 00:13:09.359
And how you did you get
into that as a craft.

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:11.150
JESSE: I have been
writing for a long time,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.970
but never with the
intention of acting

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.677
in the plays or the other
things that I've written,

00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:16.510
that were not plays.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.940
But I, including
this one, in fact,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.730
I tried to find other actors
to do the part before I did it,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.070
because I just feel a lot
of anxiety doing the show's.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.260
Not because I don't
like performing them,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.330
but I just feel so-- I've just
like the general stage fright

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.040
that people have.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.700
So I try to avoid
acting in them.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.390
But, then it gets
into a point where

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.800
I feel like I'm the only
person who could do it,

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.000
because it's in my mind.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.480
And now that I'm
doing the play with,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.880
this is actually a-- this
play has a cast of five,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.230
Kunal is the other
main character with me.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.590
And now I can't picture
anybody else but him doing it.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.920
So now you end up boxing
yourself in psychologically.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.232
But, I will say,
though an answer

00:14:01.232 --> 00:14:02.690
more specifically
to your question,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.970
partly a lot of the characters
that I write probably

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.970
stem from real things or
maybe even frustrations

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.330
I have as an actor.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.940
Like if I'm playing
in a certain role,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.940
and I don't like the role for
whatever set of reasons that I

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.040
feel comfortable by, maybe
I'll write the opposite

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.297
or the inverse role for a play.

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:23.880
INTERVIEWER: OK,
that's great to know.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.587
And then when you
actually do let it go

00:14:25.587 --> 00:14:27.170
and other companies
pick it up, you'll

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.540
have a chance to see how other
people interpret your work.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.910
JESSE: Yeah, I saw my last
play-- I saw it in actually--

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.820
it was in Israel-- it's
still playing there.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.970
I saw it in Hebrew.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.170
And it was wonderful.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.460
Partly there because of
the language barrier,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.020
I wasn't so critical of
it because I couldn't

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.145
hear what they were saying.

00:14:41.145 --> 00:14:44.290
But it was a nice experience.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.140
INTERVIEWER: And then
now with Kunal, you've

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.700
done a lot of stage
work, actually.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.940
Has it been a while for you
since you've been on stage?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.012
And have you been
in New York before?

00:14:54.012 --> 00:14:57.880
KUNAL: The last play I did
was in 2007, in Los Angeles.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.410
But we shoot Big Bang in
front of live audience,

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.850
so that's every Tuesday night.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.760
So it's not like
I was never having

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.010
been on stage since 2007, I'm
on stage every Tuesday night.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.662
But it's obviously a
different atmosphere.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.870
But, yeah, I mean, being on
that show for eight years

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.912
has really prepped me.

00:15:15.912 --> 00:15:17.370
I thought it would
be the opposite.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.170
I thought I've
been stuck playing

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.640
this one character
for eight years,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.180
will I remember how to do this?

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.487
But I think I was
silly in not realizing

00:15:25.487 --> 00:15:27.570
that I've learned a lot
over the last eight years.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.569
INTERVIEWER: So your
acting muscles were already

00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:30.840
in pretty good shape?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.310
KUNAL: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.480
And not that I've been--
yeah, there was a joke,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.370
and I lost it.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.090
Thinking about heavy
lifting and-- what was it?

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.800
I'm not doing anything or some--

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.020
JESSE: Go through the
details of the joke.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.480
They're funniest.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.980
KUNAL: Jesse writes
my jokes for me.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.520
So, I haven't had time
this morning to prep.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.127
JESSE: Right.

00:15:48.127 --> 00:15:50.460
INTERVIEWER: And you guys
have such an amazing chemistry

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.629
onstage.

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:53.920
What's it been like for you
developing the relationship

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.086
with each other and working?

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:57.740
And what sort of things
do you do for each other

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.137
on stage that make it
all the more fun to do?

00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:03.220
JESSE: I think there's
like a few things happening

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.940
on stage between actors
in plays that don't happen

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.740
in the same way in movies.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.564
Which is that, I think
there's this almost telepathic

00:16:10.564 --> 00:16:12.730
relationship that's occurring
underneath the surface

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.910
of the dialogue in the behavior,
which is-- we are so in tune

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.600
with each other, by virtue of
having done it so many times

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.660
and knowing what each other are
trying to accomplish onstage

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.618
and what we're trying to
accomplish as a group,

00:16:22.618 --> 00:16:28.210
that there's almost this tacit
dialogue that's occurring

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.750
simultaneously with the play.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.462
We know that tonight will be
our 40th show or something,

00:16:34.462 --> 00:16:35.920
and we've rehearsed
for two months.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.619
So we have a sense
of the minute pauses,

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:40.160
I mean, half-second pauses that
we know affect the other guy,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.410
and the other guy doesn't
like that half-second pause.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.930
And that's not something we've
ever articulated explicitly,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.860
but we know that that's
what the other guy's go--

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.318
that's what's going
on in his mind,

00:16:48.318 --> 00:16:50.990
that you end up creating this
really incredible unspoken

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.150
dialogue.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.211
And it's really special.

00:16:55.211 --> 00:16:56.710
KUNAL: And every
night is different.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.730
That's the thing.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.187
You have no idea
what the audience

00:16:59.187 --> 00:17:00.770
is going to bring
on any given night--

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.590
where they're going to laugh,
what they're going to say.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.200
If someone coughs
over a line, you

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.099
have to repeat that information
to set up for another joke.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.609
So you have to be so incredibly
in tune with each other.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.359
Sometimes you drop a
line or sometimes you

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.394
get caught up in
the moment, and you

00:17:13.394 --> 00:17:15.060
do something that is
out of the ordinary

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.290
that you're not used to
and the person on stage,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.415
you have to trust that
they're going to pick it up.

00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:21.250
Sometimes maybe you're
not feeling it, maybe

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.319
not in the moment, and then your
partner just grabs your face

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.610
and looks you in the eye and
then you're back in to it.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.940
There's so much going on
stage and anything can change.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.820
In any given moment,
anything can change.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.560
And that's the beauty
of being blessed

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.085
enough to work with
a talented actor

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:36.140
like Jesse is that you
have complete trust.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.290
Anything can happen.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.050
No matter what happens you have
complete trust that you're not

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.730
going to be left hanging.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.260
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, that's also
the beauty of live theater.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.792
And so, as you've gone
from words on a page

00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:49.500
to working with each
other and a director

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.090
now on stage, what are some
of the things that both of you

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.980
have learned or insights
you've had about either

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.480
the play itself or about
yourself as an actor,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.030
either one of you?

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.540
KUNAL: Go ahead.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.970
JESSE: I feel like acting is
a bit like playing the drums.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.410
It's hard to do it on your own.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.810
And I do feel like the
more practice you get

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.454
at it, the better you become.

00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:12.870
That sounds like
an obvious thing.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.470
But it's-- unfortunately, it's
not-- acting, as a profession,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.500
is not really
thought of that way.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.160
Because you don't necessarily
have to have a degree.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.760
You don't necessarily have
to have specific training.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.250
A lot of times the
most famous people

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.370
that you see in the profession
of acting have never,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.453
are not really good at it.

00:18:24.453 --> 00:18:26.550
Just by virtue of them
being very attractive

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.870
or whatever-- it's just the
nature of the profession.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.600
That's not something
that we deal with.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.807
So, it's an unusual
profession, in that regard.

00:18:34.807 --> 00:18:36.640
And I think getting to
do a play every night

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.223
and rehearsing for
it, you just end up

00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:40.770
getting better at your job
by virtue of doing it a lot.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.610
I guess it's like
the Malcolm Gladwell

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.150
philosophy in that way.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.571
And so, I think we're
getting better in the play.

00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.570
But I think probably even
more importantly we're

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.140
probably getting
better at our job,

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.872
just by virtue of doing it.

00:18:53.872 --> 00:18:55.580
INTERVIEWER: That's
always great to hear.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.538
And it's also, because
you're putting something

00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:00.200
into something that you
love you get stuff back,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.240
which is a really cool.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.890
JESSE: That's right.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.723
INTERVIEWER: So yes.

00:19:02.723 --> 00:19:05.190
And you have an MFA,
actually, so you've done

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.572
some serious acting training.

00:19:06.572 --> 00:19:08.280
So what are the sort
of things that you'd

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.160
like to continue to
work on and accomplish

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.076
and what are the things
that you feel like you

00:19:12.076 --> 00:19:13.780
bring to a role like this?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.920
KUNAL: I think its-- grad
school really taught me

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.970
how to prepare.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.540
I think that's something that
you don't-- it's hard sometimes

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.472
to realize how to break
down a script and prepare.

00:19:22.472 --> 00:19:24.930
Oftentimes, actors will just
show up to the first rehearsal

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.513
without having thought
about it a lot.

00:19:26.513 --> 00:19:29.400
And that's fine, and then
they'll still be incredible.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.310
But, for me, I really
have to take the time

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.020
to be meticulous about
every single beat

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.436
and try to think
about everything.

00:19:34.436 --> 00:19:37.530
And try to create every moment,
so that when I do rehearse

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.320
I'm not thinking about
what I have to say next.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.150
I'm just saying
it in the moment.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.830
And I think that's what grad
school really taught me is,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.250
if you don't know your lines
or if you feel ill-prepared

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.310
then you're doing the
work in rehearsal.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.860
You're not really
doing the work.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.900
You're working on it by
yourself in rehearsal

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.650
as opposed to just
being present and being

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.040
there for you're partners or
being there for the director.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.460
And I think that's what going
through a rigorous program

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.620
really teaches you
is how to prepare.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.828
INTERVIEWER: And I think
that's really important too.

00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:07.799
So and you've both
now-- you do work a lot.

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:10.090
You're committed to your
craft, which is a great thing.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.990
And you add to, I guess,
your quiver full of talents

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.390
as you move on to
the next thing.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.980
So, this show has
been wonderful.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.230
What sort of things are you
thinking about doing next,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.570
for both of you?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.620
KUNAL: I have to go back
to Season 9 in August.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.990
So, I don't have much
opportunity to think about.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.780
I have a book coming out
September 15th about my journey

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.590
from New Delhi to Los Angeles
called, Yes, My Accent is Real.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.720
And I'm competing,
unfortunately,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.397
against Jesse's book that comes
out on September 15th, as well.

00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:48.230
What is that called?

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.771
JESSE: It's called,
my accent's fake.

00:20:54.707 --> 00:20:56.540
INTERVIEWER: So tell
us both about the book.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.650
Because when you have
something-- obviously

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.150
people here are going to want
to read the book-- so, tell us

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.740
the real title, and the
publisher, and about

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.760
when it's coming out.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.010
JESSE: Do you want to finish--

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.051
KUNAL: Oh, yeah, my book,
Yes, My Accent is Real,

00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:14.990
it's about my journey from Delhi
to LA, and growing up in India,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.200
and a lot of fun stuff.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.380
And it's Atria,
Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.474
It's out September 15th.

00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:21.140
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.060
JESSE: My book is,
actually, it's called,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.740
Bream Gives Me Hiccups.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.710
It's a collection
of short stories.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.751
Some have been published in
the New Yorker, McSweeney's,

00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:31.750
in the Shouts and Murmurs
section of New Yorker.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.820
And it's coming out, Grove
Atlantic, in September.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.229
And yeah, it's like short humor.

00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:42.520
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I love
the essays in The New Yorker.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.930
JESSE: Oh, thanks.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.054
INTERVIEWER: Those are fun.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:47.060
They're actually-- it's in some
ways, you're, in many ways,

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.140
like a classic New York writer.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.830
Because you act, you write, you
have stuff in The New Yorker,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.797
you show up and you
do interesting things.

00:21:53.797 --> 00:21:55.630
Is that something-- I
guess, it is something

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.732
that clearly feeds you.

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:57.690
JESSE: Yeah, I like it.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.200
I haven't set out to copy
that particular path, which

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.690
I think we can read as Jewish.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.270
But I like all those things.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.240
Yeah, there's probably some,
let's say, cultural glue that

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.650
binds those things together.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.754
But, I like them for
separate reasons.

00:22:16.754 --> 00:22:18.420
So the next thing I'm
doing, in a month,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.970
I start Woody
Allen's next movie.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.010
And so, I guess they're--
so it seems almost like

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.980
as an outsider, in retrospect--
like obviously all linked

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.840
to each other.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.450
But I like doing these
things for different reasons.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.862
And I feel like when we're
onstage, it feels more like,

00:22:34.862 --> 00:22:37.320
I don't know, it feels like
we're like in a wrestling match

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.861
onstage, or something,
it's this very

00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:41.514
visceral, emotional,
cathartic experience on stage.

00:22:41.514 --> 00:22:43.680
Like what you just saw is
the beginning of the play,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.020
but the play becomes
a very dark play.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.780
As you can see in
the opening, there's

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.730
some elements underneath
lurking that feel dangerous.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.450
It doesn't feel
like I'm performing

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.310
a light, witty thing.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.450
It feels like this
very visceral thing.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.960
So I don't see the
connection as much

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.107
between writing humor
for The New Yorker

00:23:02.107 --> 00:23:03.690
and performing this
thing, which feels

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.260
like a UFC fight or something.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:05.840
Doesn't it?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.180
KUNAL: Yeah, it's exhausting.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.680
It is.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.096
I hope you guys
come see the play.

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:13.020
It's rare to find an actor who
can write as well as Jesse.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.820
And so while it's on, I think
it's a great opportunity

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.880
to see the future of the
Jewish industry that--

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.067
JESSE: I tell you, we're
about to take over--

00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:26.650
not just entertainment, but some
parts of law and Wall Street.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.370
INTERVIEWER: Well, it
is such a good show.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.520
And it makes me happy,
as a theater goer,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.020
to see a piece that's
overall that strong,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.150
which makes-- it's
just sometimes

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.232
when you go to the
theater, you go, oh,

00:23:39.232 --> 00:23:41.440
we're just not going to look
at that actor that much.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.270
Or, oh man, I wish the
door hadn't fallen off,

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.949
and stuff like.

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:45.990
JESSE: Our doors stay on.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.167
KUNAL: Our doors-- yeah.

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:48.250
INTERVIEWER: There you go.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.160
KUNAL: It's come-- it's not
been hinged fully sometimes.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.020
It's come apart.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.160
INTERVIEWER: So you had
some issues with the broom

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.710
last week.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.300
JESSE: Oh, you
were at that show?

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:54.820
KUNAL: You were at that show?

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.445
JESSE: Oh, god.

00:23:55.445 --> 00:23:57.099
Fucking-- that was
one performance--

00:23:57.099 --> 00:23:58.890
KUNAL: Literally, the
one before the broom,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.931
it just kept falling out.

00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:02.190
I just-- I took it off stage
and I threw in backstage.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.210
I was like--

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.947
INTERVIEWER: But
you dealt with it.

00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:04.700
You dealt with it in
the moment as you would.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.200
You just picked it up and said,
oh, it's not staying there--

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.390
KUNAL: I was just Kunal,
being like, fuck it.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.202
JESSE: Yeah.

00:24:10.202 --> 00:24:12.390
I think Olivia did the
same thing, didn't it?

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.011
KUNAL: Yeah.

00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:15.372
Just me and Olivia.

00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:16.830
INTERVIEWER: So if
you want, people

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.961
can start heading up
to the microphones.

00:24:18.961 --> 00:24:19.460
We have--

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.970
KUNAL: Yes, ask questions.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:20.920
INTERVIEWER: --one
on either side.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.480
KUNAL: Please, ask us anything.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.370
INTERVIEWER: And know
we have some folks here

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.940
who are huge fans
of the both of you.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.300
And you get to head back to this
really, really funny show very

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.830
soon and that people here,
as I'm sure you can imagine,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.870
they quote it religiously,
and often wear the t-shirts.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.580
KUNAL: Oh, yeah.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.705
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

00:24:38.705 --> 00:24:39.956
KUNAL: Not creepy at all.

00:24:39.956 --> 00:24:40.300
INTERVIEWER: So, if anybody--

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.900
JESSE: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.290
KUNAL: No, I'm joking.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.665
INTERVIEWER:
--would like to make

00:24:42.665 --> 00:24:44.420
their way to the microphone.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.399
We can have a couple minutes
of cha-- look there's, good,

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:48.440
there's people actually--

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.020
KUNAL: Yeah, yeah, ask
don't be shy, please.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.200
Shout it out if you
don't use the mike.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.700
I mean--

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, there, yeah.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.943
So, I'm just-- this is
for both of you guys.

00:24:54.943 --> 00:24:57.240
I'm wondering is there any
sort of connecting thread

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.810
that you guys have noticed
between the types of characters

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.290
that you most
enjoy playing, when

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.498
you get those sorts of roles?

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:05.550
KUNAL: You want to?

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.925
JESSE: I mean, I like-- I
usu-- I mean the characters

00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:10.300
I've written for--this is my
third play to be done in New

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.740
York and the
characters, I guess,

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.460
are all considered
despicable people.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.980
But I-- that seems to me the
most interesting thing to play.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.950
Because then the
job is to humanize

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.200
these people that are otherwise
doing horrible things.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.760
I mean, the play, the
guy becomes really

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.385
off the rails towards the end of
the play, of what we just did.

00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:27.730
And yeah, to me,
that's exhilarating.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.570
Because then my job is to
humanize them in the same way

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.820
that if somebody is a
terrible person in real life,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.060
if you ask them, they'll
defend themselves

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.960
and they'll have some kind of
emotional reason for doing--

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.550
for behaving that way.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.225
KUNAL: Yeah, I mean, I tend
to, oftentimes, get cast

00:25:43.225 --> 00:25:45.482
as the sweet,
innocent, naive guy.

00:25:45.482 --> 00:25:46.190
INTERVIEWER: Huh.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.860
JESSE: But, in this play--

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.670
KUNAL: But in this play--

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.544
JESSE: Talk about it.

00:25:48.544 --> 00:25:50.516
KUNAL: Exactly, but in
this play this character

00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:52.640
is very, when you see the
whole play you'll realize

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.870
that this character's grounded.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.140
He's a very much a grounded
guy, which is rare for me.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.780
And I'm lucky to have an
opportunity to actually play

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.090
someone would some gravitas.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.090
JESSE: In all the ways
he pacifiers my character

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.506
in this first
scene, which he does

00:26:05.506 --> 00:26:08.460
in a kind of submissive way,
all kind of come around.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.810
He kind of grows up in the play.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.974
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:11.974 --> 00:26:13.390
INTERVIEWER: You
got anybody else?

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.040
Yes.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.150
AUDIENCE: Over the
course of your acting,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.070
both your acting careers, you've
met really incredible people.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.140
And I'm so admire
both your works.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.410
I love Big Bang
Theory and I watch

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.800
a lot of your movies, Jesse.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.200
And so I was wondering
what celebrities

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.710
that you've met, that you
just really admire, as well.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.867
And what was the funniest
interaction with any celebrity?

00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:34.950
KUNAL: I met Jesse Eisenberg
about two months ago.

00:26:37.572 --> 00:26:38.510
Yeah, that was funny?

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.710
JESSE: It was really funny.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:39.416
Tell them what happened.

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.590
Tell them exactly what happened.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.300
Tell them what happened.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.170
KUNAL: So, Jesse--

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.126
JESSE: No, nothing happened.

00:26:44.126 --> 00:26:46.000
KUNAL: Like, is there
a story there I forgot?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.260
JESSE: No, no, no.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.650
KUNAL: I remember meeting
Stephen Hawking when

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.460
he was going to be on Big Bang.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.310
He came to set to
watch a run-through.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.920
And, obviously, it's quite a
sight to spend time with him.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.740
Obviously, it can be
just-- of his state

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.200
and also of who he is.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.540
And so, it was just amazing
being in its presence.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.620
And he watched the run-through
and in the run-through

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.270
Simon Helberg is actually
making fun of Stephen Hawking

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.690
and doing his voice.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.440
JESSE: Oh, really.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.990
KUNAL: Yeah.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.400
And I'm like-- and we're
doing this run-through,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.150
and I just looked
at Stephen Hawking.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.740
And Stephen Hawking was smiling.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.824
And he loved it.

00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:22.490
But he loved it.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.890
But he went home and
read the script again.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.181
And now he's come on our show
like three or four times.

00:27:26.181 --> 00:27:28.370
So it's really cool to meet him.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.970
We got to meet
Leonard Nimoy, too.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.511
All the people that
you would imagine

00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:33.850
would be on The Big Bang
Theory, that was fun.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.190
What about you?

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.247
Tell them about when
you met George Clooney.

00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:38.330
JESSE: Oh, my god, George.

00:27:40.287 --> 00:27:41.870
(FANATIC VOICE) I'm
rarely tongue-tied

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.280
tied but, no-- (NORMAL VOICE)
Well, it's interesting to see,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.070
for me to see the
people who seem

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.420
to be at the kind of
most accomplished point

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.780
in their lives, or careers, or
artistic achievements who are

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.250
still really worried about it.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.310
So the last play I did the main
actress was Vanessa Redgrave.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.820
She's like 76 years old,
77 years old, at the time.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.710
And she was in the
theater like every day

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.250
4 o'clock for an 8 o'clock
show, pouring over her script.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.811
OK?

00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:11.310
No, but it's just
amazing you think,

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.330
here this woman doesn't-- this
woman is finished accomplishing

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.930
anything that anybody
could accomplish something,

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.680
not because of her age, just
because of her achievements.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.130
And she still really
worried about the play.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.920
We did, let's say, 90 shows
or something, the 89th show,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.270
she's sitting
backstage panicked.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.542
And that's, to me, is like
the most impressive thing,

00:28:28.542 --> 00:28:31.000
that somebody is still worried
about it, which tells me, A)

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.190
it's OK to worry about
doing a good job.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.930
That doesn't mean
you're not going

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.471
to do a good job probably means
you're going to a better job.

00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:38.910
And B) that there's no
point that you reach

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.970
that you can become complacent.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.280
And I think that it transcends
industry, and talent,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280
and achievement.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.890
That's I think the life
lesson that I took from that.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.348
KUNAL: We're always scared
we're never going to work again.

00:28:50.348 --> 00:28:51.480
I mean, seriously.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.430
Its' weird being an
actor, because you never

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.100
know where your next paycheck
is going to come from.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.650
But you know what I mean.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.730
AUDIENCE: On Big Bang
Theory, you're kind of--

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.340
KUNAL: But you know what I mean.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.090
JESSE: Yeah, yeah but
more than just fears

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.680
of industrial collapse,
more the fears of just,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.710
I want to do good for myself
even if it's for 17 people are

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.710
in the audience tonight.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.970
You want to do
good for yourself.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.750
If no one's in the audience, you
want to do good for yourself.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.410
And that's, I think
probably the biggest thing.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.912
And then all this other stuff
like the money, or success,

00:29:20.912 --> 00:29:23.120
or whatever that probably
will follow if you're doing

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.540
all those other things well.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.880
AUDIENCE: What's the
funniest gaff that you've

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.640
done, either on a movie set,
or during a play, or anything.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.500
JESSE: We don't do that.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.850
INTERVIEWER: KUNAL: Yeah, we're
very serious about everything.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.266
JESSE: Every single
night perfect.

00:29:35.266 --> 00:29:36.120
Yeah.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.376
One time I thought we'd
screw up, but then that--

00:29:40.564 --> 00:29:41.730
INTERVIEWER: Thanks so much.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.890
JESSE: Thanks.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.760
AUDIENCE: It's always
incredible to see

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.260
you working artists and then
diversified working artists,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.629
like you both write.

00:29:50.629 --> 00:29:52.670
You're doing a serial,
you're in all these movies

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.330
simultaneously.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.070
I guess the one
thing that always

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.310
baffles me is how do
you deal with burnout?

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.930
Like what is your
schedule, and how

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.920
do you even start to
fight potential burnout?

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.340
And how do you keep
everything aligned

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.000
so that you can stay
focused moving from task,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.130
to task, to task that you
either are recruited for

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.340
or you just kind of
creating yourselves.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.222
JESSE: We get 20% of
our week time off.

00:30:17.222 --> 00:30:17.955
Google joke.

00:30:21.334 --> 00:30:22.265
What they get here.

00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:22.550
KUNAL: Really?

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.280
JESSE: They all get 20%, yeah.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:23.730
They--

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:24.106
KUNAL: They get, what?

00:30:24.106 --> 00:30:24.650
20% what?

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.110
JESSE: 20% of their jobs,
they get to work on--

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.068
KUNAL: You guys hiring?

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:30.900
Burnout.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.390
JESSE: Burnout is like-- the
luckiest actor in the world

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.480
gets burnout.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.320
Because typically you're not
working as much as it seems.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.840
We're in a very public thing.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.660
So I pass the subway every day
and there's pictures of Kunal

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.370
for his show.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.400
But I know he has nothing to do
with it for these three months.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.340
And similarly, I'm in a poster
that's coming out, or whatever.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.390
But I did that movie
a year and a half ago.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.900
So I think the
nature of our jobs

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.001
makes it look like we are
probably working more than--

00:30:56.001 --> 00:30:56.500
KUNAL: Yes.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.140
JESSE: --than we actually are.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.170
KUNAL: We have downtime
in between our projects.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.785
But there are times
when you feel exhausted.

00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:03.910
And then you sleep and you
wake up the next morning

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.640
and you're fine.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.097
Like all of us, seriously,
what are you going to do?

00:31:08.097 --> 00:31:09.930
What are you going to
do with your ambition?

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.000
What's burnout?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.500
Seriously?

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.250
What are you going to-- what
do you do with your ambition?

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.833
You can't do anything with it,
you have to just keep reaching.

00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:21.400
And so I don't-- burnout is
not a word in my vocabulary.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.109
No, but seri-- I don't
know why I said that.

00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:26.150
JESSE: It's just because
you don't know the word.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.930
KUNAL: Yeah.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.400
It's because I don't actually
understand English that well.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.830
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.140
JESSE: Thank you very much.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.370
INTERVIEWER: And we
have one more over here.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.530
AUDIENCE: All right, so
thanks for coming, guys.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.220
This question is more for Jesse.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.920
And it's sort of
off topic, so feel

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.730
free to punt on it if you want.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.590
But given your involvement
in The Social Network,

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.260
and given the fact that
you're here, and also given--

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.161
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:49.161 --> 00:31:51.660
AUDIENCE: I guess, yeah, that's
kind of what I'm getting at.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.565
Is there's a bit of
a common theme there.

00:31:53.565 --> 00:31:53.750
Right?

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.416
But also looking at
some of the opinions

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:58.060
that were apparent in the
opening scene on the banking

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.050
industry or whatever.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.090
Do you have any specific
opinions on how Google sits,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.680
right now?

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.600
JESSE: Oh, right, right.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.032
AUDIENCE: In the world could
there be a play in the future

00:32:08.032 --> 00:32:09.740
that involves maybe
some of these walls--

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.590
JESSE: Right, no, no,
honestly, not at all.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.580
No, I mean, I know
really nothing

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.780
about any of those industries.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.170
My character, though,
also knows nothing.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.660
He is a guy who
demonizes banking

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.286
because he's jealous of
anybody having a job.

00:32:26.286 --> 00:32:28.160
And he runs into this
guy in the street who's

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160
marrying this girl he likes.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.580
So that's where that comes from.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.792
I know nothing about
those industries.

00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:36.250
Acting in a movie, playing a
guy who knows about computers,

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.083
is really just that.

00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:38.595
It's the same as
probably the actors

00:32:38.595 --> 00:32:39.970
who were in Jurassic
Park knowing

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.000
about Tyrannosaurus Rex's and--

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.700
AUDIENCE: That's
a good comparison.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.900
JESSE: They probably
very little.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.358
KUNAL: Or playing
an astrophysicist

00:32:45.358 --> 00:32:46.610
who knows shit about anything.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.024
Yeah.

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:50.190
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.180
JESSE: But I don't know you
guys seem like the smartest

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.263
people on earth work here.

00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:55.127
So, I'm sure you guys
will do good things.

00:32:55.127 --> 00:32:57.710
And be-- I mean, I don't know,
I mean, so my opinion of Google

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.699
is that seems like it's being
populated by the greatest

00:33:01.699 --> 00:33:02.490
minds in the world.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.160
So, I guess, that's wonderful.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.650
I don't know on the corporate
side, what they're doing,

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.483
maybe it's horrible.

00:33:09.178 --> 00:33:11.854
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:33:11.854 --> 00:33:13.770
So we'll go along with
that, that the greatest

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.115
minds work here.

00:33:16.115 --> 00:33:18.240
OK, so we have one here,
and then one last question

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.419
to wrap it up.

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:21.460
AUDIENCE: This is, I guess,
especially for Jesse.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.240
You seem pretty into your craft.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.810
Where would you like to see
yourself in 20 years, to say,

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.760
I've had a good career or
what would make you happy?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.740
What are you aiming for?

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.320
JESSE: Yeah.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.580
AUDIENCE: It seems like
that's something you'd--

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.079
JESSE: I just, I
want to do it more.

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:39.890
I can't-- this play that we're
doing now is just like came

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.837
from like a flurry of like
thoughts and bad the emotions

00:33:43.837 --> 00:33:44.670
and stuff like that.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.959
And so like I don't have
any kind of real discipline.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:49.000
That's what I would like.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.060
I write a lot.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.420
But I don't have the discipline.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.669
I want to be able to A)
develop some discipline and B)

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:54.740
be able to maintain it.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.100
And I don't have that now.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.169
I've been very prolific.

00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:58.710
I'm also-- I have
the great advantage

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.180
of being a known actor, so
people will publish my books

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.447
and plays.

00:34:02.447 --> 00:34:04.530
They're probably on par
with the other things that

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.520
are being published,
but they probably

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.910
get to the top of the pile
a little more quickly.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.770
So I'd like to be able
to continue working

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.185
and that's my goal.

00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:13.184
AUDIENCE: So I have two.

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:15.400
If you have time for
only one, that's fine.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.989
So, 1) taking a step back, I'm
curious when, in your lives

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:23.690
or at what age was like a
turning point or an aha moment

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.719
where you realized you
wanted to be an actor

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.710
or realized you were
different from everyone else.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.989
And you wanted to pursue that.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.840
Was there a mentor?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.800
How did that develop?

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.960
And then curious
about the future,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.600
also, so being at
Google and thinking

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.320
about the future of media
consumption, and theater,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.690
and entertainment, YouTube, and
in person, online digital era,

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.920
where do you see the
future of your careers

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.120
acting careers, entertainment
TV careers, movies.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.699
What do you think about that?

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.440
JESSE: Well, I think about the
second question all the time.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.630
KUNAL: Yeah, me too.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.130
JESSE: I do feel like I'm
in a very, very fortunate

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.380
but ultimately
unsustainable place.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.020
As an actor who is able
to make money and be

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.500
successful in the way I am.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.690
I really feel like
it's unsustainable,

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.648
because it seems like
entertainment is becoming

00:35:12.648 --> 00:35:15.194
diversified in such a way that
being in the big movie that

00:35:15.194 --> 00:35:16.610
comes out that
weekend or whatever

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.990
seems to be-- it's
still holding on,

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.627
but it seems to be like
the past, in my opinion.

00:35:21.627 --> 00:35:24.210
KUNAL: But at the same time, if
you were to do an independent,

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.668
like a small
independent movie that

00:35:25.668 --> 00:35:28.020
also could have more legs
because of the digital age.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.554
Correct?

00:35:28.554 --> 00:35:29.970
JESSE: Yes, possibly
but it's big.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.810
There are so many--
just by virtue

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:32.790
of that being cheaper
to make-- there

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.160
will be a lot more of those
competing with each other.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.960
Right now, we're
doing this play,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.987
we're both very successful
actors like in financial--

00:35:40.987 --> 00:35:42.070
AUDIENCE: And very modest.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.760
JESSE: What's that?

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.740
No, no, no, but I have to
preface it by saying that,

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.010
so this is not a complaint.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.052
But we make like
$400 a week doing

00:35:51.052 --> 00:35:53.260
this play, which is the most
exhausting thing that we

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.420
do in our careers.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.590
So there's no correlation really
between like effort and money--

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.500
KUNAL: Money.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.259
JESSE: --like in our
business, it seems.

00:36:04.259 --> 00:36:06.300
The thing that I make the
most money from usually

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.290
are the easier things,
where you're on a set,

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.320
and you get a nice
trailer, everything.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.820
AUDIENCE: That's
really interesting.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.620
JESSE: So I don't
see the future of my

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.720
what I'm actually very
interested in being

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.394
economically sustainable.

00:36:19.394 --> 00:36:21.060
And that might have
more to do with what

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.390
I'm interested in, which
is of these smaller things

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.563
than what the
industry's going to do.

00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:26.896
Do you have an opinion about it?

00:36:26.896 --> 00:36:28.280
KUNAL: Yeah, no, I agree.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.310
Doing theater is exhausting.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.740
But you get nothing
to do it, but it's

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.860
fulfilling as an artist.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.280
But it's exhausting.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.370
And I just think
everything's going digital.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.070
Everything is.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.920
And as much as you
want to be, hey, I

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.824
want to preserve these things.

00:36:43.824 --> 00:36:45.490
But why do we want
to preserve anything?

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.710
If it's going to
digital, that's great.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:49.120
It gives a lot more people
who have a lot more talent

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.560
to be discovered, as well.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:50.720
JESSE: That's true.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.450
Except I do think they will
be, like everything there's

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.360
pendulum shifts, so I
do think the backlash

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.110
to everybody looking
at the telephones

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.180
to get their entertainment
may be in theaters

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.500
favor in a few years time.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.886
We'll all be rushing to where
we want to see real people.

00:37:04.886 --> 00:37:06.010
There may be that backlash.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.531
I hope so.

00:37:06.531 --> 00:37:08.780
INTERVIEWER: I hope theater's
not going away anywhere.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.450
And one of things
that you guys have.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.570
And it is when you're being
pragmatic and assessing

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.280
yourself as successful it's
because you have the capacity

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.190
to do one thing that
another of one thing

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.360
allows you to do other.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.151
JESSE: That's true.

00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:22.360
INTERVIEWER: And also
that the more experience

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.710
you acquire and, frankly, the
more influence the more people

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.260
you can bring along after you.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:27.440
JESSE: Absolutely.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.730
INTERVIEWER: And that's
an important part

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:29.640
of being an artist.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.160
JESSE: Yeah, that's true.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.952
Thanks, Kathleen.

00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:31.660
KUNAL: Thank you.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.340
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.110
Well, gang this
has been wonderful.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.130
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:36.430
KUNAL: Thanks guys
so much for coming.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.880
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you, Jesse and Kunal.
