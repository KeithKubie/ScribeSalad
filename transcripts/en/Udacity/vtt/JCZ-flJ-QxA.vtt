00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.439
One area of genetic research that psychologists are really interested in these

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.533
days is Epigenetics. Simply put, epigenetics is interested in the heritable

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:12.223
change caused by the environment. In other words, how the environment affects

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:14.770
if our genes are turned on or off.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right, Lauren. Epigenetics is a really new and exciting field of

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:21.060
genetics that's teaching us a lot about how the environment influences gene

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.870
expression. Now it's really important to remember, that this is not mutation.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.080
The genetic sequence is unchanged. What's happening is the environment is

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.930
physically modifying the DNA, in a way that shuts a gene on or off.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So how does that work?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.810
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, you can think about it like chemicals that you take in from your local

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.130
environment.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.470
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, by chemicals, do you mean things like diet, or even chemical exposure?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure, like that. Even things like exercise and metabolism can produce these

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.000
basic factors too. And these factors, or chemicals, physically modify the DNA

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.770
independent of the genetic sequence, and this will determine whether or not a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.150
gene can be read.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.340
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So these modifications make genes a product of both nature.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.480
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, the genetic sequence itself.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And nurture.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.550
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, the epigentic or environmental influence.
