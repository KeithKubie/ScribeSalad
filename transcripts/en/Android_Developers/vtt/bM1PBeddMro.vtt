ANKUR KOTWAL: Welcome to part
two of the DevBytes series

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.060
Making Apps Beautiful.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.230
In this part we're going to
focus on the spacing and the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.450
typography of the list item, as
well as the detail view to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.390
make it look more beautiful.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200
So let's just switch to our
phone to see where we were up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.930
to at the end of
the last part.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.480
And we've modernized the app and
had an action bar, gotten

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.310
rid of the virtual navigation
menu button,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.680
the legacy menu button.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.170
But we look at this, and the
text isn't particularly

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.705
well-formatted.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.260
The images are an inconsistent
size.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.430
When we go into the detailed
view, the text is going from

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.690
edge to edge.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
There's still some glaring
problems from a design point

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.150
of view, and that's what
we're going to look at

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.710
fixing up in this part.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.850
So let's go back to the slides,
and let's see what

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.440
we're going to try
and achieve.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.710
The first thing we want to do
is have a consistent set of

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.970
heights for each of
our list items.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.110
So we're using a 48dp rhythm,
as per the Android design

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.070
guidelines.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.560
So if we look at where we are
now, this is actually what we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.470
want to be.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.720
So when we look at these slides
now, you see that the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.860
list items are really nicely
spaced out, and we've got some

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.970
margins on either side of the
detailed view, as well.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.810
So let's look at how
we do that in code.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.940
So switching over to code,
we've specified a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.190
dimension.xml file.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.970
We want to abstract out the
values that we're using as

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.960
much as possible.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.110
So we've got an 8dp vertical
margin, which just basically

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.800
means that on the text views
we're going to have an 8dp

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.350
margin above and below.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.880
And so the way we're going
to do that is in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.410
this list item article.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.810
In our linear layout that
contains our text views we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.670
have this margin top and margin
bottom defined with our

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.500
list item vertical margin.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.330
In the detail view for the
fragment, we are also going to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.440
use a margin left and a margin
right, and we're going to use

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.540
that detailed horizontal
margin.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.800
And that's what's going to give
us the spacing on either

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.900
side of that detailed view.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.650
So switching back to the slides,
and you can see the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.580
spacing that we're after.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.760
What we want to do is once we've
put those dimensions in,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.060
we also want to now fix up the
spacing with the thumbnails.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.660
And basically, what we want to
do here is eliminate that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.800
inconsistency that we have from
thumbnail to thumbnail.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.540
The way we're going to do that
is use the center crop

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.100
attribute on the image view
and set the scale type, so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.160
that way it's nice and
consistent from

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.660
each image to image.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.940
The next thing we want to do
is focus on the typography.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.730
So if you look at the image
on the left, the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.350
fonts, they're OK.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.900
They're not particularly
attractive.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.360
You can see very much on the
right-hand side that we've

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.690
paid a lot of attention to
detail there and made some

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.860
really good changes.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.390
So let's look at what
we did there.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.160
We're going to look at the
two main text views.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.680
The top one is the title
and then the subtitle

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830
in each list item.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.420
So you'll see that we've used
a condensed font and made it

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.530
bold for the title.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.120
For the subtitle, we've actually
changed the color of

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560
the text so that it
contrasts less.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.590
And you may want to abstract
that out, too.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.790
And we've also made
it all caps.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.840
The other thing you want to look
at is the fact that with

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.980
both of these we've actually
fixed the number of lines.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.370
And we've used this property
called ellipse size, which

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.140
will basically truncate the text
and put dot dot dot if

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.070
it's going past that maximum
line specification.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.170
So it's just presented in a
nice, consistent manner from

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.090
item to item.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.290
So if we now look at the detail
page, the other thing

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.650
that we want to do is make the
author stand out a lot more.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.390
And what we're going to do is
use this property called text

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.360
color link.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.130
That text color link is actually
a property on the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.110
text view, and we've just
used this bacon color.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.700
Again, on the text views, all
you do is add that one

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.960
property and your links
will stand out.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.060
But that also means that we need
to make that author at

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.330
that top subtitle
a link, as well.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.740
So the way we're doing that is--
actually, for that part,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.490
we're doing it programmatically
where on

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.010
create view we go and fetch
the font color.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.290
And when we're going to put the
author in that text view,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.190
we just put some HTML on either
side to specify the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.280
font color.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.990
The other thing that we'll see
that we're doing here is that

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.520
for the article body, as well,
where we're using a custom

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.010
font that we've shipped
with our APK.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.950
So just getting to
our checkpoint.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.760
If you see on the left-hand
side, that's where we started.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.960
We've come a long way.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.060
It's a really beautiful
app on phones, now.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.460
So join me for the next part
for focusing on tablets.
