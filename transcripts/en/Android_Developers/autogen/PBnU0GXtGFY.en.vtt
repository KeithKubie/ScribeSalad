we realized well it doesn't really make
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.890
we realized well it doesn't really make
much sense on how to scale our app if we

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
much sense on how to scale our app if we
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510

mobile well so what do we do we realized

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
mobile well so what do we do we realized
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600
mobile well so what do we do we realized
that this was not going to scale and we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
that this was not going to scale and we
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.800
that this was not going to scale and we
started building a bunch of this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
started building a bunch of this
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080
started building a bunch of this
experiences on mobile and as we finished

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
experiences on mobile and as we finished
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539
experiences on mobile and as we finished
building them we transition the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
building them we transition the
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.050
building them we transition the
ownership to each of the product teams

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060
ownership to each of the product teams
 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.440
ownership to each of the product teams
we continue doing so and as of today we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
we continue doing so and as of today we
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210

engineering or engineering science and
culture but let's look at it from the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
culture but let's look at it from the
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.089
culture but let's look at it from the
other point of view our users as of

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099
other point of view our users as of
 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.759

conditions you guys know about the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
conditions you guys know about the
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.500
conditions you guys know about the
Android fragmentation problem it's a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
Android fragmentation problem it's a
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.780
Android fragmentation problem it's a
benefit but also it's an interesting

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
benefit but also it's an interesting
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.820
benefit but also it's an interesting
challenge that means that there are lots

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
challenge that means that there are lots
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.449
challenge that means that there are lots
of people in the world that our Cape are

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
of people in the world that our Cape are
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.720
of people in the world that our Cape are
able to have internet connected devices

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
able to have internet connected devices
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.330
able to have internet connected devices
now and because of this we're building

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
now and because of this we're building
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.280
now and because of this we're building

building the application that allows

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
building the application that allows
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500
building the application that allows
them to connect to with the world and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
them to connect to with the world and
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.820

coming injected into the Android
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.150
coming injected into the Android
ecosystem and they're not gonna have

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
ecosystem and they're not gonna have
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.470
ecosystem and they're not gonna have
phones like the ones we have in our

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
phones like the ones we have in our
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.590
phones like the ones we have in our
pockets they're gonna have phones that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600
pockets they're gonna have phones that
 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.650
pockets they're gonna have phones that
we're probably have have them the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
we're probably have have them the
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.170
we're probably have have them the
hardware set that back in probably like

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
hardware set that back in probably like
 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.729

three years ago where the newest phone
so we have so we have a lot of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480
so we have so we have a lot of
 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.360
so we have so we have a lot of
interesting engineering challenges to

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
interesting engineering challenges to
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.390
interesting engineering challenges to
handle here and because of this we need

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
handle here and because of this we need
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.180
handle here and because of this we need
as many developers in facebook to be

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
as many developers in facebook to be
 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.530
as many developers in facebook to be
tackling this not just a mobile team

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
tackling this not just a mobile team
 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.009
tackling this not just a mobile team

in size and speed so two ways first I'm

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630
in size and speed so two ways first I'm
 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.570
in size and speed so two ways first I'm
going to talk about coding at scale and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580
going to talk about coding at scale and
 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.730
going to talk about coding at scale and
the second part is how we release to the

the second part is how we release to the
 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.830
the second part is how we release to the
world in a very fast and speedy and

world in a very fast and speedy and
 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.710
world in a very fast and speedy and
reliable manner so let's talk about

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
reliable manner so let's talk about
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.010
reliable manner so let's talk about
let's talk about coding at scale so I

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020
let's talk about coding at scale so I
 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.000
let's talk about coding at scale so I
guess like story time around 2011 when I

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010
guess like story time around 2011 when I
 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.520
guess like story time around 2011 when I
started at Facebook this was also quite

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530
started at Facebook this was also quite
 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.900
started at Facebook this was also quite
simply at a time when we were

them having the whole company jump in
 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.629
them having the whole company jump in
and do Android and iOS development okay

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639
and do Android and iOS development okay
 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.270
and do Android and iOS development okay
so was it as easy as it sounds obviously

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280
so was it as easy as it sounds obviously
 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.100
so was it as easy as it sounds obviously
not it was actually really scary I

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110
not it was actually really scary I
 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.590
not it was actually really scary I
remember almost like in my mind almost

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600
remember almost like in my mind almost
 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.860
remember almost like in my mind almost
overnight the codebase had transitioned

overnight the codebase had transitioned
from probably a dozen engineers to

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789
from probably a dozen engineers to
 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.129
from probably a dozen engineers to
hundreds like probably a hundred

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139
hundreds like probably a hundred
 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.230

was probably like so many but still a

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
was probably like so many but still a
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.110
was probably like so many but still a
lot so how did this affect my life

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120
lot so how did this affect my life
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.909
lot so how did this affect my life
you could never build everything was

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919
you could never build everything was
 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.710
you could never build everything was
crashing when you thought your feature

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720

when you finish writing your code
nothing worked so obviously we realized

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820
nothing worked so obviously we realized
 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.060
nothing worked so obviously we realized
developer efficiency was gonna be

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070
developer efficiency was gonna be
 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.560
developer efficiency was gonna be
affected by having a lot of people

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570
affected by having a lot of people
 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.440
affected by having a lot of people
writing writing a lot of code so we

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450
writing writing a lot of code so we
 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.580
writing writing a lot of code so we
realized that we had to make some

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590
realized that we had to make some
 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.650

changes for this to work out
you can't just transition from having 12

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500
you can't just transition from having 12
 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.790
you can't just transition from having 12
engineers to a hundred in one day and

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800
engineers to a hundred in one day and
 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.610
engineers to a hundred in one day and
not expect hiccups here so we realized

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620
not expect hiccups here so we realized
 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.740
not expect hiccups here so we realized
well first we need to create an

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750
well first we need to create an
 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.990
well first we need to create an
environment that enforces testing and

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000
environment that enforces testing and
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.070
environment that enforces testing and
also makes it easy to to read more tests

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080
also makes it easy to to read more tests
 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.190
also makes it easy to to read more tests
just to avoid brittle code and the

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200
just to avoid brittle code and the
 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.600
just to avoid brittle code and the
second part is we need to break

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610
second part is we need to break
 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.340
second part is we need to break
dependencies amongst the different teams

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350
dependencies amongst the different teams

dependencies amongst the different teams
what does that mean if I'm working on

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510
what does that mean if I'm working on
 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.660
what does that mean if I'm working on

feed engineer I should not be blocked by
 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.940
feed engineer I should not be blocked by
that and I should be able to build my

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950
that and I should be able to build my
 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.500
that and I should be able to build my
code and you should be able to deploy it

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510
code and you should be able to deploy it
 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.000
code and you should be able to deploy it
okay so what do we do so we started

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.010
okay so what do we do so we started
 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.850
okay so what do we do so we started
using dependency injection so many of

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860
using dependency injection so many of
 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.860
using dependency injection so many of
you guys are familiar with this for but

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870
you guys are familiar with this for but
 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.420
you guys are familiar with this for but
for those who are not dependency

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430
for those who are not dependency
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.260
for those who are not dependency
injection is a design pattern for

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270
injection is a design pattern for
 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.520
injection is a design pattern for
externally setting object dependencies

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:50.530
externally setting object dependencies
 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.590
externally setting object dependencies
and separating the creation versus the

and separating the creation versus the
 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.200
and separating the creation versus the
behavior what this does naturally is

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.210
behavior what this does naturally is
 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.780
behavior what this does naturally is
that it encourages modularity modularity

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:57.790
that it encourages modularity modularity
 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.930
that it encourages modularity modularity

Guice back in 2011 dagger was now

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:08.380
Guice back in 2011 dagger was now
 

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.960
Guice back in 2011 dagger was now
available as an open source framework

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:09.970
available as an open source framework
 

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.350
available as an open source framework
and Guice was giving us performance

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360
and Guice was giving us performance
 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.520
and Guice was giving us performance
problems so we developed our own

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.530
problems so we developed our own
 

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.970
problems so we developed our own

let me give an example for those who are

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:23.200
let me give an example for those who are
 

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.680
let me give an example for those who are
not familiar with this the idea is let's

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.690
not familiar with this the idea is let's
 

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.290
not familiar with this the idea is let's
say I'm creating a method that fetches

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:28.300
say I'm creating a method that fetches
 

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.060
say I'm creating a method that fetches
data for my news feed let's call it news

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:30.070
data for my news feed let's call it news
 

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.490
data for my news feed let's call it news
feed fetcher and it requires a lot of

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:32.500
feed fetcher and it requires a lot of
 

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.370
feed fetcher and it requires a lot of
different objects say something an HTTP

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.380
different objects say something an HTTP
 

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.900
different objects say something an HTTP
request helper so that you can fetch

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:36.910
request helper so that you can fetch
 

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.380
request helper so that you can fetch
something some sort of JSON parser and

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.390
something some sort of JSON parser and
 

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.600
something some sort of JSON parser and
some sort of image downloader all of

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.610
some sort of image downloader all of
 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.810
some sort of image downloader all of
this are modular classes that perform

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:45.820
this are modular classes that perform
 

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.360
this are modular classes that perform
separate objectives so one way to

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.370
separate objectives so one way to
 

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.250
separate objectives so one way to
construct this dependencies

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260
construct this dependencies
 

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.530
construct this dependencies
the knife manner is just within your

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540
the knife manner is just within your
 

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.780
the knife manner is just within your
constructor or within your main method

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:56.790
constructor or within your main method
 

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.660
constructor or within your main method
and within your class initialize them

00:08:59.660 --> 00:08:59.670
and within your class initialize them
 

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.190

downloader etc are you so what happens

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260
downloader etc are you so what happens
 

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.390
downloader etc are you so what happens
here so the problem in that case is that

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.400
here so the problem in that case is that
 

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.910
here so the problem in that case is that
we you have to be like you tangle a lot

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920
we you have to be like you tangle a lot
 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.980
we you have to be like you tangle a lot
of the dependency creation together with

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
of the dependency creation together with
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.840
of the dependency creation together with
the objects and it's really really hard

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:17.850
the objects and it's really really hard
 

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.760
the objects and it's really really hard
to test it so with dependency injection

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:19.770
to test it so with dependency injection
 

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.520
to test it so with dependency injection
the idea is that rather than creating

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:22.530
the idea is that rather than creating
 

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.510
the idea is that rather than creating
your dependencies

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:23.520
your dependencies
 

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.890
your dependencies
you're gonna assume that they get passed

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:24.900
you're gonna assume that they get passed
 

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.440
you're gonna assume that they get passed
to you by some god-like injector class

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:27.450
to you by some god-like injector class
 

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.390
to you by some god-like injector class
or just get passed to you by the

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:29.400
or just get passed to you by the
 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.120
or just get passed to you by the
constructor and you got this and inject

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.130
constructor and you got this and inject
 

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.980
constructor and you got this and inject
annotation what this add inject

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:33.990
annotation what this add inject
 

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.140
annotation what this add inject
annotation does is it goes through all

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.150
annotation does is it goes through all
 

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.000
annotation does is it goes through all
of the methods that were annotated like

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.010
of the methods that were annotated like
 

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.600
of the methods that were annotated like
this and creates an injector global

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:41.610
this and creates an injector global
 

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.050
this and creates an injector global
object a singleton that when we're

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060
object a singleton that when we're
 

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.450
object a singleton that when we're
asking for a particular object fetching

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:47.460
asking for a particular object fetching
 

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.340
asking for a particular object fetching
sweet method will pass all of these

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.350
sweet method will pass all of these
 

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:55.370
sweet method will pass all of these
objects during instantiation time and it

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380
objects during instantiation time and it
 

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.680
objects during instantiation time and it
will also if you you want just one

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:57.690
will also if you you want just one
 

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.180
will also if you you want just one
instance of it it will hold that

00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.190
instance of it it will hold that
 

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.970
instance of it it will hold that
instance and we won't recreate it what

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980
instance and we won't recreate it what
 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.440
instance and we won't recreate it what
is the nice thing about this if you're

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.450
is the nice thing about this if you're
 

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.330
is the nice thing about this if you're
writing tests you can pass fake versions

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:05.340
writing tests you can pass fake versions
 

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.750
writing tests you can pass fake versions
of it

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760
of it
 

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.450
of it
you keep a very clean interface and the

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:08.460
you keep a very clean interface and the
 

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.300
you keep a very clean interface and the
other part is that you can build your

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:11.310
other part is that you can build your
 

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.160
other part is that you can build your
own module and then connect it to the

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.170
own module and then connect it to the
 

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.130
own module and then connect it to the
other ones as part of the final version

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140
other ones as part of the final version
 

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.260
other ones as part of the final version
when deploying and compiling the app so

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.270
when deploying and compiling the app so
 

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.730
when deploying and compiling the app so
this encourages testability code

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740
this encourages testability code
 

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.250
this encourages testability code
modularity and also helps of scalar a

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
modularity and also helps of scalar a
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.320
modularity and also helps of scalar a
code base now and this is obviously

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.330
code base now and this is obviously
 

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.930
code base now and this is obviously
really really important when you have

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:31.940
really really important when you have
 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.030
really really important when you have
tons of developers writing code at the

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
tons of developers writing code at the
 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.870
tons of developers writing code at the
same time so what is one of the problems

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880
same time so what is one of the problems
 

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.260
same time so what is one of the problems
here is performance let me illustrate

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:42.270
here is performance let me illustrate
 

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.930
here is performance let me illustrate
why performance is a problem it lies on

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940
why performance is a problem it lies on
 

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.440
why performance is a problem it lies on
the area of dependency resolution so at

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.450
the area of dependency resolution so at
 

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.930
the area of dependency resolution so at
runtime because you don't really know

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940
runtime because you don't really know
 

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.510
runtime because you don't really know
who are the objects that you're gonna be

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:53.520
who are the objects that you're gonna be
 

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.240
who are the objects that you're gonna be
depending on we realize okay you hook

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.250
depending on we realize okay you hook
 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.370
depending on we realize okay you hook
the news feed fetcher to this HTTP

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380

the app during coaster that you are

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:03.810
the app during coaster that you are
 

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.490
the app during coaster that you are
doing all of this stuff

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:05.500
doing all of this stuff
 

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.410
doing all of this stuff
this takes us to a different problem in

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.420
this takes us to a different problem in
 

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.030
this takes us to a different problem in
order to have all this flexibility our

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040
order to have all this flexibility our
 

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.680
order to have all this flexibility our
coaster time is just going through the

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:10.690
coaster time is just going through the
 

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.260
coaster time is just going through the
roof so what do we do here

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:13.270
roof so what do we do here
 

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.240
roof so what do we do here
so we're gonna actually switch all of

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.250
so we're gonna actually switch all of
 

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.670
so we're gonna actually switch all of
this to compile time but if we

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680
this to compile time but if we
 

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.380
this to compile time but if we
hard-coded everything we will go back

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.390
hard-coded everything we will go back
 

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.970
hard-coded everything we will go back
into the old method where everything

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:20.980
into the old method where everything
 

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.860
into the old method where everything
feels wired and like static and we

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:22.870
feels wired and like static and we
 

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.830
feels wired and like static and we
wouldn't be able to write tests in an

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:25.840
wouldn't be able to write tests in an
 

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.340
wouldn't be able to write tests in an
easy manner so one of the engineers a

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.350
easy manner so one of the engineers a
 

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.100
easy manner so one of the engineers a
facebook I thought okay

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.110
facebook I thought okay
 

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.750
facebook I thought okay
instead we should look at the Java

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760
instead we should look at the Java
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.970
instead we should look at the Java
bytecode and modify it at compile time

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:35.980
bytecode and modify it at compile time
 

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.840
bytecode and modify it at compile time
to substitute the creators of this

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:39.850
to substitute the creators of this
 

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.060
to substitute the creators of this
providers into static methods and

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.070
providers into static methods and
 

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.160
providers into static methods and
actually wire them to the final versions

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.170
actually wire them to the final versions
 

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.870
actually wire them to the final versions
and when you're doing tests you still

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880
and when you're doing tests you still
 

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.040
and when you're doing tests you still

the day we reduce startup time by 20%
and you do all these operations at

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.510
and you do all these operations at
 

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.100
and you do all these operations at
compile time which happen offline okay

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.110
compile time which happen offline okay

so that's just one example of how we

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.230
so that's just one example of how we
 

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.650
so that's just one example of how we
actually broke down a lot of our

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:04.660
actually broke down a lot of our
 

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.210
actually broke down a lot of our
development process what type of

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.220

structure that we actually put in place

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:07.900
structure that we actually put in place
 

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.930
structure that we actually put in place
so that we could move really fast in an

so that we could move really fast in an
 

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.200
so that we could move really fast in an
independent manner here's another

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.210
independent manner here's another
 

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.050

start being able to write code we will

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:44.980
start being able to write code we will
 

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.680
start being able to write code we will
be able to identify a bunch of these

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:46.690
be able to identify a bunch of these
 

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.740
be able to identify a bunch of these
failures before we even land the code so

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:49.750
failures before we even land the code so
 

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.380
failures before we even land the code so
that our trunk is like it's in a

works in all of these cases and it's not
 

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:25.819
works in all of these cases and it's not
creating a terrible experience so how do

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:25.829
creating a terrible experience so how do
 

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:30.769
creating a terrible experience so how do
we do that well with we have a ton of

say I'm building my particular feature
 

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.610
say I'm building my particular feature
and I'm pretty sure that it works but I

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620
and I'm pretty sure that it works but I
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.290

information it makes it easier so if you
find something that doesn't feel right

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:10.770
find something that doesn't feel right
 

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.220

or an experience that is really
bothering you you rich you reach in your

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959
bothering you you rich you reach in your
 

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.949
bothering you you rich you reach in your
phone and then you get to write an

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959
phone and then you get to write an
 

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:23.210
phone and then you get to write an
employee report so it

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220
employee report so it
 

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.939
employee report so it
enough well the answer is no so we take

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:25.949
enough well the answer is no so we take
 

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:28.100
enough well the answer is no so we take
advantage of the alpha the Google place

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.110
advantage of the alpha the Google place
 

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.770
advantage of the alpha the Google place
alpha beta channels we have over a

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780
alpha beta channels we have over a
 

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.909
alpha beta channels we have over a
hundred thousand of users and we have a

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919
hundred thousand of users and we have a
 

00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:36.980
hundred thousand of users and we have a
little over a million beta testers right

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:36.990
little over a million beta testers right
 

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.409
little over a million beta testers right
now so we release our app into alpha

00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:41.419
now so we release our app into alpha
 

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:44.450
now so we release our app into alpha
every day new version of master into

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460
every day new version of master into
 

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.750
every day new version of master into
that and every every couple days into

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760
that and every every couple days into
 

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.529
that and every every couple days into
beta this allows us to turn on our

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539
beta this allows us to turn on our
 

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.750
beta this allows us to turn on our
features early so if you guys are

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760
features early so if you guys are
 

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.169
features early so if you guys are
interested in staying up to date with

00:17:56.169 --> 00:17:56.179
interested in staying up to date with
 

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.880
interested in staying up to date with
the newest Facebook features we turn

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:58.890
the newest Facebook features we turn
 

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.740
the newest Facebook features we turn
them on much more often in the alpha

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:00.750
them on much more often in the alpha
 

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.539
them on much more often in the alpha
beta channels and we turn them down in

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:02.549
beta channels and we turn them down in
 

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:05.830
beta channels and we turn them down in
production so check out these channels

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840
production so check out these channels
 

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.130
production so check out these channels
by looking at this we're able to

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:09.140
by looking at this we're able to
 

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.220
by looking at this we're able to
identify crash rates mostly and see some

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:13.230
identify crash rates mostly and see some
 

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.500
identify crash rates mostly and see some
of our obvious booting problems now this

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.510
of our obvious booting problems now this
 

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.659
of our obvious booting problems now this
is not perfect because most of the users

00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:17.669
is not perfect because most of the users
 

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:20.630
is not perfect because most of the users
in the alpha beta channels have really

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640
in the alpha beta channels have really
 

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.370
in the alpha beta channels have really
really high end phones most of the

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380
really high end phones most of the
 

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.350
really high end phones most of the
phones are Nexus phones so it's a little

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360
phones are Nexus phones so it's a little
 

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.600
phones are Nexus phones so it's a little
skew towards a very tech oriented

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:26.610
skew towards a very tech oriented
 

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.490
skew towards a very tech oriented
audience nonetheless that is very

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500
audience nonetheless that is very
 

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.899
audience nonetheless that is very
helpful well so everything passes here

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:32.909
helpful well so everything passes here
 

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:34.940
helpful well so everything passes here
everything looks good we're released to

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:34.950
everything looks good we're released to
 

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.180
everything looks good we're released to
a small percentage of the world now I

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:38.190
a small percentage of the world now I
 

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.580
a small percentage of the world now I
mentioned this is a release like we have

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:40.590
mentioned this is a release like we have
 

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.169
mentioned this is a release like we have
multiple releases of different products

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179
multiple releases of different products
 

00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:43.789
multiple releases of different products
all the time but we're very very careful

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799
all the time but we're very very careful
 

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:46.549
all the time but we're very very careful
sometimes if we're looking at product

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559
sometimes if we're looking at product
 

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.070
sometimes if we're looking at product
changes that affect a lot of users and

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080
changes that affect a lot of users and
 

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.029
changes that affect a lot of users and
are pretty obvious we run tests in

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039
are pretty obvious we run tests in
 

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:56.090
are pretty obvious we run tests in
countries in particular to see what are

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100
countries in particular to see what are
 

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.830
countries in particular to see what are
the longer-term network effects there

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840
the longer-term network effects there
 

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.110
the longer-term network effects there
and sometimes if it's something smaller

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120
and sometimes if it's something smaller
 

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.210
and sometimes if it's something smaller
we will run on 1% tests look at

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220
we will run on 1% tests look at
 

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.350
we will run on 1% tests look at
engagement metrics and keep rolling to a

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360
engagement metrics and keep rolling to a
 

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.640
engagement metrics and keep rolling to a
larger audience that way but is this

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:10.650
larger audience that way but is this
 

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.549
larger audience that way but is this
enough the answer is no let me tell you

00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559
enough the answer is no let me tell you
 

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:15.919
enough the answer is no let me tell you
a story about something that we didn't

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:15.929
a story about something that we didn't
 

00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:19.159
a story about something that we didn't
catch in employee dog food program the

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:19.169
catch in employee dog food program the
 

00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:22.760
catch in employee dog food program the
alpha or beta releases or even like when

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:22.770
alpha or beta releases or even like when
 

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.970
alpha or beta releases or even like when
we like rolled it out slowly so this was

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980
we like rolled it out slowly so this was
 

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.140
we like rolled it out slowly so this was
in the context of a photo uploader

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:29.150
in the context of a photo uploader
 

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.970
in the context of a photo uploader
so yes disco

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980
so yes disco
 

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.909
so yes disco
familiar if you we are trying to show a

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919
familiar if you we are trying to show a
 

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:37.940
familiar if you we are trying to show a
progress bar for uploading photos your

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:37.950
progress bar for uploading photos your
 

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.110
progress bar for uploading photos your
code might look something like this

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120
code might look something like this
 

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.529
code might look something like this
obviously I don't like simplify it a lot

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539
obviously I don't like simplify it a lot
 

00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.779
obviously I don't like simplify it a lot
here here it's saying hey you're

00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:44.789
here here it's saying hey you're
 

00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:48.919
here here it's saying hey you're
uploading photos at 70% of the total so

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:48.929
uploading photos at 70% of the total so
 

00:19:48.929 --> 00:19:50.360
uploading photos at 70% of the total so
we go through a face of

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:50.370
we go through a face of
 

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.190
we go through a face of
internationalization of strings so so

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200
internationalization of strings so so
 

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.830
internationalization of strings so so
obviously when you want to put a number

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840
obviously when you want to put a number
 

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.970
obviously when you want to put a number
in Android you will do a placeholder

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980
in Android you will do a placeholder
 

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.320
in Android you will do a placeholder
percent D and it will actually

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.330
percent D and it will actually
 

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.090
percent D and it will actually
substitute to a number so it's probably

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100
substitute to a number so it's probably
 

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.180
substitute to a number so it's probably
pretty clear for this crowd when we

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.190
pretty clear for this crowd when we
 

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.340
pretty clear for this crowd when we
translate stuff we since we send our

strings uploading photos whatever into
our internationalization console and we

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:17.370
our internationalization console and we
 

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.389
our internationalization console and we
have a lot of volunteers translators so

00:20:20.389 --> 00:20:20.399
have a lot of volunteers translators so
 

00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:23.840
have a lot of volunteers translators so
in the case of Finnish Danish and polish

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:23.850
in the case of Finnish Danish and polish
 

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.669
in the case of Finnish Danish and polish
I have a single translator doing this

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679
I have a single translator doing this
 

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:29.210
I have a single translator doing this
they thought oh this % was a probably a

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220
they thought oh this % was a probably a
 

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.279
they thought oh this % was a probably a
mistake so they removed it in the

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:31.289
mistake so they removed it in the
 

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:34.190
mistake so they removed it in the
translation okay so what happens here

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200
translation okay so what happens here
 

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.379
translation okay so what happens here
there's no crash no crash happens here

00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:36.389
there's no crash no crash happens here
 

00:20:36.389 --> 00:20:38.840
there's no crash no crash happens here
well no come up there's a crash but

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:38.850
well no come up there's a crash but
 

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.299
well no come up there's a crash but
there's no compilation mistake here so

00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:41.309
there's no compilation mistake here so
 

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:45.350
there's no compilation mistake here so
everything still still builds depending

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360
everything still still builds depending
 

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.970
everything still still builds depending
on how you write your code it could be a

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980
on how you write your code it could be a
 

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.070
on how you write your code it could be a
software or it could be a cancellation

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080
software or it could be a cancellation
 

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.019
software or it could be a cancellation
of uploads or it could be a crash so

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:53.029
of uploads or it could be a crash so
 

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:57.230
of uploads or it could be a crash so
regardless this means that our users in

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240
regardless this means that our users in
 

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.720
regardless this means that our users in
the Nordics are not getting a photo

00:20:59.720 --> 00:20:59.730
the Nordics are not getting a photo
 

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.870
the Nordics are not getting a photo
uploads now the reason why this was even

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880
uploads now the reason why this was even
 

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.750
uploads now the reason why this was even
more subtle is because we have separate

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760
more subtle is because we have separate
 

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.700
more subtle is because we have separate
experiences for low-end phones and

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:07.710
experiences for low-end phones and
 

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.560
experiences for low-end phones and
high-end phones so this was just

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:09.570
high-end phones so this was just
 

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.710
high-end phones so this was just
happening for gingerbread users in

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720
happening for gingerbread users in
 

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.320
happening for gingerbread users in
Finnish polish and Danish so there we

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.330
Finnish polish and Danish so there we
 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.600
Finnish polish and Danish so there we
did not have anyone in the alpha or beta

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.610
did not have anyone in the alpha or beta
 

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.879
did not have anyone in the alpha or beta
really like channels that used any of

00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:19.889
really like channels that used any of
 

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:23.990
really like channels that used any of
these particular cases so okay how do we

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000
these particular cases so okay how do we
 

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
these particular cases so okay how do we
catch it we immediately saw a drop on an

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.010
catch it we immediately saw a drop on an
 

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.259
catch it we immediately saw a drop on an
increase in upload failures in

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:30.269
increase in upload failures in
 

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:32.690
increase in upload failures in
particular in this particular scenario

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700
particular in this particular scenario
 

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.879
particular in this particular scenario
we drilled more into this and when I

00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:34.889
we drilled more into this and when I
 

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:38.509
we drilled more into this and when I
identified this so this is so we have

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:38.519
identified this so this is so we have
 

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:42.200
identified this so this is so we have
very very targeted instrumentation tools

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.210
very very targeted instrumentation tools
 

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.650
very very targeted instrumentation tools
so we can identify

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:43.660
so we can identify
 

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.600
so we can identify
large changes in engagement and

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:45.610
large changes in engagement and
 

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.790
large changes in engagement and
sometimes like many of these are related

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:47.800
sometimes like many of these are related
 

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.320
sometimes like many of these are related
to releases and then we can actually

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:49.330
to releases and then we can actually
 

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.230
to releases and then we can actually
like by step and identify what the

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240
like by step and identify what the
 

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.690
like by step and identify what the
particular problem is so I guess is this

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:57.700
particular problem is so I guess is this
 

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.510
particular problem is so I guess is this
enough well so I touched a little bit

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520
enough well so I touched a little bit
 

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.490
enough well so I touched a little bit
into the analytics how do we understand

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:02.500
into the analytics how do we understand
 

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.740
into the analytics how do we understand
their app is doing well once we released

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:04.750
their app is doing well once we released

their app is doing well once we released
it to the world so we have a lot of

these tools this helped reduce crashes
by 75 percent which is a lot what does

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:16.540
by 75 percent which is a lot what does
 

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.270
by 75 percent which is a lot what does
it say if we build a right

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.280
it say if we build a right
 

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.040
it say if we build a right
infrastructure but build the right tools

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.050
infrastructure but build the right tools
 

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.970
infrastructure but build the right tools
we will be able to target the problems

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:23.980
we will be able to target the problems
 

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:29.430
we will be able to target the problems
in a more in a much clearer manner so

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440
in a more in a much clearer manner so
 

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.290
in a more in a much clearer manner so
that's all I have here today

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:31.300
that's all I have here today
 

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.750
that's all I have here today
looks like we have a much larger slot

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760
looks like we have a much larger slot
 

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.270
looks like we have a much larger slot
and I have a 30-minute talk repaired but

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:36.280
and I have a 30-minute talk repaired but
 

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.020
and I have a 30-minute talk repaired but
I'll start taking questions yeah and

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.030
I'll start taking questions yeah and
 

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.610
I'll start taking questions yeah and
there are a bunch of us from Facebook

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:41.620
there are a bunch of us from Facebook
 

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.100
there are a bunch of us from Facebook
here if you guys like have broad

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.110
here if you guys like have broad
 

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:52.200
here if you guys like have broad
questions as well yeah okay so the

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.210
questions as well yeah okay so the
 

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.000
questions as well yeah okay so the
question I'll repeat that is how do you

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.010
question I'll repeat that is how do you
 

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.220
question I'll repeat that is how do you
priority you identify the severity of

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:56.230
priority you identify the severity of
 

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.960
priority you identify the severity of
the bug and how do you prioritize it

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:57.970
the bug and how do you prioritize it
 

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.110
the bug and how do you prioritize it
well so remember that slide that I

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120
well so remember that slide that I
 

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.480
well so remember that slide that I
talked about where we have like we have

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.490
talked about where we have like we have
 

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.450
talked about where we have like we have
a lot of input of reports crashes at

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:06.460
a lot of input of reports crashes at
 

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.820
a lot of input of reports crashes at
Sarah so we can also we have information

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:08.830
Sarah so we can also we have information
 

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.210
Sarah so we can also we have information
like how often is this being reported so

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.220
like how often is this being reported so
 

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.070
like how often is this being reported so
if people are pressing the report a bug

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080
if people are pressing the report a bug
 

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.110
if people are pressing the report a bug
button the more they reported it's

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120
button the more they reported it's
 

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.300
button the more they reported it's
indicates a lot more severity and like a

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.310
indicates a lot more severity and like a
 

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.500
indicates a lot more severity and like a
brother use case

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:22.510
brother use case
 

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.650
brother use case
so we have we have a program at Facebook

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:25.660
so we have we have a program at Facebook
 

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.350
so we have we have a program at Facebook
hold account though the countdown kind

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360
hold account though the countdown kind
 

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.200
hold account though the countdown kind
of like program where we look at all of

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.210
of like program where we look at all of
 

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.330
of like program where we look at all of
the bugs that are being reported the

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:33.340
the bugs that are being reported the
 

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.950
the bugs that are being reported the
ones that are reported the most and we

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960
ones that are reported the most and we
 

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.560
ones that are reported the most and we
we have specific task forces to handle

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:37.570
we have specific task forces to handle
 

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.410
we have specific task forces to handle
each of them some of them are easier

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:40.420
each of them some of them are easier
 

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.180
each of them some of them are easier
than others some of them are because we

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:42.190
than others some of them are because we
 

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.890
than others some of them are because we
release something by mistake and we can

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:43.900
release something by mistake and we can
 

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.070
release something by mistake and we can
do immediate targeted fixes some of them

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080
do immediate targeted fixes some of them
 

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.630
do immediate targeted fixes some of them
are versatile let me give you an example

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640
are versatile let me give you an example
 

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.200
are versatile let me give you an example
we had a like reliability problem at

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:52.210
we had a like reliability problem at
 

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.230
we had a like reliability problem at
some point people couldn't like but if

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240
some point people couldn't like but if
 

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.560
some point people couldn't like but if
this was really mainstream like of this

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:58.570
this was really mainstream like of this
 

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.180
this was really mainstream like of this
problem we would have realized system

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:00.190
problem we would have realized system
 

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.950
problem we would have realized system
will craft targeted it was not it was

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960
will craft targeted it was not it was
 

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.550
will craft targeted it was not it was
not the case

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:02.560
not the case
 

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.790
not the case
it was pretty subtle and we we broke it

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:05.800
it was pretty subtle and we we broke it
 

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.620
it was pretty subtle and we we broke it
we broke down a bunch of the different

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:07.630
we broke down a bunch of the different
 

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.480
we broke down a bunch of the different
cases by adding a bunch of logging and

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.490
cases by adding a bunch of logging and
 

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.019
cases by adding a bunch of logging and
looking

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:10.029
looking
 

00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:12.359
looking
what are the reports are in some cases

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:12.369
what are the reports are in some cases
 

00:26:12.369 --> 00:26:15.149
what are the reports are in some cases
in low connectivity scenarios people

00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159
in low connectivity scenarios people
 

00:26:15.159 --> 00:26:16.950
in low connectivity scenarios people
were hitting like but this was not

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960
were hitting like but this was not
 

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.810
were hitting like but this was not
propagating and they hit like a like a

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:18.820
propagating and they hit like a like a
 

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.629

00:26:21.629 --> 00:26:21.639
lot like I'm like like Mike and our site
 

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:23.519
lot like I'm like like Mike and our site
integrity or like our spam filter

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:23.529
integrity or like our spam filter
 

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:26.249
integrity or like our spam filter
detection mechanisms realized okay you

00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:26.259
detection mechanisms realized okay you
 

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:28.589
detection mechanisms realized okay you
can't be liking I'm liking this story a

00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:28.599
can't be liking I'm liking this story a
 

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:30.599
can't be liking I'm liking this story a
ton we think we're gonna block you we're

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:30.609
ton we think we're gonna block you we're
 

00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:33.149
ton we think we're gonna block you we're
gonna sentry block you so but this was

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159
gonna sentry block you so but this was
 

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:34.799
gonna sentry block you so but this was
happening because people were pressing

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:34.809
happening because people were pressing
 

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:35.519
happening because people were pressing
this back and forth

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:35.529
this back and forth
 

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:37.169
this back and forth
it was queuing up on the client side and

00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:37.179
it was queuing up on the client side and
 

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.599
it was queuing up on the client side and
when the connectivity came back up all

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:39.609
when the connectivity came back up all
 

00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:41.849
when the connectivity came back up all
that queue of like someone likes a

00:26:41.849 --> 00:26:41.859
that queue of like someone likes a
 

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:44.609
that queue of like someone likes a
request was coming on a server okay so

00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:44.619
request was coming on a server okay so
 

00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:46.739
request was coming on a server okay so
we were able to identify that and we

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:46.749
we were able to identify that and we
 

00:26:46.749 --> 00:26:49.440
we were able to identify that and we
were able to remove all those likes and

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:49.450
were able to remove all those likes and
 

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.930
were able to remove all those likes and
likes and fix that so that's one example

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:51.940
likes and fix that so that's one example
 

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.989
likes and fix that so that's one example
of a problem but this is affecting some

00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:54.999
of a problem but this is affecting some
 

00:26:54.999 --> 00:26:59.009
of a problem but this is affecting some
of our core functionality having signals

00:26:59.009 --> 00:26:59.019
of our core functionality having signals
 

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:00.930
of our core functionality having signals
of how often is being reported like

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:00.940
of how often is being reported like
 

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.859
of how often is being reported like
where like helps us identify the

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:04.869
where like helps us identify the
 

00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:08.639
where like helps us identify the
severity of them those are how bouncer

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:08.649
severity of them those are how bouncer
 

00:27:08.649 --> 00:27:15.029
severity of them those are how bouncer
question yeah

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039
 
 

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:17.560
 
okay so the question was what type of

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:17.570
okay so the question was what type of
 

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.479
okay so the question was what type of
testing processes do you have in place

00:27:19.479 --> 00:27:19.489
testing processes do you have in place
 

00:27:19.489 --> 00:27:22.269
testing processes do you have in place
to that allow you to release in a weekly

00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279
to that allow you to release in a weekly
 

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:26.200
to that allow you to release in a weekly
basis okay so we just started switching

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.210
basis okay so we just started switching
 

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.210
basis okay so we just started switching
or really like transitioning from a

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:28.220
or really like transitioning from a
 

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.859
or really like transitioning from a
two-week release cycle to a one-week

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:29.869
two-week release cycle to a one-week
 

00:27:29.869 --> 00:27:34.419
two-week release cycle to a one-week
really ii recently um did so let me give

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:34.429
really ii recently um did so let me give
 

00:27:34.429 --> 00:27:36.039
really ii recently um did so let me give
you a little more historical context we

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:36.049
you a little more historical context we
 

00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:37.450
you a little more historical context we
used to release once a month but you

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:37.460
used to release once a month but you
 

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.859
used to release once a month but you
still not have a release schedule we

00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:38.869
still not have a release schedule we
 

00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:40.570
still not have a release schedule we
were waiting like we were ready to

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:40.580
were waiting like we were ready to
 

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.210
were waiting like we were ready to
release and then we like we released

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:43.220
release and then we like we released
 

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.680
release and then we like we released
this this is back in the days when we

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:44.690
this this is back in the days when we
 

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.710
this this is back in the days when we
had probably a small mobile team okay we

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720
had probably a small mobile team okay we
 

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.629
had probably a small mobile team okay we
had like a bakery right we released it

00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:49.639
had like a bakery right we released it
 

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:52.149
had like a bakery right we released it
then we swish to release once a month

00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159
then we swish to release once a month
 

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:53.849
then we swish to release once a month
when we started having a lot of people

00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:53.859
when we started having a lot of people
 

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:57.009
when we started having a lot of people
developing in the codebase we used to

00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:57.019
developing in the codebase we used to
 

00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:00.869
developing in the codebase we used to
have a month soaked period and a month

00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:00.879
have a month soaked period and a month
 

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.970
have a month soaked period and a month
like you cut your branch cut and you

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:03.980
like you cut your branch cut and you
 

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.889
like you cut your branch cut and you
have a must soak period and only only

00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:05.899
have a must soak period and only only
 

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:09.669
have a must soak period and only only
bug fixes go in there it was really

00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679
bug fixes go in there it was really
 

00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:12.159
bug fixes go in there it was really
tough because certainly if you couldn't

00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:12.169
tough because certainly if you couldn't
 

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:14.200
tough because certainly if you couldn't
get your feature for the month you had

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.210
get your feature for the month you had
 

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.009
get your feature for the month you had
to actually wait for another month and

00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:17.019
to actually wait for another month and
 

00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:21.669
to actually wait for another month and
reliability was super important so we

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679
reliability was super important so we
 

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.710
reliability was super important so we
started by having a lot of unit tests

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720
started by having a lot of unit tests
 

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.960
started by having a lot of unit tests
like setting a lot of the the dependency

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:25.970
like setting a lot of the the dependency
 

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.450
like setting a lot of the the dependency
injection framework integration was

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:28.460
injection framework integration was
 

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.430
injection framework integration was
mostly so that we could even write unit

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440
mostly so that we could even write unit
 

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.330
mostly so that we could even write unit
tests so that started first and then the

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:33.340
tests so that started first and then the
 

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.220
tests so that started first and then the
what time we realized that hey now that

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.230
what time we realized that hey now that
 

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.009
what time we realized that hey now that
we're releasing every week is really

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:39.019
we're releasing every week is really
 

00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:42.310
we're releasing every week is really
hard to have manual testing in place we

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320
hard to have manual testing in place we
 

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.979
hard to have manual testing in place we
used to have a QA testing team that

00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:44.989
used to have a QA testing team that
 

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.119
used to have a QA testing team that
looked at a bunch of the core

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:46.129
looked at a bunch of the core
 

00:28:46.129 --> 00:28:48.129
looked at a bunch of the core
interactions to make sure say you could

00:28:48.129 --> 00:28:48.139
interactions to make sure say you could
 

00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:50.950
interactions to make sure say you could
load your news feed you could post a

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960
load your news feed you could post a
 

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.289
load your news feed you could post a
photo you could like a story like a lot

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:53.299
photo you could like a story like a lot
 

00:28:53.299 --> 00:28:55.389
photo you could like a story like a lot
of our current actions before we they

00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399
of our current actions before we they
 

00:28:55.399 --> 00:28:57.009
of our current actions before we they
would manually test a lot of our core

00:28:57.009 --> 00:28:57.019
would manually test a lot of our core
 

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:59.259
would manually test a lot of our core
interactions before we shipped now with

00:28:59.259 --> 00:28:59.269
interactions before we shipped now with
 

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:00.639
interactions before we shipped now with
a week one week release cycle that's

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:00.649
a week one week release cycle that's
 

00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:01.299
a week one week release cycle that's
impossible

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:01.309
impossible
 

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:06.639
impossible
so we are pushed so we so we have a

00:29:06.639 --> 00:29:06.649
so we are pushed so we so we have a
 

00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:10.739
so we are pushed so we so we have a
really good and to end testing framework

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:10.749
really good and to end testing framework
 

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:13.720
really good and to end testing framework
screenshot testing framework that we use

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:13.730
screenshot testing framework that we use
 

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.210
screenshot testing framework that we use
now a screenshot testing framework is

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.220
now a screenshot testing framework is
 

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.909
now a screenshot testing framework is
operates a lot like a unit test it

00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919
operates a lot like a unit test it
 

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:21.849
operates a lot like a unit test it
allows you to separate a lot of the

00:29:21.849 --> 00:29:21.859
allows you to separate a lot of the
 

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:24.099
allows you to separate a lot of the
components and it takes a screenshot of

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:24.109
components and it takes a screenshot of
 

00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:26.950
components and it takes a screenshot of
the of a lot of the UI that you have so

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960
the of a lot of the UI that you have so
 

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.740
the of a lot of the UI that you have so
that it can come

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:27.750
that it can come

you can tell and you can ask you hey do
you mean for this to be a difference so

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:34.680
you mean for this to be a difference so
 

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.030
you mean for this to be a difference so
if we have on this art like changes we

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.040
if we have on this art like changes we
 

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.580
if we have on this art like changes we
can actually identify them early our

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:40.590
can actually identify them early our
 

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.920

entrance tests are meant to substitute

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:42.930
entrance tests are meant to substitute
 

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.960
entrance tests are meant to substitute
some of our manual testing and we're

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:46.970
some of our manual testing and we're
 

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.150
some of our manual testing and we're
where as a principal we're asking all of

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:50.160
where as a principal we're asking all of
 

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.490
where as a principal we're asking all of
the product teams to search incision to

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500
the product teams to search incision to
 

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.570
the product teams to search incision to
this so how do we enforce it is we have

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580
this so how do we enforce it is we have
 

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.030
this so how do we enforce it is we have
this concept of a test storm happening

00:29:59.030 --> 00:29:59.040
this concept of a test storm happening
 

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.050
this concept of a test storm happening
at Facebook we have a lot of kind of

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:03.060
at Facebook we have a lot of kind of
 

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.620
at Facebook we have a lot of kind of
like trials of what will happen if we if

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:06.630
like trials of what will happen if we if
 

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.680
like trials of what will happen if we if
our data center if X data center went

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:09.690
our data center if X data center went
 

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.810
our data center if X data center went
down so we want to understand our

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820
down so we want to understand our
 

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.300
down so we want to understand our
witnesses there so what will happen if

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.310
witnesses there so what will happen if
 

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.730
witnesses there so what will happen if
our QA testing team just was not

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740
our QA testing team just was not
 

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.260
our QA testing team just was not
available so we're having that test or

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:20.270
available so we're having that test or
 

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.060
available so we're having that test or
plan where our objective is to

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:23.070
plan where our objective is to
 

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.710
plan where our objective is to
transition a lot of our manual testing

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720
transition a lot of our manual testing
 

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.060
transition a lot of our manual testing
in 21 tests so the answer is there's a

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:29.070
in 21 tests so the answer is there's a
 

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.460
in 21 tests so the answer is there's a
mix of stuff we have a lot of tools now

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:31.470
mix of stuff we have a lot of tools now
 

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.430
mix of stuff we have a lot of tools now
that allow us to write from all the way

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440
that allow us to write from all the way
 

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.230
that allow us to write from all the way
from unit tests you end to end test and

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240
from unit tests you end to end test and
 

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.180
from unit tests you end to end test and
the idea is to prevent regression so

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:38.190
the idea is to prevent regression so
 

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.390
the idea is to prevent regression so
that we don't have to be fixing stuff

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:40.400
that we don't have to be fixing stuff
 

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:56.269
that we don't have to be fixing stuff
after launch

00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279
 
 

00:30:56.279 --> 00:30:58.529
 
so the question is how do we find the

00:30:58.529 --> 00:30:58.539
so the question is how do we find the
 

00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:01.110
so the question is how do we find the
balance between a spatial rollout and a

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120
balance between a spatial rollout and a
 

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.090
balance between a spatial rollout and a
consistent experience amongst different

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.100
consistent experience amongst different
 

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.509
consistent experience amongst different
people well so we release or app once a

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519
people well so we release or app once a
 

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:11.159
people well so we release or app once a
week and that is a staged rollout on its

00:31:11.159 --> 00:31:11.169
week and that is a staged rollout on its
 

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.529
week and that is a staged rollout on its
on its own we want to make sure that we

00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:13.539
on its own we want to make sure that we
 

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:15.840
on its own we want to make sure that we
murder a lot of things like crash rates

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:15.850
murder a lot of things like crash rates
 

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.169
murder a lot of things like crash rates
bug reports so we want to be very very

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:19.179
bug reports so we want to be very very
 

00:31:19.179 --> 00:31:23.220
bug reports so we want to be very very
careful about not introducing a release

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.230
careful about not introducing a release
 

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.860
careful about not introducing a release
that is bad for our users so in that

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:25.870
that is bad for our users so in that
 

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.310
that is bad for our users so in that
sense we will we'll have a growl rollout

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320
sense we will we'll have a growl rollout
 

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.840
sense we will we'll have a growl rollout
that thing said we we do a lot of

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:33.850
that thing said we we do a lot of
 

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.820
that thing said we we do a lot of
experimentation on our features because

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:35.830
experimentation on our features because
 

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.169
experimentation on our features because
we want to make sure that whatever we

00:31:37.169 --> 00:31:37.179
we want to make sure that whatever we
 

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:39.359
we want to make sure that whatever we
will roll out 100% is the best

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:39.369
will roll out 100% is the best
 

00:31:39.369 --> 00:31:40.560
will roll out 100% is the best
experience for our users

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:40.570
experience for our users
 

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.999
experience for our users
let me give you an example when we redid

00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:45.009
let me give you an example when we redid
 

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:48.499
let me give you an example when we redid
the way we navigate to to open comments

00:31:48.499 --> 00:31:48.509
the way we navigate to to open comments
 

00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:52.889
the way we navigate to to open comments
we had a new very like fancy design that

00:31:52.889 --> 00:31:52.899
we had a new very like fancy design that
 

00:31:52.899 --> 00:31:56.519
we had a new very like fancy design that
like that when you tapped on comments it

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:56.529
like that when you tapped on comments it
 

00:31:56.529 --> 00:31:59.100
like that when you tapped on comments it
opened a popover it was bouncy it was

00:31:59.100 --> 00:31:59.110
opened a popover it was bouncy it was
 

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.619
opened a popover it was bouncy it was
very friendly but we found out that hey

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:01.629
very friendly but we found out that hey
 

00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:03.690

if you actually looked at low-end device

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:03.700
if you actually looked at low-end device
 

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.909
if you actually looked at low-end device
users they were actually having a

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919
users they were actually having a
 

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:07.200

terrible experience they were commenting

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.210
terrible experience they were commenting
 

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.720
terrible experience they were commenting
less so we dug in a little bit more we

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:09.730
less so we dug in a little bit more we
 

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.600
less so we dug in a little bit more we
actually opened this in low-end phone

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:12.610
actually opened this in low-end phone
 

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.430
actually opened this in low-end phone
and we realized that the animation is so

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440
and we realized that the animation is so
 

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.190
and we realized that the animation is so
choppy there's really no point in having

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200
choppy there's really no point in having
 

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.310
choppy there's really no point in having
it so if we had released the one version

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320
it so if we had released the one version
 

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.889
it so if we had released the one version
to everybody we would have heard our low

00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399
I have a better more delightful
 

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:29.249
I have a better more delightful
experience for how a high end users but

00:32:29.249 --> 00:32:29.259
experience for how a high end users but
 

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:31.409
experience for how a high end users but
because we had all the way to look at

00:32:31.409 --> 00:32:31.419
because we had all the way to look at
 

00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:33.330
because we had all the way to look at
all this analytics we were able to

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:33.340
all this analytics we were able to
 

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.149
all this analytics we were able to
pinpoint that for some users this is bad

00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159
pinpoint that for some users this is bad
 

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.369
pinpoint that for some users this is bad
and so for some more users is better so

00:32:38.369 --> 00:32:38.379
and so for some more users is better so
 

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:40.139
and so for some more users is better so
what we did in that case is we turned

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:40.149
what we did in that case is we turned
 

00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:42.659
what we did in that case is we turned
off animation for our low end users and

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:42.669
off animation for our low end users and
 

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:45.480
off animation for our low end users and
they actually like got to experience the

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:45.490
they actually like got to experience the
 

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.159
they actually like got to experience the
fullscreen behavior that we had which

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:47.169
fullscreen behavior that we had which
 

00:32:47.169 --> 00:32:49.049
fullscreen behavior that we had which
was better than the older one but they

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:49.059
was better than the older one but they
 

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:50.279
was better than the older one but they
didn't either animation that was gonna

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:50.289
didn't either animation that was gonna
 

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:52.529
didn't either animation that was gonna
be choppy anyway so I guess those are

00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:52.539
be choppy anyway so I guess those are
 

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:55.109
be choppy anyway so I guess those are
your question one of the things we learn

00:32:55.109 --> 00:32:55.119
your question one of the things we learn
 

00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:56.789
your question one of the things we learn
is that there's no one-size-fits-all for

00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799
is that there's no one-size-fits-all for
 

00:32:56.799 --> 00:33:01.730
is that there's no one-size-fits-all for
everybody there's a lot of diversity in

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740
everybody there's a lot of diversity in
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.889
everybody there's a lot of diversity in
device models and screen sizes and

00:33:04.889 --> 00:33:04.899
device models and screen sizes and
 

00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:08.010
device models and screen sizes and
usages in general usage

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:08.020
usages in general usage
 

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.110
usages in general usage
not just from your device but also

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120
not just from your device but also
 

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.230
not just from your device but also
culturally speaking for instance people

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240
culturally speaking for instance people
 

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.640
culturally speaking for instance people
in different countries have different

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:14.650
in different countries have different
 

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.950
in different countries have different
ratios of friends versus page content

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960
ratios of friends versus page content
 

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.360
ratios of friends versus page content
and people use Facebook in a slightly

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.370
and people use Facebook in a slightly
 

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.310
and people use Facebook in a slightly
different manner so the important thing

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320
different manner so the important thing
 

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.930
different manner so the important thing
for us is to be able to understand their

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:21.940
for us is to be able to understand their
 

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.130
for us is to be able to understand their
users in the best manner and provide

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:23.140
users in the best manner and provide
 

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.549
users in the best manner and provide
them what it's what will make them use

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559
them what it's what will make them use
 

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:33.900
them what it's what will make them use
like have a better experience yeah what

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:33.910
like have a better experience yeah what
 

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:41.760
like have a better experience yeah what
do you mean the question is if we let

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:41.770
do you mean the question is if we let
 

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.400
do you mean the question is if we let
version a like and here's where we turn

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:44.410
version a like and here's where we turn
 

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.350
version a like and here's where we turn
on the feature then turn off and turn it

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360
on the feature then turn off and turn it
 

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.330
on the feature then turn off and turn it
on I can't think of a particular one but

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:48.340
on I can't think of a particular one but
 

00:33:48.340 --> 00:34:09.460
on I can't think of a particular one but
do you have an example in mine

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:09.470
 
 

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:19.240
 
oh yeah yeah yeah we did all the time in

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:19.250
oh yeah yeah yeah we did all the time in
 

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.460
oh yeah yeah yeah we did all the time in
fact we have a lot of experiments

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:21.470
fact we have a lot of experiments
 

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:23.109
fact we have a lot of experiments
running simultaneously we have a very

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119
running simultaneously we have a very
 

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:25.839
running simultaneously we have a very
good experimentation framework it was

00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:25.849
good experimentation framework it was
 

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:29.409
good experimentation framework it was
built internally literally probably

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:29.419
built internally literally probably
 

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:31.510
built internally literally probably
every single product change and any

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520
every single product change and any
 

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.760
every single product change and any
large infrastructure change will go

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:33.770
large infrastructure change will go
 

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.639
large infrastructure change will go
through experimentation here the context

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:36.649
through experimentation here the context
 

00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:41.470
through experimentation here the context
being get for instance if you have a

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480
being get for instance if you have a
 

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.599
being get for instance if you have a
refactor you want to have make sure that

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:43.609
refactor you want to have make sure that
 

00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:45.430
refactor you want to have make sure that
all your metrics are neutral and if

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440
all your metrics are neutral and if
 

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.629
all your metrics are neutral and if
they're not you want to understand why

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639
they're not you want to understand why
 

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.980
they're not you want to understand why
because it's probably a bug otherwise

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:47.990
because it's probably a bug otherwise
 

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:52.180
because it's probably a bug otherwise
for our products we we constantly roll

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:52.190
for our products we we constantly roll
 

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.980
for our products we we constantly roll
out like this in terms of tests the

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:56.990
out like this in terms of tests the
 

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.470
out like this in terms of tests the
setup of the test probably matters like

00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480
setup of the test probably matters like
 

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.450
setup of the test probably matters like
it varies a lot depending on what the

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:01.460
it varies a lot depending on what the
 

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.030
it varies a lot depending on what the
test is in particular but is there

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040
test is in particular but is there
 

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:14.500
test is in particular but is there
something in particular you have in mind

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.510
 
 

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.329
 
server control it's also ever controlled

00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339
server control it's also ever controlled
 

00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:21.290
server control it's also ever controlled
so the way it works is that we have the

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300
so the way it works is that we have the
 

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.150
so the way it works is that we have the
system we call is a quick

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160
system we call is a quick
 

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.829
system we call is a quick
experimentation system it's like

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839
experimentation system it's like
 

00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:26.120
experimentation system it's like
internally we call it a guide and also

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.130
internally we call it a guide and also
 

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.780
internally we call it a guide and also
we have a gating system for that and a

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:29.790
we have a gating system for that and a
 

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.540
we have a gating system for that and a
lot of the signals every six hours we

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:32.550
lot of the signals every six hours we
 

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.700
lot of the signals every six hours we
download some small snippet information

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:34.710
download some small snippet information
 

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.160
download some small snippet information
which is like imagine a table it's like

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.170
which is like imagine a table it's like
 

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.319
which is like imagine a table it's like
a name of experiments map to the group

00:35:39.319 --> 00:35:39.329
a name of experiments map to the group
 

00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:41.030
a name of experiments map to the group
that you're assigned to and depending on

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040
that you're assigned to and depending on
 

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.290
that you're assigned to and depending on
which group you are assigned to your

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300
which group you are assigned to your
 

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.930

code actually decides to turn this on or

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940
code actually decides to turn this on or
 

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.109
code actually decides to turn this on or
off and kind of like log a lot of your

00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119
off and kind of like log a lot of your
 

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:50.120
off and kind of like log a lot of your
engagement information like your

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.130
engagement information like your
 

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.130
engagement information like your
behavior like the behavior behavior of

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140
behavior like the behavior behavior of
 

00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:01.730
behavior like the behavior behavior of
the user depending on the flow the

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740
the user depending on the flow the
 

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.380
the user depending on the flow the
question is what type of tools and

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:03.390
question is what type of tools and
 

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.240
question is what type of tools and
processes we have around code reviews um

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:05.250
processes we have around code reviews um
 

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.640
processes we have around code reviews um
I guess so it really depends for the

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:07.650
I guess so it really depends for the
 

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.640
I guess so it really depends for the
team so we are a very bottom sub company

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:10.650
team so we are a very bottom sub company
 

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.890
team so we are a very bottom sub company
in the sense that we try not to build

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900
in the sense that we try not to build
 

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.480
in the sense that we try not to build
things that are not necessary but that

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:14.490
things that are not necessary but that
 

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.370
things that are not necessary but that
being said the common things that come

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380
being said the common things that come
 

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.299
being said the common things that come
up is automatically running the test

00:36:20.299 --> 00:36:20.309
up is automatically running the test
 

00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:22.309
up is automatically running the test
it's something that has been found very

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319
it's something that has been found very
 

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:24.440
it's something that has been found very
useful across all the teams so by the

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:24.450
useful across all the teams so by the
 

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.349
useful across all the teams so by the
time your review comes back we are able

00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359
time your review comes back we are able
 

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:29.030
time your review comes back we are able
to run a bunch of unit tests or

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040
to run a bunch of unit tests or
 

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.690
to run a bunch of unit tests or
end-to-end tests in that case I guess

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700
end-to-end tests in that case I guess
 

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.450
end-to-end tests in that case I guess
like we have general like linters and

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:37.460
 
 

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.900
 
and a bunch of like to like agreed-upon

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:40.910
and a bunch of like to like agreed-upon
 

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.890
and a bunch of like to like agreed-upon
patterns that we like to enforce so

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900
patterns that we like to enforce so
 

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.230
patterns that we like to enforce so
there are kotas consistent and coherent

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240
there are kotas consistent and coherent
 

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:50.839
there are kotas consistent and coherent
across everything what else yeah I think

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:50.849
across everything what else yeah I think
 

00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:51.890
across everything what else yeah I think
all the high level that's why I'm

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900
all the high level that's why I'm
 

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.520
all the high level that's why I'm
thinking of with two and we do like to

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:55.530
thinking of with two and we do like to
 

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.460
thinking of with two and we do like to
kind of like in principle say hey if you

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:58.470
kind of like in principle say hey if you
 

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.890
kind of like in principle say hey if you
are done building a feature because

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900
are done building a feature because
 

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.829
are done building a feature because
end-to-end tests are heavy and expensive

00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839
end-to-end tests are heavy and expensive
 

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:06.770
end-to-end tests are heavy and expensive
we we start once your ship well let's

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780
we we start once your ship well let's
 

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.480
we we start once your ship well let's
say we ship this and we kind of gelled

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:08.490
say we ship this and we kind of gelled
 

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:13.460
say we ship this and we kind of gelled
like we agreed on this as being the the

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:13.470
like we agreed on this as being the the
 

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.900
like we agreed on this as being the the
feature that we want to actually release

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:14.910
feature that we want to actually release
 

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.450
feature that we want to actually release
and in this form we go back and start

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460
and in this form we go back and start
 

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.559
and in this form we go back and start
looking at what are the core into tests

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:21.569
looking at what are the core into tests
 

00:37:21.569 --> 00:37:23.420
looking at what are the core into tests
that we would like to build

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:23.430
that we would like to build
 

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:41.580
that we would like to build
and from the point of view of a user

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:41.590
 
 

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.140
 
yeah

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:43.150
yeah
 

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.790
yeah
so there were a lot of the question is

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800
so there were a lot of the question is
 

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.190
so there were a lot of the question is
what happen when you switch from 1200

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200
what happen when you switch from 1200
 

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.050
what happen when you switch from 1200
years to like hundreds of engineers how

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:50.060
years to like hundreds of engineers how
 

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.550
years to like hundreds of engineers how
your code changed

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560
your code changed
 

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.410
your code changed
remember memory the biggest thing that

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:53.420
remember memory the biggest thing that
 

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.940
remember memory the biggest thing that
changed was we started using dependency

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:54.950
changed was we started using dependency
 

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.610
changed was we started using dependency
injection because we were enabled

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:57.620
injection because we were enabled
 

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.130
injection because we were enabled
because everything was tangled together

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:00.140
because everything was tangled together
 

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.340
because everything was tangled together
and stuff was breaking and if you could

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.350
and stuff was breaking and if you could
 

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.530
and stuff was breaking and if you could
build a particular module and just not

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:05.540
build a particular module and just not
 

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.970
build a particular module and just not
have to depend on it it's actually

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:06.980
have to depend on it it's actually
 

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.120
have to depend on it it's actually
really helpful the second one that we

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.130
really helpful the second one that we
 

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:14.350
really helpful the second one that we
built was that we developed because we

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:14.360
built was that we developed because we
 

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.150
built was that we developed because we
didn't find a tool that could handle a

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160
didn't find a tool that could handle a
 

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.580
didn't find a tool that could handle a
bunch of our scale was back our build

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:18.590
bunch of our scale was back our build
 

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.020
bunch of our scale was back our build
system so the way buck works is that it

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.030
system so the way buck works is that it
 

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.420
system so the way buck works is that it
builds particular modules and it doesn't

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:25.430
builds particular modules and it doesn't
 

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.630
builds particular modules and it doesn't
rebuild them if they haven't changed so

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640
rebuild them if they haven't changed so
 

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.650
rebuild them if they haven't changed so
it's buck is a general build system it's

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:32.660
it's buck is a general build system it's
 

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.300
it's buck is a general build system it's

to Android it's as part of our iOS build

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.370
to Android it's as part of our iOS build
 

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.420

system as well now but the advantage of
 

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:42.700
system as well now but the advantage of
that was we used to have a single

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:42.710
that was we used to have a single
 

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.140
that was we used to have a single
repository we still have a single

repository we still have a single
 

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.140
repository we still have a single
repository but each of our modules have

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.150
repository but each of our modules have
 

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.020

it would take forever with time what we

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:52.310
it would take forever with time what we
 

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.400
it would take forever with time what we
developed was different ways of

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.410
developed was different ways of
 

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.710
developed was different ways of
distributing the builds across different

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720
distributing the builds across different
 

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.510
distributing the builds across different
machines so that not everything lies on

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520

buck was pretty impactful what are

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:10.790

versioning what I mean with this so we

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:41.630
versioning what I mean with this so we
 

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:46.330

it's still out in a wild and and so we
can't deprecated certain methods so

this is the API and we're switching it

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400
this is the API and we're switching it
 

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.980
this is the API and we're switching it
like this in the next release which

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:02.990
like this in the next release which
 

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.980
like this in the next release which
doesn't really work will we we came up

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:05.990
doesn't really work will we we came up
 

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:10.330
doesn't really work will we we came up
with a method an API construction that

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:10.340
with a method an API construction that
 

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.340
with a method an API construction that
allows us to ask for specific parts for

the next version of newsfeed we are

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.130
the next version of newsfeed we are
 

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.460
the next version of newsfeed we are
first we were not rendering photos and

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:27.470
first we were not rendering photos and
 

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.380
first we were not rendering photos and
we're just rendering everything like a

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:29.390
we're just rendering everything like a
 

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.420
we're just rendering everything like a
text piece and in the next version we

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:31.430
text piece and in the next version we
 

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.550
text piece and in the next version we
want to have a rich media format right

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560
want to have a rich media format right
 

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.730
want to have a rich media format right
so how do we like repurpose this API so

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:36.740
so how do we like repurpose this API so
 

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.150
so how do we like repurpose this API so
that the the old version still keep

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160
that the the old version still keep
 

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.950
that the the old version still keep
working and we don't have to change our

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960
working and we don't have to change our
 

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.770
working and we don't have to change our
our signature a lot and in the new ones

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:44.780
our signature a lot and in the new ones
 

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.500
our signature a lot and in the new ones
we can support a bunch of this stuff we

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:47.510
we can support a bunch of this stuff we
 

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.870
we can support a bunch of this stuff we
use the concept of a stylist the idea is

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:02.210
photo format you can you need to make
 

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.360
photo format you can you need to make
sure that your image URL is there and

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:04.370
sure that your image URL is there and
 

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:06.460
sure that your image URL is there and
the title is there and if you can't

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:06.470
the title is there and if you can't
 

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.680
the title is there and if you can't
render a photo there's a fallback

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:08.690
render a photo there's a fallback

that has been very helpful so check it
out a lot of this is part of like a

out a lot of this is part of like a
 

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.830
out a lot of this is part of like a

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:39.450
 
exponential upgrade paths with me oh

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:39.460
 
 

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:44.440
 
yeah oh okay let me let me try I'll try

yeah oh okay let me let me try I'll try
 

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.720
yeah oh okay let me let me try I'll try
to repeat it for everybody so when you

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:46.730
to repeat it for everybody so when you
 

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.240
to repeat it for everybody so when you
switch to a one with a release cycle and

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:49.250
switch to a one with a release cycle and
 

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.520
switch to a one with a release cycle and
people haven't really upgraded in two

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:51.530
people haven't really upgraded in two
 

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.530
people haven't really upgraded in two
weeks and this person hasn't really in

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:53.540
weeks and this person hasn't really in
 

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.320
weeks and this person hasn't really in
one week suddenly you have the news

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.330
one week suddenly you have the news
 

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.450
one week suddenly you have the news
version that you had out but really have

00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:58.460
version that you had out but really have
 

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.520
version that you had out but really have
a bunch of people in the prior one the

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:00.530
a bunch of people in the prior one the
 

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.560
a bunch of people in the prior one the
one before and just like it blows up a

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:02.570
one before and just like it blows up a
 

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.870
one before and just like it blows up a
lot more than if you were like releasing

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880
lot more than if you were like releasing
 

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.620
lot more than if you were like releasing
twice a week

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:05.630
twice a week
 

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.930
twice a week
like like twice a month for instance is

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:07.940
like like twice a month for instance is
 

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.210
like like twice a month for instance is
that the context yeah the problem is ax

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:10.220
that the context yeah the problem is ax
 

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.800
that the context yeah the problem is ax
is not simple we've been dealing with

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:11.810
is not simple we've been dealing with
 

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.630
is not simple we've been dealing with
this problem ever since we were even

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640
this problem ever since we were even
 

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.510
this problem ever since we were even
releasing once a month Android in

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520
releasing once a month Android in
 

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.320
releasing once a month Android in
particular

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:17.330
particular
 

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.260

iOS users actually upgrade much faster

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:20.270
iOS users actually upgrade much faster
 

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.770
iOS users actually upgrade much faster
than IO Android users it's it's probably

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:23.780
than IO Android users it's it's probably
 

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.450
than IO Android users it's it's probably
pretty obvious why because of the

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:25.460
pretty obvious why because of the
 

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.570
pretty obvious why because of the
different network connections it's error

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:28.580
different network connections it's error
 

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:33.460
different network connections it's error
as well so on Android I guess to

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:33.470
as well so on Android I guess to
 

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.020
as well so on Android I guess to
contrast a little bit with iOS iOS

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.030
contrast a little bit with iOS iOS
 

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.580
contrast a little bit with iOS iOS

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:36.590
doesn't have an alpha beta channel we
 

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.680

fully but we'll take what we can get

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:41.830
fully but we'll take what we can get
 

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.170
fully but we'll take what we can get
we still have versions that exist out

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:44.180
we still have versions that exist out
 

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.160
we still have versions that exist out
there I remember we were seeing like a

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:48.170
there I remember we were seeing like a
 

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.980
there I remember we were seeing like a
bug of version like a server-side change

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:50.990
bug of version like a server-side change
 

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.950
bug of version like a server-side change
that we made by mistake from that was

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960
that we made by mistake from that was
 

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.460
that we made by mistake from that was
breaking releases that a release that

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:57.470
breaking releases that a release that
 

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.090
breaking releases that a release that
came out a year ago so we are still

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:00.100
came out a year ago so we are still
 

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.250
came out a year ago so we are still
handling use we're still handling

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:05.260
handling use we're still handling
 

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.810

binaries we're released a year ago and

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:07.820
binaries we're released a year ago and
 

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.340
binaries we're released a year ago and
the answer for that is we have to be

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:09.350
the answer for that is we have to be
 

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.500
the answer for that is we have to be
very very flexible and we really need to

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:11.510
very very flexible and we really need to
 

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.470
very very flexible and we really need to
like we can never assume that that an

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480
like we can never assume that that an
 

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.470
like we can never assume that that an
apk that is released will disappear so

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480
apk that is released will disappear so
 

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.920
apk that is released will disappear so
what do we do we I mean we need to make

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:20.930
what do we do we I mean we need to make
 

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.040
what do we do we I mean we need to make
sure that our like but before we release

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:24.050
sure that our like but before we release
 

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.360
sure that our like but before we release
everything we have tested everything

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:25.370
everything we have tested everything
 

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.160
everything we have tested everything
this is why testing is really important

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:27.170
this is why testing is really important
 

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.820
this is why testing is really important
instrumentation is super important and

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:29.830
instrumentation is super important and
 

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:33.160
instrumentation is super important and
we need to design ours the most the most

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:33.170
we need to design ours the most the most
 

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:34.480
we need to design ours the most the most
thing is that we need to design our

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:34.490
thing is that we need to design our
