00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
You’ve seen this before in a TV show or
a movie.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.820
A patient is on the table in the emergency
room, bleeding from a stab wound or having

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.140
ODed on drugs, when suddenly, an alarm goes off
and the beep beep beep on the heart monitor flatlines.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.080
It’s cardiac arrest, and you can tell just
by that sound that it’s terrible.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.500
Doctors swarm around, barking orders, and
McDreamy or Dr. Grey -- or whoever the latest

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
foxy doctor is on the TV show that you’re
addicted to -- grabs the paddles, pushes them

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
down on the patient’s chest, and is all
CLEAR! Then the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.200
patient’s chest jumps up, and everyone stares at the
monitor waiting for those steady beeps to reappear.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.899
That is a pretty classic scene.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.280
When it comes to medical crises you see in
popular culture, it’s probably only rivaled

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.340
by the pool-side CPR scene, or someone shaking
an unconscious body, pounding on their chest

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.020
and saying “Don’t you die on me!”

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.120
Which hopefully you know is no way to keep
someone alive.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.960
These are classic script tropes, but they
contribute to some misconceptions about how

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.750
defibrillators, CPR, and the electricity of
the heart work.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.829
Because the truth is, CPR can help prolong
heart function during cardiac arrest, but

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.440
it usually can’t save a life without help
from a defibrillator.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.609
And when McDreamy -- may he rest in peace
-- finally bursts out those paddles, that

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.450
high-voltage shock isn’t turning the heart
back on -- it’s actually stopping it.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.870
Confused? Well, I’m here to get your head
to understand your heart.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.280
We’ll get back to hot TV doctors in a coupla
minutes, I promise.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.049
But in order to understand what’s actually
going on during cardiac arrest, we have to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200
understand some basics about your heart cells.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.200
We’ve learned a lot about skeletal muscle
tissue -- how it’s striated, and contracts

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.679
using the actin-myosin sliding filament dance
you’ve heard so much about.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.279
Your cardiac muscle is also striated, and
uses sliding filaments to contract, but

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.739
the similarities end there.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.039
For one, their cells look pretty different.
Skeletal muscle tissue has long, multinucleate cells,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.060
while cardiac cells are squat, branched out, and
interconnected, each one with one or two central nuclei.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.420
The cells are separated by a loose matrix
of connective tissue called the endomysium,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.020
which is chock full of capillaries, to serve
up a constant supply of oxygen.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.579
Cardiac cells are also loaded with energy-generating
mitochondria. In fact, mitochondria take up

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.810
as much as 25 to 35 percent of each cell,
making it resistant to fatigue, which is partly

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.110
why your heart can beat nearly 3 billion times
in a lifetime.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.140
Not surprisingly, the differences between
skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues are key

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.329
to understanding their functions.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.090
Skeletal muscle fibers are both structurally
and functionally separate from each other,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.310
meaning that some cells can work while others don’t
-- that’s why you can grasp a delicate flower

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850
with the same hand that you can use crush
a soda can.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.219
Cardiac cells, on the other hand, are both
physically and electrically connected, all

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.750
of the time. It takes precise coordination
to create the high and low pressures required

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.870
to pump your blood after all, and cardiac cells need
to be linked in order to have that perfect timing.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.230
And there’s one more thing you need
to know about your heart’s cells:

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.750
Some of them can generate their own electricity.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.730
How in the name of Raymond de Vieussens can
that be?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.410
Well, rewind your brain to when we explored
the electrical marvel that is the action potential,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.420
and how it triggers both neurons and muscle
cells. That process started by depolarizing

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.519
the cell -- that is, pushing the cell’s
membrane potential from negative toward positive,

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.099
past a threshold that triggered voltage-gated
ion channels to open.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.360
Most cells in your body only depolarize after
being triggered by an external stimulus, or

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.680
by a neighboring cell, in a long chain reaction of action
potentials that’s set off by the nervous system.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.320
But that is not the case for a special group
of cells found only in your heart -- ones

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.290
that can trigger their own depolarization.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.450
These are your pacemaker cells.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.560
Pacemaker cells are what keep your heart beating
at the correct rhythm, and ensure that each

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.560
cardiac muscle cell contracts in coordination
with the others, because you don’t want

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.180
your brain to have to send a series of action
potentials every time you need your heart

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.769
to beat. Your brain has got other stuff to
do.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.020
So pacemaker cells are, in a way, your heart’s very
own brain, generating the initial spark that sends a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.980
current through your heart’s internal wiring system,
known as the intrinsic cardiac conduction system.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.220
This system transmits electricity along a
precisely-timed pathway that ends with atrial

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.609
and ventricular contractions -- also known
as heart beats.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.659
And it begins with pacemaker cells generating
their own action potentials.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.329
In most cells, the action potential starts
with the resting potential, which the cell

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.549
maintains by pumping sodium ions out and potassium
ions in, Right?

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.019
Then, when some stimulus causes the sodium
channels open up, the sodium ions flood back

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.300
in, which raises the membrane potential until
it reaches its threshold. Pacemaker cells

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.970
operate the same way, except for that initial
stimulus. They don’t need it.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.840
Their membranes are dotted with leaky sodium
and potassium channels that don’t require

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.800
any external triggers. Instead, as their channels
let sodium ions trickle in, they cause the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.639
membrane potential to slowly and inevitably
drift toward its threshold.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.279
Since the leaking happens at a steady rate,
the cells fire off action potentials like

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.640
clockwork. And the leakier the membrane gets,
the faster it keeps triggering action potentials.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.900
The pacemaker cells at the start of the conduction
system have the leakiest membranes, and therefore

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.770
the fastest inherent rhythms, so they control
the rate of the entire heart.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.009
And those fast, leaky cells are found in the sinoatrial 
node, or the SA node, up in the right atria.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.369
They essentially turn the whole SA node into
your natural pacemaker.

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:09.680
After those pacemaker cells make themselves
fire, they spread their electrical impulses

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.949
to cardiac muscle cells throughout the atria.

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.479
The impulses leap across synapse-like connections
between the cells called gap junctions, and

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.080
continue down the conduction system until
they reach the atrioventricular node, or AV

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.319
node, located just above the tricuspid valve.

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.030
Now, when the signal hits the AV node, it
actually gets delayed for like, a tenth of

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.150
a second -- so the atria can finish contracting
before the ventricles contract.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.620
Without that delay, all the chambers would
squeeze at once, and the blood would just

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.599
splash around and not go anywhere.

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.009
So instead, the atria contract and blood drops
down into the ventricles, and then a moment

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.829
later, the signal moves on and triggers the ventricles
to squeeze, making the blood flow out of the heart.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.220
And there are two tricks to a good ventricular
contraction. One, the ventricles are so large

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.909
that the signal has to be distributed evenly
to ensure a coordinated contraction.

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.080
And two, the ventricles need to squeeze like
their squeezing a tube of toothpaste -- from

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.069
the bottom up -- to accelerate the blood through
the big arteries at the top of the heart.

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.489
So from the AV node, the signal travels straight
down to the inferior end of the heart and

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:09.431
gets distributed to both sides.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.259
The path the electrical impulse takes to the bottom of
the heart is called the atrioventricular bundle, also

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.319
known by the more rad name, the bundle of His,
where it branches out to the left and right ventricles.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.139
Finally, the signal disperses out into Purkinje
fibers, which trigger depolarization in all

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.799
surrounding cells, causing the ventricles
to contract from the bottom up like toothpaste

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.520
tubes, at which point the whole cycle starts
all over again.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.180
And everything I just described to you -- from
when the SA node fires to when the last of

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.009
the ventricular cells contract -- takes about
220 milliseconds.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.930
So that is how your heart beats. But I know
what you want -- you want to get back to talking

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.740
about TV shows and McDreamy and his paddles.
It’s totally understandable.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.639
OK, so picture all your individual heart cells
as a bunch of musicians in an orchestra.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.699
They all sound really great together, but
then the conductor suddenly needs to go to

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.430
the bathroom. And it sounds OK at first, but
then the tuba gets a little weird, and the

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.120
triangle is half a beat off, and soon everyone
is playing a different note at a different

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.970
time, jamming to their own personal rhythm.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.509
In the heart, we call this out-of-sync behavior
fibrillation, and it can be caused by all

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.620
sorts of problems, especially ones that affect
the pacemaker cells in the SA node.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.820
In an orchestra, this just sounds really terrible.
In a heart, there’s no coordinated contraction,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.419
no lub-dub, no blood moving through the body.
Which means you will soon be dead.

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.299
But then the conductor comes back from the
bathroom break, taps her wand, and everybody stops.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.080
It’s silent for a second before the wand comes up,
and then they all start playing again, this time in unison.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.960
If your heart in fibrillation is an out-of-sync
orchestra, then a defibrillator is that conductor.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.439
It stops the chaotic noise by overriding all
the individuals, and hits a sort of reset

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:44.919
button so everyone can start again on the
same page.

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:48.310
The paddles send so much electricity through
the heart that they trigger action potentials

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.259
in all of the cells at once. Then, the cells
repolarize, and start leaking again, and then

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:58.279
the most leaky cells, in the pacemaker SA
node, reach their threshold and fire first,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.900
re-setting the rhythm that keeps everyone
in harmony so your heart functions properly.

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:07.330
And that is how hot doctors and their paddles
actually stop hearts to save lives.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.100
Now the thing about CPR -- or cardiopulmonary
resuscitation -- is that it can’t correct fibrillation.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.680
What those chest compressions can do is force
a fibrillating heart to keep circulating oxygenated

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:21.030
blood until help arrives. But if a person
is in cardiac arrest, just breathing into

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.969
their mouth and compressing their chest won’t
deliver the electricity needed to give the

00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:27.109
pacemaking cells a chance to reset.

00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:31.229
I think I just figured out why they call those
TV doctors heart throbs.

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:32.640
That’s a terrible joke.

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:36.900
Anyway, today you learned how your heart’s
pacemaker cells use leaky membranes to generate

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.360
their own action potentials, and how the resulting
electricity travels through the cardiac conduction

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.940
pathway from SA Node to Purkinje fibers, allowing
your heart to contract. And if you weren't too busy

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.840
daydreaming about TV doctors, you also learned how
defibrillators work to reset the rhythm of your heart.
