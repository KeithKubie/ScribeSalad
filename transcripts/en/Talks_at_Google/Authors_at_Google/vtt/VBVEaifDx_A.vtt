00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.270
MALE SPEAKER: We have
two very special speakers

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.119
with us today, Whitney
Tilson and John Heins.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.410
Whitney and John have
collaborated together

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
for over a decade,
putting together

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.780
one of the most well
regarded value investing

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.820
newsletters, Value
Investor Insight.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.870
More recently, they
collaborated and put their years

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.690
of investing wisdom
and experience

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.060
in investing into a new book
called "The Art of Value

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.300
Investing: How The World's Best
Investors Meet The Markets."

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.480
In addition, Whitney is
also the fund manager

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380
for the Case Fund,
which as beaten

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.980
the markets by a considerable
margin since inception in '99.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.800
So we are very pleased to
have both of them here,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.890
share their wisdom with us.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.420
Please help me welcome
John, and then Whitney

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.706
will follow on from there.

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:58.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.125
JOHN HEINS: OK, well
thank you all for coming.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.250
Just to talk a little bit
about the plan for today,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.670
I am going to start out kind
of give a cliff notes version

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.330
of our book.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.020
And then Whitney
is going to talk

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.905
in a little more detail about
one of the fundamental concepts

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:17.290
that any Investor has to master,
which is how to value a stock.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.540
And he's going to
use an example.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.690
It's a case study that
of a stock that I think

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
might be a passing interest,
which will be Google.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.450
So what we tried to do with
"The Art of Value Investing"

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.400
was pose all the
questions that someone who

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.020
wanted to be a serious equity
investor, all of the questions

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.180
that that person
should ask and answer

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.130
for themselves before they
commit their own capital

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.050
or someone else's
capital to doing so.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.240
And those questions are
related to a variety from soups

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.900
to nuts.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.210
What is my philosophy?

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.945
What types of situations
am I going to look at?

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:59.650
Why are those situations
ripe for inefficiency,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.210
being inefficiently priced?

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.199
How many stocks
am I going to own?

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.990
So we wanted to cover
just about everything

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.620
you should answer before
you start investing,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.330
both from a kind of
technical standpoint,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.250
but also from a
psychological standpoint.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.900
What are the pitfalls
that I might fall in

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.000
that I should watch
out for as an investor

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.490
because investors are
prone to doing so?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.680
So for the answers
to the questions,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.970
we used the investors
that we've spoken

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.700
to over the last 10 years
for Value Investor Insight.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.640
Every issue has two in-depth
interviews with money managers

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.190
who have successfully
beaten the market,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.090
and we thought that was,
rather than us pontificating

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.960
about what we thought was
the right thing to do,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.320
we listened to them.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.710
And what we also
did is we didn't

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.210
assume that there
was just one right

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.569
answer to any of
these questions posed.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.110
Money managers have
different styles.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.210
They have different
philosophies.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.376
They have different focuses.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:01.370
And you can be successful with
a lot of different focuses.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.104
So we wanted to provide kind
of the diversity of opinion

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:05.770
and we thought that
diversity of opinion

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.740
would help people
who were trying

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.780
to arrive at their own
philosophy and strategy,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.430
come up with that.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.720
So I'm going to just
go through a couple--

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.550
again, not at all
comprehensive, but I just

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.360
wanted to talk
about a few things

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780
that we cover in
the book, hopefully

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.750
to convey some
useful information,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.310
and prompt some
thoughts on your part.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.400
So it is called "The
Art of Value Investing,"

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.140
so while we have a diversity
of opinion, the underlying

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.740
philosophy of all the
investors that we talked

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.945
to is a value
investing philosophy.

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:45.650
And you guys, you're all
here, so you probably

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.590
have some sense of what
value investing is.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.430
But there are core principles
to value investing,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.600
which we lay out in the book.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.060
I think a lot of it's captured
pretty well in this quote

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.240
from Will Brown
from Tweedy, Browne.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.390
"Our entire process is
rooted in Ben Graham's

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.880
simple philosophical
framework for investing.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.694
He believed there were two
values for every stock,

00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:10.110
the first being
the current market

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.340
price, and the second what
the share would be worth

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.960
if the entire
company were acquired

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.000
by a knowledgeable buyer, or
if the assets were liquidated,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.120
the liabilities paid off,
and the proceeds paid

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.260
to stockholders.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.040
He called that the
intrinsic value,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.520
and argued that
the time to buy was

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.920
when there was a large spread
between the current price

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.010
and that value, and
the time to sell

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.942
was when the spread was narrow."

00:04:29.942 --> 00:04:31.650
"Over time we've
developed different ways

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.480
of applying that, by valuing
income streams rather than just

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.890
assets, by calculating
private market values,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.360
by investing internationally.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.776
But the essence of what we
do has remained consistent.

00:04:40.776 --> 00:04:42.150
Our work every
day is essentially

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.390
directed valuing what
businesses are worth."

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.120
Now, that may seem
kind of obvious,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.420
but the ability
to value a company

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.640
intelligently is not
a trivial exercise,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.370
but it is kind of the
fundamental thing you have

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.800
to master and you
have to do well

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.507
to truly be a
successful investor.

00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:04.340
That's not to say there
aren't other reasons

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.360
why people buy stocks.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.630
People buy stocks because my
wife works at the company,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.160
I think it's a great company,
or I love the product,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.582
or I heard at a cocktail party
that it was going to go up.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.040
Lots of stocks get
bought that way,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.680
but that's not what
fundamental value investors do.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.110
So one of the first
concepts we talk about

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.580
is this notion of
circle of competence.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.206
And that is what are the--
every investor should think

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.830
about OK, what are
the industries, what

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.940
are the situations, what are
the geographic areas, what

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.100
are the size of companies
that I'm going to look at

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.840
and I'm going to become an
expert in that will allow me

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.610
to get an edge over what
is a very efficient market?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.630
And I think the basic
concept is explained really

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.600
well in this quote from
Julian Robertson who's

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.790
one of the best, most
successful hedge fund

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.370
managers of all time.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.420
"A baseball player
never really gets paid,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.020
no matter how many
home runs he hits

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.760
or what his batting
average is unless he

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.190
gets to the big leagues.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.392
Then he's guaranteed
to make a lot of money.

00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:10.600
But in the fund business,
you can find a minor league

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.183
where you can hit
for a better average

00:06:12.183 --> 00:06:14.249
because that's what
you're paid on."

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.790
"I remember one of
our guys taking us

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.990
into Korea in the early
1990s and the market

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.830
was so inefficient
that it was a goldmine

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.356
if you knew what you were doing.

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:23.480
My point is that to be
successful in this business,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.229
you don't have to be
better than everybody

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.000
everywhere, just
better than everybody

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.600
in the league in which you play.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.430
It's maybe today more
difficult to find

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.270
those inefficient areas,
but it's not impossible."

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.670
So the central conceit
of any investor

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.460
is that you figured
something out

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:47.050
that the market doesn't know or
the market has just got wrong.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.630
If what's priced into the stock
is just what everybody assumes

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.950
and what the consensus
is, it's very unlikely

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.460
that that stock is going to
be a successful investment.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.260
The price reflects the future,
as the consensus sees it.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.870
And I think that's something I
think people don't-- it's like,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.980
OK, Google is a great company,
but that doesn't always mean

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.010
that investing in Google
stock is a great investment.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.630
It may be that the market is so
enamored with Google's future

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.240
that the price you'd have to
pay it own a share of Google

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.580
isn't a value, and it won't
be a great investment.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.330
That doesn't mean it's
not a great company

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.470
and won't still
perform extremely well,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.310
but it may not be
a great investment.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.600
So I think one
quote that captured

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.990
that kind of notion really
well, which is really important,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.930
was from a publisher
of "The Daily Racing

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.820
Forum," of all places.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.910
He said, "The issue is not
which horse in the race

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.780
is the most likely winner,
but which horse or horses

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.350
are offering odds that
exceed their actual chances

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.366
of victory.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.990
There's no such thing
as liking a horse

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.480
to win a race, only an
attractive discrepancy

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.720
between his chances
and his price."

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.180
OK, so that puts a premium on
what successful investors often

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.860
call the variant perception.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.450
Actually knowing what it is
or identifying what you think

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.740
are the reasons a
stock is mispriced.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.660
A lot of investors may just
imagine, OK, the stock is cheap

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.270
and that's eventually
going to work its way out.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.684
But I think what we found
is that a lot of the best

00:08:22.684 --> 00:08:24.100
investors go beyond
that, and they

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.210
want to understand at
least why it's cheap.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.740
Why would these be cheap?

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.320
What's going on that
could make this cheap?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.743
And that is the
subject of this quote

00:08:36.743 --> 00:08:38.659
that I thought said it
pretty well from Curtis

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.049
Macnguyen who's
at Ivory Capital.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.059
"Why something is
mispriced is too often

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.640
ignored by value investors.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.140
The general thinking is that
it doesn't really matter.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.940
If you're right that
something is mispriced

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.820
it will eventually
take care of itself.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.890
We think it matters because
you can conceivably avoid a lot

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.950
of pain waiting for truth to
prevail if you have a good read

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.780
on why it currently doesn't."

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.270
So again, just to
reiterate a little bit,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.740
just because a company
is a good company

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.490
doesn't mean it's a
good stock investment.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.990
There has to be something
about your perception

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.670
of how the assets they have
or how the future's going

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.090
to play out that differs from
what everybody else thinks

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.570
and what's built
into the stock price.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.300
So a logical question
following that would be,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.124
so why do stocks get mispriced?

00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:26.040
It's efficient market.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.340
A lot of academics
will tell you that it's

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.550
an extremely efficient market
and you should not even

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.130
try to beat the market.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.470
So what a fundamental
value investor

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.690
who is an active
manager is trying to do

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.070
is identify what's
going on that could

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.120
make this the stock cheap.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.630
And I thought that was summed
up pretty well in this quote

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.030
from Steve Morrow of
New South Capital.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.850
"We believe the
market often misprices

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.820
stocks due to neglect, emotion,
misinterpretation, or myopia.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.600
So our value add comes from
bottom-up stock selection.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.054
We're trying to
buy at low prices

00:10:04.054 --> 00:10:06.220
relative to our current
estimate of intrinsic value,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.660
and we want to believe that
intrinsic value will grow."

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.274
So neglect, emotion,
misinterpretation, or myopia.

00:10:13.274 --> 00:10:14.690
Those are the types
of things that

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.290
can lead a stock not
to reflect accurately

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.690
what's going on in the future.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.940
Howard Marks of
Oaktree Capital who

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.940
is a longtime very
articulate investor

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.490
puts it this way in
a more general way.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.830
"Investment markets follow
a pendulum-like swing

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.670
between euphoria and
depression, between celebrating

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.160
positive developments and
obsessing over negatives,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.130
and thus, between
overpriced and underpriced."

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.860
"There are few things of which
we can be sure and this is one.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.200
Extreme market
behavior will reverse.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.700
Those who believe the pendulum
will move in one direction

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.570
forever or reside in
an extreme forever

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.650
eventually will lose huge sums.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.720
Those who understand
the pendulum's behavior

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.110
can benefit enormously."

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.880
So what kind of
situations can lead

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.880
to neglect, emotion,
misinterpretation, or myopia,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.010
and therefore, potentially
inaccurate stock prices?

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.010
A lot of things can
make that happen,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.560
but there tends to be change.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.400
There tends to be uncertainty.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.970
And quite often
there tends to be

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.740
a problem or multiple problems.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.840
These are things that
can throw off or cloud

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.060
what the future may
hold to a greater degree

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.280
than if everything's
kind of going OK.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.772
Again, I'm doing this
because I think the people

00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:33.730
that we interviewed say
it better than I would,

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.970
so I'm going to quote John
Jacobson from Highfields

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.770
Capital where he
talks about where

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.980
he looks for opportunities.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.390
So what is the fertile ground
for potential mispricing?

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.290
"Two kinds of events
create volatility,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.980
which creates opportunity.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.900
The first revolve around
individual companies,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.750
such as earnings misses,
unexpected news, M&amp;A activity,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.280
restructurings, and legal
issues-- things that

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.770
can make prices and valuations
change relatively quickly.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.890
We want to understand
what made the price change

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.639
and then figure out
whether the facts have

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.440
changed as much as the price.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.379
To the extent they haven't,
that can be an opportunity."

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:11.920
"The other major
source of volatility

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.410
is when a macro event or
trend causes markets to move.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.820
The market reflects
at any moment

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.540
what investors think
XYZ's business is worth.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.330
So if macroeconomic factors
force people to buy and sell

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.910
its securities, but we believe
those factors have nothing

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.160
to do with the underlying
fundamentals of the company,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.826
or less to do with
the fundamentals that

00:12:29.826 --> 00:12:31.560
is being reflected
in the share price,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.059
that can also be
an opportunity."

00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:36.350
You guys probably notice,
even looking at Google stock,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.350
if you look at a Google stock
chart over the last five years,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.600
you'll see it moves.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.840
It moves quite a bit.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.970
And it moves a lot
more, one could argue,

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.240
than the actual fundamental
reality of what's

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.100
going on at Google
at any given time.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.684
And it's that if this is what's
going on at Google at any time

00:12:54.684 --> 00:12:56.100
and this is the
stock price, there

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.520
can be opportunities to buy the
stock when it's inefficiently

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.520
priced.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.140
So while most discussions
of stocks talk about what

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.380
can go right about a
stock-- everybody's

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.000
talking about what's the upside,
this is going to be great,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.624
it's going to double.

00:13:14.624 --> 00:13:16.790
One thing that I think
distinguishes value investors

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.623
somewhat is that they
pay a lot of attention

00:13:18.623 --> 00:13:21.720
to what could go wrong,
what's the downside.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.780
And that's well
captured in this quote

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.067
from Ragen Steinke of
Westwood Management.

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:29.650
"The very first thing we do when
we start to analyze a company

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.580
is to ask ourselves
how far the stock

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.820
price would fall
if we were wrong.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.970
It's not some back of
the envelope calculation,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.590
but a full assessment looking
at liquidation asset values

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.860
and stressing the business
model and valuation levels

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.200
under any number
of bad scenarios."

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.540
"If the downside is more
than 30% from today's price,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.770
it's unlikely we'll
invest, regardless

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.900
of the upside potential.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.730
If we can't establish a concrete
downside number, which probably

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.580
means it isn't far from
100%, we absolutely

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.510
won't buy the stock."

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.950
"Going through this
first sets the tone

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.390
we want to set in our research.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.490
Rather than start looking
to convince ourselves

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.710
why we should buy
something, we start out

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.530
trying to prove why
we shouldn't buy it.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.620
We try to keep that
level of skepticism

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.510
alive throughout the process."

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.580
I think that's a hallmark
of value investors, that

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.880
kind of-- any investor
has to have some optimism.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.580
You wouldn't invest
if you weren't

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.520
optimistic about a
company's prospects.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.210
But skepticism is
kind of a hallmark

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.680
I think of a good
investor, and really

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.180
thinking about what
could go wrong.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.970
It's great if a
stock could double,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.590
but if that stock
could go to zero,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.100
you should think about that.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.710
So Whitney will
speak in more detail

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.110
about how smart investors
go about determining

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.280
what a stock is worth.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.320
But even if you're
able to do that well,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.790
there are a lot of things that
can trip you up as an investor.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.810
And a lot of that revolves
around anything doing

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:59.230
with money can set off all
kinds of irrational responses

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.630
on people's parts.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.400
It could be you're assuming
that what just happened

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.630
is what's going
to happen forever.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.880
Or you're panicking because
your stock went down

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.340
and it feels really bad to
have money evaporate like that.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.140
You could be that you're only
looking for evidence that

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.820
confirms what you already
believe and you're really

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.220
ignoring evidence that
disconfirms what you already

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:27.720
believe.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.940
So these are the types of things
that can throw people off,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.439
and this is the reason why it
is so hard to beat the market.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:36.820
People make a lot of behavioral
and emotional mistakes.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.440
And I think one
of the things that

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.110
sets really good
investors apart is

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.469
they're able to deal
with that pretty well,

00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:45.260
however they do it.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.760
Whether it's just
innate wiring or it's

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.330
they've learned
it over time, you

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:57.100
have to control your
basest instincts somewhere.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.760
I have a couple
quotes here from two

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.220
very longtime, very successful
investors, one of whom

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.569
is Seth Klarman of
the Baupost Group.

00:16:04.569 --> 00:16:06.360
"As Graham, Dodd and
Buffett have all said,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.470
you should always
remember that you

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.200
don't have to swing
at every pitch.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.780
You can wait for opportunities
that fit your criteria,

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.220
and if you don't find
them, patiently wait.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.090
Deciding not to panic
is still a decision."

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.450
And that's just-- I mean
everyone's probably felt it.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:27.080
Like if you were an investor and
you lived through 2008, 2009,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.660
it feels really bad.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.940
Reading the paper was really
hard, and it feels bad.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.900
And there was a
really strong tendency

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.790
in those cases to
just want to get out.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.190
Make the pain go away.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.630
And that's perfectly natural.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.520
It's evolutionary
in a lot of ways,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.670
but it's not the greatest
thing to do as an investor.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.560
The person who panicked
and sold in March of 2009

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.400
and then was so scared
that they haven't

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.250
gone in for the last five years,
they've left a lot of money

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.170
on the table and
that's a big mistake.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.260
This is another
quote from a guy who

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.800
is a very longtime investor.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.886
He's in his 70s and he
still really does well,

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:13.260
and he just very
matter of factly

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.516
said, "I honestly don't feel any
of the emotional ups and downs

00:17:16.516 --> 00:17:18.099
from the market's
day to day activity.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.119
I just don't worry about
short-term volatility."

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.910
I think that's something
as an investor you

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.980
have to learn how to deal with.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.940
I guess my last thought is
just one about humility.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.880
There's no question that
confidence and conviction

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.450
are essential elements
to being a good investor.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.060
But as we say in the book,
like pepperoni pizza and fine

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.930
scotch, too much of a good
thing can cause problems.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.660
So the message is
not to ever think

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.066
you've got it all figured
out as an investor,

00:17:54.066 --> 00:17:55.440
and that's probably
true in life.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.530
But don't assume you've got it,
you've got this thing nailed,

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:04.330
because the market will
inevitably humble you.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.950
So here's a quote from
Kyle Bass on that.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.920
"You obviously need to
develop strong opinions

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.710
and to have the conviction
to stick with them when

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.959
you believe you're right,
even when everybody else may

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.037
think you're an idiot.

00:18:15.037 --> 00:18:16.620
But where I've seen
ego get in the way

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.730
is by not always being
open to questions

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.979
and to input that
could change your mind.

00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:22.520
If you can't ever
admit you're wrong,

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.311
you're more likely to
hang onto your losers

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:28.840
and sell your winners, which
is not a recipe for success."

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.950
So I'm going to turn
it now over to Whitney

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.630
who will try to shed some light
on whether Google stock is

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.812
worth owning today.

00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.520
WHITNEY TILSON: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.590
Thanks for joining us.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.410
So let's talk about Google.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.020
And I have a history
here with Google.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.540
And before I show it--
and I run a hedge fund.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.470
Started-- this is my 16th year.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.840
This is my track record
after my usurious fees, net

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.220
to investors.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.880
And the only reason I show it is
I'm not here promoting my fund,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.150
but rather I'm going to show
you how spectacularly wrong

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.380
I can be.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.460
And I just want you to not
think I'm the world's stupidest

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.820
investor.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.730
So very, very few investors
beat the market over time,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.781
and so I think it's
a good track record.

00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.280
It's not a spectacular
track record,

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.620
but it's a good track record.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.050
Very few managers
beat the market

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.174
over a long period of time.

00:19:24.174 --> 00:19:27.210
I've done so, despite every
once in a while making

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.520
a spectacularly bad call.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.547
So a little over 10
years ago in an article

00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:33.630
I wrote for The Motley
Fool called "The Tech Stock

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.440
Opportunity," I wrote actually
something reasonably smart

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.820
here initially that I think
the tech sector offers

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.530
fertile ground for
value investors.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.750
A lot of great companies
growing rapidly,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.440
strong balance sheets,
and very importantly,

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.350
a lot of crazy investors.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.590
If you are a sound
and rational investor,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.500
you want to go to
places, you want

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.190
to compete with
irrational people.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.425
Because a company misses
an earnings estimate

00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:04.660
and they drop the stock 50%,
when the value of the company

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.270
has not changed by
50% in all likelihood.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.590
Similarly, you want
to buy something

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.559
where the stock might rise
back to intrinsic value,

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.850
but then investors get euphoric
and give you the chance

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.860
to hang on, and it'll
trade at double or triple

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.077
or quadruple intrinsic value.

00:20:18.077 --> 00:20:19.910
That's where you really
make a lot of money.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.800
So that's what I was
pointing out here.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.410
But then I digressed
in this article

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.610
to a company that had recently
gone public named Google.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.920
And this is what I
wrote about Google.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.559
I said, "There's a huge
difference between Dell

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.600
and Google, both are lumped
into the tech sector.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.320
I'd argue that Dell is primarily
a manufacturing, assembling,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.760
sales and service business,
not a technology company.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.635
Dell doesn't care which
hardware and software

00:20:45.635 --> 00:20:47.850
products wins the
technology wars.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.922
It simply buys, assembles,
and sells and supports

00:20:49.922 --> 00:20:51.130
whatever its customers want."

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.100
"So in short, I think the odds
are very high, say 80% to 90%

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.750
that Dell is a major computer
company in 20 years."

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.922
And that actually has
been proven right I think.

00:20:59.922 --> 00:21:02.130
And by the way, I wasn't
recommending the Dell stock,

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.130
which was very
overvalued at the time,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.180
and that was correct as well.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.980
However, then,
eating crow, I said,

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.990
"Google, in contrast,
more typical tech company,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.140
one that must invest heavily
to remain on the cutting

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.840
edge or its customers
will quickly and easily

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840
flock to competitors.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.100
Just as Google
came out of nowhere

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.350
to unseat Yahoo as the leading
search engine, so might

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.940
another company
do this to Google.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.537
I admire Google and what
it has accomplished,

00:21:23.537 --> 00:21:25.870
and I'm a happy user, but I'm
quite certain that there's

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:29.280
only a fairly shallow, narrow
moat around its business."

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.240
Making it worse,
I then continued.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.986
"Think about it.

00:21:32.986 --> 00:21:35.110
What are the odds that
Google is the leading search

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.210
engine in five years,
much less 20 years?

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.120
50-50 at best I
suspect, and I'd wager

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.990
that odds are at least 90% that
its profit margins and growth

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.510
rate will be materially
lower five years from now.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.980
Yet investors appear ready
to value this company

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.480
as much as $36 billion."

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.950
I guess this was on
the eve of the IPO.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.350
"Nearly 200 times
trailing earnings.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.070
And by the way, about
12 times revenues."

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.620
Google at the time had about
three billion in revenues.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.959
"Ha!

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:03.500
Google with the same market cap
as McDonald's, a stock I own?

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:03.810
Ha!

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.785
I believe it is virtually
certain that Google stock will

00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.710
be highly disappointing to
investors foolish enough

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.460
to participate in its
over-hyped offering.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.844
You can hold me to that."

00:22:12.844 --> 00:22:14.760
Remember John was just
talking about humility?

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.920
This is a business
that keeps you humble.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.930
So by the way, the
margins actually

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.380
have sort of been stable, maybe
even declined a little bit,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.850
so I wasn't completely
wrong that margins

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.990
would come under
pressure over time.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.290
But where I was spectacularly
wrong was the growth.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.560
Revenue has gone up more than
20x in the last 10 years.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.010
It's been one of the most
spectacular growth success

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.160
stories over time.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.850
So if you can go
to the next slide.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.840
And that has translated with
a little decline in margins,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.950
but basically that growth
has fallen straight

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.020
to the bottom line, and earnings
from continuing operations

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.400
have gone up to
over $12 billion.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.350
That's translated into
earnings per share, excluding

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.320
extra items, of
almost $20 a share.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.190
So not surprisingly,
the stock has followed.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.780
Stocks over time tend
to follow the earnings,

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.330
and the stock has been
approximately more

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.640
than a 10-bagger since I
said it was wildly overvalued

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.640
and should be
avoided at all costs.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.710
So what did I miss?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.260
And by the way,
just as a general,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.380
there are a lot of
companies out there today,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.450
small companies, three
billion in revenues trading

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:37.570
at 12 times revenues
and 200 times earnings.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.890
Salesforce.com has about four
billion in revenues or so,

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.330
trending toward five and
1/2 over the next year.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.800
Trades about eight
times revenues,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.920
120 times next year's earnings.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.420
And so investors
are sort of betting

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.240
that that's going to look like
Google over the next 10 years

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.890
or so, and I think the odds
of that are extremely low.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.770
In general, you guys
are the outlier.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.860
As a general rule, 99
out of 100 companies

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.770
that grade at such
extreme valuations

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.610
turn out to be lousy, if not
catastrophic investments.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.490
So I'm not convinced
I was necessarily

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.890
wrong to say a prudent value
investor should probably not

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.990
speculate in a very hyped IPO.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.970
Statistically speaking, it was
probably pretty sound advice.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.700
But you guys were the outlier.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.820
You guys were the one in
100 that did pull it off.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.340
So what did I miss?

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.780
I missed Google's moat.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.660
It seemed to me that anyone
could just easily switch,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.400
and so forth.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.070
And theoretically,
someone easily could.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.245
But on the other hand,
people get into habits,

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.620
tend to be very sticky, and
if you have a better product,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.161
you're constantly innovating,
stay ahead of your competitors,

00:24:45.161 --> 00:24:46.500
that moat can build over time.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.800
And I missed the very powerful
virtuous cycle at work

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.700
with Google.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.520
A large user base translates
into large advertiser base,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.590
better monetization,
more R&amp;D dollars,

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.940
yielding a better product,
which a better product is

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.080
a high barrier to entry,
which then attracts

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.310
more of a user base, et cetera.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.280
By the way, I made nine times
my money in the last two years

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.050
on Netflix.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.561
I was initially at
one time shorted.

00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:10.560
And by the way, at least
I was not stupid enough

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.360
to short Google.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.280
OK, so I've never lost
any money on Google.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.750
I just haven't made
any money on it.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.650
Netflix I was dumb
enough to short

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.335
because I thought anyone
can stream movies, whatever.

00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:23.430
And then I came to
realize, Netflix

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.330
has a similar
virtuous cycle going

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.760
on where they have
80% of the streaming

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760
customers in the world.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.920
They then take all that
revenue and buy great content,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.780
which then attracts
80% to 90% to 100%

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.510
of every incremental new
streaming customer on earth

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.090
is joining Netflix, which they
can reinvest in better content.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.215
And the price of
admission now, Netflix

00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:45.760
is spending over $3
billion a year on content.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.780
The price of admission
is now very, very high.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.057
Even if a much bigger
company-- a Google.

00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:52.140
Amazon is trying to do it.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.890
If Google wanted
to try and do it,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.430
it's now going to cost billions
and billions of dollars.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.040
And from a company that's
generating no revenue,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.150
to even open your doors
and start a service,

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.290
you've got to license $3
billion worth of content.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.640
Whereas Netflix has
50 million paying

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.880
subscribers paying
for that content.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.650
So Netflix I thought
was a commodity business

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.720
is looking like a
winner-take-all business.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.510
You guys looked like
a commodity business,

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.340
and I think in
many of your areas

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.090
you are a winner take
all business because

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.024
of this kind of virtuous cycle.

00:26:22.024 --> 00:26:23.690
It's very, very
powerful and something I

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.620
didn't appreciate 10 years ago.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.530
I appreciate it more today.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.192
So let's talk about
the stock today.

00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:31.150
It's a couple days old.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.310
It closed today, its right
around 5.37 right now.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.092
$368 billion market cap.

00:26:36.092 --> 00:26:37.800
You've got a ton of
cash, sliver of debt,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.010
$316 billion enterprise.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.380
Like most tech companies,
a large expense

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.380
is stock-based compensation.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.680
Accounting rules
require you to expense

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.350
that as if it were cash,
but it is a non-cash charge.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.760
So Google, like a lot of
tech companies, analysts,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.510
they report earnings excluding
the stock-based comp.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:02.320
I tend to figure I don't care if
a company pays cash or dilutes

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.870
me via options that are worth
a certain amount of cash.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.130
So I tend to be
pretty conservative.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.630
But these numbers will be
lower, about $5 a share

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.700
lower than the earnings
per share numbers

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.150
that you might see, because
about $5 a share of earnings

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.190
are in non-cash, you guys are
partially paid in options.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.190
So reasonable people
can disagree about that.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.160
If you want to x that out
and use EBITDA number.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.230
So Google's trading right now
at about 26 and 1/2 times this

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.840
year's priced earnings,
multiple, 21 times next year's.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.690
Those multiples.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.360
That would come
down by a few points

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.890
if you exclude stock-based
comp, which most analysts do.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.650
And then EBITDA numbers,
multiples as well.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.530
So what is it saying
is we're in the market

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.360
probably 16 times
earnings for the S&amp;P 500.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.860
So any way you could
it you guys are

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.120
at some premium to that,
but not a crazy premium.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.250
But you guys are growing
your revenues 20% a year.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.620
Average S&amp;P company's growing
their revenues maybe 5% a year.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.390
So you guys have
massively higher margins,

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.000
returns on capital, et cetera.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.770
So it's a far superior
company trading

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.600
at a premium price, but
not a crazy premium price.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.910
So that's sort of interesting.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.710
I typically like buying out
of favor companies where

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.300
a sentiment is
extremely negative,

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.770
stocks near a 52-week
low, et cetera.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.770
Sort of betting on a
stabilization and/or

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.370
turnaround.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.730
That's typically what I do.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.210
But every once in a
while-- I bought Netflix

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.130
after it crashed from 300
down to around $50 a share.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.550
When I thought, look, they
can't fix the business.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.630
Somebody should buy
them for $3 billion.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.650
I think, by the
way, Google has made

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.861
a number of very savvy
acquisitions over the years.

00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.860
Somebody should be kicking
themselves at Google.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.050
You didn't buy Netflix when it
had a $3.2 billion market cap.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.460
It was a great business.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.430
It is a great business.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:02.070
So I'm actually sort of
intrigued with Google.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.109
The other thing,
by the way, is it's

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.900
such a big company with
such a large market

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.630
cap it's hard to make a
lot of money buying things

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.440
with multi-hundred
billion market caps.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.970
I mean just size is
sort of an anchor.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.630
I run a pretty small fund.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.900
I tend to look for
smaller companies.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.630
But it's pretty interesting.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.920
I'm intrigued by Google.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.020
I'm going to do some
more work on it.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.462
So let's just talk about
last quarter's earnings.

00:29:26.462 --> 00:29:28.170
You guys have probably
already seen this,

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.030
but revenues grew 20%.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.790
Margins got squeezed.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.780
Expenses rose a little
faster than revenues,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.600
which squeezed margins.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.880
Depending on whether
you want to look

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.480
at non-GAAP or GAAP
earnings, earnings either

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.849
went up or down a little bit.

00:29:41.849 --> 00:29:43.390
But the real questions
to think about

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.070
is can the company
continue to grow

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.610
at least sort of
high teens, 20% rate,

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.210
and will those margins
at least stabilize?

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.090
And when you think about
Google, by the way, if Google

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.540
were to separate
itself out and spin off

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.520
Google Fiber and the
self-driving car stuff,

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.110
like Google is-- a
lot of those expenses

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.945
are investing in things that
are currently not generating

00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:07.445
any revenue.

00:30:07.445 --> 00:30:09.480
It's just straight out losses.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.540
Like actually, I
think a reasonable way

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.860
to think about Google would
be to sort of take out

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.982
all the money losing stuff
where-- these pie in the sky

00:30:18.982 --> 00:30:21.440
things-- where Google actually
has a pretty darn good track

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.880
record of developing really
valuable things down the road.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.020
And I might give
Google credit for that

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.380
and say, how much is their
core business really earning,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.920
x-ing out all these expenses.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.499
And it might be quite
a bit of expenses,

00:30:35.499 --> 00:30:37.540
and you might actually
say Google's core business

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.910
trading for 15 times earnings
or something like a market

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.770
multiple, and then you're
getting a free call option

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.790
on stuff that--
self-driving cars.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.990
If you guys nail that, that
could change the world.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:52.152
That's a worldwide game changer,
and you guys will own it.

00:30:52.152 --> 00:30:54.360
I'm not sure I'd give
Microsoft much credit for that.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.660
They have a horrible track
record of just pissing money

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.190
away over the years, and
projects and acquisitions

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.670
that just create no value.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.240
And Microsoft shareholders
are sort of rebelling.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.910
But you guys seem to be
a lot better at that.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.480
So again, that would
be the argument

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.850
for owning Google stock
is is that it's really not

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.500
as expensive as it appears
because they're expensing--

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.460
a lot of their expenses,
their core business

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.950
is actually even much more
profitable than it appears.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.850
One of the world's
greatest businesses.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.400
And then they're investing
in a lot of new stuff

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.900
where there's
likelihood to pay off.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.025
So this gives you a sense--
by the way, again, what

00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:36.340
I sort of missed is is companies
that have a lot of optionality

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.087
to get into new businesses,
make acquisitions, et cetera.

00:31:39.087 --> 00:31:40.670
So this was the three
billion revenues

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.790
when I was disparaging
the company.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.510
And the core business grew 10x.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.080
But then stuff that didn't
even exist back then

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.890
doubled to 20x revenue growth.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.490
So this is cool, right?

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.160
And if you think this kind
of thing can continue,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.480
things that don't exist, don't
generate a dollar of revenue

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.040
today, like Google Fiber,
self-driving cars or whatever,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.700
and that this kind of
thing continues again,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.220
this stock may look
really cheap today

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.610
if you can develop some amazing
stuff and start to monetize it.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.110
So I think this
is the last slide

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.900
and then we can do Q&amp;A,
which is if you make

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.980
a case for the stock today is
look at the pieces overall.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.980
You continue to grow
your revenues 20%

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.340
for the next four years, if
your margins just stay flat,

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.820
that means the earnings
go up 20% a year.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.720
That's a double in four years.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.910
A 20 multiple or so, if you
can continue to grow at 20%

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.841
is a reasonable thing to assume.

00:32:45.841 --> 00:32:48.340
Might go up, might go down, but
that's actually probably not

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:48.881
unreasonable.

00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:51.980
And therefore, the stock just
follows that same trajectory.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.060
And making 20% compounded
over the next four years

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.170
isn't spectacular, but
it's pretty darn good.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.000
If I thought this
stock was very likely,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.220
with low risk of downside,
very likely to be a double

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.900
in four years, I don't know
all day, on a real high quality

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.360
company where I think I can
double my money in for years.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.000
So that's sort of what I'll be
digging into because there are

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.890
very few companies this size
that can grow at that rate.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:24.870
Already at $66 billion, already
at a $300+ billion market cap

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.640
that can double again
from there in four years.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.340
That's pretty rare, but you
guys have been doing it.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.000
So I certainly wouldn't
bet against it.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.370
The question is is for a
guy who only owns 15 stocks,

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.920
is this one of
the best 15 stocks

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.050
in the universe I can find?

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.040
That's the real question.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.220
So with that, do you
want to come up, John.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.276
We're happy to take questions.

00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:49.400
AUDIENCE: I'd like to ask you
how to learn from mistakes.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.060
So you said that Google
was one of your mistakes,

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.200
but you also said that it's
like buying a lottery ticket.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.060
Like even if you
win the lottery,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.290
it doesn't mean that it was
a right decision to make.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:07.340
So I just want to ask if
you make a wrong decision,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.110
do you learn from it,
or do you say, OK,

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.030
this is just how it happens?

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.159
WHITNEY TILSON: Yeah.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.670
It's hard.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.150
In the investing world-- the
analogy I would give you is

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.639
is if you walk through
a dynamite factory

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.409
with an open torch, and you
get through to the other side

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.505
safely, was it a good idea?

00:34:25.505 --> 00:34:26.796
And the answer's of course not.

00:34:26.796 --> 00:34:28.587
It was an idiotic thing
to do, and the fact

00:34:28.587 --> 00:34:31.392
that you didn't die
was just good luck.

00:34:31.392 --> 00:34:32.850
But you should
never do that again.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.350
So the investing
world has-- you can

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.190
learn a lot of false lessons
in the investing world.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.610
You can totally screw up
the analysis and make money,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.139
and by the way, can do good
analysis and lose money, right?

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:47.329
So learning from mistakes isn't
as simple as simply saying,

00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:48.870
well, did I make
money or lose money,

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:54.800
because the goal of investing is
to make high probability bets.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.520
But even the highest
probability bets

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.640
sometimes work against you.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.590
So the lessons-- but here,
I do think one of things

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.010
I've learned, like I was
trained as a traditional value

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.460
investor in the Warren
Buffett kind of school.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.570
You don't look at tech
stocks, et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:17.040
And I was trained to think
about the competitive moats

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.920
of companies-- Coke's brand
or Costco's low cost service

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.790
or whatever.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:25.850
And what's happened
in the last 10 years,

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.840
the kind of companies that
have been created that

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.700
are almost like
virtual companies, that

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.040
can grow very rapidly to
become global companies

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.880
with enormously
high profit margins

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.220
without the need to invest
incremental capital.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.360
So you guys can grow to
countries all over the world

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.450
and you don't have
to manufacture stuff,

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.160
you don't have to ship
it, you have no inventory.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:53.480
These are light business models
that create returns on capital

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.860
at a rate and a scale and
a scope, a global scope,

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.990
and a speed that has
never existed in history.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.190
And it really requires you
to-- you can either just

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.690
say-- you can be
like Warren Buffett

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.170
and just say I don't
understand any of this

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.030
and I'm just going to stay away.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.870
I'm not going to short it, not
going to long it, go long it.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.450
I want to understand
it because I

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.850
plan to be investing
for another 50 years.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:18.150
And so the real learning
here, from getting my head

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.600
handed to me, being short
Netflix before finally

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.860
appreciating it and making
nine times my money.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.610
I flipped around.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.440
So in other words, my
learning from getting

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.885
killed on the short side is I
went and did a lot more work.

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:33.200
And losing millions of
dollars focuses the mind.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.150
So losing millions
of dollars forced

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.899
me to rethink what
I was missing here.

00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:39.690
Now sometimes you're
not missing something.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.190
Sometimes a short runs against
you and you're absolutely right

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.380
and you've just
got to be patient

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.921
and your thesis will eventually
play out, because being early

00:36:45.921 --> 00:36:49.340
and being wrong look the same,
either long or short, right?

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.900
But in the case
of Netflix, you've

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.980
got to keep an open mind,
and I did keep an open mind

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.154
in this case, developed a
much greater appreciation

00:36:59.154 --> 00:36:59.820
for the company.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.540
So when I covered-- I've
short it from 80 to 200.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.520
I covered my short.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.550
It went to 300.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.600
I felt pretty smart.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.410
Then it felt eventually to 50.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.735
It fell 80% in a matter
of about three months.

00:37:10.735 --> 00:37:12.610
And I want to kill
myself, because everything

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.719
I predicted in my
short thesis came true.

00:37:14.719 --> 00:37:16.010
And I said, Whitney, you idiot.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.980
My learning was is don't
get scared out of a short.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.500
You have conviction
in it, right?

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.410
But that actually
wasn't the right

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.200
learning, though,
because Netflix

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.840
was a massively better
company than I thought.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.820
And the key pillars
of my short thesis

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.528
were there's no moat
around the business,

00:37:30.528 --> 00:37:32.822
and sort of wacky
management, and competitors

00:37:32.822 --> 00:37:34.530
are going to come in
and eat their lunch.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.630
All of my pillars of my
short thesis were wrong.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.190
I was right to cover, no matter
what happened to the stock.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.800
But what it did is is by gaining
appreciation of the company,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.390
I was ready to pounce
when the stock collapsed.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.820
And so that's a great example.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.510
I wish I were that
open-minded and learned

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.750
and had great experiences
like that more often.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.874
So that's a good case study.

00:37:59.874 --> 00:38:00.790
Anything to add, John?

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.248
JOHN HEINS: I would
say a lot of it

00:38:02.248 --> 00:38:05.586
is understand why
you made a mistake.

00:38:05.586 --> 00:38:10.390
It may be that you didn't
really make a mistake.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.080
The analysis was
good, it was sound.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.790
And then something else
happened that made it go wrong.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:18.269
And so you shouldn't
necessarily--

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:20.060
if you understand why
you made the mistake,

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.610
you shouldn't
necessarily just not

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:24.868
do that exact same
thing again next time.

00:38:24.868 --> 00:38:25.534
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:26.710
I have two questions.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.224
The first one is your
portfolio has about 15 stocks.

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:31.697
It has a very small
number, right?

00:38:31.697 --> 00:38:34.760
So how do you screen off
the thousands of stocks?

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.120
What are some of the
top three or five

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.261
factors you use as filters?

00:38:39.261 --> 00:38:40.010
That's number one.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.170
Number two is my
general impression

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:46.200
is that the market tend to
ignore balance sheet items.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.390
So just like a lot of cash,
investment, the P/E number,

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.520
totally ignore balance sheet.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.270
What do you think?

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.934
How do you think
about that issue?

00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:58.100
WHITNEY TILSON: Well, I use
a four-step-- I actually

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.849
have it taped to the
wall next to my desk.

00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:01.770
My four-step process
is first, when

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.020
I look at any new stock
is circle of competence.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.930
Do I know something
about this industry?

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.570
Is it knowable?

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.100
Is the future predictable here?

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.890
It's almost like
a yes or no thing.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.962
There is some gray
area where maybe I

00:39:16.962 --> 00:39:19.420
don't know it very well, but
I think I can do some research

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:19.961
and get some.

00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:21.140
So circle of competence.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.864
Then it's do I like the company.

00:39:25.864 --> 00:39:27.530
And I look at financial
characteristics,

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:29.420
cash flows, return
on equity, et cetera.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.569
So I evaluate the company.

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:32.860
And by the way, I'll invest
in sort of crummy companies

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.650
if it's cheap enough.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.320
But ideally I'm looking for
higher quality businesses

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.260
that I can compound over time.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.030
Then I look at the industry,
because a good company

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:50.480
in a crummy industry,
eh, is going to struggle.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.394
So it's a company and industry
analysis, then management.

00:39:55.394 --> 00:39:56.560
And that's really important.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.660
Both, do they run
the business well?

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.040
Do they allocate capital well?

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.500
And do they treat
shareholders well?

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.010
And here's the thing.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.200
I can find-- right now I can
find hundreds of companies

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.710
that I understand really well,
great industry and company

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.140
dynamics, wonderful management,
treats shareholders great.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.710
So what's the problem?

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.050
The stock's not cheap.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.084
Everybody else on
earth can understand it

00:40:23.084 --> 00:40:25.500
and likes the company and the
industry and the management,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.580
and therefore, the
stock price reflects it.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.780
The real key is to then just
sit there and sit there and sit

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.970
there and sit there and be
super patient until I can find

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:39.220
a situation where the stock
price is well below what

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.260
I think it should be,
based on my analysis.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.575
And usually what
that requires is

00:40:45.575 --> 00:40:49.170
is for there to be
some-- the market thinks

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.370
one thing, the variant
perception that John talked

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.150
about.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.970
To make money investing you
only need to do two things.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:41:00.040
You need to bet against the
crowd-- that's the easy part.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.750
And then you just
have to be right.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.220
That's the hard part.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.190
Because the crowd
is usually right.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.640
The crowd was right on Google.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.300
If anything, the crowd didn't
appreciate Google enough.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.800
We now know, stock
was an 11-bagger.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.880
So that's the hard part.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.960
It just means being super,
super patient, and recognizing

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.840
that nine out of 10 times
where you think your variant

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.870
perception is right, nine out
of 10 times the crowd is right.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.800
The crowd is very wise
and powerful and smart,

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.200
because there are a lot of
really smart people picking

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.860
over.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.767
And every time you
think, oh, this company's

00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:33.350
a really great company
and the stock's

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.640
been unfairly beaten up, nine
out of 10 times you're wrong.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.970
The company's in full scale
collapse and it's a value trap.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.880
So what I try and do
is once a month, once

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.050
every two months
or three months,

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.600
I look at a lot of
different things.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.295
It's like a pitcher
pitching to you in baseball.

00:41:51.295 --> 00:41:53.420
You sit there and they
don't call balls or strikes.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.586
You can just sit there and
take pitches all day long

00:41:55.586 --> 00:41:58.110
and don't swing at anything
that's a little iffy.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.505
Wait till just something
that you just in your gut

00:42:01.505 --> 00:42:06.520
you know that I know I'm right
on this one and the market's

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.440
wrong on this one.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.730
And that's when you swing.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.350
JOHN HEINS: His second question
was about balance sheets?

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.370
Is that your perception
that-- I don't

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.460
know if that's universally held,
the idea that balance sheet

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.710
assets are ignored.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:26.240
Actually, it's one of the--
it is a way value investors

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.960
I think find value is that
there isn't a recognition.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.280
There isn't a recognition
that, well, the stock's really

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.960
pretty cheap when you
take out the cash,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.430
or maybe that there are assets
on the books that are just

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.150
wildly more valuable than
they currently trade.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.730
So that is a typical
way in which investors

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.610
do assess something to
be inefficiently priced.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.460
So I wouldn't say it always
happens, but it certainly it

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.870
is a way to find value.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.780
WHITNEY TILSON: I
mean historically,

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.050
Ben Graham was a balance
sheet investor-- just

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.190
buy things net nets.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:03.070
Things trading at discount
to readily ascertainable

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.910
liquidation value, excluding
property, plant and equipment.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.050
Just like accounts receivable,
cash, minus all liabilities,

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.330
et cetera.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.717
And Buffett moved away from
that for a very good reason.

00:43:12.717 --> 00:43:14.550
They tend to be super
low quality companies.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.170
A lot of value traps.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.670
Difficult to do if you're
managing any kind of material

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.390
pool of capital, because there
tend to be nooks and crannies.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.120
Every once in a while,
late 2008, early 2009,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.274
they are statistically cheap on
a balance sheet basis companies

00:43:29.274 --> 00:43:31.690
where you could have gone and
just bought a basket of them

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.000
and made quite a bit of money.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.560
But it's hard to do.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.470
Only once every 10 years
does that sort of work.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.280
So usually during times of
market panic, and at that point

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.980
you're probably better off
buying higher quality companies

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.340
that you just don't
buy for a quick double,

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.815
but if all the stocks
are really depressed,

00:43:49.815 --> 00:43:51.649
you can get a long run on them.

00:43:51.649 --> 00:43:52.940
Is there a question back there?

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.340
Or here.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.930
Go ahead with the microphone,
and then you next.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:55.960
Thanks for the talk.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.030
I was wondering if you could
add some commentary on books

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:01.360
like "A Random Walk On
Wall Street," or companies

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.340
like Wealthfront,
which talk about well

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.370
diversified balanced portfolios,
as opposed to maybe trying

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.390
to choose 15 stocks or whatever.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.474
WHITNEY TILSON: Yes.

00:44:11.474 --> 00:44:13.140
Most of my recommendation
for all of you

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.900
would just be just
buy some index funds

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.040
and then hang on to some of
your Google options or whatever,

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.930
as long as you don't let it
be 80% of your net worth.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.400
In all likely is
probably not a good idea.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.790
But my parents have
some money with me,

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.040
and they have some
money in index funds.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.130
It is hard.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.520
Boy is it hard picking stocks.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.800
And doing it without a lot
of training and experience,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.320
as a part-time thing, is
probably not a good idea.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.920
I don't try and write code.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.610
Why should you guys
try and pick stocks?

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.730
Trust me, I know a lot
more about it than you do.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.690
I spent 16 years getting
scars on my back,

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.560
and I graduated from
Harvard Business School

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.624
in the top of my class.

00:44:52.624 --> 00:44:53.290
Whatever, right?

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.060
Like I've got a lot of training,
plus a lot of experience.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.540
This is an experience-based
business, and very, very--

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:07.560
and it's a business that 80+% of
people engaged in the business

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.220
full-time really don't
know what they're doing,

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.160
and are going to do
worse than an index fund.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.820
So I'd like to think
I'm in the 20% that

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.930
has enough experience
and enough training,

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.940
is sort of smart and
clever enough to do better

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.870
for my investors
than index funds.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.964
But as a general rule,
it's hard to pick stocks.

00:45:29.964 --> 00:45:31.380
It's hard to pick
managers who are

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.130
skilled at picking
stocks over time.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.120
Because I can tell you we've
had a six year bull market.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.220
There are a lot of bull market
geniuses out there right now

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.642
who have just been piling in
to the most speculative stocks,

00:45:42.642 --> 00:45:44.100
and they've been
rewarded for that.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.870
And so they have the
best track records

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.502
over the last six years.

00:45:47.502 --> 00:45:49.460
And a lot of them weren't
running money in '08.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.810
So the most important
thing I tell you in looking

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.127
at a manager is look at how they
did in '08, and that can tell

00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:57.460
you what kind of risk takers
they are and how they might

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.530
form in a down market.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.363
But the problem is the
average money manager

00:46:00.363 --> 00:46:02.690
hasn't been in
business six years.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.930
And so therefore, you can't
see how they did in '08.

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:09.920
So that's why I'm a
big fan of index funds.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.830
Those books are
right, by and large.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:15.910
But there are also outliers
that is not random.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.450
Warren Buffett's track
record is not random.

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:19.920
He's just that
good, and there are

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.172
some guys who are that good.

00:46:22.172 --> 00:46:23.630
AUDIENCE: I just
finished your book

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.722
and it was very, very excellent.

00:46:26.722 --> 00:46:28.430
One of the things I
noticed is that a lot

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.280
of these excellent
stock experts are

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.376
very forthcoming with their
ideas and their philosophy,

00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:36.360
and very much in detail.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.100
And yet, it seems like the
vast majority of people

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.550
don't invest that way.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.210
So I was wondering based
on your experience, what

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:48.090
do you think are the three
major personality traits

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.090
or qualities required to
really understand it and do it?

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.519
Because it seems to me
that a lot of people

00:46:55.519 --> 00:46:58.060
think it has to do with being
very good at math and so forth,

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.950
but it seems like the
psychological aspect

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.140
and the discipline aspect is
actually as important or maybe

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.740
more.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.490
JOHN HEINS: And I can
start with that one,

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.060
and that's what I would
say is that I think what--

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.010
and I think even these
great investors would

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.536
say it's not because they
graduated first in their class

00:47:15.536 --> 00:47:16.660
at Harvard Business School.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.930
It's because they
have a strategy,

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.760
they have a philosophy that
they believe will work,

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.380
and it's credible
that it will work.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.780
And they are able, through the
discipline of their process,

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.750
through the discipline of
their buy and sell mechanisms,

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:37.280
they're able to stick with
that through thick or thin.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.280
And that is really hard.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.740
Joel Greenblatt-- he's quoted
several times in the book,

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.160
and he talks about it's
really hard, because you

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.150
can be wrong for-- a
lot of value investors

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.180
are struggling now.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.050
Market's gone up for
five straight years,

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.910
so they're struggling, they feel
out of sync with the market.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:03.280
And you want to just fix that,
but you have to resist that.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.250
Because fixing it means
going against what

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.145
your discipline is, and
what your process is,

00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:08.500
and what you believe in.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:14.590
And so I think an ability
through the hard times

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.360
to stick with what
you believe in

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.640
and execute it without
cutting corners

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.920
in a real disciplined way.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.480
It's really kind of basic
blocking and tackling.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.860
But I think that's what sets
a lot of these people apart.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.670
Obviously, they're very smart.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:31.720
Warren Buffett always
talks about it's not

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.970
the person with the highest
IQ that wins in investing.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.170
But clearly, Warren
Buffett is pretty smart.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.676
So yeah, it doesn't hurt.

00:48:39.676 --> 00:48:41.800
WHITNEY TILSON: So this
article I wrote three years

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.790
before the infamous
Google article.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.060
July, 2001, "Traits of
Successful Money Managers."

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.270
I framed it in two things.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.030
To be a successful stock
picker or money manager,

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.890
you had to do two things.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.920
You have to have
the right approach,

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.270
and then you have to be
able-- the right temperament.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.230
You have to be able to execute.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.563
So you have to have the right
sort of philosophy, right?

00:48:56.563 --> 00:48:58.710
So you're not trading
electrons or whatever.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.130
You're buying companies, you
only buy when it's on sale,

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:07.357
you sort of ignore the market,
focus on avoiding losses,

00:49:07.357 --> 00:49:09.190
only invest when the
odds are in your favor,

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.486
don't worry about macroeconomic
factors, et cetera, et cetera.

00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:14.110
So you have to have
the right approach.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.818
And then you have to
be the right person.

00:49:15.818 --> 00:49:17.142
And so what does that mean?

00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:18.600
You're a business
person and you're

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.750
thinking about you're
buying businesses.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.410
You have the private
equity mentality.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.070
If I could buy this entire
business for the market

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:27.810
cap, which I am buying one
share of this business,

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.190
that's what I would do.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.400
You have to be really smart.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.000
You have to have a lot of
intellectual horsepower,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.550
for sure.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.640
But then once you
reach a certain level,

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.290
the ability to crunch
numbers, mathematical ability,

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:43.480
is a pretty low importance
above a fairly basic level.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.354
And then it comes
to the mental stuff

00:49:45.354 --> 00:49:46.520
that you were talking about.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.790
So you have to be simultaneously
confident and humble.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.820
Nobody gets into this business
without a lot of confidence.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.770
It's just that's the
nature of the business.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.520
Your track record is public.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.890
Any time you're betting against
1,000, a million other people,

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.170
that is an act of arrogance.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.540
The purchase of a stock
is an act of arrogance

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.694
because you're saying
I think I'm right,

00:50:05.694 --> 00:50:07.360
and all those million
other smart people

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.160
and plus their
supercomputers are wrong.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.010
It's an act of arrogance.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.010
So you have to have
that kind of confidence.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.799
But at the same time, you
have to have the humility

00:50:16.799 --> 00:50:18.840
to recognize when something's
outside your circle

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.650
of competence.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:24.060
To recognize if your
investment thesis is wrong,

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.400
and to accept
disconfirming information

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.680
and change your mind.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.300
And sometimes very publicly
admit that you were wrong.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.590
And then you have to just
be really independent.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.580
It doesn't matter if everybody
else loves the stock.

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.670
If everybody else hates the
stock, you have to not care.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.050
You have to do your own
analysis, value the company,

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:44.770
and then buy it--
be patient enough

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.190
to buy it at sort
of half that price.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:50.570
And lastly, sort of be
patient-- long-term greedy.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:53.900
Most human beings are hardwired
try and get rich quick.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.460
Who doesn't want to
get rich quick, right?

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.360
You've got to have
the patience to be

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.160
willing to get rich slowly.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.230
And you will make money faster
with the get rich slowly

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.040
approach than with the
get rich quick approach.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.520
And lastly I'll
just say the people

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.686
who are really good at this,
they love what they do.

00:51:11.686 --> 00:51:14.040
Like I was talking with
Richie earlier and said,

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.640
people here at Google, like
a lot of people I work with

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.160
and so forth, they love
tackling challenging

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.220
intellectual problems.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.300
They love what they do.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.200
They're not here for
the money, primarily.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.510
They love what they do.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:32.280
I can tell you in my business,
the successful investors

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.060
love what they do.

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.780
It happens to be
extremely lucrative,

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.300
and nobody minds the
money, I suppose.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.160
But if you took away the money,
every single investor I know,

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.350
the good investors, would
still keep investing,

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.100
because they love the
game, the challenge,

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:51.390
the intellectual
challenge, the feedback you

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.790
get in fairly short order,
like if your analysis is

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.410
right or not.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:58.450
I think there was a
question back there.

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:01.380
I don't want to
miss your question.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.720
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to
push a little bit more

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.020
on one of the previous questions
about practical advice.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.510
And I feel a little bit
stuck because on one hand

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.320
value investing is
super attractive.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.650
It sounds really attractive,
like I want to do that.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.230
But I know I have
a full-time job

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.420
and I'm not an expert,
so I won't do it myself.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:21.030
And then finding the
right investor is

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.010
another full-time job,
and like you said,

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.160
maybe I can't do that either.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.330
And the alternative is
to invest in index funds,

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.980
and that's not value investing.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.169
That's the opposite of that.

00:52:32.169 --> 00:52:33.710
So that doesn't
sound that appealing.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:38.740
And plus, it worries me
that the owners, the market

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.670
is really just the mutual fund
guys and the pension fund guys,

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.680
and they have the
wrong incentives.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.700
So when the market
crashes they're

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.720
fine because everybody
else crashes,

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.940
and they all jump on the
train when the market grows.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.670
And so I don't feel very well
protected in those funds.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.820
And so I feel kind of stuck.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.380
And should I just say,
OK, until I'm super rich

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.170
and I can invest in hedge
funds and get the right advice

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:07.430
to find the right ones, I just
have to live with index funds?

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:13.974
Or is there anything that's
smarter for the average person?

00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:15.390
AUDIENCE: Average
Google investor.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.830
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:16.330
Yeah.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.920
Exactly.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.526
With a full-time job,
that's not an expert.

00:53:20.526 --> 00:53:22.150
JOHN HEINS: I'll
speak, because I'm not

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.440
a professional investor.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.444
But I am an active investor,
and I care a lot about it,

00:53:26.444 --> 00:53:28.360
and I've always paid a
lot of attention to it.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.570
And I would say a couple things.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:39.870
One, I still hold out the
belief that there are people

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.690
who can beat the market, and
that you can, with some work,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:48.000
you can identify who you
think can beat the market.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.780
And it's clearly not easy.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.110
And if you look at academic
studies of how well people

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:53.820
do with that, it's
not impressive.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.820
But personally, I have
chosen to believe that,

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:01.990
just like there are better brain
surgeons and better airplane

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.040
pilots, there are
better investors.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.050
And there are
things you can look

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:08.360
at in terms of what's
their philosophy.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:15.740
So a clearly articulated
value investing philosophy,

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.420
run by people who have been
through up markets and down

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.940
markets, and have, over time,
performed extremely well.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.090
I'm still willing
to say I believe

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.270
that that can beat
an index fund.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:31.850
So I'm not giving advice.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:34.010
I'm just telling
you what I would do.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.560
So I believe you can do that.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.684
But you have to
have a philosophy.

00:54:38.684 --> 00:54:40.850
Like you have to believe
that investing makes sense.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.210
You have to be able, when you
read all the materials that XYZ

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:47.150
company value investing
money manager talks about,

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:50.230
you have to really believe
that they can do it.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.840
That they're describing a
philosophy, and a process,

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.288
and a discipline
that they can do it.

00:54:56.288 --> 00:54:58.580
AUDIENCE: Are you talking
about mutual funds?

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.250
JOHN HEINS: That
would be mutual funds

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:04.350
because those are
available to everyone.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.000
So yes.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.150
There are, if you're
a value investor,

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:14.730
there are more passive
value investing funds.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:20.010
So there are ETFs, DFA, if
you know that brand name.

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:22.170
DFA funds.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.470
They'll buy a ton of
stocks, but the factors

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.400
will be value investing
related factors.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.020
So you can have a very
diversified portfolio,

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.090
but its value investing.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:38.350
So it's in between a
pure passive investing

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:39.720
and pure active investing.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.747
So that's an option.

00:55:42.747 --> 00:55:44.080
So that's one thing I would say.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.381
The second thing I've
learned since I've

00:55:46.381 --> 00:55:48.630
been doing this-- I've been
doing this for the last 10

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:54.910
years-- is I used to have
more individual stocks than I

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:59.110
do now, partly
because I enjoy it.

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:02.000
And I think my instincts
are fairly good.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.580
But I have learned in spending
the last 10 years talking

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.640
to really smart investors that
they should be a lot better

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.740
at it than I am.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.240
I mean they should be.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.980
They're spending their entire--
I have another job-- they're

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.480
spending their
entire time doing it.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:19.510
And where I really
fall down is I

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.920
think my instincts are
good on the buy side.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.700
I can recognize a
situation that I

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.320
can understand why
this is beaten down.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.080
I can have a contrarian opinion.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.870
I can have a variant perception.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.810
But where I'm a little
bit lost is selling.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.266
I don't when to sell.

00:56:36.266 --> 00:56:38.140
The only way you can
really know when to sell

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.917
is if you are, on
a regular basis,

00:56:40.917 --> 00:56:42.750
valuing what you think
the company is worth.

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.300
I'll admit, when he's talking
about his stupid mistake

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.360
with Google, I had Apple stock.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:56.770
And my son, who is now 22
years old, when he was born.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.280
I put it in his
college savings fund.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.970
And I had Apple stock that
did nothing for years.

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:05.970
And I'm thinking
oh, and I'm reading

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.710
in Barron's that this
stock, it's doomed,

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.480
nobody's going to use
Apple products anymore.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.120
Microsoft is long.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.580
And I'm holding this Apple
stock, which was quite a bit

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.030
at the time, and I was thinking,
OK, well if anybody figures out

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.400
this interaction between
technology and media,

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.310
Apple has a chance at it, so
I'm going to let that play out.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.910
So I'm flat for like five years.

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:30.620
They launched the iPod.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.420
Stock goes from 10--
really, like 10 to 12.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.770
And I go, oh, wow, 20%, great.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:38.290
Sell it.

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:44.264
And I calculated
a couple years ago

00:57:44.264 --> 00:57:46.555
when the stock-- I think
maybe it was a year or so ago.

00:57:46.555 --> 00:57:48.055
The stock was about
where it is now.

00:57:48.055 --> 00:57:54.320
And I calculated that my stake
in my little baby's college

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.980
fund would be
worth $1.3 million.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.770
So anyway, talk about trying
to learn from lessons.

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.230
The lesson there
was I actually was--

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:09.390
I was pretty smart
about Apple, but I just

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:11.950
had no idea how to think
about when to sell.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:15.240
So anyway, that
has, as a result,

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.170
I have shifted way more
of my kind of equity,

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:22.740
personal portfolio
of equities to I

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:25.540
still use actively managed
funds, whether they're

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.980
hedge funds or mutual funds.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.650
And the piece I keep
in individual stocks,

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:36.510
I do it because I like it and
it's interesting and it's fun.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:40.545
But it's not what I'm counting
on living on in retirement.

00:58:40.545 --> 00:58:42.670
WHITNEY TILSON: I'll just
add three things to that.

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.520
Number one, before you
even think about investing,

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.625
there's a great old book.

00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:50.180
It's now 15 years old, called
"The Millionaire Next Door,"

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:53.130
and it's a study of
millionaires in this country.

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:57.080
And it turns out
being clever investors

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.670
is the least most
important thing.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:02.160
The single most important thing
is live beneath your means.

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.580
If every year-- in
turns out teachers

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.640
are far more likely
to become millionaires

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.290
than doctors relative
to their income.

00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:12.005
Because for whatever reason,
teachers tend to-- my parents

00:59:12.005 --> 00:59:13.380
were both public
school teachers.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.838
So when I was born-- and met
and married in the Peace Corps

00:59:15.838 --> 00:59:17.660
and have never earned very much.

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.170
But we wore secondhand clothes.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.000
My parents never owned a
new car their entire life.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.880
And we didn't go
out to eat a lot.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.580
And my mom's a good
cook and whatever.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.610
And so every year
they just salted away

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.900
money, and you save
money-- and this

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.660
is a very high cost
of living area.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.770
But there are ways to
not be extravagant.

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.504
And so the single
most important thing

00:59:38.504 --> 00:59:40.420
you can do for your
long-term financial health

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.110
is just live beneath your means.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.230
Certainly don't be out on
margin with your credit

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:45.960
cards paying 25% interest.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.250
So that's number one.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:52.550
Number two is is unless you
really know a manager of fund

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:57.630
well or whatever, indexing
is actually a great option.

00:59:57.630 --> 01:00:00.360
If you ask me to pick a mutual
fund to recommend to you,

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.480
I know one mutual fund.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.980
Of the 8,000 mutual
funds out there,

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.580
there's only one
I would recommend,

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.950
and it's a guy I happen to know.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:09.167
Zeke Ashton runs the Centaur
total return fund or whatever.

01:00:09.167 --> 01:00:11.500
It's a relatively small fund,
but I know him personally,

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.958
and I would have
confidence in him.

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:13.680
And that's it.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.340
That's it.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.350
So just index.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.280
And I've been doing
this 16 years.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.940
And then thirdly,
you guys are sort of

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.840
in an interesting position here.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.780
You guys have friends.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:27.050
You're in the heart of
an incredibly vibrant,

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.690
dynamic area with
incredible companies.

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:36.260
And I don't think buying Tesla
or Netflix today is probably

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.450
going to be the wisest
thing, or Apple today,

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.190
after they've run
up 20x or more.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:44.700
But it's a volatile sector.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.330
And to the extent a particular
company's stock gets killed

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.520
or the whole sector
gets killed, you guys

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.410
are actually in a
reasonable position

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.980
if you talk to your
friends and you

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.130
look at where's
the talent flowing.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:00.700
It is flowing out of
Yahoo and into Facebook.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.720
And Facebook got
killed post IPO and it

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.504
went from 50 or something,
down to 20 or something.

01:01:07.504 --> 01:01:09.920
You guys actually might have
been able to figure that out,

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.320
whereas I wasn't.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.610
Because I'm not out here.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:13.990
I don't know the people at all.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:17.220
But Facebook, I think you guys
have the second best business

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.090
model in the world.

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.631
I actually think Facebook may
well have the greatest business

01:01:20.631 --> 01:01:22.230
model in the world.

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:24.350
It's a winner-take-all business.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:29.100
It's one out of every six people
on the planet is now a member.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.610
And it costs them nothing
to add new members.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:35.510
There's zero incremental cost,
so they just grow globally

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:39.150
at no incremental cost,
and it's just pure profit.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:41.280
It's pretty incredible.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.040
That business model
never existed before.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.840
You guys have very
similar dynamics.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.150
So it would be close, right?

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:49.000
Well, compare that
to a Tesla, which

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.990
is I was stupid enough to short,
and then gained appreciation

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.530
for it and think it's
an incredible company.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.625
But you see, they actually
have to make stuff,

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.250
and then they have
to ship it, and they

01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.791
have inventory, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:01:59.791 --> 01:02:03.570
For them to grow it's a very
capital-intensive process.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:07.200
They have nowhere near the
business model you guys have

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.420
or Facebook has.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.480
So you guys, I would say maybe
take 20% of your portfolio

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.600
and use your networks
and relationships

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.800
and where the smartest people
you know all go into work.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.380
And when that
company comes public,

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.960
if it craps out post
IPO or something,

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.230
don't buy at the peak.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:26.110
Wait until there's a crap out.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.830
And you guys should be able
to, with a very little amount

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.795
of your time, just based on
your own knowledge, expertise

01:02:31.795 --> 01:02:34.920
and relationships, be able to
find a few of these beaten down

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.860
companies with a small
enough amount of money

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.089
that you're not going to
stress about it too much.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.630
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned earlier, when

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.360
determining the
value of a company

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.090
that one factor is
market sentiment, how

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:48.010
people feel about the company.

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:51.050
And you also mentioned the
word supercomputer earlier.

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:52.620
So I have a question about that.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.970
One, market sentiment seems to
be, for lack of a better term,

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:56.850
crazy these days.

01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:00.630
I mean people look at a company,
it'll go up 10% on Tuesday

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.900
and down 20% on Wednesday.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.640
And maybe
supercomputers, the way

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.930
they interfere in
the market now,

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.250
may be amplifying
this by reacting

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.790
to momentum, et cetera.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.580
So with the value
of a company being

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.050
so skewed sometimes
over a very long time,

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:22.380
is value investing harder or
less effective these days?

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.995
And is that trend going to
continue in your opinion?

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:30.890
WHITNEY TILSON: It's
definitely harder now,

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.160
but I'm not sure that reflects
a long-term fundamental shift.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.560
It just tends to be hard
when markets are complacent,

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.120
and stocks, the markets
are at all-time highs.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.690
But I wouldn't call the
market out there crazy.

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:47.050
I mean the multiple of the S&amp;P
500 today's 16 or 17 times.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:51.160
It was well north of 30
times in 1999, for example.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.600
That was pure insanity.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.170
There are pockets of
foolishness out there, for sure.

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.220
But sort of getting
back to your question

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:04.310
back there about how do you
invest in today's world.

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:06.600
There's nothing real
easy right there.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.035
I mean stocks, if you
ask me the S&amp;P 500,

01:04:10.035 --> 01:04:11.410
if you just bought
an index fund,

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.970
you can make 5%, 6% a year
over the next 10 years.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:15.270
Yeah, that's not horrible.

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:16.600
It's not very exciting.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:24.550
But when bonds are
offering you virtually nil,

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.710
you just can't get discouraged,
and you can't get impatient,

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.280
and you can't swing
for the fences.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.150
Can't say, you know, I'm not
happy with an index fund.

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.270
I'm not happy with bonds.

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.646
So I'm going to go
buy Astroturf.com

01:04:34.646 --> 01:04:38.120
when it comes public, or
do something stupid, right?

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.610
So you just have to be patient.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.150
And be content.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:44.110
We're in sort of a
low return world,

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.700
so hang out, live
beneath your means,

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:50.060
save money, and wait for
better opportunities.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.310
JOHN HEINS: To your question
about the supercomputers,

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:55.080
I think what a classic
traditional value

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.870
investor would say is that the
fewer decisions about a stock

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:06.400
price that are being made
by humans, the opportunity

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.630
is actually better, because
there will be more volatility.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:11.962
Volatility is a good thing.

01:05:11.962 --> 01:05:14.170
Value investors tend to find
volatility a good thing.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:18.690
So if, for whatever
algorithm-driven reasons,

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:22.630
a stock does go down 20%--
it could go up 20% too,

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:27.330
but if it does go down 20% on
a day because of some news,

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:30.490
and then the momentum of the
stock then forced it down

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:32.540
farther than it
would go otherwise.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.930
If you're alert, if
you're paying attention,

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.739
if you have a clear sense
of what something is worth,

01:05:38.739 --> 01:05:40.030
you can take advantage of that.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:43.330
So that's what a classic
traditional value

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.060
investor will say.

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.130
They won't say it's
easy, but the volatility

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:49.810
is not something that
worries them or bothers them.

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:51.970
AUDIENCE: Value
investing historically

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:56.370
has been compared to performance
of indexes such as the S&amp;P

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.620
index.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.620
And it seems to me, as long as
they beat the market, the S&amp;P

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.420
index, for example, then
value investors are happy.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.946
But I want to question
this a little bit.

01:06:05.946 --> 01:06:08.070
So value investing has been
around for a long time.

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:12.710
And credit should be given to
people who actually discovered

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:16.440
it and pioneered this--
Ben Graham, Warren Buffett.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.750
But they're not
passive solutions.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:21.900
For example, they mention
those-- value investing

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.530
fund was mentioned.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:27.140
So isn't that actually a better
benchmark to compare against?

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.030
And a study by [INAUDIBLE],
if I remember correctly,

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:32.692
comes to mind.

01:06:32.692 --> 01:06:34.150
And this comparison
actually didn't

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:39.800
look very good to funds
that were cited earlier

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.880
in the survey.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.590
Tweedy, Browne, for example.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.720
So do you compare
against such benchmarks?

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:53.594
And do you think value
investing is still beneficial?

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.260
WHITNEY TILSON: I
guess my first thought

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.640
is is I think the
studies are correct.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.130
Mutual funds
collectively, as a whole,

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:04.190
underperform the market by
roughly their amount of fees,

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.390
plus some trading
costs, et cetera.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:08.736
And hedge funds
underperform even more,

01:07:08.736 --> 01:07:11.360
because they're just higher fees
and have higher trading costs.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.340
So collectively speaking, the
studies are exactly right.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.880
As for which benchmark I
choose to use or whatever is

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.830
it depends on what you're
trying to accomplish

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.250
and what your
investors' goals are.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.500
My investors are all
individual investors.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:33.676
My parents own nothing except--
no other funds other than mine.

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:35.550
And then I've just parked
them in index funds

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.200
for the rest of it,
and then some in cash

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.574
and bonds-- a
little bit of that,

01:07:38.574 --> 01:07:43.070
because they're in their 70s
and they want a little cushion.

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.690
So most of my investors
are individual investors

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.390
and their default
option is the S&amp;P 500.

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:50.560
So that's what I should
compare myself to, right?

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.540
But there are plenty of
institutional investors

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.190
that are looking at
a hedge fund that

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:58.050
is running a
market-neutral-- they have

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.329
the same long exposure
as short exposure,

01:08:00.329 --> 01:08:02.120
and they're just trying
to be a little more

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.036
clever on their longs
and a little more clever

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:07.380
on the shorts to grind
out 8% to 10% returns.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.950
And last year when the market
was up 34 and the hedge fund

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.220
was up 10%, those
investors were happy

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:17.260
because their alternative was
a bond or something in cash,

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.999
and they got 10%.

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:21.540
But that's the kind
of fund they were

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.080
investing in that was delivering
that kind of performance.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.560
So there's no right
or wrong answer here.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.830
It's just a question of
what the fund manager thinks

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:33.029
that they're good at and
what their strategy is,

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:37.470
and therefore,
they would say this

01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:39.550
is the benchmark we
compare ourselves to.

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:42.652
And then investors can come
in and decide whether that's

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.110
what they're looking for, and
then you evaluate the manager

01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:48.170
and see whether-- OK, do I think
the manager can execute on this

01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:50.630
and outperform the benchmark.

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:57.090
JOHN HEINS: I still believe
that value investing works.

01:08:57.090 --> 01:09:00.410
And that value investing,
it does perform over time.

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:02.580
It has to be executed well.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.750
But I believe it
works, and I think

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:09.740
research would show that
executed well, it does work.

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.359
Now, one can
question whether you

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.109
can find the right
people to do it,

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:15.410
but to the point, the
dimensional funds, those types

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:18.200
of things, it is a value
investing philosophy

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.580
that is different than an index.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.729
And if you believe
in value investing,

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:26.750
you could argue that it's
better than an index.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.850
AUDIENCE: So this question
is about you mentioning

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:32.609
that you go an extra
step, and also look

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:35.044
for the reason of
the mispricing as

01:09:35.044 --> 01:09:36.710
to why things have
been-- John mentioned

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.970
that in one of his slides.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:42.590
So what is the
rationale behind it?

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.160
Let's say there is
a stock which you

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.700
think is mispriced
because of neglect.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.160
How does that help?

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.481
How stringent is
this philosophy?

01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:52.189
Like if you're not
able to find a reason,

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.147
do you just not invest?

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.800
JOHN HEINS: I think not
everyone would say that.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.591
I chose one of the quotes where
he was talking about he really

01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:03.965
believed that that
was important.

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:10.800
I think the thought
process is that there

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.000
are a lot of things
you can miss.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.690
There may be reasons
why you missed something

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:20.930
and it was going to
make the stock go up

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:24.500
and you didn't buy it, or it was
going to make the stock go down

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.920
and you didn't think of it.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.470
So I think it's
more of a discipline

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:34.010
to identify, not just content
yourself with oh, it's cheap

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:35.820
and I don't know why.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.980
Because you may miss that.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.930
You may dismiss it.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:43.420
I missed something
important, and so try

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.900
to find out why it's mispriced.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.060
And not everyone
tells me that, but I

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.730
chose that one because
I hear that often

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.304
and it makes sense to me.

01:10:53.304 --> 01:10:54.720
WHITNEY TILSON:
Look, any time you

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.450
buy stock you're
betting against-- you

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:00.700
think it's cheap
because the market is

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.140
failing to appreciate.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.547
The market thinks
something worse

01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:05.130
about the company
than what you think.

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:07.296
That's why the stock is
trading less than intrinsic,

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:09.210
and what you believe
intrinsic value is.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.570
Being very clear
and understanding

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:14.297
what the market
believes is important

01:11:14.297 --> 01:11:16.130
so that you can figure
out what's different.

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:17.504
That would be the
problem I would

01:11:17.504 --> 01:11:20.340
have about investing
in Google stock today.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.900
Because what do I believe that
is so much better about Google

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.460
than the consensus view.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.750
Because the consensus view
is you guys are awesome,

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:30.435
and it's an incredible
company, and it

01:11:30.435 --> 01:11:32.310
has an incredible
business model,

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.740
and it's got great growth
opportunities, et cetera.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.630
So is my variant
perception that I

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.000
think you're going
to grow at 25% a year

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.140
over the next four
years, not 20% a year?

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:44.327
Or that your margins are-- I
mean these are theoretical.

01:11:44.327 --> 01:11:45.910
These are things I
would want to test.

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:50.310
Or is it my view that
a 20 or 25 multiple

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:53.519
is too low for a company with
the world's second or best--

01:11:53.519 --> 01:11:55.810
or world's best or second
best economic characteristics

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:57.750
and you really should
trade at 30 times earnings

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.249
and the market will
figure that out.

01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:00.360
So I'm betting on that.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.240
Or am I betting that your
margins are depressed because

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.460
of these very heavy investments
and stuff that's not currently

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.090
paying a return, and that
these investments are

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:12.220
going to taper down,
and therefore, margins

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.550
are going to grow a bunch.

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.730
I've got to believe
one of those things

01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:21.700
to buy one of the most
widely beloved largest market

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.400
cap stocks in the world today.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.620
So that's probably
just in my gut.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.980
That's just not what I do as
a value investor to think,

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.970
everybody loves this company,
but I love it even more.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:36.715
That rarely is a good
investment thesis.

01:12:36.715 --> 01:12:38.840
And that's not to say you
can't make a lot of money

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.580
doing that-- riding
great companies.

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:48.260
But I find it's better for me
to find a company that was once

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.820
covered in glory-- Reed Hastings
was Fortune's Man of the Year

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.900
or something like that
when the stock was at $300.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.170
And six months later,
the stock's down 80%.

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:02.220
And I'm thinking, now
that's interesting.

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.870
Is this company fundamentally
and completely broken,

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:08.370
or did they screw some
things up and are they

01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:10.170
actually making a
really bold and bad,

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:12.220
and forgoing current
profitability

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.560
to drive a long-term
winner-take-all global market

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.650
that they could dominate?

01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:21.180
And it's a rational short-term
decision to take profitability

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:24.755
from $4 a share to $0.20 a
share in one year, to invest,

01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:26.230
to buy streaming content.

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:28.027
To make that
incredibly bold bet.

01:13:28.027 --> 01:13:29.610
Amazon's been doing
that for 20 years.

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:30.830
They've never made a
profit because they

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:33.230
have a policy of taking
every single penny of profit

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.150
and plowing it back
in to future growth.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:38.260
And you know what, the market
hasn't destroyed Amazon stock.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.960
But Netflix, they were selling
an earnings growth story,

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.440
and then they decided the hell
with earnings growth, hell

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.315
with earnings at all.

01:13:44.315 --> 01:13:46.023
We're just going to
invest in the future.

01:13:46.023 --> 01:13:47.210
We're become like Amazon.

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:49.585
And all the investors that
were in there for the earnings

01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:50.950
interest story sold the stock.

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:52.533
But I was like, you
know what, I think

01:13:52.533 --> 01:13:55.190
this company could be
a world beater someday.

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:58.880
So that's more the kind
of situation I look for.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.650
But being real clear
what does the market

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:04.450
believe today, you better
believe something different,

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:06.540
you better understand
what the market believes,

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:10.730
you better be right
in what you believe.

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:11.560
Yeah.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.760
AUDIENCE: So looking at
fund as a whole, if you

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.300
drop 50%, that's a
disaster because you've

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.320
got to go 100% up just to
get back where you were.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.560
In a situation like
today where you

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.940
might think that
there's a bubble--

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.770
I mean it's hard
to find bargains.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.370
People are very optimistic.

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:31.120
What do you do with your fund?

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.670
How do you protect yourself
against a very large loss,

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:41.597
which is much more likely
at a situation like now?

01:14:41.597 --> 01:14:43.430
WHITNEY TILSON: Well,
you have a short book.

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:45.479
I'm a hedge fund, so
I'm short some stocks,

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:47.520
and that will hopefully
protect me in a downturn.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.306
The problem is shorting's an
extremely difficult business.

01:14:51.306 --> 01:14:53.680
As hard as long investing is,
short investing is twice as

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.880
hard for a variety of
reasons-- structural,

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.070
but also your winners
become a bigger

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.610
portion of your portfolio,
losses are unlimited,

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:01.319
gains are capped.

01:15:01.319 --> 01:15:03.610
Unlike long investing, which
is the reverse, et cetera,

01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:04.150
et cetera

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:06.108
I highly recommend that
you never short a stock

01:15:06.108 --> 01:15:07.182
your entire life.

01:15:07.182 --> 01:15:09.140
Just trust me, I've been
doing it for 12 years.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.240
I have an entire presentation.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240
I can come back next week.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.960
I'll give you my
presentation on Lessons

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.340
From A Dozen Years
of Short Selling

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.923
I presented at Stanford Business
School-- to Stanford Business

01:15:16.923 --> 01:15:18.620
School students last night.

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:19.540
Don't do it.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.840
So then, OK, well,
smart guy, the one thing

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.350
that is sort of
obvious, you just

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.990
have a short book
offsetting your long book.

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.060
What do you do?

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.600
The real answer is just buy
super high quality companies

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.920
that can continue
to grow earnings

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.170
and so forth, even during
economic downturns.

01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:39.690
And you buy them at
moderate multiples.

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.100
And then just be willing to
accept the market pukes out,

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.670
your stock's going
to go down in line

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.210
with-- maybe in
line with market.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.465
Hopefully, if you buy
quality companies,

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:50.350
it's a reasonable price, a
little less than the market.

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:51.050
But you just have to
understand, if you're

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:53.230
going to invest in stocks,
there's going to be volatility.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:55.250
And there is no such thing
as a free lunch where

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.090
you get equity upside, but
you have no risk of downside.

01:15:58.090 --> 01:16:03.000
So don't invest in stocks if you
can't stomach some volatility.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.009
So there's no real
easy answer there.

01:16:05.009 --> 01:16:06.467
I don't recommend
you short stocks.

01:16:06.467 --> 01:16:09.880
I don't recommend you go out
and buy short-term S&amp;P 500 putts

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.380
and roll them every month.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.520
Some hedge funds do that.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.930
And you're just
destroying capital.

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:18.080
Generally speaking,
during times like this,

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.750
invest more conservatively,
hold more cash,

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:25.640
and take smaller position sizes.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.330
And just be patient.

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:30.320
The markets come
and go in cycles.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.630
And most investors
are pro-cyclical.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:37.010
They pile into stocks in October
of '07, and then they puke it

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.170
all out because they can't
take the pain in March of '09.

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:42.200
They piled in
April of 2000, they

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:47.110
piled out in October of 2002.

01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:50.300
So investors'
portfolios, as a rule,

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.340
tend to do worse than
the overall market

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.590
because their market
timing is so horrible.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:58.370
You need to be counter-cyclical,
and that's important.

01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:59.970
You either need to
be steady-- look,

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:04.754
just put $10,000 every
quarter from your IRA,

01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:06.920
just put it into an [INAUDIBLE]
fund just quarterly,

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.180
and it's sort of automatic,
you don't think about, right?

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.400
That's a lot better than
what most investors do,

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.964
which is being pro-cyclical.

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:16.130
But ideally, you sort of
want to be counter-cyclical

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.230
and just sort of
have an instinct.

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:18.410
Look, I'm not a
full-time investor.

01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:19.140
I'm doing my job.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.010
I'm earning an income.

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.510
I'm probably not
going to get fired.

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:23.880
But the market's crapping
out, so maybe I'll

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.749
bump that to
$20,000 this quarter

01:17:25.749 --> 01:17:28.040
and take a little bit of
money and put some extra money

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.720
into the market.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.860
Maybe you put a
little bit less in.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.220
If you can do that over a
lifetime, that'll help a lot.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.220
JOHN HEINS: I wouldn't
overestimate your ability

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.720
to time, however.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.740
I wouldn't overestimate
my ability to time.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.766
It's very difficult
to get that right.

01:17:44.766 --> 01:17:45.640
WHITNEY TILSON: Yeah.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.850
80% of the way there, if
you simply don't screw it up

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:50.400
and you just do it steadily.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.230
And if you're really
clever-- I'm being-- look,

01:17:54.230 --> 01:17:56.930
I have done, in 16
years, I have done

01:17:56.930 --> 01:18:03.580
well by being aggressive in
late 2002 right after 9/11,

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.470
at the bottom, late.

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:10.190
You can actually-- there's
a public record of it.

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:12.050
You can Google Whitney
Tilson "60 Minutes,"

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:15.904
and in December of
2008, I correctly

01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:18.320
predicted the housing, the
bursting in the housing bubble,

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.450
and I was a guest on "60
Minutes," about the housing

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.950
crisis.

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:22.480
And I said, I'm piling in.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.190
Like I'm all in, because as
bad as things are out there,

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.850
stocks are cheap.

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:30.860
So having that-- I
mean I'll tell you,

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:33.520
because when you
feel like hiding

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.180
under your desk
with a flak helmet

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:37.940
on because every single day
your portfolio's blowing up,

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:41.700
and the headlines are so
horrible, it's hard to do.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:46.020
But being counter-cyclical like
that, a contrarian like that

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:46.830
can add value.

01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:48.210
But most people can't do it.

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:50.690
So at the very least,
don't screw it up

01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:54.080
by doing what most people
do and piling in at the top

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.527
and selling at the bottom.

01:18:56.527 --> 01:18:57.860
MALE SPEAKER: We're out of time.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.750
Thank you so much.

01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:59.550
WHITNEY TILSON: OK, thank you.

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:00.466
JOHN HEINS: Thank you.

01:19:00.466 --> 01:19:04.100
[APPLAUSE]
