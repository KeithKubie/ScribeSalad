BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.190
interesting developer community.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.170
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.310
has asked this question.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.430
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.887
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:18.600
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.852
would like to ask questions.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.450
MALE SPEAKER: Open up one
browser and make sure that it

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.380
worked there.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.380
These days, it's not unusual
for me to have about five

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.080
different browser windows
open at the same time.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.040
CHRIS EPPSTEIN: A good portion
of my front-end development

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.270
time is spent trying to
figure out how I can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.560
best build a feature.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.090
And a good portion of that is
spent finding the right

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.180
website where I can find out
the information I need.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.110
MALE SPEAKER: Right now,
there's a lot of great

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.190
information that's out there,
but it's spread across a bunch

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.260
of different sites.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.030
CHRIS EPPSTEIN: Oftentimes, the
difference between getting

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.940
that information quickly and
right and getting it wrong can

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.690
be the difference between
something taking an

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.590
hour and all day.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.809
DIVYA MANIAN: As the web moves
forward, we have different

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.700
operating systems, different
browsers, different devices,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.250
and not just that, the standards
that we use for the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.810
Web keep changing rapidly
day in and day out.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780
MICHAEL CHAMPION: It's hard to
find the documentation for

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.390
what works across all of them.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.770
This is something we all need
to solve together as a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.330
community for the web to
be the best it can be.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.370
PAUL IRISH: The founding members
of Web Platform Docs

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.970
have contributed quite a bit
of content to create the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.250
foundation for Web
Platform Docs.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.080
It's a new community-driven
site that aims to become a

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.740
comprehensive source for web
developer documentation.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.090
But it's also an open community,
which means you can

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.930
contribute by sharing your
knowledge and your experience.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.150
MICHAEL CHAMPION: What we need
now is a larger community to

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.340
get in there and deepen
the content

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.930
with their own expertise.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.390
TIM BERNERS-LEE: Join
in the conversation.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.710
Make this website the best.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.170
DIVYA MANIAN: Just go to
webplatform.org and sign up.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.650
MICHAEL CHAMPION: Share
your expertise.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.925
TIM BERNERS-LEE: Make it exactly
just what you and I

00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.700
need for building a web page.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.210
PAUL IRISH: Join the
community and start

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.690
learning and sharing today.

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:11.850
PETER LUBBERS: Welcome to the
Chrome channel on Google

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.260
Developers Live.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.356
I'm really excited today to talk
to you about a special

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.522
episode of webplatform.org,
or Web Platform

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:19.930
Docs, as we call it.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.107
Today, I'm in the studio.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.270
My name is Peter Lubbers.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.370
I'm a program manager in the
Google Chrome team in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.150
developer relations.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.306
And recently we've been working
on a lot of the

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.563
infrastructure and getting
ready for the big

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:33.840
announcement.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.330
With me in the studio today,
I have Alex Komoroske.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.880
Hi, Alex.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Hi.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.505
PETER LUBBERS: And Scott Rowe.

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:40.425
SCOTT ROWE: Hello.

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.220
PETER LUBBERS: Alex, tell us a
little bit about the project

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.765
and-- well, first of all, tell
us what you do at Google and

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:46.250
what you've been doing
for this project.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.940
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Sure.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.870
I'm a product manager
on Chrome's Open

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.520
Web Platform team.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
I've been involved in this
project for a few months now.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.460
The point of it, I guess, is
that the Web Platform is this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.820
amazingly powerful platform,
and there's lots of good

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.830
documentation around, but
it's all over the place.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.720
It's very hard to find
it in one place.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.330
So we thought, well, why don't
we just create a site that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.546
anyone can edit and so that you
can have one place to go

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.100
to find all the documentation?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.510
And a whole bunch of folks
thought this was a great idea.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.220
A number of other organizations
are involved

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.880
from the beginning, which I
think is really exciting.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.320
So we just announced it
yesterday, the first step in a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.990
very long journey to make this
into the comprehensive site

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.080
for web developer
documentation.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.740
PETER LUBBERS: I think that's an
important thing we need to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.930
talk about a little bit more
is that what you're finding

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.880
today is an alpha version.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.160
It's something that
we really--

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.510
with the different stewards, all
of the different browser

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.810
vendors and other companies like
Adobe and Nokia and HP

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.900
really wanted see some content,
put some content out

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.150
there, and then start developing
it in the open.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.390
So not really hiding it and
building something that's

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.840
fantastic and release it in 2015
or something like that.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.180
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Or earlier.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.140
PETER LUBBERS: Right, right.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.510
So Scott, what do you do?

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.000
And what have you done
for this project?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.730
So what do you do at Google?

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.750
SCOTT ROWE: I'm a technical
writer, and I work on Web

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.440
Platform Docs almost
exclusively.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.150
Like the other browser vendors
on the project, we do have

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.790
some full-time people dedicated
to curating and

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.640
ensuring the quality of
this documentation.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.030
We're looking at this as a very
high-profile project, and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670
we want it to succeed.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.890
PETER LUBBERS: That's actually
a really good thing.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.080
As opposed to other projects
that may have a single writer

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.610
or a single person behind
it, this is really a

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.680
collaborative effort.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.970
But also, as you point out, we
have all of the stewards have

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.200
full-time people dedicated
to this great resource.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.630
So hopefully, they will also be
able to guide the community

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.300
in developing more and
more of this content.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.080
So about we take a look at the
site and start stepping

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.480
through it?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.110
SCOTT ROWE: Go for it.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.240
PETER LUBBERS: So if you look at
the home page, you'll find,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.710
of course, the video that
we opened up with.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.270
And, of course, you'll find
different areas at the top--

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.360
Docs, we have a forum,
blog, chat,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.850
tutorials, and other things.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.960
One of the important things
about this is that right now,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.720
the real focus is on
the Docs area.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.250
So, in fact, when you hear about
this project, you'll

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.790
hear the abbreviation WPD--

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.580
Web Platform Docs--

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.510
webplatform.org Docs.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.660
In fact, if you go there, if you
click on Docs, you'll end

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.710
up on the Docs home
page, if you will.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.010
This page really has
links to all of the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.790
information we have.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.980
Scott, do you want to tell us
a little bit about what kind

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.490
of content you might
expect on the site?

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.460
SCOTT ROWE: Sure.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.470
We break our content into three
basic areas-- concepts,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.380
reference, and tutorial.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.180
That's pretty standard across
any technical writing effort.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.250
Within each of those categories,
we further break

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.530
the content down into
its component parts.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.030
So for the CSS reference
documentation, you will see

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.220
things like CSS properties
and selectors.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.300
And then eventually, you'll burn
down into a property like

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.400
this-- font size.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.630
PETER LUBBERS: Let's take
a look at that a moment.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.030
So you have font size here.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.220
As I open that up, I find
a lot of different

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.210
tags applied to this.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.610
We'll come back to
those later.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.960
But you can find an
overview table.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.550
You have a syntax area, the
actual values described,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.840
examples, and other
information.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.450
One of the most valuable things
that I think this

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.700
project will bring
to the table is a

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.080
compatibility matrix.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.500
And again, this is just to
reiterate, it's just an alpha

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.660
version right now.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.740
But the nice thing is everybody
can contribute.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.630
I've gone through many sites
in the past, and there are

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.310
some great resources out there,
for example, Can I Use.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.670
It's a fantastic resource.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.040
I think all of the web
developers that I've talked to

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.380
are pretty much aware of that,
and they use that sometimes on

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.680
a daily basis.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.150
Of course, any of those
resources are fantastic,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.230
except you can't edit them.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.620
Many times, I've written the
owner of a website saying,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.290
actually, this has
been changed.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.770
You should include
this browser.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.700
And it's just very hard to
do as a single person.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:42.350
So having help from the entire
community is really powerful.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.590
So you can see here
compatibility

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.930
for desktop and mobile.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.760
As I said, this is a
work in progress.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.320
But the content has been
seeded to get started.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.040
We also have tutorials.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.850
So the tutorials area, sort of
a large grouping of content

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.130
that tells you not just as a
reference topic would about

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.940
the specific feature, but how
you can really use them.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.990
Many times it will include
multiple topics, for example,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.170
how you build something using
the audio element or something

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.990
using a set of features, maybe
canvas and web socket to build

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.700
a compelling case study,
things like that.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.910
So let's take a look at that.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.960
For example, the connectivity
tab, if I open that here, the

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.830
connectivity feature
here, there's

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.750
already three tutorials.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.950
As I mentioned, a lot of this
content has been seeded from

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.380
areas like MDN, from MSDN,
from HTML5 Rocks.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.610
Opera has great articles
on web development.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:55.630
All of the stewards have
contributed a lot of the

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.150
content already to be here.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.480
For example, here the Web
Socket tutorial is a Web

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.730
Socket basics tutorial.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.630
It has a little description of
what the problem might be here

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.920
and code examples and really
allowing you to get

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.470
started with that.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.440
And really, the power of Web
Platform Docs, I think I would

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.540
sum it up with is one thing,
which is the Edit button.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.790
Clicking on Edit opens
up this Edit page.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.470
I want to drill into that
a little bit more.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.670
Of course, it's very easy
to edit a small typo.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.030
If you see a typo, something
very small or something you

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.460
know should be rewritten,
go for it.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.300
You can literally just
go in this page--

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.750
and we'll talk a little bit
more about it in a second.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.840
You can really just edit the
page, go to the bottom of the

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.850
page and type in a little
bit of information

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.060
about what you edited.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.210
If it's just a typo,
that could be

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.020
summarized as a minor edit.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.750
But if you added a new
paragraph, you can describe

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.860
what you've done for the logs
later and then save it.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.980
And that's done.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.460
Your documentation is now
live on the internet.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.220
You've seen, as I scroll down
this page, there's a ton of

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:22.890
other information.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.990
I want to ask Alex, who has been
instrumental in creating

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.560
some of these templates,
to talk a little

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.755
bit more about that.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.440
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you'll notice
that on these pages,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.630
you might be expecting just
one big text box.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.060
But actually, you see here,
we've got form fields that are

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.040
broken out and more
structured.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.480
So what we've done is we've
created for different article

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.650
types-- so for CSS property
or tutorial, any number of

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.860
different article types, we
create a form that helps

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.170
organize that information.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.800
We aren't done yet.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.660
Some of them need
some more help.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.740
But you can see here, this is a
great example where it makes

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.530
it more clear where to fill
in the information.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.140
One thing to call out as well
on this page is we had this

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.350
notion of flags.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.030
So we know the content
isn't perfect yet.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.450
It's in a very early state, and
we need everyone's help to

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.830
help massage it, make it more
complete and comprehensive.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.610
So we have this notion of flags
where you can say, this

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:20.510
article is not complete, or this
article has errors, or

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.310
this article needs
a new title.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.750
You can flag these off.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.700
If you've noticed a problem, and
you don't want to fix it,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.640
you can go in, hit Edit, check
off these boxes up here-- you

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.760
can see them, they're
called high-level

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.430
issues in content there--

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.310
and say, well, this
article is a stub.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.150
That will flag it.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.330
So if you go look at the page,
you'll a red bar at the top

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.580
that this article needs
those changes.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.120
And other people can find that
content later and say, I'm in

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.330
the mood to fix stubs and find a
list of stubs and go and fix

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.630
them and remove that flag.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.040
PETER LUBBERS: That's really
powerful because what we want

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.280
it to do is for the community
to help, it needs

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.800
to be pretty clear--

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: How.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.430
PETER LUBBERS: --how
you can do it.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: What
you do, right?

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.480
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.460
So we've actually broken that
down into three different

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.718
areas, so five-minutes tasks--

00:12:06.718 --> 00:12:08.200
[AUDIO LOST]

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.770
PETER LUBBERS: --you
would uncheck the

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.350
compatibility needed.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.680
So we want to make it really
easy to get started.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.770
You really don't need to be
super technical to be part of

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.510
this project.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.420
Everyone can help.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.570
All you need to do is just
sign up at the top.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.290
You get an account, and
you're rolling.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.590
SCOTT ROWE: That's it.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.790
If you want to test
code, there's code

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.850
there to test, too.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.745
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's
addictive, really.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:02.050
You start off, you're correcting
a few typos.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.770
You're just doing these very
tactical things that take a

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.800
couple of minutes.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.690
And then as you get more
confident, as you do it more

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.580
often, you take on bigger
and bigger tasks.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.570
That's one of the reasons
we wanted to

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.780
organize it this way--

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.030
to help people really get
involved in a way that doesn't

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.920
require them to jump
directly into it.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.430
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, it
reminds me, I used to

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.270
contribute a little bit
here and there to MDN.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.670
They had a great system like
that, too, where they would

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.080
provide these doc sprints.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.700
Later, I'll tell you a little
bit more about some ones that

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.190
we have coming up as well.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.910
So these doc sprints where
basically people are online on

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.600
IRC channel or actually in a
physical location, and really

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.510
just coming out and saying,
OK, what do I need to do?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.820
Here's a list of tasks, and
just go through it.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.860
Like you said, I found
it pretty addictive.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.410
It's really a great
community effort.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.730
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And we already
have the chat channel--

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:50.790
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.400
ALEX KOMOROSKE: --and the
mailing list as well.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.010
There's lots of active
discussion on the IRC channel

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.130
about people like, hey,
how do I fix this?

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.850
It's a great place to find
other people to help you

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.940
figure out how to fix things.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.780
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.200
So on the Getting Started page,
there is in fact some

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.390
information about how you
can get connected.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.140
So there's an IRC channel,
a mailing list.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.250
All of that's there.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.780
Just take a look at that
Getting Started page.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:18.220
I wanted to go through the Q&amp;A.
On our Google Developers

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.620
Live page, we have a moderator,
and we have a

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.190
couple of questions.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.800
So let's take some of those.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.490
Some of them will
be pretty quick.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.320
The first question
is from Fernando.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.620
"Will Web Platform Docs hold
WebGL information?"

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.470
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
a great question.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.680
WebGL is an example of a cutting
edge technology that's

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.120
only in some browsers
at the moment.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.230
The idea of Web Platform
Docs is to be useful,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.620
comprehensive, practical
documentation for folks.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.740
In fact, we had this notion
of these pillars, these

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.490
foundational principles to the
site, which you can see on the

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.080
site at wpd:pillars.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.760
And that's part of our goal.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.430
So we want to be inclusive
about this kind of stuff.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.100
If web developers are going to
want to know about these kinds

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.865
of topics, they should be
included, just clearly flagged

00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:05.570
to make it clear that
you cannot rely on

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.820
this in every browser.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.630
This is something maybe that's
not standardized yet, or it's

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.750
only in the beginning stages
of standardization, or it's

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.070
only in some browsers.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.840
So yes, WebGL, we definitely
want to have documented on

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.190
this site as one example
of many other kinds of

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:19.880
technologies.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.440
PETER LUBBERS: Just add to
that, if you're a WebGL

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.000
expert, please help us
build that content.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.410
I think the reaction to this
project has been so good

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.630
because, look, it's out there.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.750
It's free information.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.520
Everyone can join in.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.550
Really the only criticism
you can have is there's

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.840
not enough out there.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.090
Well, come and help
us make it better.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.810
I think what you mentioned also
is an important thing.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:52.320
Because if we get the
documentation about these

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.130
standards that are in the early
stages out there more,

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.760
then really we can start
seeing it earlier.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.650
We can have more collaboration
about it.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.450
And since it's a cross-vendor
effort, it's going to be

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.320
really cool.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:04.470
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.610
I'm really excited about that.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.080
PETER LUBBERS: Another
question from Eltern.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.650
"Will Web Platform Docs be
available in other languages?"

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.080
The infrastructure is set up
so that, yes, it will be

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.560
possible to translate it.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.250
Of course, right
now at launch--

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.100
I think there's actually a
little bit of Spanish content

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.640
that I noticed in the Docs--

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.430
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We don't
have a ton of it.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.840
Our intention, of course, is
to have this content be

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.600
available in many different
languages.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.230
We looked at a number of
different ways of doing this.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.060
We're still working
on precisely the

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.860
final way to do it.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.180
But this is definitely
very important.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.080
I know we've had a number of
folks reach out to us and say,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.010
hey, I really want to translate
this into German.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.790
It's like, cool.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.960
Hold that thought for a second
as we make sure we get this in

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.570
place for you to do this.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.130
But we definitely
want to have a

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.340
thriving translation community.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.330
PETER LUBBERS: It really comes
back to the point where we

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.660
said, we want to get it out in
front of the community sooner

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.700
rather than later.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.750
So if that means we don't
have it translated in 32

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.109
languages--

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:04.349
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Not yet.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.920
PETER LUBBERS: --then we'd
rather have it out there and

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.802
get the community to
help us build that.

00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:09.710
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.770
PETER LUBBERS: Another
question from Serge.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.700
"From the blog post, Web
Platform Docs is the first and

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.190
most important piece of
webplatform.org." That's a

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:24.300
good question about are there
other parts of the site that

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.579
will be created later on?

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.790
Do you want to--

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So right now,
the focus is definitely Docs.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.280
It's primarily documentation.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.720
That's what we're starting.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.090
But I'm so excited about
webplatform.org because

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.810
there's so much more
potential.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.970
There's so many other things.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.090
We're even seeing a little
bit with chat.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.490
The IRC channel already has
all these interesting

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.910
discussions going on about not
just the site, but web

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.180
development in general.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.610
So you can imagine
webplatform.org growing over

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.620
time to include all kinds of
other things that are relevant

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.020
to web developers.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.570
We don't know exactly what those
are at this point, but

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.680
I'm excited by the possibility
of the community helping us

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.680
figure out what things are going
to be useful and then

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.000
doing that on this site.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.710
Webplatform.org is much bigger
than just documentation, which

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.190
is already quite big.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.040
It's a very open-ended
sort of promise.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.830
I'm really excited about it.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.680
PETER LUBBERS: So Scott, maybe
you can answer this question.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.370
SCOTT ROWE: I'll do my best.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.190
PETER LUBBERS: Web Platform
being a community, how can I

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.150
help out anything other than
contributing content?

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.710
SCOTT ROWE: Well, we certainly
have a lot of ways to do that.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.710
You can edit the compatibility
tables.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.260
That requires some research
figuring out what features are

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.330
supported in which browsers.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.700
There are a number of flags you
can use on content that

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:50.770
don't have anything to do with
the editing tasks, flags that

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.800
say this content may be
misplaced, or it may be

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.400
duplicative or some
such flag as that.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.780
The way we've shown how the
forms are laid out with the

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.490
different types of information
to supply, those help you get

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.690
through that process of
contributing in ways that may

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.760
involve editing or may not.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.430
ALEX KOMOROSKE: There's
a lot of other stuff

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.990
you can do as well.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.730
As one example, you can look at
the recent changes list on

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.530
the site and see changes that
are obviously spam and help

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.470
revert those.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.450
You could be someone who just
hangs around the IRC channel

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.210
and helps answer people's
questions and

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.290
help them get started.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.620
There's all kinds of stuff to
do that doesn't directly

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.390
involve editing content, but
really helping foster the

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.610
community and be
a part of that.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.780
PETER LUBBERS: Fantastic.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.920
Another question from Serge--

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.725
good questions from
Serge here.

00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:51.040
"Will there be video content
on the site?"

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.550
Sorry, actually this
is from Eliah.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.810
"Will it be accepted,
endorsed, and

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.790
promoted on the platform?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.880
So video tutorials,
for example.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.360
I think the answer is yes.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I believe
so as well.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.560
We can't speak on behalf of
everybody, the whole community

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.940
obviously, but that sounds
great to me.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.140
I think this is the perfect
thing to bring up on the

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.710
mailing list or on the IRC
channel and discuss with the

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.310
rest of the community.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.800
But this totally fits in with
the mission of the site, so--

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.840
PETER LUBBERS: Definitely, I
would expect to see that.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.640
All right.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.300
"What is the planned
scope for Docs?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.350
Are server-side technologies
like PHP and Ruby going to be

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.560
added?"

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.970
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So when I was
hanging out in the IRC channel

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.040
a lot yesterday and today, this
question's come up a lot.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.500
At the beginning--

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.660
again, I can't speak on behalf
of the entire community,. and

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.245
it's up to us as a community to
figure out what the answer

00:20:39.245 --> 00:20:41.430
to this question is.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.910
We were focusing at the
beginning especially on

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.580
client-side technologies,
so technologies that are

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.920
implemented in a browser, say.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.260
However, there's all kinds of
documentation that's relevant

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.230
to web developers that's
not just based

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.440
on what's in a browser.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.730
I think over time, as we see
what's most useful for the

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.220
community, that may be the
stuff that's involved in.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.090
At the beginning, you can
imagine just a simple page

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.440
that points you in the
direction of other

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.320
documentation sites.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.930
But definitely, this is
something that people are

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.900
interested in.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.450
It will be hard to do correctly
because there are so

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.290
many different things to
include, but I think this is a

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.210
great example of where the
community can help us set the

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.600
direction for this
site long term.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.060
PETER LUBBERS: Perfect.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.650
Another question here. "How long
until the alpha ends and

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:33.130
what about beta?"
We don't have--

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.840
ALEX KOMOROSKE: The way I would
describe it is we're

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.880
using the word "alpha" to
communicate to people that

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.710
this site is very early.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.350
We've seeded it with a lot of
great content, but there is so

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:47.000
much longer to go before the
site has become the definitive

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.800
piece, the site for
documentation for web

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.970
developers.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.380
So when we drop that label, when
it becomes a stable, or

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.010
beta, I don't think anyone
knows at this point.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.080
It really depends on how much
the community can come

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.170
together to bring the site up
to the level of quality that

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.460
we all want it to be.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.580
That is definitely our goal.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.000
Our goal is to get this to be
the definitive source of web

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.030
developer documentation.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.050
When we're to that point, when
we as a community feel

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.570
comfortable with that, I can
imagine that we drop that

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.710
alpha bit from the label.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.110
PETER LUBBERS: So to
be determined.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.990
Jerome in Toronto asked "what
happens to existing

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.650
documentation on the web?

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.170
With Web Platform Docs, we now
have duplicate and redundant

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.420
documentation.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.740
How do I deal with that?"

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.660
SCOTT ROWE: That's the current
state of affairs.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.260
There is a lot of duplicative
content.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.800
What we hope to do over time
is to gradually funnel that

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.150
into fewer and fewer sources
for people to go to so it

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.020
isn't quite so hard
to find things.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.270
That's the purpose of
webplatform.org.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We can't
speak on behalf of

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.220
various other sites.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.330
Our hope is that by fostering
this community as a central

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.960
place that people can that, that
everyone can come to and

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.460
centralize around, that
naturally over time--

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.320
yes, right now, there's
duplicated content on

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.050
different sites.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.510
But quite frankly, that's
been the case for a

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.610
long time as well.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.290
There are many great sites that
effectively duplicate

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.910
content across different
sites.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.130
Our hope is that this Web
Platform Docs can, long term,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.300
become the comprehensive
answer where, this

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:17.870
is where you go.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.290
This is where the content
goes as well.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.750
In the short term, of course,
it's very early.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.540
There's still lots of other
sources of content.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.990
PETER LUBBERS: And like I said
earlier on, the biggest

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.330
feature here is that you
can edit this content.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.090
It's very easy to come across
outdated content.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.390
I've written a lot of articles
myself, and then two years

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.880
later, somebody will post on a
blog like, oh, this is so bad,

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.660
this information.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.560
Sure, but it hasn't
been updated.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.290
It was accurate at the time.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.240
Especially with these evolving
technologies,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.420
that's a real problem.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.430
This stuff happens so fast that
it's almost impossible to

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.822
keep up with as a single person
or a single site.

00:23:54.822 --> 00:23:56.900
SCOTT ROWE: It's going
to take a village.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.840
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.440
A web village.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.210
OK, so one other question
here from Morgan.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.840
"How should compatibility
tables be formatted?

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.290
Should they list all versions or
the first version where you

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.080
can use an element
or attribute?"

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: This is a very
low-level question, but one

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.660
that's near and dear to my
heart because I wrote the

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.460
original template that we're
using right now for the

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.870
compatibility tables.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.330
Compatibility is a very
interesting question because

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.670
there's lots of different ways
to present the information

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.890
that are useful to people
in different contexts.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.700
I don't think that we have
the answer right now.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.020
I think we've got a pretty good
stab at the beginning.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.350
But this is the kind of thing
that we really want to dive

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.010
into with the community and help
figure out what is the

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.840
right way to present
this content?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.370
So right now, what you do is you
create a new row for each

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.560
new sub-piece of support.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.160
So the first row is
basic support.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.210
You might have, say,
box shadow.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.060
Whether or not you support
the insect keyword is a

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.270
sub-feature of that thing, so
that would have its own row.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.940
Ideally, we would have the first
version number of each

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.740
browser that started
supporting it.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.450
One other thing, too, that's
important is we have this

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.700
notion of compatibility notes.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.370
That's a table after the
compatibility table that says,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.950
hey, just FYI, in Chrome Version
12, there was this

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.040
weird little hack, a tweak
that didn't work exactly

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.350
correctly, so that you still
have this historical record

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.700
for people who do need to figure
out how precisely it

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.590
differed in other places.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.130
But I'm really looking forward
to working with folks to

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.110
figure out what the right
format is for this.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.720
There's a lot of different
formats out there for this

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.230
information.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.680
SCOTT ROWE: You can also can
tag content that is--

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.410
you can set up the compatibility
table to show

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:43.950
that when a feature was
supported as prefixed and when

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.830
it was supported
without prefix.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:53.480
So the question is, well, from
which version onward?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.950
And how do I show that in
the compatibility table?

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.270
The method we've been adopting
is the first version of its

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:05.920
support is the first version
that you cite.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.440
And thereafter, it's assumed
to be supported.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.850
If, however, a subsequent
version is a non-prefixed

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:19.140
version, then you have a
different tag to apply there.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.530
So maybe we need a tutorial
about using that.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.720
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's easy to
test and see, hey, does this

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.980
browser support this
functionality?

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.650
But you might not know when it
started because it's back in

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.420
the mists of time.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.080
PETER LUBBERS: True.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So what we've
done in the current template

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.260
is it's possible to say,
I know it's supported.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.550
I don't know when it started.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.650
And if you want, you can also
fill in more specific

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.800
information and say, oh,
I know it was supported

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.970
as of Version 7.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.490
But there's a lot of room to
grow here and to explore

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.810
different options here.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.320
PETER LUBBERS: Great.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.710
So I think that gives a
pretty good overview.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.940
We've answered all
the questions.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.350
We'll come back and we'll make
another pass through just in

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.250
case we missed any.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.650
The final thing that I wanted to
talk a little bit about is

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.280
the way you can get started
in the community.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.790
So of course, we have
the home page.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.560
There's some links to the
Getting Started document.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.990
We're also planning a bunch
of doc sprints.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.750
The first one, actually--

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.390
shameless plug for the San
Francisco HTML5 user group

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.160
that I run.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.070
We actually have an event
next week that will be

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.280
live-streamed from San Francisco
talking about web

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.450
standards and also on how
to help on this project.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:35.970
And after that, we're announcing
for November 3 with

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.930
Adobe, we're launching the first
doc spring This is an

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.730
on-site doc sprint.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.710
But, of course we'll open it
up to anyone that wants to

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.920
join online.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.200
So it's going to be
pretty exciting.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.040
We're just going to get in the
room for a day and start going

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.480
through issues.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.680
Like I said, we have five-minute
tasks, half-hour

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.830
tasks, and then the slightly
longer ones.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.690
Hopefully, get a bunch of
those out of the way.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.030
So anything--

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: There's a list
of those on the site as well.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.210
PETER LUBBERS: That's right.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.230
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One thing I
wanted to emphasize, too, is

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.430
there are people who are
organizing these events like

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.930
Adobe and Peter and others.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.090
But really, we want to encourage
you guys to create

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.850
your own as well.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.910
You don't have to wait for one
of the stewards or something

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:17.470
to do this.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.170
This is something where if you
want to just grab a few people

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.090
in your hometown or whatever
and work on it together,

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.550
that's great.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.390
Let us know on the IRC channels
so we can make sure

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.050
we're around to support
you guys.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:33.540
We want everyone in the
community to feel the ability

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.582
to get this stuff started.

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:37.520
PETER LUBBERS: That's
a very good point.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:43.110
Of course, we're going to
share the pros and cons,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.640
everything we've done and the
things that went well and the

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.820
things that didn't go well.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.430
But everyone should
be able to--

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.505
we shouldn't have to wait until
the third of November to

00:28:51.505 --> 00:28:54.400
start helping, definitely.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.150
Well, with that, I think we're
going to close it for today.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.810
Thanks for joining us.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.450
The recording of this session
will be available at the same

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.740
URL in a few minutes so you
can point people to that.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.680
Hopefully, we'll see you online
in the IRC channel

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.490
helping out on Web
Platform Docs.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.620
Thanks so much.
