00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:03.446
- We're asked to use the
reflect tool to find the image

00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:05.767
of quadrilateral PQRS,

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.125
that's this quadrilateral right over here,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.085
for a reflection over the line

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:12.269
y is equal to x plus two.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.149
All right, so let's use the reflect tool.

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.751
So let me scroll down.

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.551
So let me click on Reflect,

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.732
it brings up this tool,

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:21.729
and I want to reflect across the line

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.015
y is equal to x plus two.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.560
So let me move this so it is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.305
the line y equals x plus two

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:30.502
and to think about it,

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:33.337
let's see, it's going to have

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:34.897
a slope of one, the coefficient

00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:36.348
on the x term is one,

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:37.706
so it's going to have a slope of one,

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:38.577
so let me see if I can give this

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:40.156
a slope of one.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:41.190
Is this a slope of one?

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.106
Let me put it a little bit --

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:43.291
yep, it looks like a slope of one

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.392
as the line moves one to the right.

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:46.448
We go from one point of the line

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:48.131
to the other, you have
to go one to the right,

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.572
and one up or two to the right,

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:50.952
and two up, however much you move

00:00:50.952 --> 00:00:52.612
to the right in the x direction,

00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:54.052
you have to move that same amount

00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:55.666
in the vertical direction.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.569
So now it has a slope of one,

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.334
and the y intercept is going to be

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.992
the point x equals zero, y equals two,

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:02.829
we see that right over here.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.314
When x is equal to zero,

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.534
y is going to be equal to two,

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:07.078
so let me move this.

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:09.330
So we see that we now
go through that point.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.344
When x is equal to zero,

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.015
y is equal to two.

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:15.692
And now, we just need to reflect

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.749
PQRS, this quadrilateral,

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:21.362
over this line, so let's do that.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.964
There you go, we did it.

00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:25.731
The things, the point, like
point S right over here

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:28.190
that was to the top and left of the line,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.732
its reflection, the corresponding point

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:33.066
in the image is now to
the right and the bottom

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.112
of the line.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:35.527
The things that were to the right

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.292
and the bottom of our line,

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.593
like point P,

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:40.775
it's the corresponding
point in the reflection

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:43.852
is now on the other side of the line.

00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:45.534
So there you go, I think we're done,

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.090
and we got it right.
