I think that climate change issues are
not just long-term goals their

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.560
not just long-term goals their
 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.609
not just long-term goals their
short-term goals because the climate

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
short-term goals because the climate

change problems is includes solutions
 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.310
change problems is includes solutions
also to short-term problems there's a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320
also to short-term problems there's a
 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.330
also to short-term problems there's a
lot of possibility economically for the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340
lot of possibility economically for the
 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.510
lot of possibility economically for the
clean tech sector to work on developing

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520
clean tech sector to work on developing
 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.930
clean tech sector to work on developing
clean tech products which bill which are

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940
clean tech products which bill which are
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.660
clean tech products which bill which are
necessary and there's a market right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670
necessary and there's a market right
 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.959

benefit on short term by being much more
focused on how to reduce energy costs so

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
focused on how to reduce energy costs so
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.200
focused on how to reduce energy costs so
this is a short-term perspective and and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
this is a short-term perspective and and

short-term perspective they learn the
huge possibilities the huge project

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829
huge possibilities the huge project
 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.050
huge possibilities the huge project

in two decades but next year and next
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.940
in two decades but next year and next
year's again and as soon you really

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
year's again and as soon you really
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010
year's again and as soon you really
understand the dynamism of this market

and what can be benefited from this

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090
and what can be benefited from this
 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.260
and what can be benefited from this
market I'm sure that we will find out

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270
market I'm sure that we will find out
 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.149
market I'm sure that we will find out
that these are not issues which we you

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
that these are not issues which we you
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.830
that these are not issues which we you
couldn't divide in short-term long-term

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
couldn't divide in short-term long-term
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.230
couldn't divide in short-term long-term
dimension it's all integrated and you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240
dimension it's all integrated and you
 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.180
dimension it's all integrated and you
had to start focusing on it right now

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190
 
 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.080
 
but it's really necessary right now it

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090
but it's really necessary right now it
 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.330
but it's really necessary right now it
is first and foremost that we somebody

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340
is first and foremost that we somebody
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.330
is first and foremost that we somebody
and again some companies have posed a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
and again some companies have posed a
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.520
and again some companies have posed a
possibility an application to go out and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530
possibility an application to go out and
 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.320
possibility an application to go out and
tell that the true story the right story

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330
tell that the true story the right story
 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.690
tell that the true story the right story
that goes from a social economic

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
that goes from a social economic
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.660
that goes from a social economic
financial whatever views that this is

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
financial whatever views that this is
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.590
financial whatever views that this is
this is a strategy this is a possibility

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
this is a strategy this is a possibility
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.370
this is a strategy this is a possibility
which is at a hand right now and the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
which is at a hand right now and the
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.760
which is at a hand right now and the
short-term priority should be that to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770
short-term priority should be that to
 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.960
short-term priority should be that to
prevent some of the best in the class

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
prevent some of the best in the class
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
prevent some of the best in the class
some of the best companies to go out for

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520
some of the best companies to go out for
 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.170
some of the best companies to go out for
their own benefit but for the benefit of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
their own benefit but for the benefit of
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.020
their own benefit but for the benefit of
society to to document the possibilities

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
society to to document the possibilities
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.210
society to to document the possibilities
and therefore be the true business case

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
and therefore be the true business case
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.440
and therefore be the true business case
the true economic case that this is not

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
the true economic case that this is not
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.800
the true economic case that this is not
a cost this is not a problem this is a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810
a cost this is not a problem this is a
 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.960
a cost this is not a problem this is a
huge possibility we have right ahead of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
huge possibility we have right ahead of
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.160
huge possibility we have right ahead of
us it might be the best possibility the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
us it might be the best possibility the
 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.110
us it might be the best possibility the
best opportunity we've had for a long

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
best opportunity we've had for a long
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.930
best opportunity we've had for a long
time and it could be a solutions to some

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940
time and it could be a solutions to some
 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.370
time and it could be a solutions to some
of the short-term problems like

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
of the short-term problems like
 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.830
of the short-term problems like
financial crisis whatever and the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
financial crisis whatever and the
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.350
financial crisis whatever and the
companies who really right now can go

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360
companies who really right now can go
 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.660
companies who really right now can go
out and demonstrate that will be there

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
out and demonstrate that will be there
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.630
out and demonstrate that will be there
to winners both economically but from

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640
to winners both economically but from
 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.890
to winners both economically but from
the point of view our branding

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900
the point of view our branding
 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.910
the point of view our branding
attracting talent and so forth so this

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920
attracting talent and so forth so this
 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.280
attracting talent and so forth so this
could be a short-term priority I'm quite

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
could be a short-term priority I'm quite
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.410
could be a short-term priority I'm quite
sure that will really be a win-win

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420
sure that will really be a win-win
 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.220
sure that will really be a win-win
situation for a lot of stakeholders
