00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.880
Sunshine is now using real data thanks to

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.580
the OpenWeatherMap API. And it's time for us to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.070
build out more of the UI. In this lesson

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.620
you'll learn how to create activities, create the structure

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.390
of your app, and learn how to navigate

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.600
between screens. And that means learning more about activities,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.040
the intent framework and even learning how to use

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.580
activities that come from other apps within your own.
