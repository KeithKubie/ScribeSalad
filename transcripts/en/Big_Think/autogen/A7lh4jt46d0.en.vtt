what we're hoping is that the by

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
what we're hoping is that the by
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.670
what we're hoping is that the by
understanding the genetic basis of the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680
understanding the genetic basis of the
 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.100
understanding the genetic basis of the
disease that we begin to understand the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110
disease that we begin to understand the
 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.800
disease that we begin to understand the
fundamental biology understanding the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810
fundamental biology understanding the
 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.339
fundamental biology understanding the
disease so by exploring and

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349
disease so by exploring and
 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.920
disease so by exploring and
understanding which genes might

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930
understanding which genes might
 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.269
understanding which genes might
contribute to the development of

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279
contribute to the development of
 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.240
contribute to the development of
schizophrenia for example what we are

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250
schizophrenia for example what we are
 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.310
schizophrenia for example what we are
interested in finding is does this tell

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
interested in finding is does this tell
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.229
interested in finding is does this tell
us anything about the biology and the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239
us anything about the biology and the
 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.570
us anything about the biology and the
pathways underline that and as a result

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580
pathways underline that and as a result
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.030
pathways underline that and as a result
of that we may be able to find a target

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040
of that we may be able to find a target
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.380
of that we may be able to find a target
so we may be able to find a maybe a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
so we may be able to find a maybe a
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.110
so we may be able to find a maybe a
receptor or some kind of a protein that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
receptor or some kind of a protein that
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.790
receptor or some kind of a protein that
we would be able to target with some

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800
we would be able to target with some
 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.670
we would be able to target with some
kind of pharmacology and then we're

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680
kind of pharmacology and then we're
 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.389
kind of pharmacology and then we're
hoping that because that has targeted

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
hoping that because that has targeted
 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.690
hoping that because that has targeted
targeted us in on the fundamental basis

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700
targeted us in on the fundamental basis
 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.360
targeted us in on the fundamental basis
of the disease and that we've developed

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370
of the disease and that we've developed
 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.950
of the disease and that we've developed
some pharmacology against that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960
some pharmacology against that
 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.529
some pharmacology against that
underlying basis of disease that our

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539
underlying basis of disease that our
 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.820
underlying basis of disease that our
drugs are more likely to be more

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
drugs are more likely to be more
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.130
drugs are more likely to be more
effective in patients with those

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
effective in patients with those
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.160
effective in patients with those
diseases it also may translate we hope

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
diseases it also may translate we hope
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.109
diseases it also may translate we hope
in the future and to be able to

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
in the future and to be able to
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.539
in the future and to be able to
targeting specific treatments towards

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549
targeting specific treatments towards
 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.370
targeting specific treatments towards
specific patient groups so-called

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
specific patient groups so-called
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.590
specific patient groups so-called
personalized medicine so helping to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600
personalized medicine so helping to
 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.749
personalized medicine so helping to
understand that action fact by doing

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759
understand that action fact by doing
 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.380
understand that action fact by doing
this we may be able to find specific

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390
this we may be able to find specific
 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.090
this we may be able to find specific
patient groups who are going to respond

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100
patient groups who are going to respond
 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.429
patient groups who are going to respond
even particularly well to the drugs that

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439
even particularly well to the drugs that
 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.910
even particularly well to the drugs that
we develop

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920
we develop
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080
we develop
the concept of personalized medicine

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
the concept of personalized medicine
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.649
the concept of personalized medicine
ideally would be the right drug in the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659
ideally would be the right drug in the
 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.960
ideally would be the right drug in the
right dose at the right time for the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970
right dose at the right time for the
 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630
right dose at the right time for the
right patient so in other words a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
right patient so in other words a
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.420
right patient so in other words a
patient comes in to a doctor and a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430
patient comes in to a doctor and a
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.580
patient comes in to a doctor and a
doctor is able to do some kind of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
doctor is able to do some kind of
 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.149
doctor is able to do some kind of
specific screen is able to identify the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159
specific screen is able to identify the
 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.460
specific screen is able to identify the
components that contribute to that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470
components that contribute to that
 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.520
components that contribute to that
person's disease be it environmental

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530
person's disease be it environmental
 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.529
person's disease be it environmental
biet genetic or be another kind of

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
biet genetic or be another kind of
 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.200
biet genetic or be another kind of
biological parameter in an ideal world

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210
biological parameter in an ideal world
 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150
biological parameter in an ideal world
that would translate into one sort of

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160
that would translate into one sort of
 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.759
that would translate into one sort of
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be
 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.800
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be
able to do on the spot so-called point

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
able to do on the spot so-called point
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530
able to do on the spot so-called point
of care diagnostics and by doing that a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
of care diagnostics and by doing that a
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.830
of care diagnostics and by doing that a
doctor would be able to say for you with

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
doctor would be able to say for you with
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.630
doctor would be able to say for you with
this disorder this is the right

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
this disorder this is the right
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.789
this disorder this is the right
treatment for you you're really going to

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799
treatment for you you're really going to
 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.860
treatment for you you're really going to
respond to this this treatment and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
respond to this this treatment and
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270
respond to this this treatment and
you're not going to have any side

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
you're not going to have any side
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.530
you're not going to have any side
effects that's the ideal scenario that's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
effects that's the ideal scenario that's
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.050
effects that's the ideal scenario that's
quite a long way off what we are doing

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
quite a long way off what we are doing
 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.880
quite a long way off what we are doing
those were making a lot of progress in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
those were making a lot of progress in
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.030
those were making a lot of progress in
beginning to understand particularly in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
beginning to understand particularly in
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.440
beginning to understand particularly in
areas like oncology on cancer treatments

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
areas like oncology on cancer treatments
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.780
areas like oncology on cancer treatments
which of the characteristics for example

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
which of the characteristics for example
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.449
which of the characteristics for example
of the tumors that would make them more

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
of the tumors that would make them more
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.430
of the tumors that would make them more
susceptible to particular treatment so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
susceptible to particular treatment so
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.949
susceptible to particular treatment so
we're now able to be better a targeting

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
we're now able to be better a targeting
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.080
we're now able to be better a targeting
or and many of our treatments in the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
or and many of our treatments in the
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.650
or and many of our treatments in the
cancer arena to patients based on the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660
cancer arena to patients based on the
 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.300
cancer arena to patients based on the
makeup of the tumors which we've

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
makeup of the tumors which we've
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.310
makeup of the tumors which we've
identified via genetic or genomic

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320
identified via genetic or genomic
 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.009
identified via genetic or genomic
signature and we can say you're more

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019
signature and we can say you're more
 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.229
signature and we can say you're more
likely to respond to this drug you're

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
likely to respond to this drug you're
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.390
likely to respond to this drug you're
less likely to have side effects and so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400
less likely to have side effects and so
 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.849
less likely to have side effects and so
on and in an ideal world as we move out

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859
on and in an ideal world as we move out
 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.400
on and in an ideal world as we move out
into the future maybe everybody will

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
into the future maybe everybody will
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.680
into the future maybe everybody will
have their whole genome sequence so when

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690
have their whole genome sequence so when
 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.420
have their whole genome sequence so when
they come into the doctor the doctor can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
they come into the doctor the doctor can
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.729
they come into the doctor the doctor can
read out their genome sequence and be

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739
read out their genome sequence and be
 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.680
read out their genome sequence and be
able to sort of say I can identify that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
able to sort of say I can identify that
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420
able to sort of say I can identify that
drug for you and be able to prescribe

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
drug for you and be able to prescribe
 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.530
drug for you and be able to prescribe
the right drug for them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
the right drug for them
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.830
the right drug for them
for the individual at the moment our

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
for the individual at the moment our
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.899
for the individual at the moment our
ability to translate that genetic

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909
ability to translate that genetic
 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.869
ability to translate that genetic
information at the moment into

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879
information at the moment into
 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.270
information at the moment into
individual risk prediction for in other

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
individual risk prediction for in other
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.770
individual risk prediction for in other
words to say that you will get a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
words to say that you will get a
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660
words to say that you will get a
particular disease based on this variant

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
particular disease based on this variant
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.660
particular disease based on this variant
is still very limited at the moment so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
is still very limited at the moment so
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.509
is still very limited at the moment so
the technology is significantly advanced

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
the technology is significantly advanced
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.640
the technology is significantly advanced
you can do these you can provide these

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
you can do these you can provide these
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800
you can do these you can provide these
genome snips the technology for

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
genome snips the technology for
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.179
genome snips the technology for
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think
 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.490
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think
their estimates up now that the cost of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
their estimates up now that the cost of
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.460
their estimates up now that the cost of
sequencing of fully human genome can be

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470
sequencing of fully human genome can be
 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.530
sequencing of fully human genome can be
done for somewhere between maybe five

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
done for somewhere between maybe five
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.270
done for somewhere between maybe five
and ten thousand dollars or something

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
and ten thousand dollars or something
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.309
and ten thousand dollars or something
like that at the moment that cost is

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319
like that at the moment that cost is
 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.679
like that at the moment that cost is
going to come down and come down but at

bit of away from that and that's kind of
 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.120

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.840
I think that that's the one area that I
would say this is where genetics kind of

would say this is where genetics kind of
 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.730

let's look at this gene and see whether
this gene is involved and that's a very

what for diabetics what does that mean

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400
what for diabetics what does that mean
 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.980
what for diabetics what does that mean
in terms of your likelihood of getting

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990
in terms of your likelihood of getting
 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.680
in terms of your likelihood of getting
cardiovascular disease and so on so I

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690
cardiovascular disease and so on so I
 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.390
cardiovascular disease and so on so I
think those are the areas in which is

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400
think those are the areas in which is
 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.830
think those are the areas in which is
going to be a lot of work to try and

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840
going to be a lot of work to try and
 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.320
going to be a lot of work to try and
sort of understand the differences in

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.330
sort of understand the differences in
 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.810
sort of understand the differences in
populations and the differences in rates

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820
populations and the differences in rates

how much of that is genetic how much of
it is environment and what can one do

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150
it is environment and what can one do
 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.870
it is environment and what can one do
together to get around the other so what

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880
together to get around the other so what
 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.830
together to get around the other so what
kind of lifestyle changes can you make

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840
kind of lifestyle changes can you make
 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.570
kind of lifestyle changes can you make
to get around your genetic

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
to get around your genetic
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.460
to get around your genetic
predisposition to get developing obesity

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.470
predisposition to get developing obesity
 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.969
predisposition to get developing obesity
and and also what kind of behavioral

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979
and and also what kind of behavioral
 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:58.250

components might make it difficult or

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260
components might make it difficult or
 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.500
components might make it difficult or
easy for you to do that you know because

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.510
easy for you to do that you know because
 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.060
easy for you to do that you know because
it's often very difficult for people to

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.070
it's often very difficult for people to
 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.129
it's often very difficult for people to
change their lifestyle and that's where

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139
change their lifestyle and that's where
 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:05.570
change their lifestyle and that's where
that's where it's often the big

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580
that's where it's often the big
 

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.610
that's where it's often the big
challenge so we all know what we're

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620
challenge so we all know what we're
 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.020
challenge so we all know what we're
supposed to do in order to keep healthy

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.030
supposed to do in order to keep healthy
 

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.089
supposed to do in order to keep healthy
most of the time but it's difficult to

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099
most of the time but it's difficult to
 

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.620
most of the time but it's difficult to
do

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:13.630
 
 

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.050
 
the way that I think about it is that as

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.060
the way that I think about it is that as
 

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.590
the way that I think about it is that as
we as we develop new drugs I feel that I

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.600
we as we develop new drugs I feel that I
 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.450
we as we develop new drugs I feel that I
well I believe that personalized

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.460
well I believe that personalized
 

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.090
well I believe that personalized
medicine is the defining paradigm for

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.100
medicine is the defining paradigm for
 

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.310
medicine is the defining paradigm for
how we're going to do discovery and

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:26.320
how we're going to do discovery and
 

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.110
how we're going to do discovery and
development of drugs over there over the

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120
development of drugs over there over the
 

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.670
development of drugs over there over the
next few years when when we think about

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680
next few years when when we think about
 

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.279
next few years when when we think about
truly personalized medicine actually all

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.289
truly personalized medicine actually all
 

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.469
truly personalized medicine actually all
of these things have to come together so

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479
of these things have to come together so
 

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:40.440
of these things have to come together so
we have to have so the biology has to

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.450
we have to have so the biology has to
 

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.659
we have to have so the biology has to
take us in the right direction of which

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:42.669
take us in the right direction of which
 

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:45.540
take us in the right direction of which
drugs that we which pharmacology we

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:45.550
drugs that we which pharmacology we
 

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.580
drugs that we which pharmacology we
develop that's going to have to

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:47.590
develop that's going to have to
 

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.430
develop that's going to have to
translate into the populations in which

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440
translate into the populations in which
 

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.190
translate into the populations in which
we research and develop those drugs and

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200
we research and develop those drugs and
 

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.980
we research and develop those drugs and
when we go out into the marketplace and

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:55.990
when we go out into the marketplace and
 

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.570
when we go out into the marketplace and
we've got drugs that are going to be

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:57.580
we've got drugs that are going to be
 

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.210
we've got drugs that are going to be
used in populations it's not going to

quite a lot we've got quite a long way

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:27.910
quite a lot we've got quite a long way
 

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.150
quite a lot we've got quite a long way
to go in order to do that we've got to

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160
to go in order to do that we've got to
 

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.790
to go in order to do that we've got to
build that kind of infrastructure that

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800
build that kind of infrastructure that
 

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.270
build that kind of infrastructure that
enables us to do that as well as

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:35.280
enables us to do that as well as
 

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.560
enables us to do that as well as

exploiting the biology that's beginning
 

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.900
exploiting the biology that's beginning
to emerge but it's going to take a lot

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:39.910
to emerge but it's going to take a lot
 

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.330
to emerge but it's going to take a lot
it's going to take a long long time for

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:42.340
it's going to take a long long time for
 

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.400
it's going to take a long long time for
that to do that to get to that kind of

a little access card which contains all
of his or her medical records the doctor

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800
of his or her medical records the doctor
 

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.130
of his or her medical records the doctor
can access all of the medical records

00:09:59.130 --> 00:09:59.140
can access all of the medical records
 

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.410
can access all of the medical records
without a patient ever having to sit

think one of the critical challenges
over the next few years is to be able to

over the next few years is to be able to
 

00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:20.599
over the next few years is to be able to
bring these technologies and the

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:53.569
into the challenges that we have in
running clinical trials so a big big

00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579
running clinical trials so a big big
 

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:54.799
running clinical trials so a big big
challenge that we have in running

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:54.809
challenge that we have in running
 

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:56.989
challenge that we have in running
clinical trials is that many of the

00:11:56.989 --> 00:11:56.999
clinical trials is that many of the
 

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:58.729
clinical trials is that many of the
clinical trials that we have to do at an

00:11:58.729 --> 00:11:58.739
clinical trials that we have to do at an
 

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:02.449
clinical trials that we have to do at an
early stage in in in development are

00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459
early stage in in in development are
 

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.069
early stage in in in development are
going to be they're going to be long and

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079
going to be they're going to be long and
 

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.779
going to be they're going to be long and
they're going to be very expensive we've

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:05.789
they're going to be very expensive we've
 

00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:07.369
they're going to be very expensive we've
got to figure out a way to do those

00:12:07.369 --> 00:12:07.379
got to figure out a way to do those
 

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:12.409
got to figure out a way to do those
clinical trials cheaper quicker so that

00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:12.419
clinical trials cheaper quicker so that
 

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:14.119
clinical trials cheaper quicker so that
we can afford to develop the dogs to

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:14.129
we can afford to develop the dogs to
 

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:15.829
we can afford to develop the dogs to
bring those to market and there's a

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839
bring those to market and there's a
 

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:17.689
bring those to market and there's a
number of areas in which those are going

00:12:17.689 --> 00:12:17.699
number of areas in which those are going
 

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:19.909
number of areas in which those are going
to be very challenging and Alzheimer's

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:19.919
to be very challenging and Alzheimer's
 

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:24.139
to be very challenging and Alzheimer's
disease diabetes and cardiovascular risk

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:24.149
disease diabetes and cardiovascular risk
 

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:26.539
disease diabetes and cardiovascular risk
and those are going to be areas that are

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:26.549
and those are going to be areas that are
 

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:29.719
and those are going to be areas that are
going to be very challenging I guess the

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:29.729
going to be very challenging I guess the
 

00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:33.979
going to be very challenging I guess the
two disease areas in particular that I'd

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:33.989
two disease areas in particular that I'd
 

00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:38.349
two disease areas in particular that I'd
love to see em and you know really

00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:38.359
love to see em and you know really
 

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.599
love to see em and you know really
succeed at and are you know the

00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:41.609
succeed at and are you know the
 

00:12:41.609 --> 00:12:42.649
succeed at and are you know the
development of treatments for

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:42.659
development of treatments for
 

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:46.219
development of treatments for
Alzheimer's disease obviously I've got

00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:46.229
Alzheimer's disease obviously I've got
 

00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:48.379
Alzheimer's disease obviously I've got
I've had some Alzheimer's disease that's

00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:48.389
I've had some Alzheimer's disease that's
 

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.299
I've had some Alzheimer's disease that's
in the family and it would be great if

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:50.309
in the family and it would be great if
 

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:52.429
in the family and it would be great if
we could solve a lot of the challenges

00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:52.439
we could solve a lot of the challenges
 

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.379
we could solve a lot of the challenges
about really treating the disease

00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:54.389
about really treating the disease
 

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:57.289
about really treating the disease
underlying Alzheimer's and schizophrenia

00:12:57.289 --> 00:12:57.299
underlying Alzheimer's and schizophrenia
 

00:12:57.299 --> 00:12:59.499
underlying Alzheimer's and schizophrenia
which i think is just a you know a

00:12:59.499 --> 00:12:59.509
which i think is just a you know a
 

00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:02.059
which i think is just a you know a
horrendous the a.m crippling and

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:02.069
horrendous the a.m crippling and
 

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:04.699
horrendous the a.m crippling and
disabling disorder which we don't fully

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:04.709
disabling disorder which we don't fully
 

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:06.529
disabling disorder which we don't fully
understand and which I saw a lot of it

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:06.539
understand and which I saw a lot of it
 

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:08.809
understand and which I saw a lot of it
during my years in clinical practice I'd

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:08.819
during my years in clinical practice I'd
 

00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:10.999
during my years in clinical practice I'd
love to see us really get to grips with

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.009
love to see us really get to grips with
 

00:13:11.009 --> 00:13:12.590
love to see us really get to grips with
sort of

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600
sort of
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.380
sort of
defeating and you know really developing

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:16.390
defeating and you know really developing
 

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.269
defeating and you know really developing
great treatments for schizophrenia

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279
 
 

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.730
 
when I look at the group of people that

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740
when I look at the group of people that
 

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.489
when I look at the group of people that
I have working in in Pfizer is a group

00:13:28.489 --> 00:13:28.499
I have working in in Pfizer is a group
 

00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:31.519
I have working in in Pfizer is a group
of very highly talented highly skilled

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:31.529
of very highly talented highly skilled
 

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:34.699
of very highly talented highly skilled
scientists within my group and I think

00:13:34.699 --> 00:13:34.709
scientists within my group and I think
 

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:38.329
scientists within my group and I think
the the challenge that I feel in a sense

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339
the the challenge that I feel in a sense
 

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.579
the the challenge that I feel in a sense
most proud of is having been able to

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:40.589
most proud of is having been able to
 

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:45.350
most proud of is having been able to
build that group into into I would say

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360
build that group into into I would say
 

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.329
build that group into into I would say
pretty close to an intellectual power

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339
pretty close to an intellectual power
 

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:49.340
pretty close to an intellectual power
house that's recognized within the

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:49.350
house that's recognized within the
 

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.710
house that's recognized within the
organization so that's that's the one

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720
organization so that's that's the one
 

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.199
organization so that's that's the one
kind of challenge that I feel most proud

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:54.209
kind of challenge that I feel most proud
 

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.480
kind of challenge that I feel most proud
of I've been involved in a number of

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:56.490
of I've been involved in a number of
 

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.420
of I've been involved in a number of
sort of projects over the years that

00:13:59.420 --> 00:13:59.430
sort of projects over the years that
 

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.999
sort of projects over the years that
have been fairly significant challenges

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:02.009
have been fairly significant challenges
 

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:05.389
have been fairly significant challenges
a number of years ago we put together a

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399
a number of years ago we put together a
 

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:09.439
a number of years ago we put together a
team to build our own internal biobank

00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:09.449
team to build our own internal biobank
 

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.869
team to build our own internal biobank

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:11.879
to store and how samples from clinical
 

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:14.389
to store and how samples from clinical
trials that was a major achievement in

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399
trials that was a major achievement in
 

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:19.369
trials that was a major achievement in
many ways because we developed a plan

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:19.379
many ways because we developed a plan
 

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:22.850
many ways because we developed a plan
and put a plan together to build the

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860
and put a plan together to build the
 

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.670
and put a plan together to build the
first high-throughput robotic system at

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680
first high-throughput robotic system at
 

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.400
first high-throughput robotic system at

collection of samples that will be used

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540
collection of samples that will be used
 

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.840
collection of samples that will be used
and for which we've got great value out

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:32.850
and for which we've got great value out
 

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.119
and for which we've got great value out
of the research in over the next few

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:35.129
of the research in over the next few
 

00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:37.699
of the research in over the next few
years or so but I was you know a big

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:37.709
years or so but I was you know a big
 

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:39.710
years or so but I was you know a big
team effort that we put together and I

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720
team effort that we put together and I
 

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.360
team effort that we put together and I
was very proud of the work that we

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:41.370
was very proud of the work that we
 

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.470
was very proud of the work that we
achieved in that

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480
 
 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.199
 
I think what you'd what the next thing

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:47.209
I think what you'd what the next thing
 

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:48.519
I think what you'd what the next thing
you need to do is you need to have

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:48.529
you need to do is you need to have
 

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:51.730
you need to do is you need to have
people that have you know fundamentally

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:51.740
people that have you know fundamentally
 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.250
people that have you know fundamentally
very strong scientific credibility and

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:54.260
very strong scientific credibility and
 

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.750
very strong scientific credibility and
that means that they've done very good

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760
that means that they've done very good
 

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.810
that means that they've done very good
work and they've also got the ability to

00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:58.820
work and they've also got the ability to
 

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.810
work and they've also got the ability to
talk about that work and in a convincing

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:01.820
talk about that work and in a convincing
 

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.040
talk about that work and in a convincing
way that other people at a very at the

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.050
way that other people at a very at the
 

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.689
way that other people at a very at the
same scientific peer level in an

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:07.699
same scientific peer level in an
 

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:09.370
same scientific peer level in an
organization can really get to

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.380
organization can really get to
 

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.079
organization can really get to
understand and believe yes they can

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:11.089
understand and believe yes they can
 

00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:13.120
understand and believe yes they can
really do that and then you have to be

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.130
really do that and then you have to be
 

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.329
really do that and then you have to be
able to deliver on you know strong

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:16.339
able to deliver on you know strong
 

00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:19.060
able to deliver on you know strong
scientific projects that you run and be

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.070
scientific projects that you run and be
 

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.310
scientific projects that you run and be
able to sort of say that when we do

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320
able to sort of say that when we do
 

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.290
able to sort of say that when we do
something that we will deliver against

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:23.300
something that we will deliver against
 

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.269
something that we will deliver against
that will do very good science the

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279
that will do very good science the
 

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.949
that will do very good science the
results may not always come out the way

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959
results may not always come out the way
 

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.960
results may not always come out the way
that we want them to do but you know the

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:28.970
that we want them to do but you know the
 

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.000
that we want them to do but you know the
science that we do and delivers of the

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.010
science that we do and delivers of the
 

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.980
science that we do and delivers of the
top quality so what you really want to

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:32.990
top quality so what you really want to
 

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.579
top quality so what you really want to
do is you know focus on trying to get

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:35.589
do is you know focus on trying to get
 

00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:38.710
do is you know focus on trying to get
those core group of people within those

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720
those core group of people within those
 

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.870
those core group of people within those
individual scientists and who can then

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880
individual scientists and who can then
 

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.150
individual scientists and who can then
lead the organization I'm a great

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160
lead the organization I'm a great
 

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.879
lead the organization I'm a great
believer in in trying to recruit some of

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:48.889
believer in in trying to recruit some of
 

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:50.769
believer in in trying to recruit some of
the very top people and and letting them

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:50.779
the very top people and and letting them
 

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:53.350
