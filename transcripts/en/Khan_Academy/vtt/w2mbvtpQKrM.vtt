00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.148
- [Instructor] Previous videos

00:00:01.148 --> 00:00:03.488
we've talked a little bit
about distance traveled

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:04.958
versus displacement.

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.027
What I'm gonna do in
this video is discuss it

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:09.777
on a one dimensional number line.

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.335
And we'll get a little bit
more mathy in this video.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:17.128
So here is my number line.

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:19.664
Let's say that this is a zero,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:20.497
one, two

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:22.868
three,

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:24.108
four and it keeps going on

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:25.390
and then in the negative direction,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.992
negative one,

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.705
negative two,

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:30.983
and negative three.

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:33.811
And let's say that I start off

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:34.894
with a lemon.

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:40.582
Let's say my lemon starts
off right over here at zero

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.533
on my number line.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.810
And let's say it first
moves two to the right

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.781
so at first moves two to the right.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.286
I'll denote that by plus two

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:53.619
and then from there, it moves

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.036
three to the left

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.530
and then it moves three to the left.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.379
And I will use negative for the left.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.838
So it moves three to the left.

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:06.269
And then let's say that it then

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:07.102
moves

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.227
another one to the left.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.939
So then it goes another one to the left

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.639
and I'll denote negative one

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.965
as moving one to the left.

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:20.466
So based on what we know
about distance traveled

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.866
and displacement,

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.449
what is the distance
traveled for this dot?

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.616
Distance traveled.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:29.731
Pause the video

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.648
and see if you can figure that out.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:34.774
Or remember,

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:38.654
distance traveled is
the entire path length.

00:01:38.654 --> 00:01:42.569
Or the entire length of the dot's journey.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.425
So this is going to be equal to

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:46.435
two to the right.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:47.787
So plus two

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.510
and then three to the left.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.823
Now this is an important notion.

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:54.962
When we talk about distances,

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:58.069
we wouldn't say positive or negative.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.402
We just care about the absolute value of

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.714
the amount that we are traveling.

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:07.243
So we won't specify a direction.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:08.169
Now you might say, "hey,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.918
"where is the direction being specified?"

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:13.122
well implicitly, whether
something is positive or negative

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:14.062
on this number line

00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:15.539
is giving a direction.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.100
But if we're talking about distances,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.545
we wouldn't pay attention
to the direction.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:22.993
We only care about the magnitude.

00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:24.888
So this would be two

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:26.399
plus three

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.709
plus one.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.520
Doesn't matter if this is one to the left

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.353
or one to the right.

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:32.383
Doesn't even matter if it's
positive one or negative one.

00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:34.423
We care about its absolute value.

00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:36.506
We care about its magnitude.

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.069
So the distance traveled in this example

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.939
is going to be six units.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.353
Whatever the units are on my
number line right over here.

00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:46.906
If these are in meters

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:48.870
then this would be six meters.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870
Now what is the displacement?

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.725
Now remember, displacement
is net change in position.

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:56.808
Displacement.

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:00.880
What is that going to be?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.432
Pause the video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:03:04.432 --> 00:03:07.114
Well displacement is going to be

00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:09.093
you could view this as equal to

00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:11.148
your final position

00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:12.116
and we'll use X.

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:14.045
Let's say this is the X-axis.

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.762
So we'll say X final, your final position

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.270
minus your initial position.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.934
It's really just your change in position!

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.184
So what is your change in position here?

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.490
Well your final position is

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.251
you are at negative two
at x equals negative two.

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:33.121
And then what was your initial position?

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:35.601
Your initial position,
you started at zero.

00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:40.121
So negative two minus zero
is equal to negative two.

00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.169
So how would we visualize
that on our drawing here?

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.767
Well we started here.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.644
Just think about what is
your net change in position?

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.765
You started here.

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:50.820
And regardless of what your path was,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.237
you ended up two to the left.

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:56.588
So your

00:03:56.588 --> 00:03:59.421
your displacement is negative two.

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:02.962
Now displacement, we care

00:04:02.962 --> 00:04:04.439
not just about the magnitude.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.305
We care about the magnitude
and the direction.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:09.008
So you might be saying, well,

00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:10.673
where is the direction specified

00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:12.958
if I just say negative two?

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.556
Well, the sign in a one dimensional case

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:18.029
is giving us our direction.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.004
So the sign is giving us a direction.

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:24.681
I started off implicitly with this notion

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.417
that negative is to the left

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.242
and positive is to the right.

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:30.984
And we're in this one dimensional world.

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:33.909
And those are the only two
directions that I can travel in.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.811
So if I'm in this one dimensional world

00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:38.277
or if I'm thinking about
just one dimension,

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:41.050
the sign gives me my direction.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.965
So that's why displacement

00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:46.323
where I care about the
magnitude and the direction,

00:04:46.323 --> 00:04:48.420
I do care about the sign.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.628
While distance,

00:04:49.628 --> 00:04:52.369
where I only care about the magnitude,

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:55.253
I don't care about the sign.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.803
So I just keep adding up the magnitudes

00:04:57.803 --> 00:05:00.401
while over here, another
way you can think about it,

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:04.037
you first get displaced
by two to the right

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.549
so that's plus two.

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:07.290
The plus says to the right.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.520
Then you get displaced
by three to the left.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.853
So that is minus three.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:15.071
And then you get displaced
by one to the left again.

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.513
So that's minus one.

00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:17.830
That's why we're talking
about displacement.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.815
That's why we care about the sign.

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:22.393
And if you are to add
all of these together,

00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:25.186
you are going to get a net displacement

00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:26.363
of negative two.

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:28.934
But an easier way was just
what's your final position

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:31.267
minus your initial position?
