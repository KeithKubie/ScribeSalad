00:00:07.364 --> 00:00:09.600
Sunscreen comes in many forms,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.310
each with its own impacts on your body
and the environment.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.730
With so many options,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.129
how do you choose which sunscreen
is best for you?

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:19.451
To answer that question,

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:22.329
we first have to understand
how sunscreens work.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.587
Sunlight is composed
of electromagnetic waves

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:28.669
and is our primary source
of ultraviolet radiation,

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.619
which has a shorter wavelength than
visible light and carries more energy.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:34.620
UVA,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.590
UVB,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.830
and UVC are classified according
to their wavelengths.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.598
Short wavelength UVC
never reaches the Earth's surface,

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:48.090
but UVB and UVA do.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.044
Medium wavelength UVB rays
can enter the skin's superficial layers

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:57.021
and long length UVA rays
can penetrate into the deeper layers.

00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:00.961
UVB in small amounts actually helps
us make vitamin D,

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.511
which enables our bodies to build
and maintain strong bones.

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:09.062
However, prolonged exposure to UVA
and UVB can damage DNA,

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.552
age your skin,

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:14.302
and promote the development
of potentially deadly skin cancer.

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:18.751
Sunscreen protects your skin
either physically by deflecting UV rays

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:22.691
with an inorganic blocker 
like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide,

00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:27.612
or chemically by using carbon-based
compounds to absorb UV photons

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:30.723
that are then harmlessly 
dissipated as heat.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:34.562
So, what differentiates one sunscreen
from another?

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:35.972
When we choose a sunscreen,

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.522
we can compare application method,

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:39.803
the SPF,

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:41.262
and the active ingredients.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:44.222
Sprays can be convenient to put on,
especially when you're wet,

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:47.694
but a recent study found that most people
don't apply a thick enough layer

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:49.441
to get full protection.

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.251
And the possible health risks of inhaling 
sunscreen compounds from a spray cloud

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:57.052
might make you consider reaching
for that bottle of lotion instead.

00:01:57.052 --> 00:02:02.291
Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF
of at least 15, although 30 is better.

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:06.702
SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much
UVB radiation is needed

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:09.174
to give protected skin a sunburn.

00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:14.342
SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking
93% of UVB rays.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.863
You get a slight increase as SPF goes up,

00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:19.253
with SPF 30 blocking 97%,

00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:22.204
and 50 blocking 98%.

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.154
SPF is based on the quantity
of solar exposure.

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:27.490
So how much time you have before
you start to burn

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.815
really depends on a long list of factors,

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.194
including your genetics,

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:34.883
and when, where, and how
you spend your time in the sun.

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:38.672
Even though US marketed sunscreens
have been deemed safe by the FDA,

00:02:38.672 --> 00:02:42.253
scientists are still researching
the effects of many active ingredients

00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:44.126
on the human body.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:46.408
So if you're worried 
about potential irritants,

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:51.249
look for mineral-based formulas
with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.644
Even though they may go on 
a bit thick at first,

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:57.575
they're less irritating than carbon-based
chemical sunscreens.

00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:01.773
These mineral-based sunscreens
are preferential for the environment, too.

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:05.114
If you plan on catching rays
while splashing in a river or the ocean,

00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:07.485
keep in mind that carbon-based
chemical sunscreens

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:10.134
can harm marine life.

00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:12.107
Take coral reefs, for example.

00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:16.298
Although they cover less than 1%
of the Earth's underwater surface,

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:20.186
they're home to nearly 25% of all
fish species,

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:24.046
making them the most diverse
and productive marine ecosystems.

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:27.164
Research shows that carbon-based
chemical sunscreen ingredients,

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:32.894
like oxybenzone, butylparaben, 
octinoxate, and 4MBC

00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:36.656
contribute to a stress condition called
coral bleaching in corals,

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:39.323
which are living creatures.

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:41.197
Exposure to these organic compounds

00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:45.256
results in the death 
of the coral's symbiotic algae.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.776
In addition to providing 
a reliable food source,

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:51.016
these algae give coral their brilliant
rainbow of colors.

00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:53.706
Without them, corals turn a bleached white

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:56.893
and are susceptible to disease
and possibly death.

00:03:56.893 --> 00:03:58.337
And once the coral dies,

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:01.746
the entire reef ecosystem 
is not far behind.

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:06.026
So you're now ready to make an informed
choice when picking out your next sunscreen.

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.748
SPF is clearly labeled on the front.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.332
On the back under "active ingredients,"

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.185
you can find whether zinc oxide,

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.706
titanium dioxide,

00:04:14.706 --> 00:04:18.336
and those coral-harming components
are present.

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:20.887
Taking a bit more time to check
can be well worth it

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:23.177
for both you and the environment.
