00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the old days air traffic control was .. didn't really exist as such.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.800
An airplane wanting to fly from one place to another

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.250
would just take off and would try to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.660
work out how to get to wherever it was going.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.730
Over time it was realized that we

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.320
needed some form of air traffic control

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.880
in order to more or less to avoid

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.350
airplanes from banging into one another,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.210
but also to provide them with a service

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.070
so they actually would know what the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.960
conditions were enroute and so on and so forth.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.820
So during the fifties and sixties

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.619
what evolved was the idea of an air

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.660
traffic control center where once the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.210
airplane was away from the environment

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.219
of the airfield we now had a control

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.500
center which would then manage the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.850
aircraft through what's called the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.100
Airways system. And the airways is up at

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.440
high-level, it's once you've got

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.090
away from the airport then you're into

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.860
the airways system. The next problem was

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.180
how do we actually make all that work.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.399
Now, in the old days you'd literally have

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.079
had a controller in sitting in front of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.239
radar and assistants running around with

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.500
flight strips taking them from one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.690
controller to the other, and that clearly

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.489
wasn't going to work in the longer term.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.199
Essentially a flight strip, when a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.539
commercial flight flies it files

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.280
what's called a flight plan and the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.170
flight plan says what the the flight

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.400
intends to do.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.140
Where its going from, where its going to.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.260
What its routing is, what type of aircraft

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.119
it is and so on and so forth. Quite a a lot of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.159
information and essentially that ends up

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.170
becoming a flight strip which follows

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.540
that flight around. By the mid to late

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.130
60s we started to try to introduce

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.830
computers into this, effectively to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.229
coordinate the movement of air traffic and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.630
particularly to ensure that the controller

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.000
had the information that he required, but

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.920
also that the hand over between

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.470
controllers, as the flights progressed,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.390
was done in a structured kind of fashion.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.460
By the time we get down to nineteen seventy

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.470
we actually have a control room that's

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.329
at west drayton and what that was doing

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.310
was providing control for everything in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.110
the airways system from the south coast

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.030
right the way up to the Scottish border.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.829
There's an equivalent one at prestwick

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.990
which does Scotland and then basically

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.490
pushes the aircraft out across the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.250
Atlantic. Each one of these hoods here is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.460
effectively a radar sector an area of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.710
airspace which is controlled by that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.119
controller. So what you've got here is a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.280
couple of controllers, the director who

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.649
is overall in charge of that sector and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.060
effectively what's happening is as the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.350
flight progresses it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.120
moves from sector to sector until

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.830
eventually disappears outside of the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.360
British air control controlled airspace.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.970
One of the early attempts was to put in

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.950
a computer called the myriad, this is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.390
around the late sixties into about

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.250
nineteen seventies. It takes a long time

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.410
to develop this sort of software and by the time

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.270
the software had actually been developed so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.820
reasonably, so it was in reasonably working condition

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.470
air traffic had increased to such an extent

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.420
that the myriad was no longer capable of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.670
doing the job. In fact it wasn't capable

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.080
of even doing the civil job. It was

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.610
originally designed to do civil and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.840
military. It was designed for

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.580
fault-tolerant environments so it was a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.710
triplex system. Three computer systems

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.630
effective they're all three computer

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.640
systems were doing the same job and what

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.170
would happen is that an arbitrator would

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.840
decide who got the right answer.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.430
Hopefully all three got the same answer

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.230
but if they didn't then it would decide

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.970
which was most likely answer and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.380
basically two out of three was the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.600
arrangement. We were continually chasing

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.860
up against the limitations of what the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.140
computer systems could do. The next

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.790
attempt was really when it all started

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.160
working which was in 1972 or

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.280
thereabouts-- the Board of Trade as it was

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.100
then decided that it was going to go out

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.340
and procure the 53rd, i think it was, air

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.720
traffic control systems from the United

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.030
States because they already had this

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.700
sectorised control system using big IBM

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.640
mainframe computers. The IBM 360 is the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.380
underlying machine behind this.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.140
10 million pounds of equipment in 1972 ish

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.480
there abouts for the first time we now

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.220
have enough processing power - more or less

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.930
to be able to do the job completely.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.880
What's being pictured here is some of the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.580
initial testing that's being done before

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.560
the system went operational. Testing all

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.210
of the various different conditions and making

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.340
sure that if we did nasty things to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.330
a bit over here

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.860
a bit over there, they didn't fall over.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.540
That's actually me running with one of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.210
the tests sometime in 1974 it would be.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.560
I'd come back from the United States

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.300
where I went to the training course at

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.000
the end of 73, by 1974 i was in there

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.220
I was a bit younger and thinner in those days.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.420
Sean&gt; What did it feel like going over to the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.460
States and learning that, was that a new thing for you?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.650
It was an extraordinary thing, i was twenty

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.390
barely twenty-two when I went out to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.850
states and and I was basically a happy

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.140
technician. It was like all my christmasses

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.120
come at once. As a youngster who was

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.160
interested in technology to have a 10

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.600
million pound computer at my disposal

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.520
was just just extraordinary.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.780
We were actually encouraged

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.310
to, particularly when we were on the training

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.900
course, we were encouraged to write software.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.880
So i decided one of the things that I

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.350
decide that try and do is to write a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.090
game where the computer played Monopoly

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.400
and you can see here the high-speed

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.410
printers these printers would run at six

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.850
hundred lines per minute. And i wrote

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.110
this whole thing in assembler the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.150
computer would make a move and it would

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.460
then print the Monopoly board. So this

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.800
thing was throwing up pages like mad and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.990
as the game progressed so the computer

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.910
had to do more and more work and so everything

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.860
got slower and slower. So it wasn't quite

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.480
throwing the pages at the same sort of speed.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.830
Everything was paper-based. This was

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.480
before the days of VDUs, we didn't

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.100
have VDUs and things like that. This is

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.810
the system control here. The system

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.060
control is effectively the center

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.950
of gravity of this entire system.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.900
What we then have is three compute elements

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.440
which were IBM 360-65s, which in their day were

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.930
quite powerful computers. They had behind

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.860
them,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.560
get this, three-and-a-half mega words

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.169
of memory, core memory, three-and-a-half

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.820
mega words.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.000
Yeah they're 32-bit words. so what would

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.370
that be around about forty megabytes or

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.130
something of that order of RAM. And we

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.780
ran the whole of the national air

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.610
traffic service on that without any

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.870
problem. In fact we could run it on about

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.610
three of them. We had seven storage

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.370
elements and we could run with three, we

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.220
prefered to have four so each one was half

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.590
a mega word. Then behind there was three

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.930
input output controllers which were IBM

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.919
360-50s now the IOCE, input output

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.690
control element, was responsible for

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.280
talking to all the various different

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.750
pieces of equipment that are attached to

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.640
this. So we have flight strip printers,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.310
radar systems, all sorts of things all

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.050
feeding information in or receiving

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.810
information out from the 90-20 and they

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.400
were managed by the input output

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.419
control elements which you can't see

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.979
they're just behind there. The system

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.450
actually worked for quite a long time in

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.720
fact it was in service as this system

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.130
itself right the way through til

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.990
1990 when it was replaced by

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.110
4381 computers, a quarter / a third the size

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.490
and something like 10 times more

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.620
powerful but essentially running exactly

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.110
the same software in emulation mode in "360

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.470
emulation mode." So this was still at west

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.449
drayton.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.610
And really that was mostly done because

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.409
this was quite old equipment even when

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.439
it was first put in and so it was

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.360
becoming too expensive to maintain. The

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.889
skills and knowledge necessary to

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.509
maintain it were effectively becoming

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.300
difficult to find now. So that was the

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.800
reason that was done and that kept

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.819
things going right the way through

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.039
really until the early two thousands

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.139
when it became apparent that really what

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.789
was happening now was that computing was

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.650
moving away from the large mainframe

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.849
environment to much more distributed

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.099
architecture. By now we have networking,

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:00.349
we have the ability to have mini and

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:01.699
micro computers which is where they

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.589
where we want them rather than having in

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:07.520
them in a major computer suite. So really

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.960
the west drayton environment wasn't

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.909
designed for that, it was designed with

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.919
the idea of having central processing

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.810
bays and lots and lots and lots of

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.759
cables running underneath ducts under

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.979
the floor to where they're going to be

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:20.930
used. In addition the RAF who actually

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.580
owned the west drayton site they kind of

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.710
wanted it back so there's lots of

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.120
reasons why eventually in the early

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.069
2000s we started looking at the idea of

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:29.899
moving to a new control center. This is

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.460
swanwick and effectively that

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.259
completely replaced the west drayton

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:33.919
setup.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.810
Interestingly however, some of the code

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.189
which was written way up here back in

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:38.990
the nineteen seventies is actually still

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.240
in use to this day down here. A friend

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.219
of mine who worked together with me on a

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:44.839
lot of this software, going back to the

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.669
early seventies, he said "hey you know I

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:48.439
was I was kicking around in some code

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.209
the other day, just looking at it" and he says "and I

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:51.949
came across your initials against a line

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.439
of code," he says, "I thought about you." So

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.839
the thing is if this software still

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.009
works it ain't broke

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.110
so why fix it. The problem of air

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.089
traffic control is continually evolving

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:04.580
but the core functions are exactly the

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.180
same.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.830
It takes a long time to get it all debugged,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.139
so we might as well keep with the code

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.180
that we've already got. However over time

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.339
eventually that code will be replaced

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:16.520
but it's it's a slower process. This was

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.469
a major exercise getting this to work in

00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:20.839
the in the 70s so they've really

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:23.029
sweating the assets and

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:24.259
taking advantage of the fact that its extremely

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:25.880
reliable code.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.340
We'd like to thank Audible for supporting

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.000
computerphile and if you go to

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.370
audible.com/computerphile there's a

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.200
chance to sign up for a 30-day free

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.169
trial and download a free audio book. The

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.240
book I'd like to recommend is

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.210
Ernest Cline's Ready Player One. I enjoyed it so

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.100
much I went off and downloaded his other

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.200
book Armada as well, but ready

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.850
player one is well worth checking out if

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.890
you love the idea of a seamless VR

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.130
system, dystopian future, lots of eighties

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.140
pop culture references. I know a lot of

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.460
people have been recommending ready

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.900
player one. Its currently being made into

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.000
a film so check it out and thanks once

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.470
again to audible for supporting the

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.900
computerphile channel. The other two

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.300
canisters are actually butane cylinders

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.730
which were discarded and they act kind

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.950
of like a gas capacitor. They are called

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.580
accumulators and they store gas close to

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.050
where it comes out so that it can come

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:26.500
out quickly
