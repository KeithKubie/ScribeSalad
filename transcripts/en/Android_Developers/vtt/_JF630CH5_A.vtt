MALE SPEAKER: Hey, developers.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.430
You know what really
grinds my gears?

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.140
When I'm at a
store and I realize

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.670
I forgot that 15% off coupon
I got in the mail or the gift

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.410
card I got for my birthday.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.060
Or I'm at the
register, and I can't

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.020
remember which phone number
to use with my loyalty card.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.570
It's 2016, folks.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.670
There's got to be a better way.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.840
Well, that's where you come in.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.340
With Save to Android
Pay Deep Links,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.860
it's now easier
than ever for you

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.400
to digitize your loyalty
program, gift cards,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.980
and offers.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.570
Once you do that, I can start
storing them on my phone

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.490
so they're always with
me and ready to use.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.520
The easier it is for me to save,
the more likely I am to shop.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.330
So we both win.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.940
To get you started,
I'll show you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.630
how to digitize a loyalty
card and add it to an e-mail

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.000
so that it's super easy
for a customer to save it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.400
First, you'll need to create a
Save to Android Pay Deep Link.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.890
Step 1, create a class.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.010
Step 2, define the
object in JSON.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.215
Step 3, create
the JSON web token

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.830
or JOT by signing
with your private key.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.650
Step 4, place the
JOT and class ID

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.070
in the Deep Link URL seen here.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.820
And now that you've
created the Deep Link,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.290
put it behind a
button in an email.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.800
When a customer
gets your e-mail,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.220
they can simply tap on the
Save to Android Pay button,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
confirm, and boom-- their
loyalty card will be

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.260
instantly added to Android Pay.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.060
What's that?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.542
No more entering phone
numbers at checkout?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.000
So I've just shown you how to
embed the Save to Android Pay

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.082
Deep Link in an email.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:30.040
But did you know you can
use it anywhere a link

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.430
works, including SMS, your
website, or your Android app?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.310
And once a customer saves your
digital cards to Android Pay,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.980
you can use our REST
API to provide them

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.350
with really cool real-time
info, including how many loyalty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.090
points they've earned,
their gift card

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.020
balance, or their offer
redemption status.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.800
I'd like to see you do
that with a physical card.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.860
So what are you're waiting for?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.470
Check out our tutorial
on how to get started.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.390
In a few short
hours, your customers

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.220
can start saving your loyalty
program, gift cards, and offers

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.510
to Android Pay so they'll
never lose track of them again.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.500
Plus, it'll be easier
than ever for them to use

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.990
these items at your store.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.930
They can have the
cashier scan the barcode.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.821
Or if you've
implemented Smart Tap,

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.820
they can simply tap their
phone to the terminal.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.570
