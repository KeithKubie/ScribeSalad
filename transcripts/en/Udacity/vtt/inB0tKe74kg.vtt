00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.630
Joanne, it's really, really exciting to actually look at my paternal

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.180
line and see sort of how far back in time and, and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.280
geography we can go with this. But, if you don't have a

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.750
Y chromosome then how could you ever look at your paternal lineage?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And many women are interested in exactly that same thing.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.380
Even though we don't have Y chromosomes. So, but there is a way

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.140
to trace your paternal line even if you don't have a y

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
chromosome. And that is to find someone who has your father's y chromosome.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.160
my father passed away years ago so he

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.549
wasn't available for testing. but my uncle kindly

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.900
agreed to get tested and so I was able to learn about my paternal line through

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.190
him. And other possibilities if I had had

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.570
a brother. If my paternal grandfather had been

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.590
alive. So there are a number of relatives

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.530
who can help a woman trace her paternal line.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, Matt. So, we see here that you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.810
and your dad have a, a paternal lineage called I1.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.770
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.760
&gt;&gt; actually, I1 star. And we see, from the map, that it's very,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.910
very frequent in Northern Europe, particularly in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.440
Scandinavia. I don't know if you were

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.880
aware of any Scandinavian ancestry on your

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000
dad's side. But that's, this is suggesting

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.810
that if you go far enough back on your dad's side. you might find

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.054
that you have an ancestor who's, lives in Scandinavia.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.080
&gt;&gt; Now this fits with the autosomal ancestry pattern that we saw

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950
for me, right, where it said I had a strong Northern European descent.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950
&gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, yes, yes. So this

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.720
is just. Reinforcing that information that we see.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.770
&gt;&gt; I see, and it says that over here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.470
that age is 28,000 years. What does that mean exactly?

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.810
&gt;&gt; So this lineage like all the the haplogroups are

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.590
defined by a particular mutation that happened,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440
you know, a long time ago. And in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.910
this case, 28,000 years ago a mutation

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.900
happened on the y chromosome. And it's the

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.080
defining, and then everybody who inherited that particular y chromosone also

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.620
inherited that mutation. And so, the last 28,000 years men

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.080
and their sons have carried that particular mutation and you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.870
are part of kind of that clan.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.310
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.700
&gt;&gt; Of, of males with this particular lineage.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580
&gt;&gt; So this means that, in this region here.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.791
Somewhere in this region is where that mutation happened.

00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:16.140
&gt;&gt; It's, well.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.050
&gt;&gt; About 28,000 years ago?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.150
&gt;&gt; We don't know for sure where it happened.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.360
But because it's most frequent in this general region now.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.930
&gt;&gt; We, We speculate that it was probably in that,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.800
in that general area. You know, very far North in Europe.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.920
&gt;&gt; Now,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.270
let's take a look, at actually. Let's go back to Roy.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. King.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.450
&gt;&gt; Roy King and his father, Roy King, Sr, both have a lineage that is

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.280
fairly common in in Jewish men. and that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.520
fits with Roy's understanding that his father's father was Jewish. So,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.190
we're really seeing his grandfather right there in the DNA

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
of the y chromosome. So to go a little deeper let's click on

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.530
the history tab and move away from the map. And this is an

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.625
overall, you know, story about the, the history of this lineage J2.

00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:17.860
and and it mentions the, the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.840
branches of this J2 haplogroup spreading with the Jewish diaspora from

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.740
the Middle East across Europe. so this is just what is, and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.560
this, all this information comes from studies of people who currently carry the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.740
J2 lineage around the world. And so many scientists have conducted studies

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.180
and they publish papers and then this story is drawn from those publications.
