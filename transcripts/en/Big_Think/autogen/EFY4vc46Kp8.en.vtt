00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 align:start position:0%
the normal brain so it's actually it
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
the normal brain so it's actually it

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 align:start position:0%

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:46.810 align:start position:0%

00:20:56.969 --> 00:20:56.979 align:start position:0%
should help because the brain we have to
 

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
