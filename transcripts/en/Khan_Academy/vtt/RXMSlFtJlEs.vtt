00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.877
Simplify the rational
expression and state the domain.

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:06.460
So we have a rational
expression here.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.290
One expression being
divided by another one.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.280
And so to simplify
it, I am guessing

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.360
that we will have to
factor this top expression

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.600
and this bottom expression.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.741
And there's probably
common factors

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.240
that we might be
able to cancel out.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.406
But we have to be very
careful about how we do them.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:24.080
So let's factor each of these.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.310
So you may or may
not remember how

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.440
to factor quadratic
expressions that

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.790
have a non-one
coefficient out here.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.470
So this will be
practice in that.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.051
And we go into the rationale
for why it works in those videos

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.300
where we first learned to
factor rational expressions.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.290
And they're in this playlist.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.540
But just as a reminder,
what you want to do is you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.390
want to split this middle term.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.410
You want to split the first
degree term into two terms.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.950
You want to group it, one
of them with this 2x squared

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.370
and one of it with the 20.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.060
And you want to group
it into two terms

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.910
so that the coefficients
of the two terms,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.230
when you take their product, is
the same thing as 2 times 20.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.420
So you want to break--
let me write it over here.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.000
You want to break 13x,
you want to break it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.660
into an ax plus a bx, where a
times b is equal to 2 times 20.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.780
And we show why this
works in a previous video.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.820
So a times b needs
to be equal to 40.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.580
And a plus b needs
to be equal to 13.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.982
So let's just think
about the factors of 40.

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:32.210
1 and 40 are not going to work.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.110
2 and 20 are not going to
work, they don't add up to 13.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.981
3 and 3-- well, 3
doesn't go into 40.

00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:42.390
4 and 10 does not work.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.360
5 and 8-- so if we take 5
times 8, that does equal 40.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.280
And then 5 plus 8 does equal 13.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.580
So that's looking pretty good.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.150
So let's split up the
13x along those lines.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:08.870
So we get 2x squared plus 5
plus 5x plus 8x is plus 20.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.980
So all I did is I split up
this 13x into a 5x plus an 8x.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.470
And now we can group
these two terms.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.680
And then let's go down over
here and do the same thing

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.130
in the denominator.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.760
So let's do the same exact
thing in the denominator.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.820
Once again, we want to find
two numbers that add up to 17

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.110
and whose product is
2 times 30, or 60.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.880
So if we look at the factors
of 60, 1 and 60 don't work.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.960
They don't add up to 17.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.140
Or if you took the negative
1 and negative 60--

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.300
you're not going to have
negative numbers because they

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.070
would have to be the same
sign since this is positive.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.630
And then they would give you
a negative value over here.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.080
So we have to deal
with positive numbers.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.900
2 and 30 don't work.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.750
3 and 15-- remember, we
want to get to 2 times 30,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.006
we want to get to 60.

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:04.160
3 times 15-- sorry,
not 3 times 15.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.150
3 times 20 doesn't work.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.950
Their product is 60, but
it doesn't add up to 17.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.110
4 times 15 does not work.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.530
5 times 12-- 5 times 12
is 60, so that works.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.075
That's the same
thing as 2 times 30.

00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:24.380
It equals 60.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.226
And 5 plus 12 is 17.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:27.475
So that's looking pretty good.

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:29.930
So let's separate
this out into 2x

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.260
squared plus 5x
plus 12x plus 30.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.370
And then we can
group them like this.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.962
And then let's see
how we can simplify

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:43.045
each of these expressions.

00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:47.046
This top expression over here,
we have a common factor of x.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:48.420
So this top
expression over here,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.110
we can factor out
an x out of this.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.310
So this becomes x times-- and
2x squared divided by x is 2x.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.830
5x divided by x, when you
have the x factored out, that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.460
is just 5.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.180
So this first term
is x times 2x plus 5.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.375
And then plus-- over here
we can factor out a 4.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.470
4 is divisible into
both 8x and into 20.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.300
So let's factor out a 4.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.930
So this is 4 times-- 8x with a
4 factored out is now just 2x.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.660
And then 20 with a 4
factored out is just a 5.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.910
And then let's do
the bottom over here.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.390
I'm kind of doing them both
simultaneously in parallel.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.840
The bottom over here,
we can factor out

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.880
an x out of this expression.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.060
So this is x times--
once again, 2x plus 5.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.070
Plus, this expression over
here, we can factor out a 6

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.960
out of both 12x and 30.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.690
So let's factor out a 6.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.110
And then 12x divided by 6 is 2x.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.270
And then 30 divided by 6 is 5.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.970
2x plus 5.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.820
And so we can simplify this.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.420
We can factor out,
from this term

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.560
we can factor out a 2x
plus 5, from this term we

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.440
can factor out a 2x plus 5.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.130
So if we factor out a 2x
plus 5 from both of these--

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.870
so we're factoring
out a 2x plus 5,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.400
you're left with
an x and a plus 4.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.320
You're left with an x plus 4.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.330
And then down here we can
factor out a 2x plus 5.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.110
Down here we can
factor out a 2x--

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.650
let me make it in
that same color.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.540
We can factor out a 2x plus 5.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.890
So we're literally just
factoring out a 2x plus 5,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.800
and we're left with an x plus 6.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.550
We're just doing the
distributive property

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.640
in reverse over here. x plus 6.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.270
Now, you might be
tempted to say,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.350
hey look, I have a 2x plus
5 in the numerator, 2x

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.170
plus 5 in the denominator,
let me just cancel them out

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.461
really fast and I would have
simplified the expression.

00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.370
We have to be very
careful, because we first

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.500
need to think about the domain.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.333
Because if we just
simplify this expression,

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.506
and we include things in
the simplified domain that

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:55.630
weren't included in the
original function's domain,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.520
we've actually changed
the expression.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.020
Or we've changed the function.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.560
So we have to be very careful
that even when we simplify it,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.590
we keep the domain the same.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.570
So what's the domain
of this thing?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.090
Well, it's going to be all real
numbers except the ones that

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.344
make the denominator equal to 0.

00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:11.760
And what are the
numbers that make

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.410
the denominator equal to 0?

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.820
Well, the denominator is equal
to 0 if x plus 6 is equal to 0,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.310
or 2x plus 5 is equal to 0.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.880
And if x plus 6 is 0, then that
means that x is negative 6.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.750
Subtract 6 from both sides.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.890
Over here we could
subtract 5 from both sides.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.420
So you get 2x is
equal to negative 5.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.590
Divide both sides by 2, you
get x is equal to negative 5/2.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.290
So the domain of
this expression right

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.066
over here, the domain of this
expression-- if we could call

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.440
this a function,
if we defined it

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.610
as f of x is equal to all
of this-- the domain of it

00:06:50.610 --> 00:07:01.480
is going to be all real
numbers, except negative 6

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.580
and negative 5/2.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.980
These will make this
expression undefined.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.630
It will make this
denominator equal to 0.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.980
Now we can simplify it, as long
as we keep this denominator.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.590
So now, if we assume
that we're never

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.550
going to see a negative
5/2, then 2x plus 5

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.400
is never going to be
equal to 0, and so we

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.850
can divide the numerator and
denominator by that value,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.130
canceling it out.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.850
And so the simplified
expression is what's left over.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.480
x plus 4 over x plus 6.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.762
But we have to keep
the same domain.

00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:37.220
If we didn't write
this here, you'd

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.636
say, OK, the only
thing that would

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:40.780
make this thing 0 is x
is equal to negative 6.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.720
We have to remember, this is
a simplified version of that.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.750
And in order for these to be
identical expressions, or maybe

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.270
identical function
definitions, they

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.230
need to have the
exact same domain.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.300
So the domain for this
simplified expression

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.950
has to be the same
as the original.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:01.090
All real numbers except
negative 6 and negative 5/2.
