[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.930
SPEAKER: Today, I'd like to
welcome Dr. Jessica Tracy.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.510
She's a researcher and
professor of psychology

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.820
at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820
That's Vancouver, Canada,
not Vancouver, Washington.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.350
And she's the leading expert
on the emotion of pride.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.476
I personally found her book
absolutely fascinating.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:21.850
I think it will
be relevant to us

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.530
here at Google and
to people everywhere.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.420
Please give a warm
welcome to Jessica Tracy.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.242
JESSICA TRACY: Thank you.

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.700
SPEAKER: So today, we're going
to have a moderated question

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.210
and answer.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.720
I prepared some questions
for Dr. Tracy ahead of time

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.352
and let her know what they are.

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:39.810
So she's not going
to be surprised.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.690
I'll ask the questions.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.148
And then after the
questions, we'll

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.790
have an open audience question
and answer with the microphone

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.444
right here.

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:47.860
And we'll have a
book signing over

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.700
on the table in the far corner.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.080
So why do we need
to words for pride?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.640
And what words do you suggest?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.700
And can you give examples of
people showing both kinds?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.110
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.960
So what we found--
so pride, it's

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.080
an interesting emotion in many
ways I hope we'll talk about.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.510
And one of the most
interesting things about it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.012
is we often think it's
a bad thing, something

00:01:10.012 --> 00:01:11.220
that we shouldn't experience.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.350
Right?

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.030
It's sort of this
sinful emotion.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.320
It's considered to be a deadly
sin in some religious views.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.130
It's egotism.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.270
It's arrogance.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.080
And in fact, what we found is
that yes, that's part of pride.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.590
But it's not all that pride is.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.050
There actually are two
different forms of pride.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.320
And we use the same word to
describe them in English.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.390
We don't have two
different words.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.440
Interestingly, in some
languages, that's not the case.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.981
There are two different words
for these two different things.

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:34.160
But in English, they're not.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.480
And so we need to
make a distinction

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.200
between the kind of pride that's
I would say the bad pride.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.502
We call "hubristic pride."

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.960
And we used that
word, "hubristic,"

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.957
because that comes from the
Greek's word, "hubris," which

00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:51.540
in the Greek understanding, it
was someone who thought that he

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.170
was more god-like than human.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.490
The classic example
in Greek literature

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.990
is Icarus, whose
father built him wings.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.697
And then he used them to fly
too close to the sun and died.

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:04.030
And that's a classic example
of hubristic pride, someone

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.390
who thinks they're so
great, and theoretically,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.530
has a downfall as
a result of that.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.740
And I think
psychologically speaking,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.930
there are real negatives,
that hubristic pride.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.471
People who feel this
hubristic pride,

00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.627
this sense of superiority over
others, do have many problems.

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:22.710
And typically, those
problems result from the fact

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.501
that they think they're
better than others.

00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:27.007
And they use others in order
to boost themselves up.

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:28.840
So often, they will put
others down in order

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.320
to feel good about themselves.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.310
This causes them to
be not very likable.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.520
And so people who have a lot
of hubris tend to be disliked.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.359
They're antisocial.

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.400
They're often aggressive.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.290
They're manipulative.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.040
And they have real
relationship problems.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.790
But then there's this
other kind of pride.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.350
And this other kind
of pride, I'd say it's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.760
the sense of
confidence that we take

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.290
from a hard-earned
accomplishment.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.480
Right?

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.660
It's what we feel when
we're achieving, when we're

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.326
working hard, when
we're being creative,

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:55.230
when we're being innovative.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.900
And it's what motivates
us to put in the hard work

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.074
to create great things,
to do great things.

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:01.990
And that kind of pride
is really a good thing.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.210
And what I argue in
this book is that it's

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.826
the thing that
makes us want to do

00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:07.200
all the amazing
things that we've

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.890
done as individuals
and as a species.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.430
It's what makes us want
to achieve and be great.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.380
The term that we've
come up for that pride

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.481
is "authentic pride."

00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:16.980
And the reason that
we use that word

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.350
is because it makes
a nice distinction,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.700
I think, between
with hubristic pride.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.920
Authentic pride is based on
the authentic or genuine sense

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.420
of self.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.920
And we feel it when we
make a realistic appraisal

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.250
of ourselves, when we
look at who we really are,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.179
how we're doing,
what we're achieving,

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.970
think about what we
want, and see ourselves

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.960
in a realistic manner.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.300
That's authentic pride.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.090
Hubristic pride, in
contrast, is based

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.716
on a more grandiose and inflated
sense of self, so inauthentic.

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:43.506
So that's why we used
the term, "authentic"

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.540
because it's a nice
contrast and it points out

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.790
this key distinction.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.480
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.720
So what is the message of
your book in a nutshell?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.700
JESSICA TRACY: So I would say
my book has three messages.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.750
So I'm going to give you
three nutshells or three nuts,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.250
however you may
want to think of it.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.661
The first is that pride
is part of human nature.

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.910
And this, I think, is something
that maybe some people

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.701
would know already.

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:10.330
But other people, I
think, assume know.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.140
We feel pride.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.772
And we care a lot about pride
in the US and Western cultures

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:15.730
because we're an
individualistic society that's

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.149
all about self enhancement
and boosting ourselves up.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.720
So pride makes sense.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.740
But in cultures where
that's not so important,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.600
collectivistic culture,
more egalitarian societies,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.952
they probably don't have pride.

00:04:25.952 --> 00:04:27.160
And that's not what we found.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.400
In fact, what we found is
that it is a human universal.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.840
We've looked at the
nonverbal display of pride.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.050
And it seems to exist
everywhere we look.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.390
We've done studies in
Burkina Faso, West Africa.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.120
People there in small-scale
traditional societies

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.890
who've never been exposed to
American culture in any way,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.420
they identify pride in the
same way that Americans do.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.295
So things like that are
good evidence that it

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:50.330
is part of human nature.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.990
So that's nutshell one.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.540
Nutshell two is the reason
that it's part of human nature

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.410
is because we evolved
to experience pride

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.020
because it's
adaptive, which means

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.300
it serves an important
function in human lives.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.520
It does something useful for us.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.490
And what that is,
as I was mentioning,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.480
it's what motivates
us to work hard.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.590
Evolution made it so
that we care deeply

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.710
about our sense of self.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.300
We care how we see ourselves
and how others see us.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.220
This is incredibly
important to us.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.570
Pride is what we feel
when we're basically

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.710
doing a good job of building
a sense of self that we like,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.727
that is the kind of
identity we want to be.

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:27.060
And this is really adaptive
because the kind of identity

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.640
that we're seeking typically
is the kind of identity

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.190
that our society
wants us to seek.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.299
So it's a way of making
sure, essentially,

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.840
that we do what we need to do
to make sure that we're staying

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.429
included within our groups, and
eventually, attaining status

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:39.970
in those groups,
that we're basically

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.220
becoming the kind of person
that others look up to.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.950
And that's really adaptive.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.410
And then the third nutshell
is what we were talking about

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.826
before, that pride is
not just one thing,

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.450
that there is this
authentic pride that

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.200
motivates creativity,
achievement, innovation.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.190
But there's this other kind of
pride as well, hubristic pride.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.360
And I think both prides
are part of human nature.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.230
They both actually
help us get status.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.602
People who feel hubristic
pride do get power over others.

00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:05.060
But it's a different
kind of power.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.450
It's not based on achievements
and accomplishments

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.480
and prestige.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.920
It's based more on taking
control, using one's arrogance

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.510
and aggression to get
one's way, and basically,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.990
attaining dominance.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.820
So those are the three nuts,
I would say, of the book.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.500
SPEAKER: OK.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.350
So what was it like
in Burkina Faso?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.210
And how did you get a trip
funded by a university research

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.096
budget?

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.970
It sounds expensive with
all that air travel.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.660
You'd need translators
because these people wouldn't

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.243
speak English.

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:31.400
You have to bring computers
out into the fields.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.920
And also tell us what
it is you discovered

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.820
about pride in that trip.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.825
You alluded to a little bit.

00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:36.050
But I'd like you to
go into more detail.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.840
JESSICA TRACY:
Yeah, no, totally.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.057
It was not all that
expensive it turns out.

00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:42.390
Air flights, I think, was the
most expensive part of it,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.550
getting all the way to Burkina
Faso, which is in West Africa.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.050
But other than that,
as a developing nation,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.230
it's a fairly inexpensive
place to visit.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.550
You can get a really nice hotel,
the nicest they have there,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.760
for quite cheap.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760
So that part wasn't bad.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.440
And we were able to get a small
grant from UC-Davis, where

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.117
I was in grad
school, that funded

00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:05.450
this trip for me and my advisor
and two other people who

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.380
came with us.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.120
And yeah, we actually
didn't bring computers.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.759
It's funny you say that.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:12.800
Yeah, it was interesting.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.075
This was back in 2003,
which was probably

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.480
the last time I traveled for
three weeks with no computer

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.980
at all.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.570
But we thought it would
be too difficult to travel

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.830
in Africa with a computer.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.520
So we had no computers.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.040
We did the study with paper.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.270
Imagine that.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.192
And we brought photos in.

00:07:28.192 --> 00:07:29.650
What we wanted to
figure out was we

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.510
had found in California that
there's this pride expression.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.684
And basically what it looks
like is-- I think you probably

00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:38.850
all know what it looks like.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.117
But it's essentially
expansive chest,

00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:43.450
pulling your shoulders back,
tilting your head up a bit,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.860
smiling slightly.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.150
And we'd found that
people in California

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.364
recognized this as pride.

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:51.030
If you asked them,
what emotion is this,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.620
they would say
yeah, that's pride.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.610
And almost everyone
would agree that's pride.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.651
And that's meaningful
because it tells us there's

00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:59.209
something objective
and behavioral and real

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:01.500
about this emotion, that it's
not just this idea that's

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.360
in our head.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.780
There's something we can see.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.820
But we wanted to go beyond that.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.430
Maybe it's just something that
people in California know.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.436
It's a gesture that college
students are familiar with.

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:12.810
We wanted to know,
is it actually

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.590
universal as a part
of human nature?

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.440
And Burkina Faso is a great way
to do that because Burkina Faso

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.675
is an extremely poor country.

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:21.050
At the time we
did this research,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.610
it was actually the third
poorest nation in the world.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.810
I think that's still
roughly the case.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.180
And so as a result of the
poverty that exists there,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.100
the people who live
there really have

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.799
no way of accessing information
from other cultures.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.039
And that's true even of
the people in urban areas.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.010
But we traveled to a
rural part of the country,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.440
out in the Western countryside.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.960
And we were able, with the
help of a collaborator-- this

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.070
was someone actually
who was a village chief,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.950
or his family had been
the village chief.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.640
And so because of that, he
was a government official.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.880
And he'd spent some time
traveling in California.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.770
And that's how we connected
with him, through people that he

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.020
met when he was in California.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.350
But still, he lived in
Burkina Faso at the time

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.630
and had many ties
to this village

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.540
where his family had been
the chiefdom family basically

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.459
for many years.

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:07.250
And so he was able to
connect us with them.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.742
So we went to the teeny village.

00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:10.450
And the people there--
I mean, really, it

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.744
was an amazing experience.

00:09:11.744 --> 00:09:12.660
We go to this village.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.220
And it's as if we're going back
in time several hundred years.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220
I mean, there's nothing.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.730
We got a ride in a bus.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.270
And that was the
most modern thing

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.350
that I saw anytime
we were there.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.070
Everyone who lived there
lived in these mud huts.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.880
There's no electricity,
no plumbing.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.700
There's just chickens
roaming around everywhere.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.950
It was an amazing thing to
see, like the kind of thing

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.360
you'd see in
"National Geographic."

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.670
I think it's the kind
of thing anthropologists

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.980
see on a regular basis.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.700
But as a psychologist
who does almost all

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.764
of my research in a lab in a
university with undergrads,

00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:43.930
this isn't the kind of thing
I typically experience.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.994
So it was incredible.

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:47.660
And we were able,
with his help, to find

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.742
a group of 40 people who
reported to us that they

00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:52.700
couldn't read or write.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.010
And I should say the national
language of Burkina Faso

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.350
is French.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.320
But very few people in the
country actually speak French.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.799
I forget what the proportion is.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.590
But most people just
haven't gone to school

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.850
so haven't learned French.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.130
So they speak a local dialect.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.189
And all of our participants
were these kind

00:10:08.189 --> 00:10:09.730
of people who'd
never been to school,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.600
had never learned to
read or write in French,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.308
and spoke only their
local dialect, which

00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:15.452
didn't have a written form.

00:10:15.452 --> 00:10:17.660
And so the nice thing about
that is these are people,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.290
they don't have any access
to magazines or movies

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.750
or film from the West.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.250
Right?

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.556
It's hard to think of how they
might have somehow been exposed

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:27.930
to an American pride expression,
or even a European pride

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.330
expression because they're
not seeing any kind of media

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.600
from these other cultures.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.660
And that's really important
because that allows

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.410
us to say, OK, if these people
recognize pride expressions

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.340
in the same way
that Americans do,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.430
it's not going to be
because they've seen

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.640
some American showing pride.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.870
There's almost no tourist
industry there at all.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.290
It's because this is
something all humans know.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.790
Right?

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.919
That's really the only
reasonable explanation.

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.210
And that's exactly what we did.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.126
We showed them photos.

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:55.630
We brought a binder
of laminated photos

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.740
of people posing pride
expressions as well

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.210
as other emotion expressions.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.990
And we asked them
to identify them.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.850
And sure enough, most
people in this sample

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.320
agreed that the pride
expression was, in fact, pride,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.611
which to me is really compelling
evidence that there is

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:11.290
something universal about this.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.620
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.640
So tell us about the Obama
speech about taking down

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.716
bin Laden, and the Trump
speech right before it

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:19.590
about birth certificates
and what they showed

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.280
and how that relates to pride.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.060
JESSICA TRACY:
Yeah, so I used this

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.970
in the book as an example
of this distinction

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.720
between hubristic
and authentic pride

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.620
and the kinds of
leadership that each

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.460
promote because these are two
people who are both leaders.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.251
At the time I wrote
the book, I should say,

00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:35.430
Obama was president.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.770
Trump was not a
presidential nominee at all.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.770
I think when I actually
used that segment,

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.140
he wasn't even considering
running for president.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.130
So I was more referring to
him as a leader in business.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.020
It's interesting
how that's changed.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.786
But yeah, so basically,
Obama made this speech,

00:11:52.786 --> 00:11:54.160
which some of you
might remember,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.832
when Osama bin Laden
was assassinated.

00:11:56.832 --> 00:11:59.410
And it was really important
moment in his career.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.940
It was his first
term of presidency.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.560
He hadn't accomplished all
that much at that point.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.950
So the reviews of him as a
president were not at all in.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.890
This was his big
accomplishment to that date.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.240
And so it was a really important
event for him to basically use

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.650
as a way of boosting his
status, as a way of promoting

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.858
himself and showing, look,
I'm doing important things

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:17.780
as president.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.880
And that's something that
all leaders have to do.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.880
And so the way that he
talked about it, I think,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.245
is really interesting.

00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:24.870
And if you go back
and watch the speech

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.810
or read a transcript
of it, what you'll see

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.420
is he talks about
specific things

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.930
that he did to make this happen.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.150
He uses the word "I" a lot.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.260
So he's referring to himself,
which is really important,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.551
because he needs to get credit.

00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:38.600
He needs to make it clear, I'm
the president who did this.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.229
But he uses things like "did,"
words that express action.

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.020
Here's what we did.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.230
Here are the specific
steps that I took.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.080
And he really walks the
audience through those steps,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.770
how the knowledge came
in, what he did next.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.599
The other thing he
does is he makes

00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:54.390
sure to talk about all
the other people who

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.160
are involved in this.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.951
And there were a lot
of people, obviously--

00:12:56.951 --> 00:12:59.790
the military, his advisors,
the American people.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.720
And he gives credit
to all these people.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.980
These are all
examples of what you

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.270
should do if you
want to convey pride

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.244
that's the authentic variety.

00:13:08.244 --> 00:13:09.910
Taking credit, that's
an important thing

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:12.130
because feeling the
pride is important,

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.590
but talking about
specific behaviors.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.600
So here's why I
deserve to feel good.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.360
I'm not just telling you I'm
the best, I'm the greatest,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.450
like some people do.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.420
I'm actually telling
you, here are the things

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.760
I did to make this happen.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.530
So it's based on
specific behaviors.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.090
And crediting
others, that's really

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.680
important because
authentic pride

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.320
involves a sense of empathy
and care for others.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.390
And it's really largely
about relationships.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.250
When we feel authentic pride,
we feel good about ourselves.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.860
But we also have a sense
that others are good too.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.120
And we're able to acknowledge
others and their role

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.884
in helping us get what we want.

00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:46.050
And that's really important.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.080
It also helps convey a sense
of humility, which often goes

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.360
along with authentic pride.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.651
So I thought that speech was
a great example of someone

00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:55.480
who really, very tactically,
and I'm sure strategically,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.700
use pride in a way to get a
status bump, which he did.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.819
He really rose in
status after that event.

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:03.860
Now, the contrasting
example I give in the book--

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.401
and there are really many that
we could choose at this point.

00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.444
But the example I
give is something

00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:10.110
that happened right
around the same time

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.522
as the Osama bin Laden
assassination, which

00:14:12.522 --> 00:14:14.480
is that Donald Trump
called a press conference.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.840
Now, at this point,
he was just a citizen.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.798
He wasn't a politician.

00:14:16.798 --> 00:14:19.070
But he called a press
conference because he

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.160
wanted to announce something
that he was very proud of.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.590
And he said, I am very
proud of myself for this.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.720
And what it was that Obama
had released a long form birth

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.240
certificate, proving
once and for all--

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.610
we thought at the
time-- that he is,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.180
in fact, an American citizen
and was born in the US.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.940
And the way that Trump talked
about this accomplishment just

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.820
is a really stark contrast
to the way that Obama talked

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.367
about his accomplishment because
Obama actually never used

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:47.200
the word "proud," which
I think is important

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.550
because if you say,
I'm proud of myself,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.750
it's a complicated thing to say.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.489
It can wreak of hubristic pride.

00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:55.280
It doesn't have to.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.547
But I think we are
sensitive to that word.

00:14:57.547 --> 00:14:59.880
Trump comes right out and
says, I'm very proud of myself

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.610
because this great thing I did.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.230
Trump also says, I did something
that no one else could possibly

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.840
do.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.049
So where Obama's crediting
lots of people and saying,

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.423
look, here are all the people
who allowed this to happen,

00:15:10.423 --> 00:15:11.950
Trump is actually
crediting no one

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.750
and explicitly
saying, in fact, not

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.270
only did no one
help me with this,

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.270
no one else possibly could
have done this, which

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.250
is just extreme grandiosity.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.960
So I think it's an example
of these two different kinds

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.704
of pride, which
end up playing out

00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:25.245
in two different
styles of leadership

00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:26.920
that the two individuals have.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.940
SPEAKER: So you
talk about prestige

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.240
and how it goes with
authentic pride, and dominance

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.830
and how it goes with
hubristic pride.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.050
Tell us a little bit
about the difference

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.732
between prestige and dominance
as ways of influencing others.

00:15:38.732 --> 00:15:40.440
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah,
that's a great segue

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.850
because that's
exactly the point I

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.930
was trying to make with the
Obama and Trump distinction.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.905
Yeah, so we found that there are
two different kinds of status,

00:15:48.905 --> 00:15:50.530
two different strategies
toward getting

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.650
status, which result in two
different kinds of status.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.060
The first we call prestige.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.980
And this is a status that's
based on accomplishments,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.300
earned respect, and being nice.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.130
So prestigious leaders are the
leaders who have done a lot.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.350
They've done great things.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.849
Others look up to
them and give them

00:16:05.849 --> 00:16:07.960
power because they
know that doing so

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.740
will benefit the group,
both because these

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.210
are people who will achieve
things for the group

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.390
and because these are
skilled people who

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.950
have something to teach.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.950
So the reason that we
follow prestigious leaders

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.460
is because we want
to learn from them.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.610
They have something of value.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.776
And they're either going
to directly teach it to us,

00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:24.930
or they're going to let
us copy them in some way.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.960
And so the interpersonal
aspect of this

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.570
is really important, that
prestigious leaders are nice.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.320
They're agreeable.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.611
They're willing to help others.

00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:33.380
They want to help others learn.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.670
Dominant leadership,
in contrast,

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.910
is not about being
competent or smart

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.110
or contributing something
of value to the group

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.420
or being respected.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.260
It's about having
power over something.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.080
Typically, dominant leaders
are people who wield control

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.000
over some resource.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.657
And it might be wealth.

00:16:49.657 --> 00:16:51.990
You can think of this in our
non-human primate ancestors

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.722
as strength, just I'm bigger
and stronger than you.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.680
And they know they have
that power over others.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.805
And they wield control over
it in an aggressive and

00:16:58.805 --> 00:16:59.660
manipulative way.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.180
And so what happens is they
force people to follow them.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.680
They force followers to give
them the power they want.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.736
And followers do, but
not because they want to,

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.319
not because they
like this individual.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.290
Typically, they don't
like him or her.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.220
But they feel they
have no choice.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.040
So you can think of
the boss who threatens

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.710
to fire her employees every
time they question her mandates.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.930
This is someone who gets power
not because employees look up

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.359
to her, but because
they literally

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.490
feel, I have no choice
but to give you power

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.829
because otherwise I'm
going to lose my job.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.530
And there are lots of leaders
who use this strategy.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.760
I think Steve Jobs is actually
an interesting example

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.280
of this, based on many reports.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.360
He used to tell his employees
things like, if we fail,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.635
it will be because of you.

00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:41.010
That's a really
threatening thing

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.200
to say to someone
who's depending

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.415
on you for their livelihood.

00:17:43.415 --> 00:17:46.320
And what it did, I'm sure,
was tell all of his employees,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.680
I better do what this
guy says or else.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.220
And that's how dominant works.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.740
People follow them because
they feel that otherwise, there

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.619
will be serious punitive
consequences for them.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.410
SPEAKER: So there's a
thing called a growth

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.210
mindset versus a fixed mindset.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.740
Carol S Dweck talks about
it in her book "Mindset,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.640
the New Psychology of Success."

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.190
In the growth
mindset, you worked

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.516
hard, might be what
you tell your kid.

00:18:09.516 --> 00:18:11.890
The people try to grow and
are focused on getting better.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.050
With a fixed mindset,
you might tell your kid,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.560
you are so smart.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.607
People value themselves
as intrinsically smart.

00:18:18.607 --> 00:18:20.690
It seems very similar, to
me, to your descriptions

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.440
of authentic and
hubristic pride.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.190
What do you think?

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.690
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah, I think
there's a lot of overlap there.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.592
I think that, as you pointed
out, authentic pride,

00:18:28.592 --> 00:18:30.300
it really is linked
to the growth mindset

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.640
because we feel authentic
pride when we think about what

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.600
we can do to become better.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.380
Often, we choose to
do things because we

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.194
think it will make us
feel authentic pride

00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:41.610
and because we're
actually feeling

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.818
that we lack authentic pride.

00:18:42.818 --> 00:18:44.270
So we want to grow.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.960
We actually have a study we did
that I think demonstrates this

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.875
nicely where we looked
at undergrads performance

00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:51.779
on an exam, a real class exam.

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:53.320
And we asked them
to tell us how they

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.861
felt about their performance.

00:18:54.861 --> 00:18:57.110
And we wanted to see whether
the people who felt pride

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.260
in their performance would
go on and perform better

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.450
on the next exam
because we thought,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.600
oh, pride's going
to be motivating.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.660
They're going to do really well.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.356
And then they're going to want
to do well again in the future.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:06.730
That's not exactly
what we found.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.580
The people who did well did
feel a lot of authentic pride.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.935
And they ended up doing
well again on the next exam.

00:19:11.935 --> 00:19:14.560
But their authentic pride wasn't
really what made them do well.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.101
These were the high
achievers, people

00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:17.285
who work hard all the time.

00:19:17.285 --> 00:19:18.660
So authentic pride
isn't all that

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.310
relevant to changing
their behavior.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.220
And they don't need to
change their behavior.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.120
But what was really
interesting is

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.250
that some of the people who
did poorly on that exam, they

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.290
actually told us that they
felt a lack of authentic pride.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.710
They were missing
feeling authentic pride.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.164
And that lack of
authentic pride,

00:19:34.164 --> 00:19:36.080
we found when we asked
them a few weeks later,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.550
that made them want to say,
I'm going to study differently

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.400
for the next exam.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.235
I'm going to put in
more hours next time.

00:19:41.235 --> 00:19:42.860
And when we looked
at their performance

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.650
on the next exam, those
people-- the ones who did badly

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.150
on the first exam
and then said, I'm

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.190
missing authentic
pride-- they were

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.850
the ones who ended up doing
better on that subsequent exam.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.016
And we can trace their
improved performance directly

00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:55.920
to that lack of authentic pride.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.822
So this is nice evidence that
a desire for authentic pride

00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:01.030
is actually what motivates
us to put in the hard work

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.040
that we need to put in
in order to do better,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.285
to perform at a higher level.

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:06.910
And that, I think,
is a growth mindset.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.360
And yeah, I think as you
pointed out, the other kind

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.299
of mindset-- I forget.

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:11.340
SPEAKER: A fixed mindset?

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:11.970
JESSICA TRACY: A fixed mindset.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.820
Yeah, she often talks
about entity theories

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.020
and fixed mindset and
performance goals.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.400
And all these things are linked
to hubristic pride, where

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.100
instead of focusing on
what can I do to achieve,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.360
what next work do I need to do
to become the kind of person

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.110
that I want to be, it's
much more of a focus

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.890
on I'm just great.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.100
How can I stay great?

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.170
And often, then, you
avoid challenging yourself

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.150
because you can
think about this.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.941
If you feel great about
yourself and you're

00:20:34.941 --> 00:20:38.200
worried about I don't
want to risk not feeling

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.400
great about myself,
that's kind of scary,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.230
the last thing you want to do
is try to put in hard work again

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.970
to achieve again.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:44.490
Right?

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.612
You are instead
focused on how can I

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.070
enhance these great feelings
that I have about myself right

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.748
now.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:50.956
And that's counterproductive.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.890
SPEAKER: So what is
cumulative cultural evolution?

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.915
And why is it important?

00:20:57.915 --> 00:20:59.517
How does pride fit in with it?

00:20:59.517 --> 00:21:02.100
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah, so this is
a really complicated question.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.130
And I'll just say, this is
the topic of an entire chapter

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.800
in the book.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.360
So I'll give a brief overview.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.930
But if you're actually curious
about this, read Chapter 6.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.920
That's my advice.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.460
But basically, cumulative
cultural evolution

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.410
is the process whereby all of a
culture's creations-- and that

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.210
includes things like
belief systems, values,

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.010
religious ideologies, art,
science, math, everything

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.200
we create, technology--
all of that

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.130
builds upon itself over
time and progresses.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.480
And the result is everything
that we use pretty much

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.000
in our day-to-day lives now.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.170
And this is true for us and
people in every culture,

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.780
in human societies.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.220
All those things are
things that could never

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.190
have been created by
one individual alone,

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.180
or even one community of
people alone because what

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.010
we have is the benefit
of communities of people,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.960
societies of people,
creating ideas, and then

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.910
the smart ideas, the
ones that are useful,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.190
sticking around, getting passed
on to the next generation,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.480
and then in that generation,
one person, maybe,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.010
innovating, finding a way
to do that even better.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.290
And the best ideas,
the best innovations,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.590
are the ones that then spread
throughout that community

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.447
and get passed on.

00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:12.030
So what you end up
with is a community

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.330
where now, we have things
like Google watches and phones

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.695
that thousands of years ago
could never have existed.

00:22:18.695 --> 00:22:20.320
And if you came along
today and started

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.430
from where we were
thousands of years ago,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.346
you couldn't come up
with something like that.

00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:25.830
But everything's building
upon itself, essentially.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.060
In terms of where pride
comes into this-- basically,

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.010
cumulative cultural evolution,
which explains much of the way

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.390
that humans are and
other animals aren't.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.360
It's really the best
explanation for why

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.090
we're different from
other species, I think.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.810
And it requires several
different psychological

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.960
adaptations, each
of which, I think,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.810
is partly dependent on pride.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.780
So one thing it requires
is a desire to innovate.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.280
Right?

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.300
You have to learn
something well.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.759
But then you have to say, I'm
going to make it even better.

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:55.758
You can think of this in
small-scale traditional

00:22:55.758 --> 00:22:56.370
societies.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.370
The knowledge of how to
build a very basic level

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.400
canoe, that gets passed on.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.660
But then someone
thinks, hey, I want

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.330
to make this canoe even better.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.872
And this is a terrible
example for me

00:23:05.872 --> 00:23:08.205
to give because I don't know
how to make a canoe better.

00:23:08.205 --> 00:23:09.850
But someone did in
that culture, right?

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.099
I'm going to make it out a
fiberglass instead of wood,

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.050
or whatever it is.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.450
And that is really
important because that's

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.690
the advance that then
gets the cultural concept

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.170
to the next step.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.740
But in order to desire
to make that advance,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.990
you need to have a motivation.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.690
You need to feel
like, I'm going to do

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.051
things that make a difference.

00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:26.550
Right?

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.410
I'm going to do
something that isn't just

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.350
accepting what I
have, what we have,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.080
but actually taking
it to the next level.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.705
And that's something that humans
do that really no other animal

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:36.460
does, that when things
are good enough--

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.126
when we're surviving,
when we're getting

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.580
by, that old canoe works
perfectly well-- we don't just

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.020
say, hey, I'm fine.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.300
I'm surviving and reproducing.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.341
That's really all I need.

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:45.607
We want more.

00:23:45.607 --> 00:23:47.940
And that's because we want
to feel good about ourselves.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.650
And that's pride.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.240
So that's step one.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.580
Step two is teaching
others what you

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.760
know because cumulative
cultural evolution depends

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.950
on social learning.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.930
We have to spread the
knowledge that we know.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.680
And that means
being prestigious.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.180
Like I said,
prestigious leaders are

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.270
the ones who are willing to
teach others what they know.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.450
They're also the ones who
tend to know the best stuff.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.075
So these are exactly
the people that we

00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:12.630
would want to be spreading our
highest knowledge, basically,

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.072
throughout a society.

00:24:14.072 --> 00:24:16.280
And that prestige is attained
through authentic pride

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.113
because that's what
makes people prestigious

00:24:18.113 --> 00:24:20.880
and makes them want to share
what they know with others.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.800
And the last piece
of it is learning.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.190
In order to really master
a skill, to master or learn

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.060
a piece of knowledge,
you have to figure out

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.200
who to learn from.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.120
You can't just copy
or learn from people

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.730
indiscriminately
because if so, you'll

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.510
get some bad information as
well as good information.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.080
And so what you need
to do is figure out who

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.170
the prestigious leaders are.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.230
And it turns out pride is
really relevant to this

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.660
because people who
feel prestigious

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.820
and who are prestigious
show the pride expression.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.630
We've actually found that when
people are seeking knowledge,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.370
when they need to
learn something,

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.820
they will choose to do that
from someone who shows pride

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.560
more than from someone who shows
any other emotion expression.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.620
If given the choice, they'll
copy the knowledge displayed

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.550
by someone who's expressing
pride, suggesting that pride,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.680
basically, is a signal
of someone's prestige

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.260
and expertise.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.510
SPEAKER: So what does this
pride expression look like?

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.030
Could you show us?

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.780
You've described it.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.890
But I'd like to actually see it.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:18.170
JESSICA TRACY: I know.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:18.490
I know.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.448
This is why I was saying
I should bring slides.

00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:22.520
But we decided not to.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.782
Yeah, I mean, I can
do a little version.

00:25:26.782 --> 00:25:27.990
You tilt back your shoulders.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.330
You push your chest out.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.240
You can stand in a
posture like this,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.702
tilt your head up a little bit.

00:25:33.702 --> 00:25:35.660
Sometimes, you raise your
arms above your head.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.690
That's the excited,
woo-hoo pride.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.810
But that's not necessary.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.130
We do find typically
that arms are

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.004
expanded from the body
in one way or another,

00:25:43.004 --> 00:25:44.080
extended from the body.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.800
There is this general
expansiveness.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.925
That's the key part.

00:25:46.925 --> 00:25:48.300
But the most
important components

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.830
are expansive chest, posture,
and head tilt upward.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.190
Those are the key aspects of it.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.330
SPEAKER: So what does
religion tell us about pride?

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.163
And what does Aristotle
tell us about pride?

00:25:59.163 --> 00:26:01.170
And do you agree with
their approaches?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.940
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah,
so various religions

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.090
have talked about pride for
millennia at this point.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.125
And typically, the view
is that pride is bad.

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:10.500
This is the sinful
view of pride.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.260
And lots of different-- mostly
Judeo-Christian, but even

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.270
Buddhism talks about
pride as something

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.000
that prevents us from
reaching nirvana.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.019
So lots of religions have
really problemetized pride.

00:26:20.019 --> 00:26:22.060
I think that's because
what they're talking about

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.190
is hubristic pride.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.273
They're talking about the
kind of pride that makes

00:26:25.273 --> 00:26:26.710
us arrogant and egotistical.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.840
And in religions, the
goal is to teach people

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.320
that someone or something--
God or the religious leader--

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.380
is greater than them.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.880
So if you're feeling
hubristic pride

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.970
and you think you're
the greatest around,

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.344
that's going to
be a real problem

00:26:39.344 --> 00:26:41.710
for religious ideologies.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.307
Interestingly, there are hints
of a more nuanced view of pride

00:26:45.307 --> 00:26:46.640
if you look far back in history.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.750
And Aristotle is actually
a good example of that.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.590
He's one of the
few early thinkers

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.240
who said, well, wait a minute.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.890
Pride doesn't have to be bad.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.770
And he said, actually, you know
what's bad is if you're great

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.026
and you pretend you're
not, that's not good.

00:26:59.026 --> 00:26:59.900
That's sort of lying.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.000
That's deception.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.130
In fact, a great
man is someone who

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:04.940
knows he's great
and acknowledges it

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.140
and is able to say yeah,
I have these skills.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.900
And to me, that's
authentic pride,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.830
that this realistic appraisal
of your own greatness

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.740
and a willingness to
acknowledge it, that can be OK.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.530
And so that, I
think, is picking up

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.532
on this distinction between
authentic and hubristic pride.

00:27:20.532 --> 00:27:21.990
SPEAKER: So here
at Google, we have

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.406
something called
Googliness, which

00:27:23.406 --> 00:27:26.500
is basically being the kind of
people you want for a coworker.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.540
It's really important
for our company culture.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.250
But how does pride fit in with
being humble, not boasting,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.440
and helping your
coworkers to be better?

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.110
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah, no, I
think this is a big issue.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.609
Right?

00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:38.000
And I think often the solution
that people come up with

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.960
is, I'm not going to show pride.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.030
I'm not going to feel any pride.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.730
If I do something great, I'm
not going to talk about it.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.870
And I think it's very, very
tricky because authentic pride

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.790
is a good thing.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.420
I think it's the reason that all
of us want to do great things.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.919
Right?

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:54.770
If you want to develop something
new or create something new,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.870
it's because you want to
feel good about yourself

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.929
at some level.

00:27:57.929 --> 00:27:59.720
Once you get into it,
once you get working,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.180
you might just
get in the mindset

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.800
where you're in the zone
and you're doing your thing

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.425
and you're not thinking
about yourself.

00:28:04.425 --> 00:28:06.940
But what I would argue is
the reason you originally

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.540
decided to take this job, to
become the kind of person who

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.620
has the opportunity
to get in that zone,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.770
is because of a
desire to feel pride.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.390
At the same time, you
don't want to be a jerk.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.750
You don't want to be that
arrogant person that everyone

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.660
is avoiding at lunch.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.100
And that's hubristic pride.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.634
So it really is this
balance between going

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:26.550
for authentic pride,
acknowledging it, wanting

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.980
to feel that, and avoiding
hubris, avoiding bragging,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.070
trying not to talk
about your successes

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.040
to people who haven't
had so many successes.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.415
You don't want to
be that person.

00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:37.279
I mean, that's
one obvious thing.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.570
But it really depends on the
social norms of the group.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.840
And they vary dramatically
from group to group.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.730
You guys probably know
far better than me

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.162
what the norms are
here at Google.

00:28:46.162 --> 00:28:48.120
But they really do vary
from culture to culture

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.340
because clearly, there's
a culture in which Donald

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.060
Trump is doing
amazingly well, where

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.179
it's perfectly acceptable
and even valued

00:28:54.179 --> 00:28:56.470
to go around telling everyone
that you're the greatest,

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.200
you're the smartest, you're
the best in all these ways.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.490
I think most of
us in the culture

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.040
that I live in,
certainly in Canada, feel

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.260
like that's not really OK.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.960
Even if you think
it's true, that's

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.300
not something you should say.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.883
And there are cultures that are
even more extreme in that way.

00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:12.760
If you go to Kalahari
Bushmen, which

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.270
is a really
egalitarianism society,

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.440
it's not OK to talk
about any success, ever.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.460
And anthropologists tell stories
about people in that culture

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.340
where if they have
a success-- say,

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.010
they have a big kill in the
hunt-- when they come back,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.280
the last thing they
do is bring it up.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.770
He talked about this one hunter
who had a success and went

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.369
and sat by himself and waited
until someone approached him.

00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:36.660
And then finally, when someone
approached him and said,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.710
how did you do today?

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.750
He said, oh, you know,
nothing much happened.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.210
It wasn't really a big day.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.960
And that's what actually
tells his friend,

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.250
oh, something good happened.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:45.750
Right?

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.790
Because he's following
this intricate set of norms

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.510
about how we talk
about our success,

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.330
while retaining this egalitarian
structure of the society.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.590
And in fact, what people
told the anthropologist who

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.116
reported this is, we have to
require people to do this.

00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.240
If we let them talk about
their success in any way,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.506
if we let them show pride,
they would get too big.

00:30:03.506 --> 00:30:04.880
And that would be
a real problem.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.190
And what he told the
anthropologist is,

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.890
eventually, their
pride would kill them.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.580
So this is a way of
protecting everyone.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.140
So it really is about different
norms in different cultures,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.804
about when it's OK and how it's
OK to talk about our pride.

00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:19.220
SPEAKER: So how
do programmers who

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.749
are trained to be humble
authentically get prestige?

00:30:21.749 --> 00:30:24.290
We're trying to care about doing
the right thing more so that

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.709
about raising our own status.

00:30:25.709 --> 00:30:27.500
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah,
and I think that's OK.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.060
And in fact, I think
that's a great thing.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.280
I think thinking about
doing the right thing,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.040
whether that's building a
new product that's great,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.100
or caring about your
coworkers, those

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.910
are things that you
can take pride in.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.690
And what I would say
is, it's actually

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.150
good to think
about those things.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.250
What kind of Googler, what
kind of worker do I want to be?

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.750
What kind of person
do I want to be?

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.666
And then think about
what you need to do that.

00:30:52.666 --> 00:30:54.810
Don't think about, how
do I get high status,

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.910
because what we found is that
the ultimate evolutionary

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.050
function of pride is
to get you status.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.680
But that's not the
proximal function.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.314
And so we make this
distinction between

00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:04.730
the psychological
motivations that

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.910
are happening in our head,
the proximal functions,

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:07.900
and ultimate functions.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.580
Ultimate functions are why we,
as a species, do these things.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.240
And they're the
ultimate benefits.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.150
But the idea is, if we do these
things for proximal reasons

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.987
like I want to feel
good about myself,

00:31:16.987 --> 00:31:18.820
that's enough of a
proximal reason to do it.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.420
That gets you to
do the behaviors.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.040
The ultimate outcome is you're
going to get high status.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.070
But you don't have
to worry about that.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.490
Evolution has made
it so that that

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.880
will be the outcome of you
just doing the stuff that you

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.050
want to do because you want
to feel good about yourself.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.720
SPEAKER: So a long time
ago, I read a comic strip

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.010
called Bloom County."

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.620
And as I remember-- I'm not
sure my memory is completely

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.440
valid on this-- they
started criticizing a number

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.190
of different political figures.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.920
And there was one political
figure that they criticized who

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.410
then bought King Features
Syndicate that "Bloom County"

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.700
was a part of, and
cancelled the strip.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.932
Are you afraid that same
political figure, a person who

00:31:53.932 --> 00:31:56.140
is now a political figure,
might do that to your book

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.670
because your book
talks about him.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.450
JESSICA TRACY: I'm not
particularly scared of Trump.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.390
But I think many
people are, I will say.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.600
I think that he uses tactics
of fear and intimidation

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.850
really effectively, which
is what dominant leaders do.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.080
That's how they get power.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.530
What I noticed watching
the primary season

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.240
was that that is a
large part of how

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.100
he won the primary election
is he essentially intimidated

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.570
anyone on the Republican side
who wanted to raise questions

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.160
against him.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.940
He did this in various ways.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.602
He used Twitter campaigns
to hurt people's reputations

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:28.560
if they were going to
say bad things about him.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.910
He insulted his opponents
in the various debates.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.254
And so all this had the effect
of making people afraid of him,

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.670
largely, I would
say, because they

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.836
were afraid of what he was
doing to their reputation

00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:40.990
among Republican voters.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.974
So if you care
about his followers

00:32:42.974 --> 00:32:44.390
and what they think
of you, you're

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.223
not going to mess with
him because he really

00:32:46.223 --> 00:32:46.940
has that power.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.887
And so that's a
very strategic move.

00:32:49.887 --> 00:32:51.970
For people who don't care
what his followers think

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.580
of them, which I think is
where Hillary Clinton stands,

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.996
you don't have to
be afraid of him

00:32:55.996 --> 00:32:58.390
because what power
does he have, really,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:03.095
over people other than the
people who really care for him?

00:33:03.095 --> 00:33:04.220
SPEAKER: All right, thanks.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.428
We're going to open it up
for audience questions now.

00:33:06.428 --> 00:33:07.830
So the mic is right over here.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.590
Feel free to come on up
and ask your questions.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.980
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between self-confidence

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.670
and pride?

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.190
And is there anything that
you talked about pride today

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.726
that doesn't really
apply to self-confidence?

00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:21.350
JESSICA TRACY: That's
a great question.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.170
So I would say that
they're very similar.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.100
Authentic pride, I
would say, is very much

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.417
a sense of self-confidence.

00:33:28.417 --> 00:33:30.000
Typically, we think
of self-confidence

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.720
more as a disposition, so a
trait that some people have

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.470
and some people don't,
or some people have

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.070
a lot and some
people have less of.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.570
And authentic
pride, we can think

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.650
of more as a momentary
state for the most

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.670
part, although we
can be dispositional

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.827
authentically proud.

00:33:42.827 --> 00:33:44.660
If your dispositionally
authentically proud,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.110
I would say that's much the
same as having a strong sense

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.922
of self-confidence.

00:33:47.922 --> 00:33:49.670
But what I think is
important is the way

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.734
that we use these terms.

00:33:50.734 --> 00:33:52.650
Sometimes, when we talk
about self-confidence,

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.550
we don't distinguish
between what

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.690
I would call the
authentic pride and more

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.450
narcissistic confidence.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.510
So some people who
are self-confident

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.630
are also narcissistic.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.213
Or maybe that's
largely what they are.

00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:05.797
They're confident, but in a way
that's grandiose and arrogant.

00:34:05.797 --> 00:34:08.213
And I think that's a really
important distinction to make.

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:10.100
So I like using the
term "self-confident,"

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.880
but I want to be clear about
saying, well, self-confidence,

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.639
to me, is confidence in your
hard work and achievements

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.679
and productivity.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:18.590
It's authentic pride.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.692
It's not this grandiose
sense of self.

00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:22.607
Sure.

00:34:22.607 --> 00:34:24.440
AUDIENCE: You talked
about Eastern cultures,

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.960
which was one of the reasons
I actually showed up here.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.889
I had an email that
landed-- I don't know.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:29.764
This is happenstance.

00:34:29.764 --> 00:34:32.169
It just landed in my
inbox today that says--

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:33.460
and I'll just read this to you.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.690
And this is from about 2300 BC.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.159
This is from the
Vedas, which goes,

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.270
"Education yields humility.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.020
Humility yields character.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.429
Character yields wealth.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.139
Wealth supports
a righteous life.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.380
And righteousness
yields happiness."

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.429
And so a central part of
most Eastern cultures,

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.420
at least the culture
that I come from,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.360
is the sublimation of ego.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.330
And actually, doing great
work is meditation in itself.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.790
So when I sat and listened
to most of your lecture,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.640
it really didn't
apply to me because I

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.819
am on a path trying to
actually sublimate my ego

00:35:05.819 --> 00:35:07.610
and get rid of any of
the pride, whether it

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.380
be the good or the bad pride.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.030
And so do you think I have no
chance in a Western culture

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.230
to survive?

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.740
JESSICA TRACY: No.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.560
I think this is a
really important issue.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.650
And my thinking is
that view, which

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.964
I'm familiar with the
Eastern view, as you say,

00:35:22.964 --> 00:35:24.880
sublimate the ego-- as
I said, Buddhism really

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.252
is a big Eastern philosophy
and religious view,

00:35:27.252 --> 00:35:28.710
depending on how
you see it, that's

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.550
all about avoiding pride.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.040
I think they're
missing something.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.980
And far be it for
me-- this is thousands

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.010
of years of knowledge.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.260
But I think that really,
what they want people to do

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.340
is feel a sense of pride.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.450
Maybe they don't
want to call it pride

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.230
because you think of pride and
you think of hubristic side.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.600
And clearly, that's problematic.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.340
And that's not going to do all
the things that you just said.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.084
But authentic pride
is just the desire

00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:53.250
to feel good about yourself.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.541
And so my view is, you're
becoming this kind of person.

00:35:55.541 --> 00:35:57.650
You're focusing on
sublimating your ego

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.420
and working hard and
focusing on humility

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.550
and doing all the things
you said, being righteous.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.950
The reason you're doing
that is because you want

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.130
to feel good about yourself.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.820
You have this sense of
self, this identity,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.819
that you're building up.

00:36:08.819 --> 00:36:11.610
And for you, one part of
it that's really important

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:14.810
is sublimating the ego, not
being arrogant, being humble.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.430
But what I would
say is the desire

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.680
to do that, the desire
to build an identity that

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.380
meets certain requirements that
you've decided, that's pride.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.905
Pride is what makes you want
to feel good about yourself.

00:36:25.905 --> 00:36:26.780
It's not a bad thing.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.571
It's not bad pride.

00:36:27.571 --> 00:36:28.610
It's not arrogance.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.860
It is just authentic pride.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.080
And as humans, we evolved
to have the sense of self

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.170
that we care deeply about.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.080
And there's an enormous
adaptive advantages

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.630
that we get from that,
from having a sense of self

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.090
and caring about our reputation
and how we see ourselves

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.530
and how others see us.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.920
And so pride is the emotion
that tells us when we're

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.871
en route to achieving that.

00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:50.120
And I think it's a good thing.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.540
I think wanting to feel
pride in our sense of self

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.850
is OK, as long as we
understand that we're not

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.850
talking about arrogance.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.060
We're not talking about egotism.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.893
We're not talking about
putting others down,

00:36:59.893 --> 00:37:01.940
and that a big part of
what we can feel pride in

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.148
is all the things that you
say-- being humble, caring

00:37:04.148 --> 00:37:06.830
about others, putting others'
welfare before our own.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.500
Being the kind of
person who does that

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.570
is very much something to feel
a sense of authentic pride in.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.070
Hi.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.345
AUDIENCE: I'm coming to the
same thing like he said.

00:37:16.345 --> 00:37:20.610
In our culture, I've seen
taking pride and saying that you

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.344
made this person proud.

00:37:22.344 --> 00:37:23.510
You made your parents proud.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.980
You made your country proud.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.610
And getting the pride from that
happiness, rather than saying,

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:29.875
I mean, I did good for myself.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.220
I'm happy because my
parents are proud.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.090
JESSICA TRACY: Yeah,
no, absolutely.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.440
So I think that's a great
point that we can feel pride

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.399
in our individual self.

00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:44.356
And I think in individualistic
cultures, that's

00:37:44.356 --> 00:37:45.700
a lot of what we feel pride in.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.200
But in more
collectivistic cultures,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.825
we are very focused on
our larger sense of self.

00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:50.700
And we all have this.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.510
Even in individualistic
cultures, ourself,

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.610
for every one of us,
it's not just me.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.110
Right?

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.235
There's the self that you
have if you have a child.

00:37:58.235 --> 00:37:59.910
There's the self in
that relationship,

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.720
or in your partner,
or in your family,

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.010
or your larger community.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.024
You all probably feel proud as
someone who works for Google.

00:38:06.024 --> 00:38:07.440
And you feel proud
of the company.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.630
When the company
does a good thing,

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.630
even if you weren't
directly responsible for it,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.070
you're going to feel a sense
of collective pride in that.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.440
And I think that's great.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.010
I think that's a
really useful thing.

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.626
It makes us care about
those who are close to us.

00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:20.250
It makes us care
about our communities.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.390
It makes us work hard
for our larger groups.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.250
And yeah, I do think it's a
way of dealing with this issue.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.380
And I think in collectivist
cultures, one of the goals

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.200
is to tamp down the individual
and make people focus more

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.530
on the collective self rather
than the individual self.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.030
And that's how the
society functions

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.350
is that my sense
of self that's me

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.630
as a member of
this group, that's

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.520
the most important sense
of self that I have,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.978
if I'm in a
collectivistic culture,

00:38:44.978 --> 00:38:47.340
whereas in individualistic
cultures, my sense of self

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.600
is much more me
as an individual.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.300
Yes, I'm part of the group, but
that's a less central focus.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.050
This is a broad
generalization, of course.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.740
There's massive
individual differences

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.370
within both kinds of cultures.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.245
But I think that's what
you're talking about.

00:38:59.245 --> 00:39:02.450
And so yeah, if you're in a
collectivistic society, then

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.216
absolutely, feeling a sense
of pride in the collective

00:39:05.216 --> 00:39:06.840
can serve the same
functions as feeling

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.260
an individual sense of pride.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.254
Yeah.

00:39:10.254 --> 00:39:11.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.600
So you went to Burkina Faso
to do a lot of research

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.340
and gather a lot of
evidence and came up

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.740
with the how pride is
universal and even has

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.060
an evolutionary aspect to it.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.120
What would be the
next step in terms

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.012
of things you want to research?

00:39:30.012 --> 00:39:30.970
JESSICA TRACY: Wow, OK.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:36.720
Well, so the Burkina
Faso stuff, that was fun.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.340
And I think it did actually
lead to a lot of other research

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.240
directions, some of
which are in the book.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.360
So for example, in
Burkina Faso, we

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.440
found that people
recognized pride.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.420
But we wanted to know
do people show pride

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.650
the same way in all cultures.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.017
So we did a study
of the Olympics,

00:39:52.017 --> 00:39:53.600
in which we looked
at Olympic athletes

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.016
from countries all
over the world.

00:39:55.016 --> 00:39:57.420
And this is a great opportunity
to look at pride displays

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.400
because the Olympics is an
occasion where people feel

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.030
a ton of pride if they do well.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.030
And you have people from
all different countries

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.220
because it's the Olympics.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.545
And we found that the
same pride display

00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:08.870
is shown by people from
countries all over the world.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.790
We found no cultural differences
in displays of pride.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.680
So even people from
collectivistic or Eastern

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.240
cultures were just as likely
to show pride as people

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.836
from Western cultures.

00:40:17.836 --> 00:40:19.460
There was no gender
differences either.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.150
And then we did a study where
we thought, OK, well, all

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.600
these people, this is great.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.790
But these are all
professional athletes.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.360
Unlike our Burkina
Faso participants,

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.990
they have plenty of
exposure to other cultures.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.740
Maybe they're showing
pride because that's

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.449
our human nature.

00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:33.281
But maybe they're showing
it because they've

00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:35.890
learned when you win an
Olympic medal and you're on TV,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.490
this is what you're
supposed to do.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.990
So we were able to
do another study

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.230
of a sample of
individuals who actually

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.210
couldn't have learned to show
pride from watching others.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.740
And that's because they were
blind athletes, participating

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.220
in the Paralympics Games.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.270
And so we looked at
these blind athletes,

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.660
including a subsample of
congenitally blind people,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.954
so people who in their lives had
never seen anyone show pride.

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:59.120
And when we did that, we
found the exact same thing,

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.203
that even these congenitally
blind athletes who've

00:41:01.203 --> 00:41:02.870
never seen anyone
display pride, when

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.032
they win a match-- and
this was all judo athletes.

00:41:05.032 --> 00:41:07.240
When they win a judo match,
they do that same thing--

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.620
expansive posture,
head tilt up, arms

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.189
extended out from the body.

00:41:11.189 --> 00:41:12.980
So that was kind of
nice evidence, I think.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.860
And so when I say
pride is universal,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.360
it's partly because of
the Burkina Faso evidence.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.901
But it's also things
like this, where

00:41:17.901 --> 00:41:20.100
we're seeing these displays
in such a universal way.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.450
SPEAKER: OK, if there
are no more questions,

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.376
let's proceed to our
book signing next.

00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:25.000
But first, please
give a warm thank you

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.626
to our author, Jessica Tracy.

00:41:26.626 --> 00:41:30.670
[APPLAUSE]
