Why Does Mint Tastes Cold?

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:12.260
Similar to why peppers taste hot, what’s
going on here is there is a chemical in mint,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.600
menthol, which is tricking the brain into
thinking that the area the menthol is applied

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.090
to is cold; even though in fact, it’s the
same as it was before.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.290
More specifically, menthol binds with cold-sensitive
receptors in your skin; these receptors contain

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.430
things called “ion channels”, in this
case TRPM8.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.680
The menthol makes these much more sensitive
than normal, so they trigger and you feel

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.350
a cold sensation, even though everything is
more or less the same temperature as before.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.999
This extra sensitivity is why when you eat
peppermint, which has a relatively high level

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.160
of menthol, and then you breathe in deeply
through your mouth, your mouth feels extra

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.160
cold.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.159
Your cold receptors are reacting much more
strongly than they normally would to the air

00:00:52.159 --> 00:01:07.900
which is cooler than the inside of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.860
your mouth.
