00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.560
So you want to be an astronaut?

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.850
Well I hope you have good health insurance!

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.160
Hi there spacewalking hopefuls!

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.719
I’m Ian for DNews: Now….Space is a horrible,
horrible place.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.120
As soon as humans exit the lovely, snug atmosphere
of Earth, the cosmos is out to kill us.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.070
I’m not kidding; there’s radiation from
the sun, cosmic rays from distant supernovas

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.020
and even chunks of space debris traveling
faster than a speeding bullet!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.020
These killers are a very real threat to astronauts
in space, but they’re only the tip of the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.020
iceberg.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.839
After spending a record-breaking one year
in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly reported

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:40.589
some rather uncomfortable issues with his
prolonged exposure to the microgravity environment

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.469
onboard the International Space Station.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.210
Interestingly, when he landed on Earth in
March, Kelly was one and a half inches taller

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.399
than when he was when he launched into orbit.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.089
The lack of Earth’s gravity caused his spine
to expand, which quickly got squashed again

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.129
after landing.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.960
And this underscores an astronaut’s biggest
problem in space: Gravity.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.269
Or the lack of it.

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.399
Kelly complained of muscle pain; his eyesight
was temporarily altered and his skin became

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.430
ultra-sensitive after he landed.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.960
Immediately after reaching Earth, his blood
pressure dropped -- his heart wasn’t used

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.470
to pumping in a gravitational environment,
so dizziness and temporary loss of balance

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.490
were obvious concerns.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.250
There’s always a period of adjustment to
Earth gravity after being in space, but Kelly’s

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.460
mission was longer than most and some of his
health issues persisted.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.620
Kelly’s one-year stint on the space station
wasn’t designed to torture the veteran astronaut,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.620
however.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.200
It was an experiment to see how the human
body changes in space.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.850
And Kelly was a special case; he had a twin
brother, Mark, on Earth to act as his terrestrial

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.850
control.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.670
During his orbital stay, Kelly participated
in a range of tests and had to engage in vigorous

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.050
exercise for 2 hours a day that all astronauts
and cosmonauts have to endure to stave off

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.540
the effects of muscle atrophy.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.980
Bone wastage, that is common in osteoporosis
patients on Earth, is also an issue for astronauts.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.210
To combat it, many take the drug bisphosphonate
to counter the effects of bone loss.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.960
They also take supplements like calcium and
vitamin D, but the most effective counter

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.980
to bone and muscle loss is lots and lots of
exercise.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.690
The future of space exploration will likely
spawn a whole new sector in the pharmaceutical

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.690
market.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.700
If astronauts have problems sleeping (which
is a common complaint while strapped to your

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.810
bed while speeding above Earth at over 17
THOUSAND miles per hour), they can drop a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.810
sleeping pill.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.810
Feeling tired?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.749
Drop a Modafinil which, according to a 2009
Canadian Medical Association Journal report,

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.939
“is available to crew to optimize performance
while fatigued.”

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.700
Say if a crewmate starts acting erratic and
becomes a danger to the rest of the crew?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.019
Well, that’s why there are tranquilizers
on board…. and duct tape.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.189
I’m not kidding.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.080
So, medically-speaking, we’re still trying
to figure this space thing out.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.290
Our bodies are used to a gravitational environment
with a 24-hour circadian cycle, not a microgravity

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.189
environment with a 90-minute orbital cycle,
so there’s bound to be some problems.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.730
But all these problems have surfaced while
we live only a couple of hundred miles above

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.190
Earth -- how the heck are we going to deal
with the health issues facing us when we finally

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.750
send astronauts to Mars?

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.579
During that long trip to Mars, our intrepid
explorers will be bathed in radiation from

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.459
high-energy particles from the sun and deep
space in the form of cosmic rays.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.440
When going to Mars, we’ll need spaceships
equipped with some novel radiation shielding,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.450
but even then they’ll likely encounter a
variety of unaccounted-for space radiation-related

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.450
cancers.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.810
So, would I still want to be an astronaut?

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.150
Actually, yes.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.019
Humanity is really good at pushing the envelope
and discovering new things about our universe.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.829
The next big step is to see humanity on Mars
and though it’s going to be a challenge,

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.779
I think we’ll persevere, develop some really
strong space drugs and eventually become a

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.090
true space-faring civilization.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.779
To maintain muscle mass and strength, astronauts
have some pretty cool machines to work out

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:45.180
with, check out Lizette’s space fitness

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.299
out more!

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.510
Knowing that a mission to Mars could kill
you, would you still want to go?
