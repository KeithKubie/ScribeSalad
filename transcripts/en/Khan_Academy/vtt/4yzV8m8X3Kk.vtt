00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:01.329
- [Voiceover] So where we left off,

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.770
I had this two-dimensional vector field V,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.703
and I have it pictured here as
kind of a yellow vector field

00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:08.423
and I just stuck it in three dimensions

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:10.495
in kind of an awkward way
where I put it on the XY plane

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:12.727
and said pretend this
is in three dimensions.

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:14.550
And then when you describe the rotation,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.356
around each point what we
were familiar with is 2D curl,

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:20.772
that's where you get this
vector field, it's not quite

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:22.676
a 3D vector field because
you're only assigning

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:25.308
points on the XY plane to
three dimensional vectors,

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:27.404
rather than every point
in space to a vector,

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:28.757
but we're getting there.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.061
So here let's actually
extend this to a fully

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.380
three dimensional vector field,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.882
and first of all let me just kind of

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:37.308
clear up the board from the computations

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.308
we did in the last part.

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:42.270
And as I do that kind
of start thinking about

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.527
how you might want to
extend the vector field

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.518
that I have here that's
pretty much two dimensional

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.303
into three dimensions.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:52.880
And one idea you might, we'll
kind of get rid of the circles

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.693
and the plane, is to
take this vector field

00:00:56.693 --> 00:01:00.028
and then just kind of copy
it to different slices.

00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:03.071
So, you might get something
kind of like this.

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:05.290
And then, I've drawn each
slice a little bit sparser

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.431
than the original one, so
technically that original

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.685
one if you look on the XY plane

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.541
I've pictured many more vectors,

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:12.381
but it's really the same vector field,

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.519
and all I've done here is
said at every slice in space,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:18.007
just copy that same vector field.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.317
So if you look from above,
you can maybe see how really

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:22.654
it's just the same vector
field kind of copied a bunch,

00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:25.661
and if you look at it each
slice, you know in the same way

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:28.379
that in the XY plane,
you've got this vector field

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.762
sitting on the slice,
every other part of space

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.298
will have that.

00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:35.459
And even though there's only
what, like six or seven slices

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:37.379
displayed here, in principal
you're thinking that

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:39.885
every one of those infinitely
many slices of space

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:42.288
has a copy of this vector field.

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:44.731
And in a formula, what does that mean?

00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.691
Well what it means is
what it means is that

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.790
we're taking not just X
and Y as input points,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.235
But we're gonna start taking Z in as well.

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:55.891
So if I go, I'm gonna say that
Z is an input point as well.

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.011
And I want to be considering these

00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:58.460
as vectors in three dimensions,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.677
so rather than just saying
that that it's got X and Y

00:02:00.677 --> 00:02:05.008
components, I'm gonna pretend
like it has a Z component

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.823
that just happens to
be zero for this case.

00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:12.032
And the fact that you
have a Z in the input,

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.104
but the output doesn't depend on the Z,

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:16.743
corresponds to the fact that
all the slices are the same,

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:18.263
as you change the Z direction

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.504
the vectors won't change at all,

00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:21.487
they're just carbon copies of each other.

00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:24.047
And the fact this output
has a Z component,

00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:26.393
but it just happens to be
zero is what corresponds

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:28.222
to the fact that it's very flat looking,

00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:30.569
you know, none of them point
up or down in the Z direction,

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.167
they're all purely X and Y.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.621
So, as three dimensional vector fields go,

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.559
this one is only barely a
three dimensional vector field,

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.701
it's kind of phoning it in
as far as three dimensional

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:40.808
vector fields are concerned,

00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:42.809
but it'll be quite good
for our example here,

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.148
because now if we start
thinking of this as representing

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:49.527
a three dimensional fluid
flow, so now rather than

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.561
just kind of the fluid
flow like the one I have

00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.185
pictured over here, where
you've got water molecules

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:56.224
moving in two dimensions
and it's very easy to

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:59.184
understand clockwise rotation,
counter clockwise rotation,

00:02:59.184 --> 00:03:01.880
things like that, whereas
over here it's a very

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.409
kind of chaotic three
dimensional fluid flow,

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.523
but because it's so flat
if you view it from above

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:08.993
it's still loosely the same just kind of

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:10.799
counter clockwise over here on the right,

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.766
and clockwise like there above,

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:13.775
so if I were to draw like a column,

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:15.941
you could think of this column as being,

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:18.232
having a tornado of fluid flow, right,

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.319
where it's, everything is
kind of rotating together

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.855
in that same direction.

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:24.760
So if you were to assign a
vector to each point in space

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.992
to describe the kind of rotation happening

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.122
around each one of those points in space,

00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:31.104
you would expect that
those inside this column,

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:34.552
inside this sort of counter
clockwise rotating tornado,

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:36.276
and I say counter
clockwise, but if we viewed

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:37.746
it from below it would look clockwise,

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.581
so that's the tricky part
about three dimensions

00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:41.329
and why we need to
describe it with vectors,

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.616
but you expect these using
your right hand rule,

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:45.504
where you curl the
fingers of your right hand

00:03:45.504 --> 00:03:47.536
around the direction of rotation here,

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:50.708
you would expect vectors that
point up in the Z direction,

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:53.024
the positive Z direction,
and if I do that,

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:56.540
if I show what all of the
rotation vectors look like,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.888
you'll get this, and maybe
this is kind of a mess

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:01.560
because there's a lot of things
on the screen at this point.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.144
So for the moment I'll kind of

00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:05.566
remove that original
vector field and remove

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:07.688
the XY plane, and just
kind of focus on this

00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:09.875
new vector field that
I have pictured here.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:13.500
Inside that column where we
have that tornado rotation

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.224
I was describing, all of the vectors

00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:17.464
point in the positive Z direction,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.314
but if we were to view it elsewhere,

00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:20.504
like over in this region,

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:22.560
those are pointing in
the negative Z direction,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.581
and if you stick your
thumb in the direction

00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.719
of all of these vectors in
the negative Z direction,

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:30.570
that tells you the direction
of, that tells you how

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.526
the fluid, maybe you're
thinking of it as air

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:33.930
kind of rushing about the room,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.166
how that fluid rotates
it in three dimensions.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.993
So what curl is gonna
do, here I'll kind of

00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:41.581
clear things up, I have
the formula from last time,

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:43.069
that hopefully hasn't looked too

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.621
in the way while I've been doing this,

00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.525
that described curl for a
two dimensional vector field

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:50.165
if we imagine that's
not just taking X and Y

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.005
as its inputs because it's a
three dimensional vector field,

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:56.577
but if we imagine it taking X, Y and Z,

00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:59.442
so it's a proper three
dimensional vector field,

00:04:59.442 --> 00:05:02.107
the output is gonna tell
you at every point in space

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:06.807
what the rotation that
corresponds to that point is.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.176
And in the next video I'm
gonna give you the formula

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:11.472
and tell you how you
actually compute this curl

00:05:11.472 --> 00:05:13.143
given an arbitrary function,

00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:15.231
but for right now we're just
getting the visual intuition,

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.847
we're just trying to understand

00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:19.482
what it is that curl
is going to represent.

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:21.307
And in this vector field,
this one that was just kind of

00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:24.095
copies of a 2D put above,
it's almost contrived

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:27.026
because all of the rotation
happens in these perfect

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.558
tornado-like patters that
doesn't really change

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:32.413
as you move up and down
in the XY direction,

00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:34.469
but more generally you might
have a more complicated

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.026
looking vector field, so I'll go ahead and

00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:39.338
finally erase this since it's
been a little bit in the way

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.171
for a while, and erase this guy too,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.690
and if you think about just arbitrary

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.034
three dimensional vector
fields, like let's say

00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:49.906
this one that I have here,
so I don't know about you,

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:53.226
but for me it's really hard
to think about the fluid flow

00:05:53.226 --> 00:05:55.741
associated with this, I have
a vague notion in my mind

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.322
that okay, like fluid is
flowing out from this corner

00:05:58.322 --> 00:05:59.769
and kind of flowing in here,

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:01.857
but it's very hard to
think about it all at once,

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:04.017
and certainly if you start
talking about rotation,

00:06:04.017 --> 00:06:05.617
it's hard to look at
a given point and say,

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:07.721
oh yeah there's gonna be
a general fluid rotation

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:10.601
in some certain way and I can
give you the vector for that.

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:14.337
But as a more loose and
vague idea, I can say,

00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:16.941
okay, given that there's
some kind of crazy

00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.567
air current fluid flow
happening around here,

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:21.761
I can maybe understand
that at a specific point,

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:23.545
you're gonna have some kind of rotation,

00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:25.582
and here I'll picture it
as if there's like a ball

00:06:25.582 --> 00:06:28.135
or a globe sitting there
in space, and maybe you're

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:30.517
imagining your new vector field and saying

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.482
what kind of rotation is it kind of induce

00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:34.669
in that ball that's just
floating there in space?

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.178
Maybe you're imagining this
as like a tennis ball that

00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:39.785
you're sort of holding in
place in space using magnets

00:06:39.785 --> 00:06:42.593
or magic or something like that,
and you're letting the wind

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:44.694
sort of freely rotate
it, and you're wondering

00:06:44.694 --> 00:06:46.953
what direction it tends to rotate,

00:06:46.953 --> 00:06:49.082
and then when it does and
when you have this rotation,

00:06:49.082 --> 00:06:52.533
you can describe that 3D rotation
with some kind of vector,

00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:55.041
and in this case it would
be a vector that points out

00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.345
in that direction because we're
kind of curling our fingers,

00:06:57.345 --> 00:07:00.105
curling our right hand fingers
over in that direction,

00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:03.281
and if you don't understand
how we describe 3D rotation

00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:06.033
with a vector, I have a
video on that, maybe go back

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:08.436
and check out that video,
but the idea here is that

00:07:08.436 --> 00:07:10.760
when you have some sort
of crazy fluid flow

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.752
that's induced by some
sort of vector field,

00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:14.923
and you do this at every point and say,

00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:16.584
hey what's the rotation
at every single point,

00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:19.094
that's gonna give you the
curl, that is what the curl

00:07:19.094 --> 00:07:23.120
of a three dimensional vector
field is trying to represent.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.890
And if this feels confusing,
if this feels like something

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.746
that's hard to wrap your
mind around, don't worry

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:31.422
we've been there, 3D curl is
one of the most complicated

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:34.315
things in multivariable calculus
that we have to describe.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:37.238
But I think the key to
understanding it is to just kind of

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:40.479
patiently think through and
take the time to think about

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.402
what 2D curl is instead of
thinking about how you extend

00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:45.678
that to three dimensions
and slowly say, okay, okay,

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:47.807
I kind of get it, tornados of rotation,

00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:49.590
that sort of makes sense,
and if you understand

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.614
how to represent three
dimensional rotation around

00:07:51.614 --> 00:07:54.949
a single point with a
vector, then understanding

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:57.055
three dimensional curl
comes down to thinking about

00:07:57.055 --> 00:07:58.943
doing that at every single point in space

00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:00.750
according to whatever rotation

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.654
the wind flow around
that point would induce.

00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:05.918
Like I said, it is complicated,
and it's okay if it

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.314
doesn't sink the first
time, it certainly took me

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:12.698
awhile to really wrap my head
around this 3D curl idea,

00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:15.865
and with that I'll see you next video.
