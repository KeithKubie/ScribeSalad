-The Radcliffe Institute
is Harvard's institute

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.560
for advanced study.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.210
Our mission is to
foster cutting-edge work

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.920
across the disciplines--
the arts, the humanities,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.750
the sciences, and
the social sciences.

[APPLAUSE AND MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.680
-I'm an associate professor in
chemical engineering at MIT.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.320
My research is focused on
engineering of microbes

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.110
for chemical production.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.380
A really nice benefit
of being here at Harvard

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.110
is having the time
and the proximity

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.390
to really have interactions
with other people

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.200
doing research here
on Harvard's campus.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.510
Radcliffe was really an
interesting environment

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.010
for me as well, in
terms of thinking

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.510
about how the work
that we do in my lab

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.730
has an impact on the
rest of the world.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.870
I actually was involved in
two federal government reports

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.090
during my time at Radcliffe.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.520
And the Radcliffe
fellowship year

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.920
really gave me the opportunity
to dedicate real time to those.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.760
I think, when I look
back at the year

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.550
that I've spent at
Radcliffe, I will

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.160
remember being very productive.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.450
I had more papers that were
submitted for publication

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.000
than I've ever had at
any point in my career.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500
-Kristala Prather.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.350
-And I'll remember the
people and the exposure

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.190
to all these other different
areas of work, many of which

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.120
have such a profound
impact on my life

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.590
just as a citizen of
the world, as well

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.890
as a citizen of this country.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.966
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.440
-I am a junior in
Leverett House,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.530
and I'm studying
comparative literature,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.180
with a secondary in government.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.830
Being part of the Radcliffe
Research Partnership, I think,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.610
has made me connected to
a larger academic world

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.900
beyond the world of
college and classes.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.550
This year, I'm working
with Professor Ziblatt,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.950
who's a government
professor at Harvard.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.650
-I'm writing a book this year on
the rise of democracy in Europe

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.240
historically.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.741
-So like who the people are.

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.490
-I've spent the last
several years working

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.700
on Germany and Britain
over a 100-year period,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.990
but I needed help with
the last part of the book.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.580
I'm trying to extend the lessons
of this particular historical

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.052
experience into other countries.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.120
-And so the idea that
even though there

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.760
were these new parties there,
the informal power structure of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.141
[INAUDIBLE] was maintained.

00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:40.640
-I speak French and
I speak Spanish,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.090
so I was able to read text
that he wasn't able to read.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.940
So I would share with
him what I'd learned,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.250
and he would see how that
connected to the research

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.620
that he'd done in the
meantime, and how it connected

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.229
more generally to his argument.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.020
-So in a way, that was
a kind of a reversal

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.660
of the traditional role
of professor and student.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.360
And she was actually
teaching me.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.403
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.830
-I think the reason
for the DNA symposium

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160
was just the
incredible development

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.040
in the last several years, the
last decade, of DNA science,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.150
of synthetic biology, of
really exploding information

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.100
about our ancestry
and our origins that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.957
are revealed by DNA analysis.

00:03:23.957 --> 00:03:25.790
And we thought, wow,
what an exciting moment

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.620
to bring it all together.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.604
-This technology
is new, very new.

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:31.270
And so in addition
to the science, today

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.430
we'll be discussing the ethical
aspects of this new world.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.940
-We had anthropologists.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.340
We had evolutionary biologists.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.190
We had chemists.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.200
We had criminal justice.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.390
We had an ethicist.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.730
-They brought together
different areas of research

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.250
that I am interested
in, but might not have

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.870
talked to in the same room.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.150
-Today's been incredible.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.240
It's a great opportunity
to hear about research

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.291
from around the world in a
completely interdisciplinary

00:03:59.291 --> 00:03:59.790
way.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.840
So you get totally outside of
your specific little bubble

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.530
that you study.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.210
-But I also think bringing it
to the public is absolutely key.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.120
This stuff has enormous
ethical implications.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.730
It has enormous implications
for human health.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.550
It has big implications
for how we see ourselves.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.620
And that can only be addressed
in an interdisciplinary setting

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.747
like Radcliffe.

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:27.226
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.890
-We have the world's
leading collection

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.870
of materials around
women's rights movements,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.310
from the first stirrings of
such movements in the 1830s

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.900
and 1840s, through what we
call second wave feminism,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.120
and on into today.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.050
Bill Baird was a
really important player

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.860
in the reproductive rights
pieces of those movements.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.230
The Bill Baird collection
is the largest collection

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.780
a library has ever acquired.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.230
700 plus boxes came out
of Mr. Baird's basement.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.560
One of the things that was
carted out of his basement

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.630
was a carton of
badly burned books.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.630
The first act of domestic
terrorism against an abortion

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.750
provider was leveled
against Baird.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.520
His offices were firebombed.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.140
It's going to be
important, in 100 years,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.720
literally to demonstrate
the heat of this argument.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.860
I think one of the truly
remarkable things about Baird

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.820
is that he treated his
opponents in the Right to Life

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.100
movement with enough seriousness
to collect their materials.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.590
Having the pro-life materials,
the anti-choice materials

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.740
in the Baird collection, I think
is really of inestimable value.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:54.780
-At Radcliffe, we're
fortunate enough

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.610
to have built a new gallery,
the Johnson Kulukundis Family

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.660
Gallery.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.450
And for the
inaugural exhibition,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.880
we were really looking for a
work that would showcase what

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.670
the gallery was capable of.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.630

collective in Japan

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.410
that counts over 400 members.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.880
And it consists of engineers,
computer scientists, artists,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.140
architects, designers,
people involved

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.310
in all kinds of
different specialties.

with other forms of study,
engages our senses afresh,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.580

assemble and to present
