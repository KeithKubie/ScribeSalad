00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:13.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's the
dream of every educator.

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:18.976
Here at C. P. Squires Elementary,
children are so eager to learn,

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:22.666
they burst through the
schoolyard gates every morning.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hey, boys and girls,
today, while you're eating,

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:29.906
we're going to read this story, "The
Berenstain Bears Christmas Tree."

00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:32.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Before the
school day even begins,

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.186
they are treated to bagels and books.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:37.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What do you think
the Berenstain Bears are going

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:39.876
to do with a Christmas tree?

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:41.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since 90 percent

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:44.836
of Squires incoming students
don't speak a word of English,

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.826
literacy is the school's
primary focus.

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:50.786
&gt;&gt;Carol: The only hope our
Hispanic youngsters have, I believe,

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:53.766
is to master English, and then
they will truly be bilingual.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.656
I say to the parents, it's your
responsibility to teach them Spanish

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.806
in your home, and please do
that, and it's our responsibility

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:04.246
to teach them English, and then
they will have all their world open

00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:04.886
to them.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.326
And so I really believe that poverty

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.486
and second language are
absolutely not any excuse

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:12.986
for not teaching children to read.

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:15.026
&gt;&gt;Teacher: A, B, Cs,
and counting, one--

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:18.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers here use a
variety of techniques to teach

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:20.566
and reinforce English
language skills,

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.706
from memorizing months
with the Macarena..

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.266
&gt;&gt;All: May, June, July,
August, September--

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To learning
letters with a talking mat.

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:31.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: C. What sound does C make?

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.206
&gt;&gt;Carol: What I guaranteed
each teacher was

00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:35.286
that if they would just
slow down their speech,

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:37.466
and tech everything
three different ways,

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.916
that these little five
year olds are like sponges,

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:40.896
and they will pick it up.

00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:43.346
And the brain research
supports that dramatically.

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:46.386
The first year it was very
scary, because we weren't sure.

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:47.956
Now we're positive.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:50.956
We know that it works, and
when they go into first grade,

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:53.976
we have 98 percent mastery
of all letters and sounds.

00:01:54.516 --> 00:02:00.546
[Singing]

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology plays a key
role in advancing reading skills.

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:06.906
&gt;&gt;Tracey: I have 30-some
students, and it's hard to sit

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.846
down with one child every day.

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:11.876
They go on the computer
every day for 15 minutes,

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:14.646
and it's just individualized
for them.

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:16.336
&gt;&gt;Computer: Find the balloon, T.

00:02:16.546 --> 00:02:19.456
&gt;&gt;Tracey: They learn to write their
names, they learn the A, B, Cs,

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.226
and then they focus on
each letter individually.

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:25.766
And then they advance when they know
that letter, they test themselves.

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:30.346
&gt;&gt;Student: The truck had to squeeze
to stop to avoid running over Sammy.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students also
get individual attention

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.366
from older students, who act
as their reading buddies.

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:39.406
And from volunteer mentors
like Thomas Washington.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:40.216
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Tell me that sound.

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:41.026
What is that sound?

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:42.196
&gt;&gt;Student: C-- C--

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:43.546
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Very good.

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.816
&gt;&gt;I was in the third grade, before I
really learned how to decode and how

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.906
to read, and read successfully.

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:51.936
So I feel that I have to share
it, because I had a strong person

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.756
that helped me when I was in school.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:56.056
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Well, what is 14 times 5?

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:59.616
Now you can use the pen if you want,
but I want you to use your head.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:00.966
This is called mental math.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:04.676
&gt;&gt;The more smart kids we have,
the better our future will be.

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:07.496
The more kids that are able to
take care of themselves and provide

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.546
for themselves, the
better we're going to be.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:10.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Twenty-five.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:11.006
&gt;&gt;Thomas: Right.

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:13.106
&gt;&gt;Tracey: Oh, you've got a big book.

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:15.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school has
received several grants,

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:19.186
and partnered with local business
to start innovative programs

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:21.106
like this monthly book giveaway.

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:22.076
&gt;&gt;Tracey: What did you pick?

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:23.326
Baby Animals.

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:26.616
&gt;&gt;A lot of these children don't
have many books in the homes.

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:29.136
&gt;&gt;There you go, that's
yours to keep forever.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.686
&gt;&gt;They have several children at
home, parents don't have much money

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:37.006
to go buy books, so this lets them
have books that are theirs to keep

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.566
at home, to read with little
brothers and sisters, and uncles

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:40.546
and aunts, and mom and dad.

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:42.346
&gt;&gt;Doctor: Here, put
this under your tongue.

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:44.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A new medical clinic

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:48.846
at C. P. Squires also serves three
other schools in the neighborhood.

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:50.756
&gt;&gt;Carol: Now we have a
health center on our campus.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:54.116
We can take care of dental,
vision, any kind of problem,

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:56.236
any kind of cold, flu, whatever.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.436
&gt;&gt;Doctor: Do you wear your seatbelt?

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:00.136
&gt;&gt;Parent: I would, but
we don't have a car.

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:00.696
&gt;&gt;Doctor: Oh.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:01.176
Okay.

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:01.856
&gt;&gt;Carol: I like to think of it

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:04.486
as a one stop community
center, and it should be.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:07.536
The hub of society, I
think should be the school.

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lark is addressing
the needs of all family members

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:13.766
in the community with an array
of after school programs centered

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:14.456
around preschool literacy.

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:15.016
&gt;&gt;All: Green, blue, orange, red.

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:19.866
&gt;&gt;Carol: As soon as the
kindergarteners go home

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:23.516
in the afternoon, I have three
groups of four year olds that come

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:26.696
into those classrooms, and we start
doing basically the same program

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:29.956
that we do during the day, with
the guidance of a licensed teacher.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:31.836
&gt;&gt;All: A star!

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:38.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Number one,
John is a student.

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.496
&gt;&gt;All: John is a student.

00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:41.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: He isn't a teacher.

00:04:42.026 --> 00:04:44.476
&gt;&gt;Carol: We knew we had to meet
the needs of the entire family,

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.746
so by working with the middle school
across the street, the parents go

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.086
across the street and get
English lessons, which is going

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:53.216
to enhance their future
in terms of job potential

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.016
and all the older siblings,
they have many choices.

00:04:56.056 --> 00:05:00.746
Like, right now, we have intramural
soccer going on, we have ballet--

00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:06.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Seven, and-- one,
two, three, four, five, six--

00:05:06.896 --> 00:05:08.326
&gt;&gt;Carol: And we have line dancing.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.706
&gt;&gt;Leah: The biggest thing,
building self esteem.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.786
They didn't think they'd
be able to perform.

00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:18.616
First of all, they couldn't
even do the first dance.

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:19.696
They said, we can't do this.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:24.126
Now they know three dances, we're
working on, The Cowboy Hip Hop.

00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:28.766
I told the girls they can't dance
in sneakers, because you don't look

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.776
like a cowgirl if you're
dancing in sneakers.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:35.686
So a lot of them have not had
the means to get cowboy boots,

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:39.716
so I have six pairs, and I lend
them out and they wear big socks,

00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:43.136
and a couple of them I bought myself,

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:48.746
and hopefully Santa Claus
will bring them boots.

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:49.726
&gt;&gt;Carol: These teachers
are caring teachers.

00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:51.336
I hire for heart first.

00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:53.316
I can train, I can teach anything.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.846
But you have to hire for people
who thrive on that feeling.

00:05:57.036 --> 00:06:00.576
It feels so good when
children succeed.

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:01.766
You saw their faces.

00:06:02.256 --> 00:06:04.946
They're happy and they're
growing and they're learning.

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:07.206
I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:09.856
