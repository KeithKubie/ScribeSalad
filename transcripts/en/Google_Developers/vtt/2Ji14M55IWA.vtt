PETER HODGSON: I'm Pete Hodgson.

00:00:02.262 --> 00:00:03.720
I'm an interaction
designer working

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.460
on the Google Assistant.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.110
Over the next few
minutes, I'm going

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.190
to give you a brief overview
of one of the key topics core

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.790
to conversation design.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.550
That's conversational repair.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.460
People historically don't
much like voice interfaces

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.960
because of the
feeling it gives them

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.390
when the conversation
takes a misstep.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.360
Research shows that
60% of all users

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.650
feel either angry or confused,
or awkward and self-conscious,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.560
in general, because they feel
like they did something wrong.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.170
After all, our
instinct is to assume

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.836
that the other party
in the conversation

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:36.960
is being cooperative.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.020
So it must be us that's
doing something wrong.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.840
The good news is that
69% of the same group

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.660
are likely to give the voice
interface another go even when

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.830
something has just gone wrong.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.650
So if we can make a
conversation work well

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.390
when it takes a
misstep, then there's

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.420
a great opportunity to build
user trust and confidence

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.340
in the assistant.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.040
It's tempting to describe
these misstep situations

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.740
as error cases, which
suggests that the user has

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.180
done something wrong.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.370
But it's important to
remember that the users know

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.280
what they want.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760
There's no such thing as a
voice query without an intent.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.960
For example, the user
might be being ambiguous.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.640
Perhaps their
intent is unspoken,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.130
and they've implied an intent,
which we haven't covered

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.320
in the recognition grammars.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.350
Maybe they're just poking
around and trying things out.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.480
Remember, discovery
is an intent.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.340
Poking around is an intent.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.830
And figuring out the boundaries
of a piece of technology

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.840
is also an intent.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.060
But mostly, people
are being co-operative

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.670
and want to do something,
even if they didn't say so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.840
explicitly.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.940
And it's our job
to figure out what

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.480
they're trying to do, and to
move the conversation forward.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.450
Just because their query
doesn't match our expectations,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.190
doesn't mean it's an error.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.480
For example, let's talk
about a no input state.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.700
When the assistant
prompts for a reply

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.520
it opens the microphone
for a short period of time,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.410
listening for a response.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.270
If there's no spoken
input detected

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.220
within a number of
seconds, the assistant

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.780
closes the microphone again
and will re-prompt the user.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.729
It's easy to label
this situation

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.300
as a single type of error based
on a technical description.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.640
But there are many reasons
why the user might not

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120
reply to a prompt before
the microphone is closed.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.970
They might have been distracted
or changed their minds.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.600
Or perhaps the options presented
don't match their expectations.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.000
Or they simply
hesitated too long.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.036
In each of these
cases, the assistant

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:30.660
might say something
slightly different,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.740
depending on the context.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040
So it's important to
consider the possible context

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.130
of every repair case, since
they can change the language

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.220
and structure of re-prompts.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.440
Conversational repair
is a big topic.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.637
And we can't cover everything
in this short video.

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:47.220
So in the next few
minutes I just want

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.400
to focus on three main
types of repair cases.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.440
First, there's no match inputs.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.540
This is when the assistant
has heard something

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.130
that doesn't match
the recognition

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.290
grammars for a specific state.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.960
Then there's no
inputs, as I just

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.050
described, when the assistant
has prompted for a response,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.640
but heard nothing
back from the user.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.270
And then there's
disambiguation, where the system

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.460
has a confident
but partial match

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.210
and needs more specific
information to progress.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.030
So here's an example
conversation with these three

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.770
repair cases shown.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.580
[INAUDIBLE] just
sending a message.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.462
Let's run through it.

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:24.420
SPEAKER 1: Hey, Google.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.052
Send a message.

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:26.010
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.207
Who do you want to message?

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:29.040
SPEAKER 1: Hey, Hon.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.320
Can you turn down
the TV, please?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.800
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Who
do you want to message?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.280
SPEAKER 1: David.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.870
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Which David?

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.080
Is it David Singh,
David J, or David Brown?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.362
SPEAKER 1: David Brown.

00:03:44.362 --> 00:03:45.820
PETER HODGSON: The
first misstep is

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.740
when the Assistant
has the mic open,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.652
and the grammars are listening
for a specific contact name.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:51.610
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.807
Who do you want to message?

00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:54.640
SPEAKER 1: Hey, Hon.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.930
Can you turn down
the TV, please?

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.850
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Who
do you want to message?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.740
PETER HODGSON: This
is a no match case.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.780
Since it's the first
time in this conversation

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.220
that the assistant hasn't
understood the user,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.240
we will try the lightest touch
repair in much the same way

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.030
as we would a natural human
to human conversation.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.270
It's the equivalent of
saying, huh, say that again.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.820
We call this a rapid re-prompt.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.300
The second case is when the
assistant hits a disambiguation

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.070
state.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.860
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Who
do you want to message?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.490
SPEAKER 1: David.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.780
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Which David?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.446
PETER HODGSON: It has
a confident match,

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:32.780
but it's ambiguous.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.210
The input matches more
than one contact name,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.180
so prompts for more
specific information.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.090
As this is the first
repair in a disambiguation,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.100
we might also treat
it quite lightly.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.580
After all, the user knows their
contacts and who they meant.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.920
The assistant just needs
a bit more information.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.880
And the third repair
is a no input time out.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.490
After the last prompt, the
user hasn't said anything.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.890
Or the assistant hasn't
picked up the user's speech.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.560
They may have left the room
or missed the question.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.530
But the system is still
in a disambiguation state.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.170
So the strategy here is
to help the user make

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.540
a choice by escalating
the detail in the prompt.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.110
In this case, it's by
presenting the specific Davids

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.420
from [INAUDIBLE] contacts list.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.630
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Is it David
Singh, David J, or David Brown?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.966
SPEAKER 1: David Brown.

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:21.840
PETER HODGSON: So here
are those cases again.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.890
In a multi-step
conversation, every time

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.710
the assistant prompts
for a response,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.580
the conversation designer
needs to consider all

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.440
of these possible repair cases.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.280
The goal is to always move
the conversation forward

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.840
as naturally as possible.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.360
But we can't keep
reprompting forever.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.270
So we've got to consider the
maximum number of attempts that

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.280
are reasonable in
each conversation,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.110
and provide ways out
of the conversation

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.390
when we reach that limit.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.640
And remember, if we
have to keep on asking,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.310
then the chances are
we've got something wrong.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.860
The user is most probably
trying to be cooperative.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.830
It's up to us to help them out.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.070
So depending on each case,
the conversation designer

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.801
and engineers need to decide
the maximum number of tries

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.800
the assistant will prompt
the user before ending

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.940
the conversation.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.170
And at that point, how it
will end the conversation.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.220
SPEAKER 1: OK, Google.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.722
Book a ticket to the ISS.

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:18.680
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.850
Which carrier are
you orbiting with?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.630
SPEAKER 1: Honey, what
carrier were we looking at?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.580
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Which carrier?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.289
SPEAKER 1: Honey?

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.788
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
To make a booking,

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:30.290
I'll need to know which
carrier you're orbiting with.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.990
For example, NASA or SpaceX.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.380
Or you can say cancel.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.595
SPEAKER 1: What?

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.970
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Since I'm
having trouble understanding,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.926
go ahead and tap a carrier
name on the screen.

00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:42.800
PETER HODGSON: So in
this case, the Assistant

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.440
has tried three times to
get the name of the carrier

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.030
without getting a
recognizable answer.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.850
That means the system
had to manage three

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.390
no match cases, one
after the other.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.550
What you've heard is
one example of how

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.620
you might construct a repair
strategy for this case.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.900
And we can break
it down like this.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.610
No match one is treated
as a rapid re-prompt.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.050
In no match two, we're
escalating the detail

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.480
in the prompt to clarify
the type of things we're

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.310
expecting the user to say.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.542
We've also provided the
user with an escape option,

00:07:14.542 --> 00:07:16.000
in case they've
changed their minds

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.330
or just want to stop
the conversation.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
By no match three, we could
just end the conversation.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.220
Or alternatively, we
can give the users

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.350
the option to make
an explicit input

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.630
by using the touch screen.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.630
But remember, for all
conversational repair

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.170
prevention is better than cure.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.330
An iterative design process
and formative user research

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.550
around the user's
expected language

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.890
will inform your design
of the most likely things

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.500
that users will
say at any point.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.750
And, as a result, a
highly relevant set

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.000
of grammars for each
step of the conversation

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.730
can significantly improve
the user experience

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.520
and reduce the number
of repair cases.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.800
I've just touched on a
couple of examples here.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.320
And I want to reiterate,
it's important to recognize

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.800
that every conversation will
warrant its own strategy.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.380
If you want to find out more
about conversational repair,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.050
I highly recommend you visit
Google's new conversation

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.820
design guidelines.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.160
And check out the other
videos on conversation design

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.355
in this series.

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.230
Thanks for listening.
