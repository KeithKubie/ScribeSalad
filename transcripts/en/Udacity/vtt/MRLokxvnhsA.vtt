00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:04.227
So the most important thing to remember when we say a problem is NP complete

00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:08.045
is the NP-completeness equation which says that

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:15.078
NP-Complete means that a problem is in NP and

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:17.794
its NP-Hard.

00:00:17.794 --> 00:00:19.127
Alright, so based on that

00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:23.695
knowing that graph partition is NP-Complete means that Yes, graph partition is NP-hard.

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:27.362
And based on what we said about NP-hardness, a polynomial time solution

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.511
to graph partition would solve everything in NP.

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:37.861
We also know specifically that any problem like clique that we know is in NP can be reduced to it.

00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.695
so a solution to graph partitioning would solve clique specifically.

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:45.546
&gt;From this part of the NP-completeness equation

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.811
we know that graph partitioning is in NP.

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:51.510
And from what we know about NP means that an exponential time solution exists to graph partitioning

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.060
And that it can be reduced to SAT. If somebody could solve SAT for us that would also let us solve graph partitioning.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:06.547
So we actually know all of these things by virtue that graph partitioning is NP-complete.
