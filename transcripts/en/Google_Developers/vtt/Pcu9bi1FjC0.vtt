00:00:00.726 --> 00:00:04.070
The more ads you show, the
more money you can earn.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.810
With AdMob Mediation, you
can maximize the number

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.900
of ads shown in your app,
pulling from multiple networks

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.640
to increase your fill rate.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.430
Simply put, AdMob Mediation lets
you better manage your ad sales

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.600
and earn more money
from your inventory.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.450
The best part-- it's completely
free to all of our developers.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.660
Mediation lets you
serve ads to your apps

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.010
from multiple sources,
including the AdMob

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.050
network, third-party ad
networks, programmatic buyers,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.640
demand-side platforms,
house ad campaigns, and even

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.420
direct-sold buyers.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.730
We maximize your fill rate
and increase your monetization

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.410
by sending ad requests
to multiple networks

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.030
to ensure you find the best
available network to serve ads.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.570
And because Google operates
the largest ad exchange

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.360
in the world, all of those
buyers and advertisers

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.460
are plugged in
directly to AdMob,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.260
giving you access to an
unprecedented level of demand.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.319
Mediation is
essentially a waterfall.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.860
You configure which
networks you want

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.700
called in a particular order,
and the Mediation stack

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.040
will request ads from
those network sources

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.340
in that particular order.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.300
The order of the waterfall can
be set by each ad network CPM.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.020
The CPM of the
network is typically

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.390
based on the network's
historical performance

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300
and is set manually.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.740
That's why it's extremely
important to check your network

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.450
CPMs on a consistent
basis to ensure you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.370
are maximizing your revenue.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.050
To put it bluntly, if you aren't
updating your CPMs regularly,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.970
you may be leaving
money on the table.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.370
Because we know you need to
focus on building a great app

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.080
experience first and updating
CPMs can be extremely time

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.570
consuming, we created a feature
called Ad Network Optimization.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.660
Ad Network Optimization
automatically

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.470
updates network CPMs
within your Mediation stack

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.305
and optimizes the order of those
networks based on the eCPM they

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:51.590
are giving you.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.520
In other words, we
take the hard work

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.610
out of updating
your network CPMs,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.520
ensuring you are serving the
highest paying ad for any given

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.860
impression every single time.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.920
To ensure that AdMob is properly
competing within your Mediation

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.840
stack, we also created
the Optimized AdMob

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.360
Network feature.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.040
In AdMob Mediation, you
could enable Google's demand

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.370
to bid alongside all
of your other networks

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.670
on a per-impression basis.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.194
That means for every
ad request, if AdMob

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:20.610
is able to serve
an ad at a higher

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.320
CPM than the other
networks, it will.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.170
When used together, Optimize
AdMob Network and Ad Network

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.570
Optimization are extremely
powerful in providing you

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.610
with the most revenue possible.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.460
By ensuring that your
Mediation stack is dynamic,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.710
we reduce the amount of
work you need in order

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.000
to keep your CPMs up to date,
while also driving the most

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.637
revenue for you.

00:02:43.637 --> 00:02:45.220
Here's a quick summary
of the benefits

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.080
of using AdMob Mediation,
Ad Network Optimization,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.450
and Optimize AdMob Network.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.360
First, all of it's free.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.950
There's absolutely no cost you
to use any of these features.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.170
We will always serve
the highest paying ad,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.350
even if it isn't from Google.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.210
You'll have access to
Google's massive pool

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.980
of buyers, demand-side
platforms, programmatic buyers,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.750
and much more.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.100
You'll be able to manage
multiple networks, even

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.540
networks that we don't
officially support.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140
And finally, most
importantly, you'll

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.420
save time by allowing
you to focus on building

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.010
a great app for your users.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.060
Thank you for watching.
