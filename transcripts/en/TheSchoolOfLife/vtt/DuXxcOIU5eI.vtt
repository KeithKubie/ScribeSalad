00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.170
Life is full of moments where we are meant
to feel certain things. The demand starts

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.680
in early childhood: it’s our birthday – and
we are meant to feel happy. Dad is going away

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.090
for two weeks – and we should feel sad.
Our school has won at team sports – and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.640
we should want to join in with a celebratory
song. Adulthood continues the injunctions:

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.910
we should feel devastated at funerals, touched
and hopeful at weddings, enthused and moved

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.600
by our families, carefree on holiday – and,
in bed with someone we like, exclusively focused

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.649
on the act and its pleasures. But, in truth,
our thoughts are seldom exactly in sync with

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.789
outward events. They have tendencies to be
vagabond, unfaithful and unruly. We rarely

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.520
feel exactly what we’re meant to when we’re
meant to. Our emotions follow the script of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.310
life with the lag and distortions of a badly
subtitled foreign film. Yet there are a host

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.249
of good reasons for this: – There’s a
lot more ambivalence in our hearts than we

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:17.429
are ever allowed to own up to in public. We
may love certain people deeply but at the

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.929
same time harbour profound and understandable
resentments and rage against them. No wonder

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:31.259
we don’t always cry as deeply as we ‘should’
at funerals. – To get through life, we need

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.450
to grow a tough hide; we have to learn not
to feel and not to register certain things

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.340
that pass through consciousness. Those among
us who’ve suffered the most, especially

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.560
at an early age, have had to grow masters
of the art of occasional non-feeling. No wonder

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.630
then that, when the time comes for vulnerability
and openness, we might not so easily be able

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:03.039
to access our more tender emotions. – Happiness
can be extremely worrying to register. We

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.039
are creatures who defend ourselves through
anxiety and cannot always readily give up

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.640
our vigilance, simply because we have a few
days off work and there’s a line of palm

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.940
trees ahead. – We may have grown suspicious
of large groups and fear their capacity for

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.120
intolerance and cruelty. It may therefore
be tricky for us to join in in any uncomplicated

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.780
way with communal cheering and celebration.
We may have some well-founded background resentments

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.420
against collective demands. – Finally, our
emotions tend to move far more slowly than

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.150
do events in the outer world. The so-called
right feelings may well show up, but rather

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.909
later than one might expect. We do eventually
feel grateful at the way the holiday went,

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.209
but three months after we’ve returned. We
do register that we are in love, or devastated

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.939
or in mourning or scared, but not as soon
as the world outside us might like. The inner

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:11.810
clock has its own rhythms and seasons that
won’t easily obey the outer calendar. Ultimately,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.709
we often aren’t ‘in the moment’, because
we have the wrong map of what should be thought

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:25.150
normal at any given moment. It’s our expectations,
rather that our emotions, that are at fault.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.359
To help ourselves, we should create a culture
which better accommodates the weirder truths

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.220
of the way we work: that does not have such
a strong script about what should be felt

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.420
– and where we are more ready to accept
the greater complexities of our minds. A lover

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.719
who isn’t always there in the act might
return if they aren’t pressured to do so

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.251
too actively; someone who isn’t happy on
holiday might grow a little more so if we

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:55.890
don’t demand that they smile all the time;
someone who isn’t delighted at a wedding

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.560
anniversary could eventually celebrate if
they were first allowed to be (understandably)

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.670
a bit sad as well. We should have greater
respect for the way we’re built. Not being

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.959
able to be in the moment isn’t a sign that
we are strange or defective, but that we have

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.880
started to be rightly faithful 
to ourselves.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.040
Our wisdom display cards explore what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to become more enlightened in our everyday lives.
