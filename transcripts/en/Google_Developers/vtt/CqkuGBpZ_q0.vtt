00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.430
EMILY FORTUNA: We're excited
to have Daniel Galpin here

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.070
to tell us about Android news
from the Developer Keynote.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.930
Hey, Daniel.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, Dan.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.995
So responsibility to our
users was the first core part

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:15.370
of the Android
developer keynote.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.542
Now, how does this
relate to developers?

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.000
DANIEL GALPIN:
Well, users trusting

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.917
the platform is inherently
important to developers.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.500
Downloading an app
is something we all

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.195
want users to feel
comfortable doing.

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:27.070
And that's why we've
given users more control

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.528
over their identity, around
how apps run in the background,

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.580
and about how apps share
storage with each other.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.175
Now, these platform
changes ultimately

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.460
will require some apps to make
changes when they target queue,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.752
but it's important for everyone
that we get this right.

00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:41.085
EMILY FORTUNA: Tell me more
about how the Android studio

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.640
team focused on
quality improvements

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.793
for their latest release.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:46.210
DANIEL GALPIN: Well, we're
always listening to developers.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.945
And while new ID
features are great,

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.570
they don't mean
anything if your coding

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.945
is interrupted with the crashes
and performance problems.

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.640
So the team has fixed over
400 high-priority bugs

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.750
and made existing
features work better.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.790
For example, we've
rewritten Instant Run

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.790
from the ground up with
a more solid foundation,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.710
renaming it Apply Changes.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.085
And developers can try all of
this today in the 3.5 beta.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, what's
the latest with Google Play?

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.800
DANIEL GALPIN: Ah, well,
it's all about app bundles.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.440
And they make sure
the devices get

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.120
just the parts of
the APK they need,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.430
which has turned into an
average of 20% smaller

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.110
downloads for users.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.680
We've also recently launched the
1.0 release of dynamic feature

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.732
modules, which allows
apps to have even smaller

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.190
initial downloads
by choosing which

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.650
parts to download at launch.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.260
And speaking of distribution,
we launched inline app updates

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.760
today, which provides
a standard way

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.250
to prompt users to update
their app when a new version is

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.570
available on Play.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.330
EMILY FORTUNA: So what about
the updates to Android Jetpack?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.830
DANIEL GALPIN: Well,
Android Jetpack

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.600
is another way
we've been investing

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.740
in developer productivity.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.280
And CameraX is a huge step
forward in making it easier

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.440
for Android apps to
access the camera

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.930
and get consistent
behavior across devices.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.330
We've also continued to
improve JetPack's architecture

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.490
components, having recently
released WorkManager

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.560
and the Navigation
Controller into stable,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.420
adding enhanced RXJava
support for room,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.150
adding Kotlin coroutine support
to room lifecycle and LiveData,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.400
and adding Saved State
support to ViewModel.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.590
And we're also continuing
to expand the architecture

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.120
components and
JetPack in general

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.495
to tackle new pain points,
including the new benchmarking

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.210
library.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.620
Also the early source for a
new Kotlin First reactive UI

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.912
toolkit-- we're developing
the open JetPack Compose--

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:17.620
is now available.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.492
So check it out, and
give us feedback.

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:20.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Android development

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.510
is becoming Kotlin First.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.140
Why is Kotlin First important?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.890
DANIEL GALPIN: Well,
the world has spoken.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.380
Kotlin is wildly popular.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.290
Over 50% of pro Android
developers are using it,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.620
and it means much less code
to type, test, and maintain.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.320
Now of course, we're continuing
to invest in C++ and Java

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.680
programming language, and all
three choices remain great

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.600
options for Android development.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.120
That being said, I'm excited
to see the reaction to our new

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.612
for Udacity course, "Developing
Android Apps in Kotlin."

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:50.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for stopping by, Daniel.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.420
That was a lot of really
great information,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.480
and we really appreciate it.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.410
EMILY FORTUNA:
Thank you, Daniel.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.000
DANIEL GALPIN:
Thank you, Timothy.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.708
Thank you, Emily.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.340
And I appreciate talking to you.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.690
