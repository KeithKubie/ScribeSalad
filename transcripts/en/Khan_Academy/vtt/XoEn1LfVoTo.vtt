00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's try some slightly more
complicated equations.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:13.340
Let's say we have 3 times
x plus 5-- I want to make

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:24.655
sure I get all the colors
nice-- is equal to 17.

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:27.430
 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.790
So what's different about this
than what we saw in the last

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.290
video is, all of a sudden,
now we have this plus 5.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.250
If it was just 3x is equal to
17, you could divide both

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.570
sides by 3, and you'd
get your answer.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.080
But now this 5 seems to mess
things up a little bit.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.610
Now, before we even solve
it, let's think about

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.170
what it's saying.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.500
Let's solve it kind of in a
tangible way, then we'll solve

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.800
it using operations that
hopefully will make

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.650
sense after that.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.440
So 3 times x literally means--
so let me write it over here.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.870
So we have 3 times x.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.960
So we literally have an
x plus an x plus an x.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.630
That right there is a 3x.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.170
And then that's plus 5, and
I'm actually going to write

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.770
it out as five objects.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.130
So plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.426
This right here, this 3x
plus 5, is equal to 17.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:19.010
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.845
So let me write the equal sign.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.520
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.810
Now, let me draw
17 objects here.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:38.020
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.910
Now, these two things are
equal, so anything you do

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.440
to this side, you have
to do to that side.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.460
If we were to get rid of one
object here, you'd want to get

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.730
rid of one object there in
order for the equality

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.730
to still be true.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.530
Now, what can we do to both
sides of this equation so we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.690
can get it in the form that
we're used to, where we

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.040
only have a 3x on the
left-hand side, where

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.840
we don't have this 5?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.810
Well, ideally, we would
just get rid of these

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.210
five objects here.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.460
You would literally get rid
of these five objects:

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.300
But, like I said, if the
original thing was equal to the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.410
original thing on the right, if
we get rid of five objects from

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.680
the left-hand side, we have
to get rid of five objects

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.900
from the right-hand side.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.600
So we have to do it here,
too: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.030
Now, what is a symbolic way
of representing taking

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.800
away five things?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.550
Well, you're subtracting 5 from
both sides of this equation.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.100
So that's what we're doing here
when we took away 5 from the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.410
left and from the right.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.660
So we're subtracting
5 from the left.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.820
That's what we did here.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.800
And we're also subtracting
5 from the right.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.390
Do that right over there.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.790
Now, what does the left-hand
side of the equation

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.220
now become?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.300
The left-hand side,
you have 5 minus 5.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.170
These cancel out.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.800
You're just left with the 3x.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.530
It's a different
shade of green.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.930
You are just left with the 3x.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.260
The 5 and the negative
5 canceled out.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.300
And you see that here.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.070
When you got rid of these
five objects, we were

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.410
just left with the 3x's.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.340
This right here is the 3x.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490
And the whole reason why we
subtracted 5 is because we

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.780
wanted this 5 to go away.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.790
Now, what does the right-hand
side of the equation look like?

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.450
So it's 3x is going to be-- let
me write the equality sign

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.210
right under it-- is equal to--
or you could either just

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.060
do it mathematically.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.980
Say, OK, 17 minus 5.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.310
17 minus 5 is 12.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.120
Or you could just
count over here.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.910
I had 17 things.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.900
I took away 5.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.800
I have 12 left: 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.090
That's what's subtraction is.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.180
It's just taking
away five things.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.820
So now we have it in a pretty
straightforward form.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.350
3x is equal to 12.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.450
All we have to do is
divide both sides of

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.330
this equation by 3.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.930
So we're just left with an
x on the left-hand side.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.840
So we divide by-- let me pick
a nicer color than that.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.490
Let me do this pink color.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.340
So you divide the
left-hand side by 3, the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.540
right-hand side by 3.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.260
And remember what
that's equivalent to.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.070
The left-hand side, none of
this stuff exists anymore,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.570
so we should ignore it.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.120
None of this stuff
exists anymore.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.270
In fact, let me clear it
out, just so that we don't

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.190
even have to look at it.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.730
We subtracted it, so
let me clear it.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.350
Let me clear it over here.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.740
Let me clear it over here.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.300
And so now we are dividing
both sides by 3.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.640
Divide the left-hand side by 3.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.890
It's 1, 2, 3.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.580
So three groups, each of
them have an x in it.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.670
If you divide this right-hand
side by 3, you have 1, 2 and 3.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.560
So it's three groups of four.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.550
So when you do it
mathematically here,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.680
the 3's cancel out.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.975
3 times something divided by
3 is just the something.

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:48.220
So you're left with x is
equal to, and then 12

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.103
divided by 3 is 4.

00:04:50.103 --> 00:04:53.100
 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.150
You get x is equal to 4,
and you get that exact

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.070
same thing over here.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.140
When you divided 3x into
groups of three, each of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.730
the groups had an x in it.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.610
When you divided 12 into groups
of three, each of the groups

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.230
have a 4 in it, so x
must be equal to 4.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.390
x is equal to 4.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.110
Let's do another one, and this
time I won't draw it all out

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.610
like this, but hopefully,
you'll see that the same type

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.750
of processes are involved.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.380
Let's say I have-- let me
scroll down a little bit.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.060
Let's say I have 7x.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.880
So 7x-- and I'll do a slightly
more complicated one this time.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:48.330
7x minus 2 is equal to-- I'll
make the numbers not work

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.360
out nice and clean-- is
equal to negative 10.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.400
Now, this all of a sudden
becomes a lot more-- you know,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.570
we have a negative sign.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.310
We have a negative over
here, but we're going to

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.300
do the exact same thing.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.510
The first thing we want to do
if we want to get the left-hand

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.450
side simplified to just 7x
is we want to get rid

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.950
of this negative 2.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.170
And what can we add or subtract
to both sides of the equation

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.200
to get rid of this negative 2?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.050
Well, if we add 2 to the
left-hand side, these two

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.470
guys will cancel out.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.420
But remember, this
is equal to that.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.950
If we want the equality to
still hold, if we add 2 to the

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.070
left-hand side, we also have to
do it to the right-hand side.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.990
So what is the new left-hand
side going to be equal to?

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.950
So we have 7x, negative
2 plus 2 is just 0.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.090
I could write plus 0, or I
could just write nothing there,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.130
and I'll just write nothing.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.920
So we get 7x is equal to-- now,
what's negative 10 plus 2?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.670
And this is a little bit
of review of adding and

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.970
subtracting negative numbers.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.810
Remember.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.840
I'll draw the number
line here for you.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.090
If I draw the number line--
so this is 9, this is 1.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.360
We could keep going in
the positive direction.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.550
Negative 10 is out here.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.850
Negative 10, negative 9,
negative 8, negative 7.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.860
There's a bunch
of numbers here.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.040
You know, dot, dot, dot.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.350
I don't have space to draw them
all, but we're starting at

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.350
negative 10, and we're adding 2
to it, so we're moving in the

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.780
positive direction on
the number lines.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.960
So we're going 1, 2.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.520
So it's negative 8.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.540
Don't get confused.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.130
Don't say, OK, 10 plus 2
is 12, so negative 10

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.070
plus 2 is negative 12.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.800
No!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.260
Negative 10 minus 2 would be
negative 12 because you'd

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.440
be going more negative.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.200
Here, we have a negative
number, but we're

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.960
going to the right.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.640
We're going in the positive
direction, so this

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.020
is negative 8.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.010
So we have 7x is
equal to negative 8.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.990
So now you might be saying,
well, how do I do this

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.760
type of a problem?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.170
You know, I have a
negative number here.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.425
You do it the exact same way.

00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:49.410
If we want to just have an x on
the left-hand side, we have to

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.850
divide the left-hand side by 7,
so that the 7x divided by 7,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.610
just the 7's cancel out,
you're left with x.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.220
So let's do that.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.880
If you divide by 7, those
cancel out, but you can't just

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.130
do it to the left-hand side.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.880
Anything you do to the left,
you have to do to the right

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.950
in order for the equality
to still hold true.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.360
So let's divide the
right by 7 as well.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.270
And we are left with
just an x is equal to

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.760
negative 8 divided by 7.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.560
We could work it out.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.810
It'll be some type of a
decimal, if you were to use a

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.810
calculator, or you could just
leave it in fraction form.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.200
Negative 8 divided by
7 is negative 8/7.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.560
Negative 8/7, or if you want to
write it as a mixed number, x

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.500
is equal to 7 goes into 8 one
time and has a remainder of 1,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.560
so it's negative 1 and 1/7.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.690
Either one would be acceptable.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.255
