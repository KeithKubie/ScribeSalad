00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.030
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Good morning.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.330
So let's get started.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.510
Welcome to the 75th Topics

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.330
and Preservations Series
lecture or TOPS lecture.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.630
My name is Elmer Eusman.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.930
I'm the chief conservator
here at the Library,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.800
and it is my great pleasure to
make some introductory remarks

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.170
for today's presentation
given by Dana Hemmenway

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.500
and Matthew Clarke titled
Removing Residual Iron

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100
from Platinum and Palladium Prints.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.390
Before I do so, I would like to
welcome our more than 70 colleagues

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.940
who are tuning into
our live web feed.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.410
And for those who cannot
join us live,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.180
the Library is recording
today's presentation

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.640
and will make a high quality video
or on demand video stream available

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.060
for both the Library's main website

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.910
and Preservation site
in the coming months.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.940
In the meantime, we invite you to
visit our website to keep abreast

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.920
of our upcoming lectures
and other ongoing work.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.240 position:56%

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.940
So now that's out of the way,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.550
we can actually focus our
attention on the talk.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.900
Photographic material that Dana
and Matt will be talking about are

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.640
of great interest at the Library
and to others with collections

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.610
that hold platinum and
palladium photographs.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.320
These photographs were extremely
popular just before and just

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.060
after the turn of the 20th century,
and they played an important role

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.240
in the rise of photography as
an art form as well as being one

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.710
of the predominant processes

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.010
that documented the
visual world at that time.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.950
While these photographs are
often considered permanent

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.890
and quite stable, we know
from examining our collections

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.670
that unfortunately the
condition of platinum

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.220
and palladium photographs
can deteriorate over time.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.090
Dana and Matt's work is a wonderful
example of the research we do

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.070
to understand the object's
condition,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.520
determine why it may be
deteriorating, propose treatments

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.410
to improve it's condition
and evaluate the efficacy

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.330
of those proposed treatments.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.970
The ability to preserve collections
for future generations --

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.670
that is our charge -- depends on
our knowledge of that deterioration

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.580
and how to arrest or correct it.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.040
So as for Dana and Matthew --

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.250
Dana Hemmenway has been a
senior photograph conservator

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.320
at the Library's Conservation
Division since 2003.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.300
She serves several special
collection divisions

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.710
and as a conservation
liaison is responsible

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.060
for preparing all photographs
selected

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.800
for in-house and outgoing loans.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.100
She's currently researching

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.540
and treating the Library's
important collection

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.850
of copyright deposit prints,
the earliest motion pictures.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.190
Before coming to the Library,
Dana was an Andrew Mellon Fellow

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.350
with the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and participated in the first cycle

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.170
of advanced residency program in
photograph conservation cosponsored

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.900
by the George Eastman House
and Image Permanence Institute.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.510
Dana has a Master's degree from
the Winterthur University Delaware

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.300
program in art conservation,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.520
specializing in the
conservation of photographs.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.810
Dr. Matthew Clarke is Conservation
Scientist at the National Galleries

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.620
at the Smithsonian Institution.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.740
He has been working in the field
of conservation science since 2010

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.860
when he joined the National Gallery
as a photograph material scientist

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.970
as part of a project
funded by a grant also

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.710
from the Andrew Mellon
Foundation focusing on the study

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.670
of platinum and palladium prints.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.890
This work has involved the
application of spectroscopic,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.500
microscopic and reverse
engineering techniques.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.820
Before his work at
the National Gallery,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.400
he investigated optical imaging
techniques and methods and analyses

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.210
at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.160
Matt has a Ph.D. in
analytical chemistry

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.110
from the University of Michigan.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dana and Matt.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.730
[ Applause ]

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Hemmenway: Thank you, Elmer.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.180
The following presentation
is a collaboration

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.740 position:56%
between two neighboring institutions
with common goals and interests.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.760
It began like much recent
platinum photography research

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.950
under the auspices of the
National Gallery of Arts Platinum

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.620
and Palladium Initiative.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.820
Matt presented preliminary results
of our research last November

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.040 position:56%
at the project symposium in his
discussion of the technical history,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.180
chemistry and degradation
and analysis

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.600
of platinum and palladium prints.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.270
This talk will review and expand
on key elements of that discussion

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.040
and present results from
research conducted since then.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.810
We will conclude with an assessment
of advantages and disadvantages

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.530
of chelation as a conservation
treatment.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.530
The list of photographers
who worked in platinum

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.560 position:56%
in the early 20th century is a who's
who of the pictorialist movement,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.340
some of whom you see in
the image on the screen.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.910
Others include Imogene Cunningham,
F. Holland Day, Frederick Evans,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.750
Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.270
They all worked and
loved the medium.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.590
As Stieglitz wrote, "The platinum
print has an indescribable charm,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.310
suggesting atmosphere,
though the negative printed

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.510
on another medium may be entirely
devoid of this pictorial quality."

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.470
Today, the increasing number of
exhibitions and academic study

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.380
that include platinum photography
demonstrates our own esteem

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.010
of the medium.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.180
The Platinum Palladium Initiative
has unquestionably heightened our

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.890
awareness and increased the
knowledge base of this medium.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.250
While this project was taking shape
here at the Library of Congress,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.420
I was considering treatment options
for a Laura Gilpin photograph.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.200
Upon examining the print, I was
struck by the degree of darkening

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.980
on the recto, especially
when compared to the verso.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.770
This Clarence White
print, on the other hand,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:55.250 position:56%
is stained on both sides, while this
photograph contains overall staining

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.730
as well as localized dark spots.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.010
And I think you'll agree that
this Paul Outerbridge appears

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.260
to be in very good condition.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.930
So what are the sources of
staining and deterioration?

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.520
It interferes not only with
our appreciation of the image

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.520
but can cause extreme brittleness,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.250
making the print vulnerable
to physical damage.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.380
The old addage, "A platinum print
is as permanent as it's support,"

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.900 position:56%
was probably meant to be reassuring.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.480
There are a number of possible
sources for poor aging.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.520
Platinum catalyzed
paper degradation,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.570
acid catalyzed hydrolysis of
cellulose, photo-oxidation

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.880
of cellulose and residual
processing chemistry.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.600
This series of images illustrate
the steps in the process

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.830
of making a platinum print.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.260
Sensitizing the paper support,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.790
exposure to UV radiation
and image development.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.090
The simplified chemical equation
show how light sensitive iron salts

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.100
are used to reduce platinum
to it's metallic state,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.220
thereby creating image
material we see in the print.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.750
Final processing includes
acid clearing

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.740
of unused sensitizer
and extensive washing.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.730
If the remaining iron compounds
are not adequately removed

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.600
from the print, residual iron can
go on to produce color compounds

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.470
such as iron oxide and hydroxides
and induce future degradation

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.350
of the cellulose support.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.240
This will cause yellowing
and loss of paper strength.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.980
One can quickly imagine a
number of factors that lead

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.870
to incomplete clearing of prints.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.170
First, proper processing
takes over an hour to finish.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.050
There are multiple
prints in a single --

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.470
if there are multiple
prints in a single path,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.250
they would need agitation
to be adequately exposed

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.350
to the processing chemistry.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.880
And finally, that chemistry, if not
replenished, may become exhausted

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.110
and not fully able to
clear unused sensitizer.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.820
Inevitably, mistakes were
made and shortcuts were taken.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.740
And of course the condition
would be made worse

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.870
if the print has been stored in a
poor environment since creation.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:16.260 position:56%
Our study is based on the assumption
that residual iron causes staining

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.360
and paper degradation and removing

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.970
that iron will benefit
the print's preservation

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.360
and aesthetic appearance.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.330
Historically, conservation
literature reveals a number

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.970
of approaches including
acidified bathing solutions

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.760
and powerful oxidative bleaching.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.400
The use of chelators for paper
conservation applications was

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.120
discussed by Helen Burgess in 1991.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.340 position:56%
Since then, there have been an
increasing number of studies dealing

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.350
with the corrosive action of
metal complexes on cellulose

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.240
such as iron [inaudible], a
study we do a lot with here,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.350
and copper pigments as well.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.620
To date, there has only been one
published study by [inaudible]

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.190
in 1994 that directly
involves chelating iron stains

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.330
in aged platinum prints.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.910
When developing strategies for the
current study, a number of factors

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.300
or questions help guide our
approach for testing chelators.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.660
What delivery method
would be most effective?

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.550
Immersion, blotter washing,
application of [inaudible].

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.450
Could we select chelators
that are selective for iron?

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.880 position:56%
Could we select chelators that would
not necessitate extremely elevated

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.420
pH levels to activate?

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.940
Would there be a collateral loss
of original material on the print?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.380
That is, platinum, the
image material or calcium

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.760
and sizing that's in the paper?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.870
What chelator concentrations
would be safe?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.840
Would the reported long
bathing times be necessary?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.950
How long would it take
to remove the chelator

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.470
and could it be completely removed?

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.820
And finally, is this procedure
practical for conservators?

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.570
Matt will now address how we
incorporated these factors

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.000
into our research questions
and strategies.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.620
&gt;&gt; Matthew Clark: So, as we want to
look into this research and we want

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.570
to find out whether chelation
treatment is something

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.380
to be considered, we
first want to think

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.660
about how does residual iron
affect print's appearance

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.550
and does chelation both
improve removal of iron

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.140
and change the print appearance.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.880 position:56%
And finally, one of the main parts
of the research is we wanted to find

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.180
out what's the long term effect?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.720
Because this is probably the
most understudied component.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.940
Now, there's a challenge
here as either we have

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.910
to find a large number
of historic prints

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.620
in which we think we know
how they were made or we have

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.840
to make our own prints where
we can control at least most

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.650
of everything that goes into them.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.310 position:56%
And so that's what we decided to do.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.000
And as part of the Platinum
and Palladium Initiative,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.850
there's been a lot of research
at the National Gallery of Art

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.480
and at other institutions at making
platinum and palladium prints.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.340
So shown here is Christopher
Manes [assumed spelling] making

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.650
up solutions for platinum
printing, and through the course

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.290
of the whole initiative, there's
been hundreds or possibly now

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.960
into the thousands little
different variables of step tablets

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.770
that we sliced and done at all
sorts of different conditions.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:33.040
And so we can get this large
range of different images

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.210
and image qualities and study them.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.030
But we first have to
start with something

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.740
to make the platinum prints on,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.420
and choosing an appropriate
paper is a critical step,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.380
and early platinum literature
we talk about we have

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.450
to use a high quality paper.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.640
And so in this case either a cotton

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.100
or bast fiber paper
was typically used.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.630
We don't want any buffered paper.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.060
Alkaline buffered papers
can interfere

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.240
with the platinum printing process.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.540
We don't want optical brighteners.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.940
We don't want dyes and the
platinum process is better,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.470
starch or alum rosin size
paper compared to gelatin.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.140
So that's the type of
paper we're looking for.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.600
It's not easy to find.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.140
You -- most papers
now have brighteners.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.120
They have different sizing agents
then would have traditionally

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.420
been used.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.620
But so we're two different
institutions

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.720
so you can see what
we have available.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.110
And it turns out National
Gallery of Art letterhead

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:42.110
from the 1980's roughly has
the properties that we want,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.730
and no one really cared
if our team dug through

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.710
and removed it from their closets.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.240
So that's what we've been using.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.620
We've had different lots of
this, and it varies a bit.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.150
But we can use this paper
as a good standard tool.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.000
And then we have to find
out what's the print going

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.130
to look like in 50 years?

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.430
100 years?

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.840
And we don't want to
wait so we have to come

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.270 position:56%
up with an accelerated aging system.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.830
And that is always it's own
challenge, but we are looking

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.260 position:56%
at using a few different techniques.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.630
What we settled on was
we have this system

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:31.690
where we have a stainless steel rig
that we tie the paper samples to.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.960
That goes into a humidity
aging oven.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.950
We age it at 70 degrees Celsius,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.130
75 percent relative
humidity for four weeks.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.520
This is a condition that we found
generally minimized the paper

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.010
degregation while increasing --

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.280
being favorable for the
formation of stains.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.640
And by appearance,
they mimic the stains

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.710 position:56%
that we observed in historic prints.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:06.290
Now we want to do analysis on
what happens to these prints.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.890
And so of course we
look at these by eye,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.400
and we can classify them that way.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.000
By my point of view as a
scientist, we want to look

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000 position:56%
at some quantitative measurements so
we're going to use two techniques.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.490
We're going to use x-ray
fluorescence, and that's going

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.280
to give us an idea
about the elements --

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.770
in this case, we're really
looking at the amount

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.680
of iron that's present
in the papers.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.200
And we're looking at colorimetry,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.170
which will give us a quantitative
value of how we perceive the print

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.480
and so finding out
whether it's brighter

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.730
or darker, yellower tone print.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.360
So these are the main techniques
I'm going to focus on here.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.320
Now, as Dana mentioned,
the prints are made

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.430
by applying the sensitizer
to the paper.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.080
There are different types
of staining that can occur

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.790
in prints and in other objects.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.060
We're going to focus on what
we call sensitizer stain.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.170
And that's going to
occur in the region

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:07.210
where we have the sensitizer
was [inaudible] to.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.240
So you can see where
that yellow ends,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.640
that's the end of the sensitizer.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.420
And we'll compare that region
after development and processing

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.190
to a region that never
had any sensitizer on it.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:27.170
And looking -- we'll compare both
prints that are aged and unaged,

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.470 position:56%
well processed and poorly processed.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.210
And so this stain exists
even if the print was masked.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.630
And you can see on the far right

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:43.320
that there's a tiny
faint line that exists.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.150
We can enhance that
contrast a little bit.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.310
And you can see it before
aging just barely and then

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:51.860
after aging it's more significant.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.690
So this is kind of our goal because
if a photographer made a print

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.220
and it had a really bad stain,
it probably wouldn't have come

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.970
to the National Gallery
of Arts collection

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.670
and probably may not have come
into the Library of Congress.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.040
It all depends on --
so we're looking

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.370
for what shortcuts could be made

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.600
but that it's still
going to cause staining?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:19.280 position:56%
So to do that, we have to do a
whole lot of tests and what was done

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.900
by both Dana and I and by
the broader platinum team was

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:30.040
to start taking shortcuts and find
out what's the kind of least amount

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.580
of shortcut you can do that's
still going to cause a stain?

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:39.020
So as a print goes from well
processed to poorly processed,

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.550
you will see more and more stain
form particularly after aging.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.850
But what you really can see is that
you can take a lot of shortcuts,

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.080
have a print that looks pretty
good once it comes out of

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.890
that final washing
bath, but it's going

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.870
to form a stain after
a number of years.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:05.440
And the other question we want
to know is does the amount

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.630
of iron also change when
you do these shortcuts?

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.320
And yes. As you go to more
poorly processed prints,

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.980
you'll see an increase in the
amount of iron that's in the paper.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.280
So we know iron's important.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.200
We know it correlates
with the image staining.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.770
So one thing I wanted to know in
particular was is iron enough alone

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.250
to cause these stains or do
you need residual platinum

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.110
or palladium salts also present?

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.720
So is it a combination effect that
you have platinum and you have iron

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.670
and then that's what's
causing the staining?

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.270
So one of the tests
that we did was to do --

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.550
make a "platinum print"
but without any platinum.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.820
So we added the iron solution.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.120
We sensitized the paper.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.420
We exposed it.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.930
We developed it, processed
it otherwise.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.370
It was just ferric oxalate and
no platinum or palladium salts.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.610
And we still see staining.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.900
You can see sensitizing line.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.760
On the top right, you'll see
a paper before and after aging

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.910
and there's kind of an
orange line at the top.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.830
But the paper is changing color.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.970
And if we look at the XRF
results -- and again this is --

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.440
the reason the XRF results to
look at the amount of iron that's

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.860
in the paper, we can see
an increased amount of iron

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.040
in the sensitized region compared
to the unsensitized region

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.410
for both this iron only print
and for platinum prints.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.420
As you know, we have
residual iron in the paper.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.360
So iron's certainly a key
element that's going on.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.710
It's here.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.760
We can quantify that color change.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.850
Again, we're using the colorimetry
so just quickly I'm going to look

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.980
at the LAB colorimetry values.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.740
The LVAD value at the top is
a measure of the brightness

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.400
so higher numbers are
brighter paper.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.830
The A is a value of
redness greenness.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.220
Pretty much all other
values are positive,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.920
which means as they
go more positive,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.050
they're more red in appearance.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.710
Similarly, B is yellowness blueness

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.770
and we're going to
a more yellow print.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.630
Higher positive numbers.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.170
You can sort of ignore
that and just look

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.910
at the little bars here
that show yellow or red.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:25.560
And the aged prints, they darken
and they become more yellow.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.130
It's a simple take away here.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:35.230 position:56%
So if we known iron's related to the
stain formation, can we remove it,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.430
and what does removing it
do for us in the long term?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.730
So chelation treatments

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.240
as Dana mentioned have been
commonly used in conservation.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.940
We know they're being used for
photographs, but there aren't

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.400
that many studies on what's
actually taking place.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.700
So we should quickly review,
well what is a chelator?

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.670
It's a molecule that combines
multiple sites on it's target ion.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:08.580
I like to think of it as kind
of a hand holding object.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.630
So it has these multiple
sites where it can bind.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.430
And that makes it a strong
affinity for certain irons.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.090
Depending on the pH of the
solution and other conditions,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.370
that can change which
ions it will bind more.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.050
It's not specific to iron,
but it can be more specific --

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.240
some molecules can be
more specific than others.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.830
And I'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.580
But there are different
forms of iron.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.100
Iron three state, iron two state

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.840
and each chelator can have it's own
binding coefficient for each state

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.680
of iron, and that can
change with pH. So very,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.650 position:56%
very common chelator is EDTA, and at
low pH it will bind more iron three,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.090
and at a higher pH, it
will bind more iron two.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:57.900
Based on the conservation
literature,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.210
we chose three chelators.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.390
I'll skip going through
the full chemical names,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.800
but they are EDTA, DTPA and HBED.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.440
EDTA is -- was invented in the 30's
and has been very commonly used.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.290
You'll see it in many
different applications

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.520
from conservation to gardening.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.530
DTPA is very structurally similar.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.090
It's the one on the right to EDTA.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:32.850
It has a higher binding
coefficient for iron than EDTA,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.190
but it's also less soluable.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.140
And then HBED is structurally
a little different.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.590
It has a very, very strong
binding coefficient for iron three,

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.880
and so it's had a lot
of interest recently

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.210
in the conservation community

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.910
because in these aged prints
we expect most of the iron

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.710
to be in the iron three state.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.500
We'll talk a little bit more about
each of these as we come to them.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.140
So we're looking at
these three chelators,

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.790
and based on the other literature,
we also know that the addition

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.530
of a reducing agent -- in
this case, sodium dithionite,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.890
is often used in order to change
one form of iron to the other.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.450
In this case, changing it from
the iron three to iron two state,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:19.590
and that can aid with removal by
the -- of iron by the chelators.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.030
And we tested two pH
conditions that would be amenable

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.800
for conservation treatment,
pH 6 and pH 8.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:36.210
After our initial test, the pH
8 gave the better visual results

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.170
and so we stuck with that plus all
three chelators are more soluable

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.800
at pH 8, especially for HBED
and DTPA that was very helpful.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.000
So we start with a custom
negative, and we do this

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.440
because we want a large area where
we can form the sensitizer stain,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.500
and that's going to form in this
masked area or this demin area.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.120
And we can compare it with
this large unsensitized area.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.310
This is something that you don't
necessarily find in the prints

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.700
in our archives or artistic prints

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.320
because either the paper was
initially sensitized throughout the

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.270
entire sheet or it was
trimmed after it was made.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.100
So that's hard to compare, but
this gives us a really good sense

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.720
of what's happening.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.760
And then we compare these
thoroughly processed prints

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.060
to poorly processed.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.390
And then we age them in cycles.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.870
So we compare unaged, aged and
print that has been aged two times

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.160
and see that it used to darken.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.510 position:56%
Both the well processed print and
the poorly processed print do change

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:46.050 position:56%
in appearance over time, but the
poorly processed print changes more.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.270
Now, for our chelation test,
what we want to do is we want

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:55.580
to take the print after one
aging cycle and then treat it

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:01.230
and then we will reage it to
find out what happens after that.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:08.180
So in the initial test that we
did, we first hydrate the prints

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.290
in water for about ten minutes.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.030
We did a two hour chelation
treatment, and then we washed it

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.860
in the pH adjusted
water for 30 minutes

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.470
with multiple changes of the water.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.770
And then we looked at them.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:27.800
And I think this -- the lower right
it shows you chelations aren't

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.220
really exciting treatment.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.660
And a lot of this stuff you don't
want, a treatment that's going

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.960
to run away from you, right?

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.280
So at least here we could sit
and watch it and rock trays.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:45.670
So what do we find from
our initial results?

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.930
Well, the paper sizing's important.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.780
We did compare gelatin size
paper to alum rosen size paper,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.680
and the gelatin retained more iron.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.060
The chelation treatments
did remove more iron

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.990
than the water treatment alone,
and that's important to note.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.280
And as we increase the chelation
time, so if we went to four hours,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.580
we saw an increased benefit.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.820
There wasn't much benefit
after four hours,

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.460
but we thought we could also
exchange new chelation baths

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.890
and improve the process.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.280
So that's something
else we plan to explore.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.540
Adding a reducing agent did help
removal of iron for both EDTA

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.160
and DTPA, but it did not for HBED.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.040
That shouldn't be a surprise
because HBED is really specific

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.350
for iron three so there's no real
reason to try to reduce iron three

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.820
to iron two for an HBED process.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.300
And I'll talk a little bit more
about HBED in a few slides,

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.290
but HBED we found was very
difficult to remove from the prints

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.780 position:56%
and so we plan some more experiments
on how to aid it's removal.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.630
So we did a whole lot
of tests after this,

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.410
and I'm not going to
go into great detail.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.630
But we looked at different
concentrations of chelators.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.350
We looked at increasing
the chelation time as well

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.370
as exchanging multiple
baths and the absence

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.290
or addition of a reducing agent.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.070 position:56%
In this case, the sodium dithionite.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.930
And we looked at the
concentration of sodium dithionite

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.360
from two percent to eight percent.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.510
And then had to do
analysis on all of them.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.120
So it takes some time too.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.350
There's a whole lot of data
here, and I'm not going

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.650
to go through all of this.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.740
I'll kind of show you in general
what we saw and then I'll go

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.820
through a couple specific cases.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.340
But the amount of iron in the print

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.860
as they were more poorly
processed will show a greater --

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.360 position:56%
you can see a larger amount of iron.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.400
The chelators all reduced the
amount of iron that was present

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.380
and general, the addition of
the dithionite further aid

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.810
of the reduction of iron, and in no
place is this going to remove all

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.110
of the iron from your prints.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.890 position:56%
And that's pretty important to note.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.660
And there's some different
form of iron that were

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.020 position:56%
in the paper before it was even made

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.790
into a platinum print before
the sensitizer was added.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.220
And we can compare this with
the colorimetry results.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.230
As the print ages, it gets darker.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.580
It also gets yellower.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.310
All of the chelators
generally bumped up the --

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.370
brightened the paper a little bit.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.960
Dithionite tended to also
further brighten the paper.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.910
And you may notice on the far right
something's going on with HBED

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.350
where it looks a little
bit more red.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.380
So we kept an eye on that.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.340
So don't try to keep all
of this in your head,

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.840
but let's just look at one sample.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.570
So let's look at EDTA.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.870
And in this round again,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.740
we're taking the sample
that's been aged once.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.290
We have a whole bunch of these,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.280
and then we do different
chelation treatments.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.090
So in here we're generally going up
longer and longer chelation times

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.580
and exchanging baths and
adding dithionite to it.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.010
And it's a little difficult
to see but generally as soon

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.340
as you do the chelation
treatment, the print is brighter.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.730
After you do aging, it darkens
some but not to the extent

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:09.630
as if you had not done
the treatment.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.640
The really high concentrations

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.450
of EDTA were not very
favorable for treatment.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.320
They were too -- this was
essentially almost saturated

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.240
and so we had some
issues with those.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:29.640
But we had some otherwise
improved appearance of the prints.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.500
If we look and just focus on the
iron content for the EDTA samples,

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.660 position:56%
we'll see that if you take that
dotted line to be the amount of iron

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.890
in the poorly processed
print, after chelation all

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.020
of the prints had reduction
in the amount of iron,

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.730
the addition of the
diothinite further reduced it.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.380
But in the end again,
we're never removing all

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.600
of the iron from the paper.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.570
We can compare this also and look

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.430
at what else is being
removed from the paper.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.140 position:56%
So calcium is being removed from
the paper, and that's not a surprise

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.720
for anyone who has worked with
chelators, and it's typical

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.770 position:56%
where calcium may be introduced
during some conservation treatments.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.920
That's not something
we explored here.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.430
But we just note that
calcium is being removed.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:21.280
And that's the case for
all three chelators.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.020
We can compare these to
the colorimetry results.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.000
Now, as I said, while
this treatment isn't fast,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.640
it's also not so substantial
that you see this giant thing

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.630
where now it's this white,
bright standard of paper.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.090
It's not something that -- we're
not aiming for that either.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.390
We're just trying -- we're trying

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.740
to improve the appearance
from these stains.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.110
So the prints are --
this is after aging.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.710
So the prints are of
improved appearance compared

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.760
to if they were not
treated after aging.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.210
In all cases, we saw
that they did brighten

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.040
and they had a reduction
in the amount of yellow.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.700
But they didn't make the print
back to the state they would be

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.610
in if they hadn't been properly
processed to begin with.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.510
But they did improve them.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.840
We did a larger battery
of tests with DTPA

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.930
because from our initial
trials it was quite --

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.970
it was somewhat most promising.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.060
As I said, DTPA is less
soluable than EDTA so it's

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.310 position:56%
about ten times lower concentration.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.960
It has about 100 times
stronger binding to iron

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.370
so ideally it still
can remove more iron.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.140
We did a large set of tests.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.350
They also again -- they
brightened the paper.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.220
Some fo that changes after aging.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.230
It does remove calcium.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.150
It removes iron, and the addition

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:54.630
of sodium dithionite improved
the reduction of iron as well.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.530
We can compare that to
the colorimetry results.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.040
I'm going a little faster.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.090
You start to see all these
spots, and it's hard to tell

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.450
which direction things are going.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.640
But the diothinite seemed to
brighten a little bit more

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:13.600
when you had the four DTPA samples
then it did for the EDTA samples.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:20.200
And really in the DTPA we found
samples had two percent dithionite

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.880
and two two hour treatments
to be most amenable.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.280
These were again all small changes.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.890
So this is -- just the
conditions that we found,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.980
to look the best both visually
and by the measurements.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:40.410
So I looked at the HBED, and that
little bit of change in color.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.950
Now, one of the things the
HBED is touted for is the fact

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.890
that when it complexes with
iron, it now has color.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.190
And that was kind of interesting

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.080
to see during the chelation
treatment the solution turns pink

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:57.100 position:56%
because that's the iron that's come
out, and it's chelated with the HBED

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.250
and so you can see
something's happening.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.250
That's something different.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:06.340
And there was a little bit of
tinge to the prints after they came

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.570
out even after multiple washes.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.760
But after aging, they
become very pink.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.450
And so what's happening is -- I
suspect there's a small amount

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.270
of HBED that isn't coming out
because it's poorly soluable.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:27.830 position:56%
And once it's in the accelerated
oven, it's enough it can [inaudible]

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.210
with some remaining
iron in the paper

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:34.560
because not all the iron comes
out, and it forms this pink stain.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:41.480
We explored ways to remove HBED
and going from a ten minute washing

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.780
to 22 hours using buffer
solution and really there's only

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:54.380
after the 22 hours you couldn't
tell that pink was there.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.320
And that's not really practical
for most conservation treatments.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.300
It's certainly not an
advantage of HBED to say oh,

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.670
it's really [inaudible] to remove
iron, but you have to wash it

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.200
for ten times longer
than the other processes.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:13.680 position:56%
So that's all well in good but you
still have to show, does this relate

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.360
to historically aged print?

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.710
So naturally aged print.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.690
So we went through all our data,
and I think this is a great slide

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.910
of showing we just pour over
the data and look at the prints

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.230
and talk back and forth about
what we thought was best.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:33.610
And we had a print here.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.200
It shows a somewhat
orangeish appearance.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.500
It's a little brown.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.700
It's about the same thickness
as the papers we're using

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.680
so that was somewhat
handy as we knew the --

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.270
we can make about the same
solutions and same time.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.850
And one of the first things
we want to do is measure it

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.140
by x-ray fluorescence to find
out is it a platinum print?

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.440
Because you can't always tell.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.510
And that's an important
factor to consider too.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.810
So we want to make
sure it was platinum

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.030
because we're focusing this
work on platinum prints.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.040
It does, and it has a lot of iron.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:13.000
So then we wanted to find --
divide the print into three parts.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.800
Have a control, do a DTPA
and an EDTA measurement.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.210
We're kind of just kicking
HBED off the list for now.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:26.240
And we want to do color imagery
and XRF measurements on areas

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.420
of the print that are
of similar density.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.210
And that's what this
little red areas are.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.220
That's similar optical
density of the paper.

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:39.050
And so these three yellow circles
are where we did the measurements.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.630
And the print conditions we found

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.390
to be most amenable were the
chelating conditions were EDTA

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:50.140 position:56%
for total treatment time of eight
hours with three different exchanges

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.180
of the solution and then the DTPA
plus the two percent dithionate

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.460
with a pair of two hour treatments.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.320
So we do see a reduction
of iron, and we also see

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.840
that the print is far less orange.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.750
It's a little bit brighter.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:14.630
We can look the -- again,
calcium comes out of the paper.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.940
A significant reduction
of iron has occurred.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.430
What we saw here is DTPA removed
more iron compared to EDTA,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.890
and it removed a little
less calcium.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.070
So that was favorable.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.410
We also noticed colorimetry.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.710
It is brighter.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:35.570
We noticed there was a little
bit of difference in the tone

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.250
between the appearance so the
DTPA was a little bit cooler tone,

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.950
and the EDTA was a
little bit warmer tone.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.610
That sort of surprised us.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.900
We don't know what the print
looked like before it was aged

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.450
so we can't say that one
treatment is more true

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.290
to what the original
intent of the artist was.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.610
But that was something
that we just noticed.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:36:02.730
And then if we take
this print and reage it,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.200
we'll see that in the center on the
lower half is what the print looks

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.550
like if it was not
treated, and it was reaged.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.710
So it will -- the print
will continue to darken

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.550
and become a little more orange.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.430
Both chelated portions also darken.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:28.300
They are not as dark as the
print had it not been treated.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:33.650
And they are less orange
compared to the original control.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.520
Now, we didn't compare on
that print water washing.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.020
That's something we
did want to explore

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.290
because water washing is often used
in conservation treatments of works

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:53.170
on paper and on photographs
for removal of iron for removal

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.500
of acidic products and for
strengthening your paper.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.810
And so that's something we
thought well maybe we do need

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.110
to come back to it.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.030
We know from our earlier test our
water didn't remove as much iron,

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.220 position:56%
but perhaps there's some differences

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.340
between our accelerated
aging and historic prints.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.630
So we had another print from our
study collection that we examined,

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:20.320
and we treated it by DTPA
and by buffered water baths.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:27.460
So we can see both with
the water and the DTPA

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.440
that the print has brightened some.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.740
It's less orange.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.010
The DTPA you do get this much
brighter initial -- this print --

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:45.700 position:56%
use a lot of that stain color and it
looks very sort of clean initially.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.990
It does darken after
aging, but not to the extent

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.790
as just the water washed alone.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:38:01.360
And so overall, we thought this
showed the chelator can remove more

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.520
iron and improve the
print appearance.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.780
And we can look at
the amount of iron.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.040
Certainly in this historic print,
a lot more iron was removed

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.530
for the DTPA treatments
compared to the water treatments.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:21.710
And from here, Dana is going to
summarize some of the advantages

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:26.000
and disadvantages that we found.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.480
&gt;&gt; Dana Hemmenway: Well,
with this data in mind,

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.970
I will highlight the
advantages and disadvantages

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.780
of chelation for platinum prints.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.610
Chelation removes iron compounds
from the print as Matt has shown.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.770
It protects the print from
future iron-induced deterioration

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.110
and staining.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.080
This benefit may be
mitigated, of course,

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.360
if there is incomplete
removal of iron

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.410
which could cause future
weakening and discoloration.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.700
Alkaline aqueous immersion also
removes acidic decomposition

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.300
products and reduces discoloration.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:05.350
It brightens the overall print
and restores tonal range.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.340
Disadvantages.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.050
You need XRF to confirm
both the presence of iron

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.700
and platinum before
proceeding with the treatment.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.340
Our study really focused
on platinum prints.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:21.400
If there are other toners or other
image materials within the print,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.370
we didn't take that
into consideration.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:30.850
They have other vulnerabilities.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.150
Let's put it that way.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.800
If it's a platinum print, it may
have different abilities to --

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.930
or become chelated in a
way that you don't want.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.580
It removes material from
the paper substrate,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.250
i.e. calcium and paper sizing.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.130
It potentially changes the
surface texture of prints.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.270
If used, the dithionite
reducer poses additional risk

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.300
to the print during treatment.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.880
Any brightening of the print
from the reducing capacity

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.650
of dithionite may revert
in time as we've seen.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:08.000
And lengthy bathing puts the
vulnerable platinum layer

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.300
at risk especially at the edges.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.480
And there may be unanticipated
consequences

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.060
to a chelation treatment
that may be revealed in time.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:27.980
Finally, what are the different
forms of iron in the paper?

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:34.240
Initially, after processing, after
aging are all forms of concern.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.470
How much calcium lost
can be tolerated?

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:40.530
Can it be effectively reintroduced?

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.610
Is the treatment too
aggressive for fragile prints?

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.220
And how will modified paper
like Japine behave in immersion?

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.810

Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.930

No. We didn't add that aspect
to the treatment protocols,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.690
but it certainly is something that
could be or should be considered.

Removing the oxygen

in those exhibit cases
certainly would reduce oxidative

&gt;&gt; Just one comment regarding
the paper that you guys used

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.650
to test all of these variables.

are based

I know you're using it because
these were sized papers, but that --

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.990
if not, that'd be an
interesting thing to look

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.510
at because then you
would determine the role

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:50.790
of your [inaudible]
sizing or that protein.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matthew Clarke: Well, the main
advantage if you don't have a sizing

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.230
in your paper, it -- when you
sensitize it, it's just going

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.360
to soak it up, and you won't --

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.030
it's going to be very
expensive essentially

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.330
because really you're
going to be forming

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.500
that platinum image near the top.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.000
And so -- and it's also --
it would be almost impossible

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.180
to even coat the paper well.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.840
It'll -- we've tried
a lot of different --

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.860
in the broader project -- a lot
of different ways of looking

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.500
into the papers and things

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.780
like unsized papers are
not favorable for that.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.970
&gt;&gt; Dana Hemmenway: And it's also
not that typical historic prints.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:34.740
They would have sizing.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.540
Yes?

00:45:36.540 --> 00:46:00.860
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.150
&gt;&gt; Matthew Clarke: I think
some of it does take some time

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:08.500
for the chelator to kind of
permeate and bind and come

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.390
out because you can slowly just
watching it reduce the hours

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.690
that we'll see a change.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.310
And so that's kind of
what we're basing it on.

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.340
I don't know -- some of these --

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.610
the iron compound isn't
just in solution.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.840
It's somehow bound
within the paper fibers.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.010 position:56%
And so that is what I think it takes
the time to get in and eventually

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.490
out and then washed away.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:41.490
&gt;&gt; Dana Hemmenway:
Any other questions?

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.790
Yes.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.470
&gt;&gt; Is iron entrained in
the high density areas

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.380
of the print when it precipitates?

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:52.910
&gt;&gt; Matthew Clarke:
There's different --

00:46:52.910 --> 00:47:00.230
there is a higher amount of
iron total in the darkest areas

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.300
of the print, whether it's
because it's been entrapped

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.150
and it's more difficult
to get out, I don't know.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:10.940
But usually in the measurements,
we'll see that it's there.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.610
I think also some of
it after it's been --

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:20.180 position:56%
gone through this photo reduction
process during the exposure may make

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.050
it more difficult to remove.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:29.370
So the paper that -- test that I
did with only the iron present,

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.630
you could tell a difference
because we also --

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.300
we put in the same step tablet.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.980
You could tell that there was a
little bit more iron in the area

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.300
that received more light.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.310
But that's kind of an
initial little test.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.370
I don't know exactly
how accurate it is.

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:47.120
It was enough to show here, but --

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.110
and people have seen that in other
studies where you see more iron

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:55.870
in the densest areas of the prints.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Hemmenway: But then the
staining will be less obvious there,

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.540
too.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.820
Any other questions?

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.720
&gt;&gt; Yes. For us prefacing
platinum and palladium printers,

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.100
should we consider adding
DT to our [inaudible]?

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.400
If so, what concentration?

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.240
What might be the risks?

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.010
&gt;&gt; Matthew Clarke: I think
usually there are practitioners

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.180
that will use a reducing agent
between in clearing baths,

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.860
but usually that hasn't
been sodium dithionite.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.730
Sodium dithionite is a
stronger reducing agent

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.870
so it's been more often
used on the treatment side,

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.860
but something like sodium
metabisulfite has been used

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.000
to remove iron from prints.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:49:00.510 position:56%
And that's often done in conjunction
with EDTA baths in particular.
