00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To close, we're going to use Delta Debugging

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to do something pretty cool,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
namely to give us a full diagnosis on what's happening

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when the program fails.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Our diagnosis will look something like this:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First this variable had this value.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This caused this other variable to get this other value.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then this third variable gets set to this other value.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That is what finally made the program crash.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In other words, what we get is cause-effect chain

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
throughout the program, which explains how the failure came to be

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in all of this automatically.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This cause-effect chain may or may not include the infected values,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but frequently it does.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Even if it does not, it immediately helps you understand

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how the failure came to be.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The basic idea is as follows:

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If we can change any of these variables

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
such that the failure no longer occurs,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then we have found a failure cause.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How should we change a variable?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
After all, variables can take arbitrary values.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The rule is not to make them use arbitrary values

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but to use values from a successful run.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That is, during execution we change variables

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from the values found in the failing run

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to values found in a successful run.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If we can change a variable value such that the failure goes away,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we do have a failure cause.
