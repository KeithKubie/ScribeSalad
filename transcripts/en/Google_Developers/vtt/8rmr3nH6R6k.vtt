Hi.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.110
When you clicked on this
video, were you asking yourself

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.430
why app promotion even matters?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.830
My name is Belinda
Langner, and I'm here

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.930
to help you answer
that question.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.940
Let's start off by looking at
what your users are seeing.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.550
Let's take a look
in Google Play.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.560
The app universe is
enormous, and users are

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.940
surrounded by so many options.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.990
There are over 1.5 million
apps in Google Play, all

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.190
fighting for the
attention of users.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.220
One of the most effective
ways to get users' attention

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.760
is by running app promotion
to help your apps stand out

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.340
and reach the right
user at the right time.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.080
Not to mention
that it also helps

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.080
organic discovery
in the long run

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.730
by growing your
overall user base.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.420
So how can AdWords help
you promote your app

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.560
and make it a champ?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.850
App Install ads
help you reach users

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.560
where they're spending
time across their devices,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.260
no matter what they're
doing, like when

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.660
they're in other apps.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.570
There are over 650,000
apps in the AdMob network

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.840
that help you reach your
desired audience when

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.590
they're using other apps.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.540
Or they may be casually
browsing the web,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
reading up on today's
news, or researching where

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.650
to go for their next vacation.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.720
Now you can reach users on
millions of sites, news pages,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.120
and blogs across the Google
Display Network, which

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.740
reaches 90% of internet
users worldwide, and includes

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.020
more than two million
publisher sites.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.660
And let's not forget about those
addicting videos on YouTube.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.890
With over one billion
active monthly users,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.330
YouTube provides
another rich source

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.620
of quality potential
users for your app.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.670
You also want to be there
when they're actively

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.960
searching for apps like yours.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.060
There are high intent
users searching for apps,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.880
or solutions that
your app helps solve.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.640
And they're just a step
away from installing.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.160
Help them find and
install your app

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160
by being there on Google search,
and soon, right in Google Play.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.729
We are introducing
a new campaign type

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.580
that helps make your campaign
set up and management

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.420
simpler than ever.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.130
And we're calling it
Universal App Campaigns.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.440
Even better, you can
set everything up

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.560
straight from the Play Developer
Console in three steps.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.400
Step one, tell us
about your app.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.490
Step two, tell us
about your audience.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.120
And step three, tell us about
your budget and performance

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.320
goals.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.610
And that's it.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.640
From this information,
Universal App Campaigns

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.530
will create ads for you in
a variety of great formats

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.970
and optimize bids to
help you get the most app

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.810
installs for your budget.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.760
The user journey doesn't
end after the install,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.930
and neither should
your app promotion.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.040
Just taking my own
phone as an example,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.190
you can see how many
apps I've installed.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.730
And I definitely don't
use them all every day.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050
In fact, 95% of
apps are abandoned

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.280
after the first month,
and 25% of installed apps

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.450
are never used at all.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.760
So it's important to not only
drive that first install,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.130
but to continue reengaging your
users to keep them coming back

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.930
to your app.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.940
Use Remarketing to remind them
of new features or content.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.990
And when you're giving
them these reminders,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.890
use deep links to point
users to specific places

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.480
within your app that will be the
most interesting and relevant

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.540
to them.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.930
This gives them a way
better experience,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.390
compared to just sending them
to the home page of your app.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.380
Deep links aren't just great
for creating customized ads

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.610
for your users.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.770
App Indexing is now also used
as a ranking signal on Android

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.240
to help provide users with
the most relevant and specific

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.550
search results possible.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.860
Growing and keeping
users on your app

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.020
is just as important
as developing it.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.660
App promotion and AdWords
can help you elevate it

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.400
from an unknown to a contender
in the very crowded app

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.030
marketplace.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.410
Go ahead and set up your
first campaign today,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.930
and learn more about AdWords
by visiting the Help Center.
