00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.320
In this session,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.240
we're going to open up a new way of
thinking about how code is executed.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.920
We're going to talk about functions,
a core concept in programming.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.430
Functions allow us to package code
into units of behavior that can be

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.670
executed over and over again.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.290
They're particularly useful in
enabling us to organize our code into

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.070
distinct pieces that
accomplish specific tasks.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.990
Without further ado, let's get started.
