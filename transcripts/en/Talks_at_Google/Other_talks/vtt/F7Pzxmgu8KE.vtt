00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.840
&gt;&gt;Lee-Feng: Welcome APEC Googlers and other
folks.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.800
Welcome to the first APEC Speakers at Google
event.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.410
I'm really Lee-Feng Chien, Taiwan site director.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.340
And today we are very excited and very honored
because we have a distinguished special guest,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340
Winston Fiore.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.870
Probably you know, if you read the internal
news about the recent inspiring journey you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.990
probably know some of his background.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.019
But let me recap a bit.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:47.579
Winston is a former US Marine and served in
Afghanistan and Senegal.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.559
And he's now spending a year walking 5000
miles around Southeast Asia beginning and

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.059
ending in Singapore.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.260
And Winston is about halfway on this trip
and now, and he already has been to Talen,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
Laos, Kenan, China, Hong Kong and now in Taiwan.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.109
So we're very excited that he is visiting
Taiwan.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:21.630
[applause]
And his chief purpose is going to each place

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.649
to raise money for a children's charity, with
cleft pallet.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.330
[Inaudible] And that's very impressive.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.899
He's been through a lot of efforts to raise
the money and it's very impressive.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.939
And he also would probably like to share us
his very exciting story in the trip, and also

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.229
his experience in using Google tools like
altitude and Google maps.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.079
We chatted, and he is using Google maps for
the trip and apparently and he found some

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.079
bugs.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.420
[laughter]
So let's welcome Winston.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.390
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Winston: All right thank you.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.190
I actually have my mic.
&gt;&gt;Lee: Please stand here.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.220
&gt;&gt;Winston: Great.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.860
Can everybody not here hear me?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.690
Okay, thank you, good, thumbs-up.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.459
What an honor.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.080
Hello Google.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.400
&gt;&gt;Audience: Hi
&gt;&gt;Winston: I think this is the first time

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.510
I've presented to more locations than people.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.080
[laughter]
Thank you Lee-Feng for that introduction I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.409
appreciate it.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:45.310
As Lee-Feng mentioned, I am on a 5000 mile,
8000 kilometer yearlong hike through Southeast

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.310
Asia.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.510
Through eight different countries in Southeast
Asia to raise money for the International

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.700
Children's Surgical Foundation (ICSF) which
is a charity that provides free facial reconstructive

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.870
surgeries in developing countries.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.050
So I actually started in Singapore on October
3rd.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.390
And I walked nearly to Southeast China and
then flew to Taipei a couple days ago.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.300
And then on June 1st I'll be headed down to
Kaichung.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.260
So that in a nutshell, I want to provide just
a little bit of background for some you might

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.900
be unfamiliar on the cause of cleft repair
which is primarily what this charity does.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.260
So clefts or orofacial clefts are a birth
defect in which there is an opening in the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.020
lip or the pallet, the roof of the mouth which
is caused by incomplete development during

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020
fetal formation.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.349
So it's actually one of the most common birth
defects worldwide, one or two out of every

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.599
thousand kids is born with a cleft.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.849
The good news is it can be treated and most
kids can undergo surgery within their first

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.030
18 months, which is good.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.969
As far as a cause, there is still no definitive
cause that has been outlined by researchers

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.819
but there are a number of factors believed
to lead to the formation of clefts.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.640
So you got syndromic factors meaning that
the cleft occurs as part of a syndrome.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.330
So in this slide you'll see two kids with
what's called stickler syndrome which is a

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.200
syndrome that attacks the connective tissue
in the body, mainly collagen.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.760
And so as a result of this syndrome children
are more likely to be born with clefts.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.130
You've got genetic factors, so there are a
number of genes that have been identified

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.360
by researchers that are believed to lead to
the formation of clefts.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.610
And then you've got a whole host of environmental
factors.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.860
So things such as the mother smoking during
pregnancy, use and abuse of illicit drugs,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.450
nutritional deficiencies are a big one, what
the mother is eating or not getting while

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.350
she's pregnant.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.450
Exposure to certain pesticides, these environmental
factors are believed to lead to the formation

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.890
of cleft.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.110
They come in a whole set of, range of shapes
and sizes as you can see.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.780
Ranging from some more milder occurrences
to more extreme occurrence in the last one

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.130
there where a cleft just in the soft pallet
to a cleft occurring both in the soft and

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.030
hard pallet and then bilaterally on the lips
there which is bad news.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.100
So how did I get this idea?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.830
How did I get the idea to walk 5000 miles
through a part of the world I'd never been

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.180
to before to raise money for the small cleft
charity?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.550
It actually all started in Senegal in 2007,
summer of 2007.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.880
I deployed with my Marine Corps unit at the
time to Senegal for three weeks of manual

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.820
training with the local Senegalese commandos.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.910
And Senegal's the most Western point in Africa
for some of you who are unfamiliar.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.090
That's me in my platoon, I was embedded with
the mortar platoon at the time this is a photo

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.210
of us with our Senegalese counterparts.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.600
But it was my first time in that part of the
world, I'd never been to Africa, I'd never

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.050
been to a developing country before.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.390
It was an absolutely amazing experience.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.150
All sorts of culture shock and getting to
witness all the local customs.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.940
So seeing, this would happen all the time
we get like a five minute break in training

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.950
and before we could turn around the Senegalese
commandos will be huddled up brewing this

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.140
tea, drinking it, they'd invite us over.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.790
There was even a specific sipping sound that
we were expected to make as a sign of politeness.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.750
Men holding hands in that part of the world
is a sign of friendship, but coming from Indiana

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.900
it wasn't something I was used to seeing every
day.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.421
Come mealtime all the Senegalese would huddle
around a collective dish of food and eat out

00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:50.150
of it together as opposed to individual plates
and that type of individual approach that

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.310
we have in the States.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.240
So getting to witness all of these local customs
in this local culture was a tremendous experience.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.910
And it really made me realize how little of
the world I'd seen.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.030
And how much more that I wanted to see.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.190
So I decided then and there that I wanted
to dedicate one year to traveling a part of

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.380
the world I'd never been to before.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.390
And I wanted to do so on foot so that I could
hopefully connect with locals as I had in

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.390
Senegal.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.570
That being said, it wasn't uncommon for us
to see women carrying these huge jugs of water

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.290
on their heads from water pumps that were
miles and miles away from their villages just

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.120
to bring drinking water into their homes.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.440
Kids dressed in rags digging through piles
of trash.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.530
Just really sad stuff.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.220
And so I decided that if I was gonna spend
one year walking, that I could potentially

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.060
find a good cause and potentially walk for
a cause and walk to help out in some way.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.500
But I didn't how I was going to go about doing
that.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.780
So I headed back to New York where I was living
at the time.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.310
And I started looking at different charities
and different causes out there to get a feel

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.310
of what was out there.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.490
And it wasn't long before my dad sent me a
newspaper clipping in the mail about a doctor

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.330
by the name of Jeff Williams who had been
leading a perfectly comfortable lifestyle

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.650
making very good money as a plastic surgeon
on the faculty, the medical school University

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.050
of Texas.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.960
And he began volunteering one or two weeks
out of the year with some of the larger organizations

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.060
doing medical missions, lending his services
as a plastic surgeon.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.120
And over the years he kind of became disenchanted
by the way a lot of these organizations were

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.240
run, by the way a lot of these missions he
was participating in were managed.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.149
And so he decided in 2005 that the best way
for him to continue doing his work would be

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:40.870
to found his own charity and that's what he
did, the International Children's Surgical

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.870
Foundation.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.589
So it was a complete inspiration to read this
story and to read about how this foundation

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:47.910
came to be.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.430
But what really spoke to me was the work that
they were doing.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.420
The cause of cleft repair which is not something
I knew a lot about.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.279
And so I wanted to take a couple minutes to
go over some of the complications associated

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:05.209
with clefts and talk a little bit about what
it is these kids have to live with every day.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:12.240
So one of the earliest things to occur for
a baby with a cleft are difficulties feeding.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.600
So if a child has a cleft lip, they often
can't perform a proper seal around the bottle

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.009
or around the nipple.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:22.550
And so as a result they're deprived of all
sorts of nutrients that they need to grow

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.689
and they end up losing all sorts of weight
when they should be gaining weight as a developing

00:09:27.689 --> 00:09:28.980
child.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.350
You've got hearing complications.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.199
Clefts will often affect what's called the
Eustachian tube which regulates the fluid

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:37.269
in and out of the middle ear.

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:42.649
So what happens a lot of times is these kids
will get a buildup of fluid in their ear which

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:48.029
if it isn't drained can become infected and
if that infection isn't addressed it can lead

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:49.629
to permanent hearing loss.

00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:53.949
In this slide is a three-year-old Chinese
girl who was actually adopted by a family

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:54.949
in the states.

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:59.250
When they adopted her she had a cleft which
they had repaired which is great.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:05.540
But she also had two permanently ruptured
eardrums from a dual ear infection that had

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.070
persisted for two years without treatment.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.040
And then you've got speaking complications,
obviously clefts affect the mouth and can

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.240
lead to all sorts of dental deformities.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.889
And kids have speech impediments as a result
of that.

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:23.639
And also if child with a cleft has experienced
hearing loss, they often can't hear the sound

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:29.649
their own mouths are making and have difficulty
speaking as a result of that as well.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:36.110
And then lastly, and this is hands down the
complications that spoke to me the most.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:42.950
And those are all of the social complications
associated with clefts.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:50.449
It can be hard enough for kids without a facial
deformity to make friends growing up, at school

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.449
or on the playground.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:58.009
But you can just imagine how nearly impossible
it is to have a normal social life when you're

00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:59.250
having to live with something like this.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.870
These kids are often kept from attending school,
they can't find jobs when they're older, they

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.170
can't raise a family because they're considered
undesirable.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:13.939
And what I really liked about this cause is
it's such a relatively small amount of money

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:18.019
and a short amount of time, a couple hours
of surgeon's time is all it takes to completely

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:23.000
turn these kids' lives around which really
appealed to me.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.079
So I want to talk a little bit about this
charity in particular because it's something

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:33.910
you may know, there are actually several charities
that tackle this work of cleft repair.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.690
A lot of big names out there.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.759
And so you might be wondering why I chose
to stick with a lesser-known charity.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:44.730
So I want talk about some the things ICSF
does differently that made me want to get

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.709
behind them as opposed to some of the other
charities.

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:54.570
Firstly anybody associated with ICSF does
not draw any sort of salary or compensation.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.809
All the staff, the doctors are 100% volunteer.

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:02.440
So it's an extremely lean charity with very
little overhead and I really like that.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:11.209
A lot of larger charities will spend tens
of thousands of dollars on office administrators

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:16.970
and special projects coordinators and that
type of thing, and ICSF does not do any of

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.970
that.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.310
They don't spend any money on advertising.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:26.399
A lot of organizations will spend tens of
thousands of dollars on newspaper ads, on

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.720
TV commercials which cost a lot of money.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.749
ICSF depends on word-of-mouth and what little
press they get.

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:36.559
So again I really like the lean aspect of
the charity.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.759
Their emphasis on postoperative care.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.779
This was a big one for me.

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:44.009
One of the things that Dr. Williams had noticed
when he was doing this work with other charities

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:51.460
before founding ICSF was a lot of times the
complete and utter lack of postoperative care.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.139
So what would happen is he would go on a mission,
and the day after the last surgery, the surgeons

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:58.270
that he was working with would leave.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.829
Or sometimes the day of the last surgery,
the surgeons would leave.

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:04.980
And I can't tell you how detrimental that
is for these kids who are just within that

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.870
first week following the surgery.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.910
All sorts of infections can flare-up.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.209
Pneumonia is a common side effect to the surgery.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:18.639
And so what ICFS does is they make sure to
stay on that mission for an entire week following

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:24.980
the surgery to make sure that they do those
critical postoperative checkups and address

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.189
any issues if they do occur which I really
liked.

00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:32.040
Emphasis on quality versus quantity.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.949
Some of you who might be more familiar with
clefts may have heard a cleft surgery is advertised

00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:41.939
as only taking 45 minutes of a surgeon's time.

00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:47.610
While it is possible in some cases to perform
a surgery that quickly the results are often

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.399
sub optimal.

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:56.790
In developed countries, when surgeons in developed
countries are performing surgeries they will

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.970
often spend hours on kids in developed countries.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.910
But for whatever reason when these medical
teams and these volunteer teams go to the

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.430
Third World to perform surgeries they just
rush through them a lot of times and don't

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.649
do a top-notch surgery.

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:14.209
And what I really like about ICSF is they
make sure, they don't believe that kids in

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:17.430
the developing world are any less deserving
of the top notch surgery.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:23.991
And they spend just as much time on these
kids as doctors in developed world do which

00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:26.230
I liked.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.529
Emphasis on training local doctors.

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:31.019
What happens a lot of times is medical teams
will go to a part of the world and they'll

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:35.689
do a medical mission, spend a week or two
there and then get up and leave and never

00:14:35.689 --> 00:14:37.300
ever come back.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.149
So there's absolutely no follow through.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:43.940
And they claim to be training, to emphasize
training local doctors.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.730
But when you're only somewhere for a couple
weeks and never returning, how much training

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.730
is really getting done?

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.600
So what I liked about ICSF is a return in
the same mission sites at least once a year

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.260
to ensure that continuity and training over
the years which is important.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:05.430
And then lastly ICSF tackles a lot of the
more complicated facial deformities, surgeries

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.999
for more complicated facial deformities that
other medical groups won't touch either because

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:14.269
they don't have the expertise or they don't
have the training or they don't have the time.

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.839
And I'm gonna show you a couple examples of
that.

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:24.800
This was a 26-year-old Kenyan girl, suffered
from something called orbital plexiform neurofibromatosis.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.809
She was turned down time and time again by
volunteer teams coming through Kenya because

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:34.230
they simply didn't have the expertise or the
time to tackle this surgery.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.259
So wasn't until ICSF came around and was able
to perform the surgery that her treatment

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.089
was finally able to be successful.

00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:46.970
This is a 26-year-old Pakistani man who suffered
from facial plexiform neurofibromatosis, commonly

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.139
known as elephant man syndrome.

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:54.269
Actually suffered so extensively that he attempted
to end his life on two different occasions.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:59.999
The problem in his case is that there weren't
any surgeons in Pakistan who had the training

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:02.749
to perform the surgery because it's a very
intricate surgery.

00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:06.559
And not a lot of surgeons will do it because
they don't have the know-how.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:11.829
So it wasn't until ICSF came around and performed
this seven-hour surgery that he was finally

00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:13.680
able to get a new start.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.610
This is a 19-year-old Peruvian girl who suffer
from congenital fiber lipoma.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.459
This is a particular deformity because what
happens with this is while there is obviously

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:28.839
an initial surgery that's required, there's
also a follow-up surgery that's required a

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:32.180
year later in order for the treatment to be
successful.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.929
So she was actually treated unsuccessfully
on four different occasions by various medical

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:40.440
teams coming because what would happen is
they would come, perform the initial surgery

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440
and then never return.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.639
And so it wasn't until ICSF came to Peru,
re-performed the initial surgery and was able

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:52.279
to return a year later for that critical post,
follow-up surgery that her treatment was finally

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:55.429
able to be successful.

00:16:55.429 --> 00:17:00.119
This was a three-year-old Chinese girl who
suffered from a very rare cleft called tessier

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:03.600
number four bilateral orbital ocular cleft.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.040
The problem in her case was similar to the
Pakistani man where there just weren't any

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.950
doctors in the area who had experience with
this particular cleft because it is so rare

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.560
and because it is such a lengthy surgery.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.710
So it wasn't until a nearby hospital in the
city of Nanjing contacted ICSF that they were

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.840
able to come and perform the nine-hour surgery
that was witnessed by 20 local doctors that

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.490
her surgery, that her treatment was finally
able to be successful.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.550
And then lastly burn victims.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.500
This was a six-year-old Filipino girl.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.990
Burn victims get left by the wayside time
and time again because the surgeries require

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.430
a little bit more expertise, take a little
bit longer.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.140
And this is actually a kind of dramatic case
because it's a facial surgery but a lot of

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.510
times burn victims will have extreme burns
on their limbs.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:58.081
So for example I was fortunate enough to get
to go to one of ICSF's missions that they

00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:01.970
do every August in Lima at the Children's
Hospital there.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:07.180
And there was a young boy there who had an
extreme burn on his arm and because of the

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.230
burn he actually had a web that connected
his bicep to his forearm and a second web

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.000
that connected his thumb to his wrist.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.630
And so he had very little mobility in his
arm.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.110
And so what you do is perform what's called
a Z-plasty where you rearrange the skin flaps

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.880
and all of a sudden you have mobility, the
kid can play sports and that type of thing.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.500
Unfortunately if you were to take a before
and after picture it wouldn't look any better.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:39.920
And so a lot of times burn victims just aren't
a very sexy cause and so not a lot of charities

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.040
address that and help burn victims.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.140
It's not like clefts where all of the sudden
the kid has a new face and can smile afterwards

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.070
and everybody gets that warm and fuzzy.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.270
Burn victims, it's not always so glorious
but it's no less important.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:58.130
So again ICSF make sure to treat any kid that
can be treated including burn victims, including

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.550
some of the more complicated deformities and
I really like that about this charity.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.400
That's the end of the slideshow, I do want
to go over the website a little bit.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.050
Thanks Homer.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.510
Oh questions, we'll go to that later.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.930
Joyce put together a little like, she googlefied
the entire slide.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:25.010
So this is the website, this is kind the hub
for the entire project, smiletrek.org.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.550
And can you scroll down a little bit Homer?

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:35.000
So as you can see I try to maintain a blog
with photos, [whispers] Picasa albums.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.030
[laughter]
And so if people want to keep up to date on

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:44.560
what's going on it's a good place to follow
the progress.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.820
The next tab.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.450
Okay so this is the route, oh actually scroll
down a little bit Homer, please thank you.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:56.390
So I started at Singapore, I didn't quite
make it to Fuzhou which is where I'd wanted

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.590
to because my visa had expired and the Chinese
charge $100 a day for overstaying your visa.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.190
So I flew to Taipei and I'll be heading all
the way to Kao-Chung and then down the Philippines

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.300
through Palawan.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.750
And then Malaysia, Borneo and then back to
Singapore.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:17.550
I hope to be back to Singapore no later than
late September early October.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:25.660
Oh and thanks to Google latitudes it's actually,
you can track my location in real time.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.330
So if any of you want to stalk me, you can
literally see where I am, you can zoom in

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:34.200
and actually see where I am at any given moment
cause I've got the latitudes in the GPS on

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.510
the phone.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:40.260
And so actually, my mom will like e-mail me
in the morning and zoom in and be like "I

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.510
can see the little man moving."

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.950
[laughter]
So that's nice for people who want to track

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.950
the progress.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.130
And then the last tab, I have a sponsors and
donors page.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:58.790
So if any of you maybe know somebody, either
an organization or a business.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.050
Can you scroll down a little bit Homer?

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:07.861
As you can see I give credit to my sponsors,
usually I put a little logo and the name of

00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:10.780
the company and then a little blurb about
the company.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.200
And then the logos actually link to their
website so that visitors can be linked to

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.480
the website of the sponsors.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.630
And I just want to clarify that there's a
donate page here, but if you click the donate

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.130
page you will actually be rerouted to the
charities donation page.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.370
So I don't touch any of the money it goes
directly to charity.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:37.150
As far as my personal expenses I was able
to save up enough money in Afghanistan because

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.550
I didn't have too many expenses over there.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:45.640
So I have more than enough in the bank to
sustain myself for a year in Southeast Asia.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.680
So now the slides over, but questions if any
have any questions.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:57.400
All right, thank you so much, no I'm just
joking.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.080
[laughter]
Anybody?

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:05.580
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So how many, well actually I have
two questions and one's more out of curiosity.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.440
A) how many doctors do you have in your network?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.050
And then B) does your phone last all day in
terms of battery life?

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:19.630
&gt;&gt;Winston: I have a second battery, but it
actually does.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.630
It'll make it, but the only reason it does
is because I take breaks and I charge it while

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.630
I take a break.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.920
So when I'm grabbing a bite to eat I always
find a place to plug in.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.830
And regarding the doctors ICSF,
[background noise]

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.160
The ghost of Google.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.330
[laughter]
ICSF goes on about a dozen, they do a little

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:51.060
over a dozen medical missions a year.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.030
Only about six of them, only on about six
of them do they take a team of doctors.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.190
A lot of the times it's Dr. Williams who does
it full-time.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.910
He's the only full-time doctor who partners
with the local doctors at the hospital, at

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.700
the same hospitals.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:12.610
And only when they deploy to really kind of
secluded rural areas where there aren't a

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:17.650
lot of resources, they'll bring an anesthesiologist,
a handful of doctors, a nurse.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.080
Does that answer your question?

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.450
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.450
&gt;&gt;Winston: OK.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.890
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Other locations feel free to ask
questions as well, just unmute yourselves.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.340
Anymore questions from Taipei?

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.370
&gt;&gt;Winston: This guy's riding solo.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.100
&gt;&gt;Joyce: [Laughing] Ming.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.650
Ming you have a question?

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.690
&gt;&gt;Ming: Yeah I actually do.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.420
This is great, I mean I'm impressed that you
have taken on one full year of yourself to

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.460
do this.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:57.210
My question is how have you, what sort of
PR marketing have you done other than appearing

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.210
at Google?

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.740
Have you done any sort of promotion about
this?

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.830
&gt;&gt;Winston: Don't downplay this too much, this
is a big deal.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:12.150
[laughter]
What other PR and marketing have I done?

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:18.071
I would say my Facebook page but that's such
a measly excuse for a Facebook page, it's

00:24:18.071 --> 00:24:19.150
pretty bad.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.630
Not much, not much man.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:26.790
I try to take a weeklong break and all of
the capital cities.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.570
So the route actually just connects the dots
of all the capital cities of the countries

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.110
I'm headed through for the most part.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.110
And so I try to take a weeklong rest in those
cities and that's kind of my opportunity to

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:45.390
speak at Rotary clubs or international schools
and that type of thing.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.940
Oh and whatever press I get along the way,
sometimes I get some press.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.850
But I wouldn't say marketing I haven't done
any marketing.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.350
Is he a marketing guy?

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.220
Is that why he's asking?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:06.100
&gt;&gt;Ming: No no, you should try to put on kickstarter,
I bet you'd get some money.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.590
&gt;&gt;Winston: They actually, kickstarter does
not allow fundraising for nonprofits.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.910
&gt;&gt;Audinne: Oh
&gt;&gt;Ming: Oh they don't?

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.970
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah it's only creative products.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:21.120
No they don't even, you can't, you can't even
have like a percentage of what you raise on

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.530
kickstarter go to a nonprofit.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.970
It's exclusively creative projects.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.940
&gt;&gt;Ming: I see.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.140
&gt;&gt;Male # 2: A question in Tokyo.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.140
&gt;&gt;Winston: All right.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.480
&gt;&gt;Male # 2: Tokyo, so you obviously, I missed
the beginning of how long you've been on the

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:41.450
road but I assume traveling overland by foot
across Southeast Asia you've either learned

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.200
some lessons about the people or yourself
or something else.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.550
Any interesting stories from the road?

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.790
&gt;&gt;Winston: Interesting stories.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.150
&gt;&gt;Male # 2: Lessons learned, insights.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:26:00.960
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah, the dogs in Thailand are
pretty bad.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.380
[laughter]
There's so many strays and it's the first

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.600
thing that comes to mind as something out
of the blue.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:18.990
A pack of stray dogs had run up on me on the
last day before getting into Bangkok at night.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.350
And one of them bit me and broke the skin.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:27.190
And I ended up, I had to go to get all vaccinations
and it was like set me back 300 bucks.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.220
It was bad news.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.750
So I've learned to stay away from the strays.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:39.370
And then my umbrella became like a dog repellent
stick after that.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:45.150
[laughter]
Yeah, I need to have more of these like spirit

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.120
question answers ready.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.460
These like introspective answers ready.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.860
Nothing comes to mind as far as like
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Talk about the guy in Vietnam that

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.860
you saw.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.880
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah, that was, that would definitely
be the most heartfelt thing that happened,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.460
what Joyce is bringing up.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:11.830
It was kinda like one of those moments where
all of the stars aligned where I was heading,

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.910
I was in northern Vietnam heading towards
the Chinese border.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:26.490
And all the sudden I see this guy on a scooter
right past me and he had FPN, facial plexiform

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.030
neurofibromatosis the elephant man syndrome
like in the slide I showed you.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.840
And it was a pretty severe case of it.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.890
And I knew that this was something that ICSF
tackled and that they addressed.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.440
And luckily he actually stopped at a fish
market behind me.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.680
And I'm hoping this story will charm you because
it involves Google Translate.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.120
[laughter]
I, and at that moment I realized, I put two

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.590
and two together and realized that it just
so happened that one of ICSF's annual missions

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:04.020
is at the Children's Hospital in the Haiphong
was less than 100 miles north of where I was.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.400
That I was gonna be passing through.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.880
And it was gonna be a couple months from then.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.090
So I turn around and pretend that I'm browsing
the fish market, I've got like my suit on

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:20.710
and like totally fit in.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:27.650
Then I open Google Translate on my phone and
I type in something to the extent of "Hey

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.560
would you be interested in a free surgery?"

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.870
And he was interested and we had a couple
back and forth and I relayed some more details

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.570
to him and got his information, got his phone
number.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:44.820
And made it up to Haiphong and sat down with
the doctor there that ICSF works with.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:50.140
And they were able to; he was able to show
up.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:56.020
I recently learned a couple days ago, the
mission was about a week ago that there was

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:04.520
actually a greater than usual turnout this
year so there were actually more children

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.220
than could be cared for.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.370
And children are the priority.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:14.380
ICSF actually prioritizes children first,
shame on them.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:20.770
And so they actually, his schedule, his surgery
is gonna have to be scheduled for next year's

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.770
mission.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:28.500
But ICSF already agreed to spend an additional
week at that particular mission to make sure

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.740
that they can get through all the surgeries
next year.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.730
So unfortunately he didn't get treated this
time around but he will next May.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.260
But does that answer your question?

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.260
Is he still there?

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.260
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Yeah, they're still there.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.260
&gt;&gt;Winston: Okay.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.670
&gt;&gt;Joyce: I think Singapore has a question
next.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.670
Singapore?

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.910
&gt;&gt;Celine: Hi Winston.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.030
&gt;&gt;Winston: Hi.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:51.170
&gt;&gt;Celine: This is Celine, It's nice to see
you.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.650
&gt;&gt;Winston: Hey how's it going?

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.600
&gt;&gt;Celine: It's going well, good to see you.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.750
We look forward to meeting you when you get
to Singapore.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.750
&gt;&gt;Winston: Thank you, it's Celine?

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.160
&gt;&gt;Celine: Yes.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:15.360
I have two questions, one is how involved
are you in how the money you're collecting

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.240
is being spent by the foundation?

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:23.510
I'm sure you trust their expertise but have
you given them some ideas in terms of how

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.590
you want that money to be utilized?

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.080
[Inaudible] and then spend it how they think
is fit?

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.080
&gt;&gt;Winston: Okay.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:39.290
&gt;&gt;Celine: And my second question, once you
complete this journey what are you going to

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.290
do?

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:48.220
Do you have another journey in mind [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Winston: Okay so how does the charity spend

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.750
their money and what am I gonna do after this?

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.860
So the money goes directly to the charity
so they're actually, it's not like I'm gonna

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.090
give them one big lump sum at the end and
then tell them have fun.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:06.570
It's being allocated to them every time somebody
makes a donation.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:12.590
As far as how they spend, the majority almost
all of their spending is actually on the plane

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:18.070
tickets to get on transportation to get the
doctors on the mission site.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.920
The second greatest expense are all of the
medical expenses.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:29.860
So the surgeries are 100% free to the patient's
and that means that ICSF picks up the tab

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.710
for the oxygen tanks, all of the medicine
that goes along with the surgeries.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.980
All of the stitches the sutures.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.390
The hospitals that they partner with a lot
of times will let them have the operating

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.710
room for free which is great, that's one less
expense.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:54.910
And sometimes if a patient lives kinda far
out from where the mission takes place, ICSF

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.830
will pick up the tab for their transportation
and make sure that they get there.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.650
And after that it's very little, that's really
the meat and potatoes of how they spend their

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.210
money.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:10.220
As far as where they stay, because they return
to the same mission sites and have those local

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:18.100
connections a lot of times they're put up
by, like the mission I went to in Lima he

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.240
stays with the doctors, in the home of the
doctors that he works with.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.870
So he stayed with one of the doctors that
he's been working with ever since that mission

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.550
kicked off 12 years ago.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:32.990
So he doesn't pay for a place to stay, they
drop him off at the hospital and take him

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.480
back home so there's no taxi expenses.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.770
While I was there they fed us, so they would
bring us food.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.310
So he didn't spend any money on food.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.670
Like in the Philippines for example they've
hooked up with a local Rotarian who owns a

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.490
hotel there.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:53.320
So he's put up by Rotarians when he goes there.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.240
So it's only in a few cases that he actually
has to spend money on a place to stay.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:05.960
And as far as the overhead at home, it's literally,
the office is literally like the basement

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.870
of the Idaho home in Boise Idaho.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:14.940
His mother is retired who's doing all of the
secretarial work and responsibilities and

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.940
stuff.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:21.360
So literally there's only two full-time employees,
him and his mother at home.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.730
And then there's one full-time nurse coordinator
in the Philippines because they have more

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.360
missions in the Philippines and anywhere else.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.770
About three or four every year.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.610
So they have one full-time coordinator there
who also volunteers for free.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:38.610
Does that, does that answer your first question?

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.610
Celine?

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:45.020
&gt;&gt;Celine: Yes it does thank you.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.850
&gt;&gt;Winston: Okay.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:52.850
In regards to your second question, I have
recently become incredibly inspired by the

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.040
urban farming movement.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.450
Totally under the spell of urban farming these
days.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.130
And I'd like to explore that as much is possible
when I get back.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.580
I want to learn as much about urban agriculture
as possible.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:13.950
So urban farming is the practice of using
untraditional spaces to grow food.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:18.929
So like growing food on your rooftop which
is a space that would otherwise go to waste.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:22.149
But which is a great space to grow food a
lot of times.

00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:24.889
Farming fish in your basement.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:25.889
That type of thing.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:29.440
And so using all this space that is not going
to use to grow food.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.119
And the more I research it the more inspired
I am.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:37.069
It's absolutely incredible how much food you
grow in such a compact area if you're doing

00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:38.069
it right.

00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:42.659
And it's all about high efficient yields and
hydroponics and it's a very interesting to

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.159
me.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.139
So I hope to learn as much about that as possible
and I hope to make that the next chapter of

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.139
my life.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.480
Definitely not gonna be doing any walking
after this anytime soon.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.529
[laughter]
Any other questions?

00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:55.539
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Show us your backpack.

00:34:55.539 --> 00:35:01.079
&gt;&gt;Winston: Oh yeah I forgot about the rig.

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:05.799
So this is my home.

00:35:05.799 --> 00:35:11.349
It has been since I kicked off in October.

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:12.349
So I have everything I need here.

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:21.180
I have my tent which weighs about 2 pounds.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:27.559
An inflatable sleeping mattress, sleeping
bag I can carry up to 4 liters of water and

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:30.569
then some miscellaneous electronics.

00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:35.869
And I actually carry a Mac Book air in the
back.

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:44.430
[laughter]
And this is it, it's really basic.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:49.069
Because I'm not trekking in the middle of
nowhere and I'm on main roads, I can pick

00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:50.950
up food along the way.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:56.250
Finding a place to eat has not been a problem
so far.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.170
And so it's able to be a pretty lean set up.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.060
It weighs about 20 pounds.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.319
&gt;&gt;Male # 3: So I have a quick question here
from Sydney.

00:36:05.319 --> 00:36:06.319
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah.

00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:08.569
&gt;&gt;Male # 3: So I'm walking to work once in
a while, and that's about 3 km.

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:15.369
It takes me like 20 minutes and I get kinda
bored along the way once in a while.

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.700
So I'm curious how do you keep yourself avoiding
this?

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.450
How do you save this?

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.020
What do you do on a bad day?

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.700
Do you sing or do listen to your iPod or what
you do to stay with it?

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.980
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah it's not singing, it's the
iPod.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:34.049
[laughter]
Yeah I listen to; I need to get some new music

00:36:34.049 --> 00:36:35.049
actually.

00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:37.390
Because I've been listening to the same songs
for a while now.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:44.220
I listen to music, I listen to various podcasts
and talks and interviews and that type of

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.790
thing to kinda keep myself from going crazy.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.350
And yeah that's it.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.150
&gt;&gt;Male # 3: Do you have days where you feel
like you want to throw it all away or you

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.150
feel like you just want it to end?

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:02.220
&gt;&gt;Winston: Well you know the nice thing about,
no it hasn't reached that point.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:10.849
I mean if there is a day where I'm just excessively
exhausted or something then I can just rest

00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:14.380
for a day and then start the next day.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:19.059
So it's not, know that hasn't been any major
incident that just makes me want to drop pack

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:20.059
and get on a plane.

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:24.119
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male # 3: Apart from the dogs in Thailand.

00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:27.630
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah those dogs.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.140
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male # 3: Thanks.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.650
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Any more questions?

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.650
Yeah.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:42.339
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: You seem to be spending nights
camping, having your own little house to set

00:37:42.339 --> 00:37:43.339
up and sleep.

00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:45.369
And you're obviously not in the wilderness.

00:37:45.369 --> 00:37:49.990
Most of Southeast Asia is extremely populated,
morning, evening, nightly there's always somebody

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.410
walking by.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.950
How do you manage that?

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:58.420
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah, that's definitely an understatement,
this places that are very populated.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.770
How do I manage so many people?

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.770
Is that your question?

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.770
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: Yeah.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.700
When you're sleeping, obviously it's not like
there's a campground.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:10.309
It's not like it's protected, all that kind
of stuff.

00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:19.289
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah, it can, well I've been, I
did a lot of camping in Malaysia for the first

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:27.420
part of the trip because guesthouses and hotels
were still kind of too pricey.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.569
And then once I got into Thailand, guesthouses
started to be like you know 10 bucks or less

00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:33.800
a night.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.569
And for that amount of money it's not worth
not staying in a guesthouse.

00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:41.280
Like you've got air conditioning so your socks
can dry.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.940
You've got, you can take a shower.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.859
The list goes on of the advantages of not
camping.

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:55.650
So, but when I do camp I try to find a more
secluded spot where dogs aren't barking or

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.150
roosters aren't crowing.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:02.420
Or like I remember in Malaysia it's impossible,
it's physically impossible to be anywhere

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.020
where you're not within earshot of a mosque.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.089
And so like 5:30 in the morning you get woken
up by the prayers.

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:13.779
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: So have you considered staying
with people?

00:39:13.779 --> 00:39:19.650
I mean have you are welcome to stay at my
place if you happen to go by.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.630
&gt;&gt;Winston: Thanks man, where's this?

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.819
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: India.

00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:23.819
&gt;&gt;Winston: India.

00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:29.940
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: However there are sites like couch
surfing etc. where you can just stay with

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.859
a local who's willing to invite you.

00:39:31.859 --> 00:39:35.020
That could also be a good way to immerse yourself
in the local culture and be able to make a

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.380
bigger impact.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:42.670
&gt;&gt;Winston: Couch surfing huh?

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.190
I actually, I'm a coucher for myself.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:51.359
I brought my couch surfing host here today
for the presentation.

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:56.160
Her mother and herself have been very generous
in hosting me, putting me up for the week.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:02.660
And I try to couch surf, couch surfing is
more for like when I'm in a pause somewhere

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.119
in a big city for a week or so.

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:09.799
It's a little tougher to coordinate any other
time just because I'm never quite sure when

00:40:09.799 --> 00:40:12.420
I'm gonna arrive somewhere.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.630
When traveling on foot.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.160
But couch surfing has been an amazing resource.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.819
I mean it's obviously great to have a free
place to stay.

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:27.400
But just to have somebody who can tell you
okay this is a tourist trap, this neighborhood

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.809
stay away from this neighborhood.

00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:32.319
Maybe it's dangerous or something.

00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:36.460
And make recommendations and a great way to
meet people and just make friends.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.220
So yeah I'm a huge proponent of couch surfing.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.240
So can I couch surf your place in India?

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.670
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: For sure.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.940
And Hyderabad is a big city.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.249
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yah.

00:40:47.249 --> 00:40:48.559
Thank you.

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:55.109
&gt;&gt;Male # 5: So one question here, how does
the organization check for doctors to join

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:56.109
the group?

00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:57.799
Is there any doctor from Taiwan?

00:40:57.799 --> 00:40:58.799
&gt;&gt;Winston: Good question.

00:40:58.799 --> 00:41:07.329
&gt;&gt;Male # 5: And the second one is actually
Google has trip credit it can donate, so if

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:14.539
you can contact with someone inside Google
who can make that happen we can probably donate

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:16.440
lots of trip credit.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:21.789
&gt;&gt;Winston: Well this would be the place to
do that.

00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:26.460
If you're able to find somebody at Google
somewhere who can help you, you should jump

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.460
on that.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.000
&gt;&gt;Joyce: So if I can just jump in, so Google
has set up gift matching.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.400
So if you donate on Winston's website you
can just basically tell Google how much money

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.599
you've donated and Google will match whatever
you given already to ICFS.

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:45.980
But you might be seeing something from Google,
if Googlers individually decide to give reporting

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.990
on gift matching.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.299
Oh that's great news, that awesome.

00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:55.490
So to answer your question, I'm not sure.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.259
I know they don't have any missions in Taiwan.

00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:06.410
And I don't think any of the doctors that
ICSF partners with happen to the Taiwanese.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.920
But I'm not 100% sure on that.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.119
I can ask and get back to you.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:13.900
And then I think you had a follow-up question.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.220
I was just about the trip.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:21.499
&gt;&gt;Male # 5: Actually trip credit is a different
thing is sort gift matching.

00:42:21.499 --> 00:42:25.599
So I'm not sure who can help on that.

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:28.650
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah I wish I knew somebody.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.900
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Any more questions?

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.950
&gt;&gt;Male # 6: Yeah we have a question in Tokyo.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:36.950
Hello.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:37.950
&gt;&gt;Winston: Hello.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:43.549
&gt;&gt;Male # 6: I'm just trying to picture how
big the problem is.

00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:51.569
Like how many people when you get to see while
you're traveling with that problem?

00:42:51.569 --> 00:43:00.859
What I'm trying to say is if you just can
met with the people with that problem in the

00:43:00.859 --> 00:43:09.769
random level, I think it's a very big problem
that should be solved on the macro level.

00:43:09.769 --> 00:43:15.900
That's what I'm thinking.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.900
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah absolutely.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.520
Luckily I did not see, or I don't know if
it's luckily or not.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:27.470
I did not see a child with a cleft until Hanoi
Vietnam.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:34.319
And that was because I was visiting a local
charity there, a Vietnamese medical organization

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:39.910
that provides cleft surgeries for local Vietnamese
kids.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:43.671
And I got a tour of their organization and
there happened to be some kids there who were

00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:47.289
waiting for surgery by who I got to meet.

00:43:47.289 --> 00:43:51.690
Other than that I haven't seen any really
just out and about.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:57.299
I've seen a couple who had had clefts that
you could see there was some scarring so they

00:43:57.299 --> 00:44:00.489
had clefts that have been repaired which is
great.

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:04.180
But I didn't see too many out and about or
I haven't so far.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:10.280
I don't know if that's a good thing or maybe,
maybe they're not anxious to go out and be

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.280
seen the public.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.069
You know who knows.

00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:18.420
But that's been my experience with kids with
class so far in this region.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.780
&gt;&gt;Male # 6: Okay thank you.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.339
&gt;&gt;Winston: Thank you.

00:44:25.339 --> 00:44:27.329
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Any more questions?

00:44:27.329 --> 00:44:31.480
&gt;&gt;Female # 1: You said that there are more
kids with cleft palates in Southeast Asia

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.490
and there are in other areas.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.210
&gt;&gt;Winston: Yeah that brings me to something
I hadn't mentioned.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:42.039
The reason I chose to focus the trek in Southeast
Asia was primarily because I've never been

00:44:42.039 --> 00:44:44.740
in this part of the world before.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:51.140
And also believe it or not they're actually
slightly more occurrences of cleft births

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.359
in this region than other parts of the world
for whatever reason.

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.839
So that's why I wanted to kind of focus things
in Southeast Asia.

00:44:58.839 --> 00:45:01.730
Philippines are actually pretty bad.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:07.440
I think it's like one out of every 600 or
something like that, 6 to 800.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:12.369
And it just so happens that ICSF has a medical
mission that's going on there in July and

00:45:12.369 --> 00:45:14.160
It's going to coincide with me passing through.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.999
So I'm gonna be able to get to visit the medical
mission and hang out there for a couple weeks

00:45:18.999 --> 00:45:21.740
and get to meet some of the families firsthand.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:26.550
Which should be pretty cool, I'll take lots
of pictures.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.730
All right.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.690
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Anyone else have questions?

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.460
Any other offices?

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.640
If not…

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.599
&gt;&gt;Winston: Get some fried chicken.

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:38.499
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Joyce: Thanks so much Winston.

00:45:38.499 --> 00:45:39.910
&gt;&gt;Winston: Thank you, thank you very much.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.109
[applause]
