00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.070
The correct answers are number one and number three.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.540
Using a principle component analysis,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.640
we could probably find the features that are more important that others.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.980
We could also scale the features such that the numerical values of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.600
the variations they have are similar.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.250
And thus, it is easier for the model to make a distinction.
