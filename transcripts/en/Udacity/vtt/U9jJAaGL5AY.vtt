00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.540
Now the ABO enzyme that can modify carbohydrates

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.570
on the surface of red blood cells is coded

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.120
in your genome, and it's just one example

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.730
of hundreds of thousands of different proteins in your

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.650
body that perform a specific function. After all,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.080
proteins make the cell go round. For example, your

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.820
genome also codes for the enzyme lactase, which

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.090
is another protein that allows all infants to metabolize

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.990
milk from the mother. But over time, some people lose the expression of this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.430
enzyme, or protein, and they can become

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.030
lactose intolerant. We'll learn more about that in

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.990
lesson four. Your genome also codes for

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.010
the enzyme tyrosinase. Which is a protein

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.220
that's the rate limiting for producing melanin,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.500
the main pigment for skin pigmentation. Without tyrosinase,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.910
an individual could present with albinism, because there

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.430
would be a lack of pigment in the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.170
skin, hair, and eyes. We'll learn more about

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.990
this trait in lesson six. Your genum also

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.990
codes for protein called FGFR3 or fiberblast growth

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.500
factor receptor 3. Which can regulate bone growth

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.620
and controls the trait of achondroplasia, one of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.560
the most common forms of dwarfism. An overactive version

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.350
of this protein, significantly reduces bone growth and results in dwarfism. And

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.010
as a last example, your genome also codes for a protein called BRCA1, or Breast

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.900
Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene, which

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.450
repairs broken DNA strands. A non-functional version

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.850
of this protein significantly increases the risk

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.620
of breast cancer. Now, these are just

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.610
examples of different enzymes or proteins. We use the words interchangeably.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.680
And the work of your genome is to have a cell

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.430
that uses its code to make all of these different proteins

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.720
or enzymes or products necessary to build your body and your traits.
