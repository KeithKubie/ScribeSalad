00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.040
RACHEL BEEN: I'd like to
introduce our panelists.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.780
To begin with, we
have Mark Kawano.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.030
Mark is the CEO and
co-founder of Storehouse,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.880
maker of the visual
storytelling app

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.000
that's won Apple's
2014 design awards.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630
Previously, Kawano
held design leadership

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.600
at frog, Adobe, and
most recently, Apple

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.720
where he served as User
Experience Evangelist

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.170
and was responsible
for designing

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.830
apps such as
Aperture and iPhoto.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.640
Next up is Tyson Evans.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.390
Tyson is an editor on
the newsroom strategy

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.240
team at the New York Times.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.020
Previously, he was
the deputy editor

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.420
of The Times
interactive news desk,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.910
working with a
team of developers

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.220
to build data-driven
web apps on deadline.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.510
He is also an adjunct professor
at Columbia University's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.600
Graduate School of Journalism.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.160
Next up is Dustin Senos.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.570
Dustin currently works at
Medium as the Head of Design.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.090
He's passionate about creating
rewarding interactions

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.300
between humans and technology
through prototyping, quick

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.630
iterations, and
empathizing with users.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.120
Mike Renaud is the Creative
Director for Pitchfork.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.790
He lead a team that designs
the website in addition

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.650
to their two festivals
in Paris and Chicago,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.440
their venture into film
called The Dissolve,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
and most recently, a
quarterly print publication,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.280
The Pitchfork Review.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240
These endeavors have
received many Webby awards,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.970
the 2013 National Magazine
award for digital excellence,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.600
and a spot for Michael on
Ad Age's Creativity 50 list.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.000
And last but not least,
we have Maykel Loomans.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.810
He's a product
designer at Facebook.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
Previously, Michael was at
Instagram for three years.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.700
His work ranges from
design, to prototyping,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.250
to actually writing
code that ships.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.140
Originally hailing
from the Netherlands,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.930
he now lives in
San Francisco where

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.300
he enjoys exploring and
photographing the city

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.170
and beyond.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.330
So with that, let's get into it.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.980
So, visual storytelling.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.580
Extremely buzzy words.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.120
Let's define it.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.780
First off, how do
you individually

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230
define visual storytelling
for the specific products

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.590
that you work on?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080
And really, why
are your products

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.750
visual storytelling products?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.910
Let's start with Maykel.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.860
MAYKEL LOOMANS: I think
visual storytelling

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.380
is the nonverbal way to enhance
whatever text is around it.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.240
And with Instagram, like
Instagram is inherently

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.330
a communication product.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.290
But the medium that we
use is square photos.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.650
And this really just
enhances that the photo

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.480
is the key element that captures
you, but the text around it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.840
is actually like the
context of that photo.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.270
So the visual aspect just
enhances the platform.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.830
And by being visual first,
that works really well.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.080
MICHAEL RENAUD: Yeah, you're
right, it's a buzzy word.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.871
I'm not sure exactly
how to define that now

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:55.660
because there's always
been visual storytelling.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.317
So, I think for us, we actually
look to the past a lot more

00:02:58.317 --> 00:02:59.900
than we do to the
future in some ways.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.441
It's really nice to
have technologies

00:03:01.441 --> 00:03:04.795
where we can use big photos
and lots of illustrations

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:05.420
and everything.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.757
But when it comes down to
it, it's just an opportunity

00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:09.590
now to be able to tell
those kind of stories

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.310
on the web the way we have
been in a lot of other mediums

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.854
in the past.

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:15.180
RACHEL BEEN: Great.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.930
DUSTIN SENOS: For us
at Medium, we kind of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.440
look at visual
storytelling as a way

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.410
of letting people share
their thoughts and ideas

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.330
and building tools in a platform
for letting them take advantage

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.360
of modern technology.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.070
With video embeds,
pictures, modern typefaces.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.690
And putting a lot of weight on
presentation of the content.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.440
TYSON EVANS: And I
would say at the Times,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.920
it's just an aspect of our
larger journalistic mission.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.580
So the idea of
visualizing the news

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.680
is baked into something
that's inherently visual,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.690
like a huge narrative story,
like Snow Fall or something.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.890
But also a part of things that
are less obviously visual.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.040
So, a push alert or
election results tonight.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.680
Like, what is the story
of these other types

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.870
of ways of conveying the news?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.370
MARK KAWANO: Pretty
good definitions

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.670
of visual storytelling.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.360
At Storehouse, it's
pretty similar.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.720
It's just how to communicate
a lot of information

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.450
using images.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.130
So photos, videos, graphics.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.220
Whether it's something
of where you are,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.620
what you're seeing using
those types of media

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.910
rather than just text
or words to communicate

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.659
that information.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.450
RACHEL BEEN: Great.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.699
I want to take a moment just
to click through and also

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.180
showcase some of the products
that you guys specifically

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.150
are working on.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.870
Storehouse, for Mark.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.480
New York Times cross platform.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.970
Medium for Dustin.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.390
Mike on the Pitchfork Review
among multiple other products.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.420
And Instagram.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.320
So to talk a little more about
quality, curation, social,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.280
these kind of aspects
of visual storytelling.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.925
Is really good design on a lot
of these products-- which you

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.990
all work on very well,
designed platforms--

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.700
potentially hiding bad content?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.560
Dustin, I want to
start with you.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.620
Medium is a beautifully
designed platform.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.070
Do you think it's making
bad content inconspicuous

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.397
to some degree?

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:24.480
DUSTIN SENOS: We talk about
that a lot internally.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.899
And our take is
what is bad content?

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:29.940
Just because I don't
particularly enjoy something

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.440
that someone has written
doesn't mean it's bad.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.160
We try to not
choose what is good.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.100
We try to not
design in a way that

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.210
makes bad content look good.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.920
Because if you want
to tell a story,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.340
or want to share an idea,
we don't want the interface

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.420
to try to push you in
one direction or bait

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.310
and switch you.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.849
Like, oh this story
looks fantastic

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.390
but the content is
actually horrible.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.580
We don't have an
opinion on that.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.960
We try to be agnostic to
the actual content being

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.550
made on our platform.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.130
So we just try to elevate
the content that you create

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.072
and just try to put our
design chops toward something

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:10.030
that people otherwise
couldn't do on their own.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.320
And as far as what's
actually the type of content,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.360
we try not to say
what's good or bad.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.021
MICHAEL RENAUD: Yeah, I mean,
it's obviously a trendy term,

00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:20.520
again.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.700
But I think that design has
gotten in the way a lot.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.810
Even if the story's
bad, I think the fact

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.670
that people are trying to kind
of go down this road a lot,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.211
it's sort of gotten in the way
of what you're trying to read.

00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.060
It's distracting
in a lot of ways.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.220
So, I think it's
important for all of us

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.178
to sort of keep that in
mind and keep ourselves

00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:39.520
in check in terms of trying to
get too far ahead of ourselves.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.660
And I don't know,
designers a lot of times

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.120
have a tendency to
want to show themselves

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.762
off more than the content.

00:06:45.762 --> 00:06:47.220
So I think that
could be a problem.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.636
But the reason we
started doing it

00:06:48.636 --> 00:06:50.110
the first place
was because we're

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.030
doing these huge features.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.154
We're spending a lot of
money on sending people out

00:06:53.154 --> 00:06:55.560
to do interviews and we're
really proud of how we did.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.317
And then they'd be
gone in three days.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.900
They'd be down on
the homepage, people

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.191
would stop tweeting about them.

00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:02.610
And it was kind of
frustrating for us.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.464
So on our end, we kind of
wanted to bring more attention

00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:08.130
to these things, just
because we thought

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.620
they were more impactful than
just the regular old thing.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.730
RACHEL BEEN: Even this concept
of not even hiding bad content,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.660
but potentially a fine line
between superfluous design

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.660
in more bigger experiences
such as the Pitchfork

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.791
cover stories or even the
New York Times Snow Fall.

00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:27.290
There's been obviously
a lot of talk

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.930
about the design, the code,
the implementation potentially

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.810
covering up or not
allowing people

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.425
to actually read the content.

00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:35.800
Tyson, I don't
know if you'd want

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.466
to address this concept of maybe
that's part of the storytelling

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:40.350
experience at this point.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.010
TYSON EVANS: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.280
there's a couple of
things at work there.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.180
First, I think we all have
faced the same challenge of,

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.360
what signals can we
convey to readers to say

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.670
that this is worth
your attention?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.420
And then it's this
kind of constant battle

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.750
to keep their attention
throughout that process.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.390
Whether it's a narrative
story, an interactive story,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.990
a reader-driven story, we
all face the same challenge

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.630
of what levers are we going
to pull that both signal right

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.260
off the bat that this is
something to invest your time

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.960
and energy into.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.260
But also, maybe
participate with.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.650
That's that second piece of a
lot of our projects right now.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.520
Just saying, here's a
front door that tells you

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.940
a story that's something
worth your attention.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.410
But take the last Sunday
magazine of the Times

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.650
every year, it's this
beautiful tribute to the lives

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.680
that we lost over the year.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.059
Beautiful obituaries, beautiful
photos, beautiful remembrances.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.775
And we use that as a
kind of an open door

00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:39.900
to ask people to share
their memories back with us.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.099
And we present those
back at the same stage

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.640
with the same level of editing,
and care, and thoughtfulness,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.130
and photo editing,
and written editing.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.670
So, I think it ends up kind of
being this two-way street where

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.780
you're trying to create
enough signals up front.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.620
But also create
these opportunities

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.461
for the unexpected to happen.

00:08:58.461 --> 00:08:59.960
MARK KAWANO: Yeah,
I think it starts

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.720
with defining what design is.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.530
I think there's
two aspects of it.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.165
There's the visual side
and some of the animations

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:08.220
that we're starting to
see in modern software.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.560
But then there's also the
design of how something works.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.570
And what we've tried to really
strive for at Storehouse

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.980
is the content is what
you're looking at.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.160
We've tried to remove almost
all chrome from our interface

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.360
and really just putting
that content on display.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.310
And that's the
design that we see.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.820
Even the typefaces
that we've chosen,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.620
we've to be as neutral as
possible so that the photos

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.590
and videos and whatever
the actual author's

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:41.780
trying to convey, that's
the actual visual design

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.380
or visual aesthetic
aspect of it.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.085
And so our design actually
goes into the background.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:50.230
And I think that finding that
balance of how the system works

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.500
versus what it looks
like and how it feels

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.081
is just important for all
designers to consider.

00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.330
RACHEL BEEN: That actually
leads into my next question

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.940
about the democratization
of the design

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.870
to allow both professional
and social content to live.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.700
This panel is somewhat
divided in more

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.840
of professional,
traditional journalism

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.390
with user-generated content
and social journalism.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.710
That dichotomy between
social and professional,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.170
is that something that we
need to define as a dichotomy?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.199
Are those things overlapping
and intermixing at this point?

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:24.782
Tyson, do you want to talk about
that specifically for the New

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:25.950
York Times?

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.350
TYSON EVANS: Yeah,
it's totally shifting.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.600
Today, versus six
years ago at the Times,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.110
users are way more woven into
the fabric of the report.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.420
Our value as a
brand is very much

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.880
our editing and our judgment
and our ordering of the world.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.550
But we're finding that
readers are obviously

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.540
kind of front line
in that system.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.915
So, you take something
like this huge series

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:51.290
we've done for the last year
about the cost of healthcare

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.600
in the U.S. How
medical procedures here

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.589
can be exponentially larger in
cost and time and complications

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:58.880
than they are around the world.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.070
And that's a series
that was almost entirely

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.370
driven by reader sourcing.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.050
So, readers sharing
their stories

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.300
in a really structured way.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.280
So, that was a design
challenge in the sense

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.010
that you don't want
just an empty text

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.680
box at the bottom of an article.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.500
Throughout the story
we wove in prompts

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.030
to say, how old are you?

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.650
Are you insured?

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.850
Have you had a pregnancy?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.920
What was the cost
of your pregnancy?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.840
Where do you live?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.310
And so you have this really rich
way of dividing and filtering

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.260
the comments on
a story that one,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.140
make it a reading
experience for someone else

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.330
to find their story in the
cacophony of other stories.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.890
But also, let the
reporter then use

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.890
that as the foundation for
their next piece of the series.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.200
RACHEL BEEN: And Maykel,
for a product like Instagram

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.690
it's interesting because
you do you have obviously

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.030
an incredible social presence.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.070
That's kind of the primary
focus of what Instagram is.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.278
But you also are seeing
professional photojournalists

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:54.210
and photographers
using that platform

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.154
for money-making means.

00:11:56.154 --> 00:11:57.820
In terms of the design
of that platform,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.010
was there ever a
consideration-- I

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.551
guess this goes for
all the panelists

00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:03.620
who alter some of the
design, some of the tools,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.820
the content management systems,
to prioritize professionals

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.499
over more social journalists
or amateurs, to some extent.

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:11.790
MAYKEL LOOMANS: Yeah, I think
one of the most important

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.200
things that Instagram
as a product did

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.350
was just democratize how ever
your photo looked for anyone.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.630
So businesses, professionals,
budding photographers,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.610
they all look the same.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.360
They all have the same
tools to work with.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.350
And the freedom of the product
allowed them to actually

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.290
either become a
professional photographer,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.960
or tell their story.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.500
Contrary to a
Storehouse, Instagram

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.650
is like a one photo
platform right now.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.870
And it's actually
the body of work

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.552
that tells more of the story.

00:12:45.552 --> 00:12:47.760
Or it's a combination of
photos from different people

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.620
in the same location
that tell a story.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.275
Just by the simplicity
of the product,

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.802
we kind of leave it at
the level playing field

00:12:56.802 --> 00:12:58.760
and everyone gets to do
with it what they want.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.310
So as I said before, we have the
professional photographers now

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.900
that started as amateurs
or just enthusiasts.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.540
And they now have a
platform and a voice

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.830
that businesses and companies
are trying to chime in on.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.470
Large companies like
Ford and other companies

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.100
are just trying to chime
in on their user base

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.531
and their presence
and their voice.

00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:23.780
RACHEL BEEN: And we were
talking about this on Medium.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.460
Now you have President
Obama writing on Medium.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.740
Do you specialize tools
for him or allow him

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.280
a greater particular
presence because

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.450
of the nature of who he is?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.360
And from a design
perspective, how do you

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.480
balance those two things?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.230
DUSTIN SENOS: So at Medium,
we have internal publications

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.230
and we work with people like
President Obama and the White

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.730
House.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.320
And we kind of use them to help
us as designers in the company

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.400
learn how a publication would
actually want to use the tools.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.010
And we'll absolutely internally
build tools for publications

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.802
and then take pieces that are
working and learn from that

00:13:58.802 --> 00:14:00.760
and then build it into
the rest of the platform

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.440
for other people.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.606
So we're actually using it
as a learning opportunity

00:14:03.606 --> 00:14:08.020
to see how a typical newsroom
or a typical book agency

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.270
would actually want the tools.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.850
And then build that,
take pieces from that.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.350
And we actually question
that a lot because we wonder

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.510
if the tools people
are asking for

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.574
are tools that
they're used to using,

00:14:21.574 --> 00:14:22.990
but it's not
actually the best way

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.950
to publish content and actually
go through the editing process.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.289
So along the whole
path, we're not saying,

00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:30.580
oh that's what you've been
using for the last 15 years?

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.820
We'll build the same
thing in Medium.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.410
We're questioning and trying
to iterate all that ourselves.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.430
And it gives us a good
chance-- I've never

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.152
worked at a news
agency, I've never

00:14:38.152 --> 00:14:40.110
written a book-- it gives
us a good opportunity

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.250
to learn what people expect
and how we can help them.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.964
RACHEL BEEN: Do you have
something to add, Mike?

00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:49.380
MICHAEL RENAUD: I guess the
only thing that comes to mind,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.420
we don't offer that obviously.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.850
But if we're talking about as
designers imposing limitations

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.300
on things so these types
of things come out better,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.980
I think limitations
is a good thing

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.121
to keep in mind for everything.

00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:03.870
And we're gatekeepers
of that, in a sense.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.000
So, to use native
advertising as an example.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.940
It's great that brands
can tell a story.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.490
But at the same time, I think
that's a slippery slope,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.220
personally.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.990
And letting everyone in
on that, in a certain way,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.480
there are other problems
that can come up

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.580
with that on the editorial level
that worry me a little bit.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.220
And I think that's nothing
we can look at our ad people

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.444
about and expect
them to help us with.

00:15:31.444 --> 00:15:33.110
And I think the same
goes for editorial.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.220
They may not be as prone to
understanding that inclusion.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.700
So I think as designers,
imposing limitations

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.380
on the outside,
if you're working

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.400
for an editorial entity,
is a responsibility of ours

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.570
for sure.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.611
MAYKEL LOOMANS: That
actually ties into Instagram

00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:54.050
where an ad is only the same
visual presence except that it

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.160
has a sponsored icon
on the top right.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.120
And by just giving them the
same tools to play with,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.240
if the person who uses the
app just scrolls through it,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.990
it doesn't necessarily make
them go, oh shit, an ad!

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.230
So, by making sure that
the content is great

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.860
and that it fits
in on their feed,

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.950
that's how we have a good ad.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.350
The whole purpose here is
to enhance your experience

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.840
by showing you content
that you didn't originally

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.460
intend by filtering
your followers.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.930
And so by actually making
that fit in and giving them

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.010
these limitations,
I think that we're

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.550
trying to do the best job there.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.280
MICHAEL RENAUD: Yeah, totally.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.821
If we have all these tools now
where we can tell the stories,

00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:37.580
why can't we work on
the ad side as well

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.200
to make beautiful ad
options for advertisers

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.491
that aren't native advertising?

00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:43.750
That aren't infiltrating
our editorial.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.460
Thinking on that side of things
as well is huge, totally.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.470
RACHEL BEEN: To jump
ahead and add on

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.950
to that-- that's
a great point-- is

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.970
how are we monetizing things?

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.520
How do we monetize
in the future?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.960
What's the future
of monetization?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.610
And specifically on
social platforms,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.310
who should actually be
getting paid, to some degree?

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.080
DUSTIN SENOS: It's
a great question.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.520
We have a team actively
thinking of different ways

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.405
to monetize Medium.

00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:08.530
Right now we're playing
with native advertisements.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.390
We launched a branded
design collection

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.310
that was hosted by BMW.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.520
And we have a very high bar
where the standard is, do we

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.700
want to read this content?

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.690
Because if not, then why are
we putting it on our platform,

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.329
and why would we
pay for the content

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.490
to be put on our platform?

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.866
I would love to
see a world where

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:29.281
if I have a good story to tell
and people are enjoying it,

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.480
I can be paid for that.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.254
I don't think anyone's
figured that out yet.

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:37.336
And I think it's something
we're all striving for.

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:39.860
Especially on a platform like
Medium where anyone can write.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.610
How do we attract top
writers to come here

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.400
if they can't be paid?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.302
There's more than just
recognition they want.

00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:46.010
People need to make
a living off of this.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.150
RACHEL BEEN: Right.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.620
And then the question of
who should be getting paid.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.544
Is it the institution
or is it the individual?

00:17:50.544 --> 00:17:51.460
DUSTIN SENOS: Totally.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.480
RACHEL BEEN:
Obviously, the Times

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.160
has talked a lot
about monetization

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.540
and the pay wall, et cetera.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.324
Can you share some
of what's going on

00:17:58.324 --> 00:17:59.990
in terms of monetization
with the Times?

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.880
TYSON EVANS: Yeah.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.540
At the core for us, we have
our two revenue streams

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.270
which are almost
50-50 at this point.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.240
Our advertising
and subscriptions.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.660
And those have very different
design constraints and goals

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.860
that are spoked around them.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.310
So, across print
and the web, I think

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.190
we have more than two million
people as paying subscribers

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.980
at this point.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.140
And they demand an experience
and a connection functionality

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.190
that isn't the same
as what would happen

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.170
if we were a purely
advertising-driven site.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.950
So there's that kind of
built-in dichotomy of when we're

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.610
embarking on any
new feature, we're

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:40.230
kind of forced to ask ourselves
what is the revenue goal here?

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.700
Does there need to be one?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.600
You take something
like our cooking app

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.490
which just launched on
the web and on the iPad.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.820
That's a play that we made
that was purely about audience.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.330
We really wanted to try to
reach as many people who maybe

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.739
haven't been exposed to
the Times recipe database.

00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:57.030
And then we'll learn from that.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.470
That is more the
exception for us.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.330
It's rare that we
as a big company

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.290
can embark on
something new and say,

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.630
we're just doing this for
audience growth right now.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.799
So the short answer is, it's
unclear and it's shifting.

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:11.590
And I don't think anyone
would have thought

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.180
we would've been 50%
percent subscriber supported

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.580
by this point.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.430
And so who knows what five
or 10 years will bring.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.350
RACHEL BEEN: And for you, Mark,
you're a fairly new product.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.261
And Storehouse is completely
free to use and create stories.

00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:27.010
Can you share with us
some of your thought

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.340
process behind that revenue?

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.089
MARK KAWANO: Yeah.

00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:34.920
I think how creators get paid is
a really tricky question right

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.420
now.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.870
I think the reality is,
what we're focusing on

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.940
and I think what a lot of other
panelists are focusing on,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.400
is really just
opening up new ways

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.150
of communication amongst folks.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:49.040
And we're at the early stage
of figuring out how that works,

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.329
what it looks like,
which people want it,

00:19:51.329 --> 00:19:53.370
do they want it to be for
professional, personal?

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.580
And I think we're kind of
finding that the answer is

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.410
a little bit of everything right
now in some of those items.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.580
And so our approach
at Storehouse

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.149
is really trying to focus
on that problem of how

00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.940
do you communicate?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.900
Who are the audiences?

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.510
How do we hone that craft?

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.590
With the idea that
if we do unlock

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.280
a lot of different relationships
between people and connections,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.510
that's an extremely
valuable proposition

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.160
and there's ways for lots of
different people to get paid.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.600
I don't think it's going
to be a single format.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.400
I think with just
different types of content,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.970
there's different verticals.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.640
As you mentioned,
education or useful content

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.669
you can look at again
and again is something

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:34.960
that you might want to pay for.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.770
Versus something that's
more topical or maybe harder

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.760
is not something
where you want to pay

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.540
or even advertisers would
want to associate themselves

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.211
with that.

00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:46.710
There's got to be
some models there.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.082
But I think it's just that we're
at such an early stage of all

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:52.220
of this visual
storytelling that it's

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.510
going to be really interesting
to see where it is.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.630
But that's not our
focus right now.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.130
RACHEL BEEN: I think there's
an interesting transition there

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:04.276
between this idea of
platform and publisher.

00:21:04.276 --> 00:21:05.650
Obviously, something
like Medium.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.920
We were talking recently
that Medium originally

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.720
launched as a platform to kind
of host other people's content.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.540
But then it is now getting into
kind of the publishing game.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.160
I'm interested in hearing
from you about that transition

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.920
as well as from
Mike from Pitchfork.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.710
Traditionally, you've
always been a publisher.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.740
Would you ever open it to
a social platform as well?

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.490
DUSTIN SENOS: Yes.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.414
So on Medium-- I
like this question

00:21:27.414 --> 00:21:30.080
because when we launched so many
people were like, what are you?

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.871
Are you a platform?

00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:33.284
And internally, we were
like, do we have to pick?

00:21:33.284 --> 00:21:34.950
Why do we have to
choose this right now?

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.050
What does it matter?

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.590
And we are absolutely both.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.510
We have internal publications,
we have an editorial team

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.260
in New York, we have
creative directors

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.370
in San Francisco helping
create content on our platform,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.297
and we use it as
a way to showcase

00:21:51.297 --> 00:21:52.380
what you can do on Medium.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.980
A way to stretch the product so
we're like constantly working

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.610
with editors and
illustrators to be

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.160
like, what features
would you like?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.492
It just really helps
to guide us to see

00:22:01.492 --> 00:22:02.950
how far can we
stretch this product

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.530
and how can we learn from it.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.810
And then, what I
love is the fact

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.140
that we're building
and paying people

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.140
to help us build this very
expansive publishing platform

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.457
and then giving it
to people for free.

00:22:15.457 --> 00:22:17.040
You can sign up and
use the same tools

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.680
as everyone else for free.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.467
And I don't struggle
with if we're

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:22.550
a platform or a publisher.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.508
I don't see why we need
to make that dichotomy.

00:22:24.508 --> 00:22:27.280
And when we launched and people
wrote news articles about that,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.620
it was like, oh, I
wonder why they're even

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.839
talking about that.

00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:32.380
I can understand
from the perspective

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.220
of if you're writing on Medium
and we're only sharing content

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.130
that we are producing
and paying for,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.490
versus shared social content.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.220
But we try to just surface
content that's good.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.720
And by adding our
social layer, it's

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.701
mostly driven by your
social graph now.

00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:48.200
RACHEL BEEN: What do you think,
Mike, from your perspective?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.820
MICHAEL RENAUD: We on our side,
discovering music on the web

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.064
has mostly been about
aggregation and finding music

00:22:54.064 --> 00:22:55.480
through different
modes of social.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.160
And for us, we've always thought
of ourselves more as a filter.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.820
So just having an
editorial voice

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.470
that people have an expectation
when they come to this site.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.770
We've never had comments
on the site either.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.940
So, part of that for us has
been, let's keep it in house

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.850
and let's keep it ourselves.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.840
But with that said, what you're
doing is really inspiring.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.110
And I think there's
other ways down the line

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.212
where those things
could be incorporated.

00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:22.170
Because our fans are a
huge part of what we do.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.520
Obviously, we have
the music festival.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.144
And that's a good
way for us to connect

00:23:25.144 --> 00:23:27.040
with those people
individually and in person.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.632
So, it's never anything
that's out of the question.

00:23:29.632 --> 00:23:31.840
But traditionally, for us,
we've always thought of it

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.710
as just being a very
traditional editorial entity.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.960
RACHEL BEEN: I think there's
a brand question in this.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.459
We were talking
about for Instagram,

00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:40.220
what is the brand of
Instagram, per se,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.319
when it really isn't
Instagram's content?

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:45.110
I'm curious what you
think of that, Maykel,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.870
in terms of how does brand
relate to this idea of simply

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.547
being a platform or being sort
of a hybrid publisher slash

00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:52.120
platform?

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.240
MAYKEL LOOMANS: Yeah,
I think that Instagram

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.090
very early on got
a blog and used

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.310
that to start highlighting
important accounts.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.190
So, accounts that
we thought were

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.280
very interesting to follow.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.231
That was kind of
very early stage

00:24:05.231 --> 00:24:07.480
and it's still one of the
things that we are currently

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.240
just exploring.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.850
And the body of work
only becomes bigger.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:16.860
There's others, like us
dipping toes in the water.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.700
Like, we have these
small books now.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.270
We launched a brand book
and a community book where

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.280
we, in print, start highlighting
all these interesting accounts

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.800
and interesting people that
have been making great photos

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.130
and have been telling stories.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.830
For example, like
maddieonthings,

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.590
this hound that
stands on everything.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.320
That's one of the stories
that we've been telling.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.880
I think Instagram
as a company is

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.320
trying to figure out where it
fits in in actually publishing

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.530
its own content and
having its own voice.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.040
There is an editor-in-chief
on the team now.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.830
But that's all
very early stages.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.132
And I think in the next
year, next two years,

00:24:55.132 --> 00:24:57.590
we're going to see something
very interesting happen there.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.548
RACHEL BEEN: Tyson, do
you think the Times will

00:24:59.548 --> 00:25:01.230
open up and become
more of a platform?

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:05.740
TYSON EVANS: Yeah, I
think it already has been.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.560
We're a site that's had a
heavily moderated comment

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.960
section now for eight years.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.490
And there's amazing gems
in our comments section.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.700
It's like the exact inverse of
the typical internet comment

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.900
section.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.130
But it still feels secondary,
it still feels reactionary to us

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.302
as a publisher.

00:25:22.302 --> 00:25:24.510
So one of the big projects
we're working on this year

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.843
is we're working with the
Washington Post and the Knight

00:25:26.843 --> 00:25:29.930
Foundation and trying to
split that model a little bit

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.350
and put readers
a little bit more

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.690
at the forefront of
that interaction.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.790
We've definitely done
it in sporadic one-offs.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.710
Like, on the
anniversary of 9/11 we

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.790
asked readers to
drop a pin on a map

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.107
and tell us where they
were 10 years prior.

00:25:43.107 --> 00:25:44.690
And there's kind of
a whole collection

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.587
of stories like that.

00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:48.170
The thing we haven't done that
I'm so jealous of everyone else

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.586
up here having
figured out, is how

00:25:49.586 --> 00:25:51.490
to create that as
just the rhythm

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.960
and expectation of the site.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.250
And that's where we're
way more a publisher

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.370
than we are a platform.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.700
RACHEL BEEN: I have a
question about distribution.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.510
Let's talk about
quality a little bit.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.040
This idea of distribution.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.140
You can create a
beautifully curated piece,

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.840
but is the quality of
the content as good

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.690
as the distribution?

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.390
I know, Mark, we were talking
a little bit about this.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.160
Of how to get content out there.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.730
Potentially, now that's
almost more important.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.790
Socialized content versus
the actual content itself.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.410
Almost back to this
idea of beautiful design

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.790
covering bad content.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.030
Is being social, being
viral, potentially

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.920
covering a lot of bad content?

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.660
MARK KAWANO: It's
a tricky thing.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.520
We talk a lot about
what makes a story good

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.790
and what makes content good.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.010
Is there something
intrinsic to it?

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.760
Or is it that if it
gets a lot of views,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.690
then that's good because
people enjoy that

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.320
and it's getting
a lot of feedback?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.510
I think it's a very
personal question.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.930
It's pretty complicated.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.540
The reality is,
distribution hasn't

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.610
been available to enough
people and it still

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.670
isn't available to
enough people today.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.390
And the creation
tools aren't there.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.250
As we think about professional
versus social content,

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.670
one of the great things that's
happened with the internet

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.340
is there's been
ways now for people

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.130
to get whatever their story
is, wherever they may be,

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.720
if they have an internet
connection, to convey that

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.370
to a whole bunch of people.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.870
And we want to make that
more elegant and easier.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.850
But we have such a
far way to go as far

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.280
as just distribution of
information amongst people.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.410
And it's still very
highly concentrated

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.220
amongst a very select
few people on this world.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.789
And I think that's part of what
we're all focusing on here.

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:34.580
DUSTIN SENOS: Yeah.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:40.040
And at Medium, we noticed a
lot of people write a draft

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.280
but never click Publish.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.800
And they're fearful of
the distribution side

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.960
because storytelling is
such a personal thing.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.330
It's hard to write, it's hard
to open yourself up like that.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.040
And it's something
we think a lot about.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.170
Is it the audience?

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.030
Is it really who
you're writing for?

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.360
Is it the distribution
channel that makes it easier?

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.510
Will you be more likely
to write if you know,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.510
I'm writing to six people
versus just putting it

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.239
on the internet for everyone
to read and judge your words?

00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:07.530
RACHEL BEEN: And Mike, for you.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.080
I mean, obviously, distribution.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.030
You have festivals, there's
a print publication.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.810
Do you find that this
kind of increases

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.210
the knowledge of
Pitchfork to some degree?

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.470
MICHAEL RENAUD: Yeah, sure.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.553
That definitely helps
people be aware of the brand

00:28:21.553 --> 00:28:24.300
and it helps people understand
what we're trying to do.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.920
On the editorial
side on the website,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.070
we try really hard to not
go too listical and Buzzfeed

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.250
and everything when it
comes to distribution.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.980
Because we're just trying
to put good things out there

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.450
in the world.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.092
Our print magazine is
a good example of that.

00:28:40.092 --> 00:28:42.560
It's something that, I think,
hopefully enhances the brand.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.030
Helps people understand
where we're coming from.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.580
We write a lot more
about older music

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.970
and have great
photography and comments

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.060
and those types of things.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.680
And from there is
where we expect

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.370
to hopefully find success.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.940
But we don't ever want to
cannibalize our own editorial

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.620
efforts by putting things
out there just to drive up

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.610
the Likes on
Facebook or whatever.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.785
RACHEL BEEN: And then one
last point on distribution

00:29:05.785 --> 00:29:07.100
from the Times perspective.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.050
So the innovation
report came out.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.972
Leaked, some degree.

00:29:09.972 --> 00:29:11.680
And there's an
interesting point in there

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.780
that basically said,
although we must always

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.020
polish our journalism,
we can have

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.290
some rough edges around
the way that we're

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.315
reaching new audiences.

00:29:22.315 --> 00:29:25.902
Can you kind of talk
about what does that mean?

00:29:25.902 --> 00:29:27.360
MICHAEL RENAUD: I
think it was also

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.276
a line in the report--
which I didn't work on,

00:29:29.276 --> 00:29:32.280
so I can be fully critical
of-- but actually,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.940
in the support of this idea
that the traditional publisher

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.660
model is you hit publish,
and then your job is done.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.190
That's when you've finished
your work for the day.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.940
Which, as we now know,
is totally false.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.010
And most of the real reach
of what's going to happen

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.590
is what happens after
you hit Publish.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.540
So one of our
biggest initiatives

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.660
right now is this idea of how
do we reach the audience that we

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.120
think is actually
interested in this work?

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.720
There was a video we
had, I think, last month

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.700
which was this incredible
video interview

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.640
with the sole survivor
of a massacre from ISIS.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.800
And it was heart
wrenching, it was brutal.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.590
And we realized,
that's the material

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.780
that we have to spend the
most amount of time trying

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.470
to find a natural audience for.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:18.530
So we translated it into Arabic,
we published it in the morning

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.870
in the Middle East.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.430
We tried to find distribution
partners and amplifiers

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.461
in a way that we
don't always do.

00:30:25.461 --> 00:30:27.210
So I think those are
the levers that we're

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.070
trying to find
smarter ways to use.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.460
And that is very
much the inverse

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.475
of how we used to operate.

00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:38.100
RACHEL BEEN: So I want to talk
a little bit about the dichotomy

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.474
that you've all
heard because you

00:30:39.474 --> 00:30:41.420
work in storytelling products.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.320
Long-form versus short-form.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.420
Firstly, is this sort
of an antiquated phrase

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.110
to some extent?

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.530
And also, just in
general, is something

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.770
like a single photo on
Instagram as powerful

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.160
as a full piece on Storehouse.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.020
I want to talk about
this dichotomy.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:04.790
MAYKEL LOOMANS: Yeah, I think
the execution of the story

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.800
is just based on what the
content of the story is.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.160
So if within one photo you can
show this bomb that went off

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.150
in Syria-- like, early
on in Instagram's life,

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.120
we found this guy
named SyrianDeveloper.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.580
And he was on the ground as
one of the few people taking

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.910
photos in Syria.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.620
That one photo was
iconic and eventually got

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.040
so much distribution that
it became a story in itself.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.620
And other outlets tried
to find context to it.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.590
Having specifically
a larger article

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.024
around that originally
from the Instagram platform

00:31:38.024 --> 00:31:40.190
I don't think would have
worked as well because that

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.320
was a in-the-moment,
right now experience

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.470
that needed to get into the
world as fast as possible.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.070
Now, on the other hand, if you
want to give context to that,

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.045
I think a platform like
Storehouse or the Times

00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:57.260
or Medium would be perfect
to actually do that.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.240
It's kind of the story
within a larger story,

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.090
so you need those
strong elements.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.900
So I think it's a combination
of many different things.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.990
Just as a person shares
differently to Facebook

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.970
than they share to
Instagram than they tweet,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.610
or that they would write
an article on Medium.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.100
RACHEL BEEN: And Mark, for
you, is that a silly phrase?

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.060
We were talking about this.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.030
MARK KAWANO: I think it's up to
the creator to kind of decide

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.920
how they want to communicate
their information.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.294
And sometimes I wish people
would take more photos

00:32:27.294 --> 00:32:29.710
from some of their Storehouse
stories when I look at them.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.251
And when I look at
Instagram, I often

00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:34.880
wish I could see a lot more
than just a single photo.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.980
And I think the gap that
we're trying to fill

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.110
is, there's just not enough
easy tools for people

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.350
to use for those different
use cases right now.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.430
But it really depends
on the information,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.030
on the platform,
again, who you're

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.980
talking to-- the audience.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.310
But I think the
average consumer,

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:57.090
they don't think about
long-form, short-form.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:57.970
Was this useful?

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:58.470
Helpful?

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.220
Entertaining?

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.500
Funny?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.700
So it's really just
about the content.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.040
TYSON EVANS: And also, I
think the idea that there's

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.890
a canonical form
for a given story

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.350
anymore is totally
discarded at this point.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.470
Really good stories have to
exist in somewhere between two

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.200
and six forms at this point.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.912
There's the Facebook
version of the story,

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.620
there's the Twitter
version of the story,

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.680
there is the phone version
while you're on the run.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.170
And that's not often how we
think of as content creators.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.880
That this really
compelling story

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.130
needs to exist in
very alternative ways

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.720
based on the context of the
user that encounters it.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.350
We think about,
this story deserves

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:39.580
to be 8,000 words
with 16 photos.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.050
And we have to find ways to have
a lot more elastic definition

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.486
around those stories.

00:33:45.486 --> 00:33:47.110
MAYKEL LOOMANS: A
really recent example

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.630
of that is actually
the Giants riots.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.360
There were a bunch of
singular photos on Instagram.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.920
They were taken on
Valencia or Mission.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.782
Things were on fire.

00:33:55.782 --> 00:33:57.490
But then there was a
bold, italic article

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.594
that came afterwards that
kind of editorialized

00:34:00.594 --> 00:34:02.760
a couple of these photos,
as well as YouTube videos,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.367
and kind of grouped it together.

00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:06.450
So people individually
were telling their stories.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.290
And then the bold
italic around that

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.889
told the story of the
night that happened.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:12.650
And as you were
following on Twitter,

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.520
you could follow
this account which

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.929
was like @ScannerSays which was
the police scanner where you

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.190
could see live like where
a couch was on fire.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.940
So there were all these
parallel story tracks

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.940
that are going on that
eventually get rounded up

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.940
in a piece of editorial.

00:34:29.174 --> 00:34:30.590
DUSTIN SENOS:
Currently, Medium is

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.800
looked at very much
as the place to come

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.780
publish long-form,
thoughtful stories.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.330
And we're trying to break that
because that's an intimidating

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:38.830
thing.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.739
And not everything needs to be
long and a very polished piece.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:45.136
And we're looking at things
like, I read a full book

00:34:45.136 --> 00:34:46.760
on my iPhone without
thinking about it.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.580
And it's because I
can be interrupted

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.230
and I can come back
to it at any point.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.710
That doesn't exist
on the web yet.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.119
There's no way of me reading a
three hour long read on the web

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:57.410
and come right back to it
and pick up where I left off.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.432
And that's something we're
very interested in breaking.

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.432
And Circa is doing an
interesting job with this,

00:35:02.432 --> 00:35:04.056
with letting stories
build up over time

00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:05.580
and you can follow along.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.580
And we're looking at ways of
enabling publishers to do that.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.174
So, I could read a
serialized book on Medium

00:35:12.174 --> 00:35:14.090
that comes out with a
new chapter every month.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.170
That would be a very
interesting way to do it.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.660
Just like we do with TV shows.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.380
We don't see that
with writing yet.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.810
I think it's an
interesting place to go.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.634
RACHEL BEEN: It's
interesting with Medium.

00:35:23.634 --> 00:35:26.300
I don't know, I wouldn't call it
necessarily sort of an apology.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.469
But you put seven minutes.

00:35:29.469 --> 00:35:31.260
This is how long the
story's going to take.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.120
This is how long that we are
going to consume your time.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.030
What was the original
intention behind that?

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.470
To almost apologize
for being long-form?

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.599
DUSTIN SENOS: We currently
have an A/B test right

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:44.140
now showing that or
not showing that.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.407
And on one hand, it's fantastic.

00:35:47.407 --> 00:35:49.240
Because you know what
you're signing up for.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.510
On the other hand, if I see a
40 minute read on my iPhone,

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.718
I'm not going to click on it.

00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:55.167
So it's kind of setting the
stage for the content you're

00:35:55.167 --> 00:35:56.000
going to click into.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.459
But it could also
be like, if you

00:35:58.459 --> 00:36:00.250
didn't know it was 40
minutes and you click

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.030
on it and you're
completely engulfed in it

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.488
and you're 10
minutes in and you've

00:36:03.488 --> 00:36:05.400
lost track of time,
that's fantastic.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.780
Versus, I don't have
40 minutes right now.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.067
So, metrics went up
when we put that there.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.150
It's a very curious thing.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.733
It was a very simple
algorithm that we

00:36:12.733 --> 00:36:14.070
used to calculate that number.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.040
And we continue to
try to figure out

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.720
if it's actually a
good thing to show.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.120
We continuously hear from
users that they love seeing it.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.360
RACHEL BEEN: Interesting.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360
MARK KAWANO: I think it's
important to also talk

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.990
about what we
think the story is.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.180
I think that rather than
the long-form short-form

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.725
distinction, I think
that some of us that

00:36:32.725 --> 00:36:35.890
are working on the
platform side are realizing

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.628
that there's a story structure.

00:36:38.628 --> 00:36:40.253
Whether it's a photo,
or a Medium post,

00:36:40.253 --> 00:36:42.066
or a Storehouse story.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.440
They're really
just participating

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.790
in a larger conversation where
the story's been created.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.480
The Giants winning the
World Series is the story.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.850
And now I'm just participating
in that conversation,

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.360
maybe through my own story
or my own perspective.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.480
But what is the real thing?

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.849
What is the real story?

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.140
How can I get involved with it?

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.550
And I think that how
that line is getting

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.390
blurred is also
really interesting

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.630
with these user-generated
content tools that we now have.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.570
And a lot of times,
the story is broken

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.850
by the professional
at the New York Times.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.640
But we all shift the story
as we give our opinion,

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.410
show our view of the
world because of that.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.910
And that's been one of the
most interesting things that's

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.675
happened over the last few
years with media I think.

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:29.550
RACHEL BEEN: I want to
talk a little bit also

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.290
about technology in terms
of how that sort of changed

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:33.940
the way that we
were storytelling.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.614
Obviously, storytelling,
long tradition.

00:37:35.614 --> 00:37:37.530
But are there things
that are happening really

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.630
contemporarily that are altering
the way that storytelling

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.604
is being told and
changed and altered?

00:37:42.604 --> 00:37:43.520
DUSTIN SENOS: Totally.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.430
Bandwidth continuously going up.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.520
Larger phone screens.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.230
High resolution.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.470
The fact that we can serve
beautiful typefaces now

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:53.110
on the web has really
opened up the doors

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.930
recently for us to really
raise the ceiling of what

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.610
can be published.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:00.100
RACHEL BEEN: How
are you guys seeing

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.070
that video is being used?

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.403
Mark, it was interesting when
we were talking originally

00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:05.344
about Storehouse, how
people are using video

00:38:05.344 --> 00:38:07.260
in kind of a different
way from traditionally,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.700
specifically watching a video.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.344
Why do you think
that's happening?

00:38:11.344 --> 00:38:13.760
MARK KAWANO: I think it's a
lot just what mobile has done.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.939
And it's just made
us all have to be

00:38:15.939 --> 00:38:17.480
a little bit more
efficient about how

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.770
we consume information.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.510
About how we want to
share information.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.770
And I think video is just one
of the most efficient ways

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:27.380
to give a window
into what's going on.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.900
And it's very different
from a photo where you're

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.330
choosing the cropping and
the filtering, all that.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.830
Video is much rawer
unless you edit it down.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.960
Which is not the
typical type of video

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.590
that people put into Storehouse.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.159
And I think it's
really fascinating

00:38:44.159 --> 00:38:45.700
to see all these
different use cases.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.616
You can describe it one
way, or you could just

00:38:47.616 --> 00:38:50.810
watch someone do it, or
watch something happening.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.010
That's kind of the way
our brains are processed.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.326
Being animals, we can
deal with that much more

00:38:57.326 --> 00:38:59.817
of a cognitive load
when it's visual.

00:38:59.817 --> 00:39:02.150
RACHEL BEEN: Tyson, in terms
of technology at the Times,

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.858
has it been hard to
kind of push through?

00:39:03.858 --> 00:39:07.600
It's a fairly old institution
to instigate that sort of change

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.010
on the digital side.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.000
TYSON EVANS: Yeah.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.720
Some of our biggest
challenges aren't

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.180
the reader-facing experience.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.340
They're the internal tool set.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.750
How can we tell really
complicated stories

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:19.620
in a more granular way?

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.750
Is the 800 word story
the go-to story form?

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.099
Probably not, but that's what
our tools are shaped toward.

00:39:27.099 --> 00:39:29.140
And that's why tools like
Medium are fascinating.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.290
Because you're taking apart this
idea that this is going to get

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:32.810
translated.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.200
You're just working
right on the live site.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.910
And those are huge
questions we have now

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.530
when it comes to aggregation,
live events, really complicated

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.459
long-running events
like the war in Syria.

00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:46.000
How do we break
those down and create

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.190
tools that help piece
smaller pieces back together?

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.770
And maybe are even aware
of what you've read,

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.940
what you haven't read,
where you came from.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.370
Those are all
technology problems.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.670
And it's one of the biggest
reasons we've now got way

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.270
more developers and
designers sitting

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.440
next to journalists,
editors, reporters.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.760
RACHEL BEEN: Mike, from
the Pitchfork side.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.700
You have a small team,
but you iterate and play

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.230
with new technologies and ways
of presentation really quickly

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.330
and get a lot of the
cover stories out.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.070
Why has that been enabled?

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.850
Why is that so easy to do
in a place like Pitchfork?

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.370
MICHAEL RENAUD: I don't know.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.610
I think it's because
we're pretty nimble.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:22.570
We are a small team.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.236
There are four
developers, and including

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:25.310
myself, four designers.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.050
So we do the festival, all
the sites, the print magazine,

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.116
we have our own CMS.

00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:31.490
Actually, our
website is probably

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.281
the thing we forget
about most of the time.

00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:35.380
We haven't designed
it in four years.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.600
But we kind of work as we go.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.330
What inspires us,
what's coming up next.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.300
And we all just really
love what we do.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.220
We love music.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.910
So, it's mostly our passions
that drive what we do.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:51.500
And I think because there's
not a huge bureaucracy.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.170
We would love more developers,
but at the same time,

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.960
it's really easy to
communicate with us

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.050
and just get things
done as we go.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:59.900
RACHEL BEEN: From an
Instagram perspective,

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.860
how do you think video has fared
on Instagram as a platform?

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.484
We were talking about
this a little bit

00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:06.480
in terms of why
hasn't it becomes

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.810
as successful as the photo part?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.760
MAYKEL LOOMANS: The medium
of video is really hard.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.107
Actually lining up a shot,
it's really easy to mess it up.

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:19.190
There's like a pan, or
like a little twitch in it.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.130
Then if you have some
level of self-curation

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.339
you won't post it.

00:41:22.339 --> 00:41:24.380
There's obviously still
technological constraints

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.980
where you have very fast
broadband mobile internet

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.860
connections, but they're
still not fast enough.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.430
And people tend to
just go past it.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.737
You really have to like
swipe down and realize,

00:41:34.737 --> 00:41:35.570
oh that was a video?

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.560
And then go back up.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.670
Which is why I think that
consuming video is still not

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.910
as optimal as we want it to be.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.990
Then to the storytelling
aspect of it,

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:50.210
it's really hard to tell a
story with one, two, three cuts.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:55.050
It's really way more easier to
let the reader or the consumer

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.440
of the story look at a photo
and kind of fill in the blanks

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.140
there.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.810
Whereas in a video you
constrain their story

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.220
that they would
come up with down.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.050
Because there's obviously the
story that you tell, but then

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.250
there's also the story
that gets consumed.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.727
There's a big difference there.

00:42:12.727 --> 00:42:14.560
RACHEL BEEN: So I just
want to end-- we only

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.180
have a few minutes left
to talk about the future

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.760
of storytelling.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.580
I'm curious to hear what
your products are doing

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.120
that's really pushing the
envelope in an interesting way.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.270
And what do you
see in the future

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:26.478
for your particular products?

00:42:26.478 --> 00:42:28.630
But specifically in
design, what are you

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.410
doing from a design
perspective that's

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.540
really pushing storytelling?

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.510
DUSTIN SENOS: So we joke
around that the original form

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.990
of storytelling was scrolls.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.470
Than we did book binding.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.600
And now we went back to
scrolling browsers again.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.683
We kind of went all the
way back to the beginning.

00:42:42.683 --> 00:42:44.920
And if you look at
things like games,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.150
like checkers versus
the modern video games,

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.700
the leap is ginormous.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.450
Why hasn't that happened with
telling stories online, or just

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:53.574
telling stories in general?

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.930
I see a future that stores are
much more immersive, much more

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.500
elaborate.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.280
And they don't take a whole
bunch of work to create them.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.780
You can just tell a
story and the tools

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.510
are there to really
help you push that.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.434
Internally, we are just a
bunch of scrappy builders.

00:43:10.434 --> 00:43:11.600
We just love building stuff.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.683
We're continuously exploring
different directions.

00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:15.789
And the version of
Medium we use internally

00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:17.580
is very different than
the external version

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.260
because we try different
prototypes and experiments

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:20.760
constantly.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.410
We're constantly building
small apps and just exploring.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.660
We haven't figured it out yet.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.010
We are looking
for people to help

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.110
us do that and kind of push the
limits of how you tell stories.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.620
But what we have
today, and the products

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.520
that we're seeing
today, I don't think

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.139
are close to what
we'll see very soon.

00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:37.930
RACHEL BEEN: What is
the Times going to do?

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.910
Is it going to change
the journalistic model?

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:40.659
TYSON EVANS: Yeah.

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:43.250
I think the big question is
what I was speaking to earlier,

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.010
the idea of adaptive
storytelling.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:50.340
We need to find ways to shape
stories, the news, to readers.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.710
Where are they?

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.150
What is their archetype?

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.900
What do they read?

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.624
How do we use the data we know
about them in a smarter way?

00:43:56.624 --> 00:43:58.040
There's a lot of
really crude ways

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.250
to make that experience
feel personalized.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.770
But I think the way to
do it in a way that's

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.770
intelligent and smart
and actually anticipates

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.110
what a user needs to
know about a given story

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.590
is our next biggest challenge.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.917
But it's also a challenge
that's off-a-cliff big.

00:44:14.917 --> 00:44:17.250
MARK KAWANO: If you think
about video, what we were just

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.010
talking about, there's still
big technological constraints

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.550
on why it hasn't
been adopted more.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.050
Bandwidth is still not really
fast all over the world.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.350
And we're now getting
higher quality video cameras

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:34.010
and learning how to shoot videos
and take videos and photos.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:35.820
It's still so early on.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.230
But I think a lot of us here
see the writing on the wall,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.120
that it just makes sense
for a lot of different types

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.130
of stories to get more visual.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.247
To use video in more
interesting ways.

00:44:48.247 --> 00:44:50.080
And we're just kind of
at the start of that.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.350
The very, very early innings.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.950
And so I think we're just going
to see a lot more of that.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.500
MAYKEL LOOMANS: I think that
one of the things that we will

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.166
probably see going
forward is that there

00:44:59.166 --> 00:45:03.170
will be this thread that
will be the basic story.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.410
And then everything else that
is only tangentially related

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.092
to it we'll start
getting access to.

00:45:08.092 --> 00:45:09.550
Originally, obviously,
the internet

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.460
was designed to be a
link between documents.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.370
So how can we start
linking this central story

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.430
to all these
sub-stories and go out?

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.470
I think Medium has a nice
feature there where you

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.937
can comment in line.

00:45:21.937 --> 00:45:23.770
And you can actually
have a whole discussion

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.870
or conversation
next to a paragraph

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:27.210
or next to a sentence.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.940
I think that if we kind
of explored that and look

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.490
at like photography or video
or other visual means that

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.690
could kind of blast
out from one paragraph

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.447
and show the story
of that paragraph.

00:45:39.447 --> 00:45:41.280
I think the combination
of all these stories

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.510
is going to be like something--

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:43.860
RACHEL BEEN: Closing
thoughts, Mike?

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.776
MICHAEL RENAUD: Yeah,
all that stuff is great.

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:47.910
And I think that side
of things-- users

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.160
being involved,
video integration.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.040
Even your own atmosphere
and your own experiences

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.490
being involved in
a story is huge.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.300
And we'll explore
that as it goes on.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.110
But we're also really grasping
at the traditional journalism

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.020
model.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.210
A place where people
can go to trust a voice.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.480
And so, I think, while at
the same time letting people

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.880
sort of create their own content
or being involved in the story

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.036
they're reading is
excellent, I think

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:14.910
just sticking with
tradition in a lot of ways

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.076
and really trying to hold
on to a lot of things that

00:46:17.076 --> 00:46:18.607
seem to be slowly
slipping away is

00:46:18.607 --> 00:46:21.190
going to continue to be really
important for us in the future.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.731
RACHEL BEEN: Well,
we're out of time.

00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:27.050
Does anyone have any closing
questions before we go?

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.684
I guess not.

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:28.600
Well, thank you, guys.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.970
Thank you for joining
us on the panel.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:34.020
[APPLAUSE]
