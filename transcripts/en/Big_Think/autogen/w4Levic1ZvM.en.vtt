about kids with autism so from through

about kids with autism so from through
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969
about kids with autism so from through
some early studies there was a lot of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
some early studies there was a lot of
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.770
some early studies there was a lot of
evidence that so-called de novo

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
evidence that so-called de novo
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.890
evidence that so-called de novo
mutations were at least partially

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
mutations were at least partially
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690

responsible for autism so a de novo

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
responsible for autism so a de novo
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390

mutation is most of your genome is is is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
mutation is most of your genome is is is
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550
mutation is most of your genome is is is
a combination of your parents genome so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
a combination of your parents genome so
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.590
a combination of your parents genome so
it's after your mom plus half your dad

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
it's after your mom plus half your dad
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109
it's after your mom plus half your dad
put together forms you but a very very

small number of changes are so-called de

small number of changes are so-called de
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920
small number of changes are so-called de
novo meaning that there will be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.950

spontaneous changes in the genome there

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
spontaneous changes in the genome there
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.499
spontaneous changes in the genome there
have been some earlier work through Mike

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.700
autism or segments of the genome would
either be duplicated or segments of the
