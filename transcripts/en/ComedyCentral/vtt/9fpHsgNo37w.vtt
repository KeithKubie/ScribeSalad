00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.702
  - Internet trolls.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.303
They're coarsening our discourse
and dividing our nation.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:06.272
 Is there anything
 we can do about it?

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:07.907
Let's turn, again, to our panel.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.109
 Joining Grant and Nora
 is Grammy nominated

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.345
 folk flutist, Peter Thrush.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.382
 (jazzy flute music)

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:18.918
 That ruled.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.653
 Peter, did you write
 that or improvise it?

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:21.854
 - Improvised.
 - Nice.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.123
 - Artists are, often,
 unfairly targeted

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.625
by the troll community.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.127
 As a musician, how would you
 deal with a troll assault?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.163
  - Well, Ted, after getting
  over the initial shock

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.498
 of finding out trolls
 are real creatures,

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.801
 I'd look for a
 weapon to fight them.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.002
 Like, a spear.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.270
  - No, no, no, no.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.073
 Sorry, we're talking
 about internet trolls.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.441
 Which are people
 who say mean things

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.709
 online because they
 hate themselves.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.478
  - Sorry, I misunderstood.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.046
- Yeah, I think you did.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.681
But, you know, you raise
an interesting point.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.684
 What if these trolls
 were actual trolls?

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.718
 Nora, your thoughts?

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:53.953
 - Look, Ted.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.355
If only 10% of America's
bridges have trolls,

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.391
  that's still a staggering
  number of trolls.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.692
- It is.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:00.860
 That's a terrifying
 statistic, if true.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.361
 Grant, trolls, talk.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.530
 - I would conjecture that we
 are not prepared for this.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:05.965
  They can emerge at
  anytime, attack.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.533
Axes glinting in the moonlight.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.935
 - Well, no.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.069
 I would argue that out
 military is equipped to handle

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:11.404
 a troll raiding party.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.172
 - Yes, but you're not
 taking into account

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.707
  their, possibly,
  bulletproof skin.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.875
- Please, let me finish.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.643
 I was about to
 suggest that trolls

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.679
 likely carry unknown bacteria.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.482
 Look, millions dying
 of root plague.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.217
Probably wish they had
their skulls crushed in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.953
 by the first wave of
 iron battle boots.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.688
  - But, how would they know
  that now is the best time

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.524
 to strike while our
 president is stuck in a hole?

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:35.728
 - Because maybe the trolls
 got to the president first.
