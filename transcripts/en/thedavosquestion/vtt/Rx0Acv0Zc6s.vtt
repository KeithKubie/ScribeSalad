00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.140
&gt;&gt; We live in a world of blurring boundaries,
between sectors of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.360
industry, between known countries and territories.
Everything is changing.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.610
&gt;&gt; The one global challenge that most people
around the world are

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.230
most worried about these days, namely climate
change, require new,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.440
committed, and global problem solving alliances.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; Countries are slowly becoming outdated.
They need to realize that their borders are

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.660
partial and that their
people and governments are one in the same.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Free education, universal education, and
free and universal

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.110
[unintelligible].

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.940
&gt;&gt; People need to start coming together, start
coming together as a

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.210
global community.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.240
&gt;&gt; [Music playing]

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.890
&gt;&gt; Everyone together improving everyone else's
quality of life.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.460
&gt;&gt; [Music playing]

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.460
&gt;&gt; And that's what should be done.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.010
&gt;&gt; Together as a global community we have
the resources, we have the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.549
intention, we have the skills, we have the
knowledge, and we have the

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.649
funds to transform Africa, to uplift the orphans,
and to heal the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.649
sick.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.740
&gt;&gt; I would look at a world going forward where
everyone has equal

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.340
opportunity, where you can provide equal chance
for your neighbor to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.459
grow and to prosper.
