00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:09.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The swine-flu
snake greeting.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.726
Morning, Morning, Morning,
Morning, Morning.

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Carrithers
Middle School, the day begins

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:19.416
with goofy games, which are often
followed by serious discussions.

00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:22.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We've been
discussing bullying all week long.

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The 20 minutes spent

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:26.856
in this daily morning meeting
is a critical component

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:30.336
of Jefferson County,
Kentucky's, district-wide CARE

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.506
for Kids initiative, which
seeks to build positive,

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:35.216
caring learning communities.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:39.006
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: There's a pretty complex
puzzle that we have to put together

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:43.246
to have a successful school,
but a foundational element

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:46.986
of that puzzle is the culture
and climate of that school,

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:49.836
and when students feel safe.

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:50.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hello, sweet girl.

00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:52.436
You have a good day, okay?

00:00:52.876 --> 00:00:56.126
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: When they feel that
culture and climate supports that,

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:59.636
when they feel cared about not
only by the adults in the school...

00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:00.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Got that?

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:01.706
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: ...but by other students

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.126
in the school, they
can do their best.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look at the name
and think of something nice

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.076
to say about that person.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:09.876
&gt;&gt;Deirdre: Good morning, Storm.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:10.746
&gt;&gt;Storm: Good morning, Deirdre.

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:11.836
&gt;&gt;Deirdre: I like your humor.

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:13.416
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: It isn't
touchy-feely stuff.

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:20.056
It's core social skills that
gives students the experience

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:22.846
and the knowledge to work
effectively with others.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Thanks for
always being nice.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:27.816
&gt;&gt;Paul: It's teaching kids
how to CARE for one another,

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:32.366
how to be a bigger person
and how to resolve conflicts.

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:36.356
&gt;&gt;When the cold wind blows, it
blows for whoever has on shoes.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:44.266
&gt;&gt;When you give us activities or
we able to move, get all our noises

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.996
out before school and stuff, it
gives us more hype about learning.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:49.716
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Less instructional
time is lost

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:54.146
because we're teaching the skills up
front, and so that when it is time

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:58.816
for academics, we're learning and
we're not stopping at various times

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:01.726
to address conflicts, and
it's teaching the students how

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:03.776
to have ownership and have voice.

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:07.236
&gt;&gt;Joanna: Tell Jasmine what
you think is special about her.

00:02:07.236 --> 00:02:08.846
&gt;&gt;Student: I like when
you share with me.

00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:09.996
&gt;&gt;Jasmine: Thank you.

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:11.376
Caroline?

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:12.236
&gt;&gt;Joanna: They're excited.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:13.606
They want to be here.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:17.586
I've had parents say, "My
daughter's sick today, but she cried,

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:19.426
because she really
wanted to come to school.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:20.746
What are you all doing?"

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:22.936
&gt;&gt;Jasmine: Thanks for
filling my bucket.

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.286
&gt;&gt;Joanna: How did they fill
your bucket today, Jasmine?

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.326
&gt;&gt;Jasmine: Because they
was being nice to me.

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:29.016
&gt;&gt;Richard: Stay in line.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:29.756
Don't run.

00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:30.126
Don't run.

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:33.756
&gt;&gt;I like this program and I see
this program that's been implemented

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:38.536
and it works, because I was
here, and I seen it for myself.

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:41.236
&gt;&gt;See you tomorrow, okay, buddy?

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:44.176
&gt;&gt;At the end of the day, those
kids getting on those buses

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:50.056
with a smile on their face.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:51.836
My job is done.

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:55.476
I can safely go home
and say, "You know what?

00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:58.406
When they came this
morning they had smiles,

00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:00.236
and when they left, they had smiles.

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:03.336
Our job is done, because I'm there."

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:04.966
&gt;&gt;Your mom's outside.

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:07.636
Your mom's right there, Madison.

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:09.496
