00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.120
So here I have a balloon filled with hydrogen.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.120
It has a lot of chemical energy as hydrogen gas,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.540
when mixed with oxygen, is a very potent fuel.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.760
By igniting the balloon, I add energy and
set off a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
that releases a lot of energy in the form
of heat.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.390
The conservation of energy is one of the fundamental
principles of our universe.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.550
Simply put, in a closed system, no energy
can ever be created or destroyed,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.420
only transformed from one form to another.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:47.579
The first law of thermodynamics takes this
idea and modifies it for thermodynamic systems.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.390
It relates the internal energy of a system
to the amount of heat added to the system

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.610
and the amount of work done by the system.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.070
If we look at the explosion again with a thermal
camera, you can see quite clearly how hot

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.789
the explosion was.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.329
But the total amount of energy in the room

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.060
is still the same as before I blew up the balloon.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.170
It's just changed from chemical energy in
the bonds, to heat energy.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.420
Historically, this idea of turning heat into
useful work was the main driver in the formulation

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.490
of this law.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.520
At the beginning of the industrial revolution,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.230
both scientists and engineers were creating
steam engines in the hope that they could

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.340
harness energy to further society and industry.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.770
The advantage was that they could automate
some jobs, and match if not exceed the power

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310
of a human labour force.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.410
Steam engines are based on the idea of heating

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.300
water under high pressure until it becomes steam.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.490
As it is heated, it expands and pushes a piston
that produces mechanical work,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.870
be it moving a train or pumping liquids or
any number of other functions.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.690
Blowing up hydrogen balloons is fun, but the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.340
conversion of chemical energy to heat isn't particularly useful.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.980
What we could do, is put it to good use in
a rocket.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.880
In physics, work is done when a force is applied

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.860
to an object and that object then moves a  distance.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.260
One of the simplest ways of making this hydrogen
do work for me is to build a rocket.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.900
The hydrogen and oxygen mixture is exactly
the same as with the balloon,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.860
but when the balloon expanded outwards in
all directions with the explosion,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.530
the rigid walls of the Pringles can funnels
the energy in one direction.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.410
The chemical energy is now converted into
kinetic energy and heat,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.060
and by moving the rocket, useful work was
performed.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.680
Rockets are useful when sending people into
space,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.099
but if I wanted to get some work out of my
hydrogen for some more terrestrial uses

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.879
then I have to harness the energy in a different
way, or transform it to a more useful form.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.440
What Iï¿½ve done here is attached my rockets
onto a wheel.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.019
When it spins, it is doing work as the rockets
move around.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.230
What I can do is attach a small dynamo here,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.060
which when the wheel spins will convert this
kinetic energy into electrical energy,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.170
which I can then store for later use.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.441
The problem with this is that all throughout
this process you're losing energy in the form

00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:27.230
of heat to the room, rather than using it
to do useful work.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.630
Because of this, it's actually a rather inefficient
system.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.950
While no energy is destroyed, because it can't be,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.520
too much of it is lost into the room as heat energy.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.850
This issue isn't one that's isolated just
to my rocket contraptions.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.530
The issue of efficiency, getting more useful
work out of the same energy input

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.350
while battling energy loss,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.379
is one that is as important today as it was
during the industrial revolution.
