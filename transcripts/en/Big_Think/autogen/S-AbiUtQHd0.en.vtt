treatments slowly get better over time
and I'm not adverse to saying that there

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099
and I'm not adverse to saying that there
 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.069
and I'm not adverse to saying that there
are biological bases to mental illness

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079
are biological bases to mental illness
 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.770

brain structures that are seemingly the
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.819
brain structures that are seemingly the
same in all people and at the same time

I feel like there's a false divide

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140
I feel like there's a false divide
 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.430
I feel like there's a false divide
almost like you have to vote is an

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440
almost like you have to vote is an
 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.829
almost like you have to vote is an
illness biological or is it social or

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839
illness biological or is it social or
 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.680
illness biological or is it social or
socially constructed and and I I don't

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690
socially constructed and and I I don't
 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.630
socially constructed and and I I don't
like that divide very much because I

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
like that divide very much because I
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.880
like that divide very much because I
think that all definitions of illness

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
think that all definitions of illness
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.640
think that all definitions of illness
and maybe particularly all definitions

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650
and maybe particularly all definitions
 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.950
and maybe particularly all definitions
of psychiatric illness are always are

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960
of psychiatric illness are always are
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.140
of psychiatric illness are always are
always both it doesn't have to be one of

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150
always both it doesn't have to be one of
 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.080
always both it doesn't have to be one of
the other mental illness is a real thing

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
the other mental illness is a real thing
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.180
the other mental illness is a real thing
it has real material consequences for

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190
it has real material consequences for
 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.220
it has real material consequences for
people who suffer from it and at the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230
people who suffer from it and at the
 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.740
people who suffer from it and at the
same time even the most biological

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750
same time even the most biological
 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.790
same time even the most biological
finding reflects social social context

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800
finding reflects social social context
 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.500
finding reflects social social context
in very important ways and so I think

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510
in very important ways and so I think
 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.440
in very important ways and so I think
psychiatry is better off looking both at

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450
psychiatry is better off looking both at
 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.690
psychiatry is better off looking both at
biology and at social contexts and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700
biology and at social contexts and
 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.650
biology and at social contexts and
really trying to think of the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660
really trying to think of the
 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.140
really trying to think of the
relationship between those and I think

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150
relationship between those and I think
 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.610
relationship between those and I think
doctors and patients are better off that

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620
doctors and patients are better off that
 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.490
doctors and patients are better off that
way we certainly know that depression is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500
way we certainly know that depression is
 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.490
way we certainly know that depression is
an illness all you have to do is watch

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500
an illness all you have to do is watch
 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.260
an illness all you have to do is watch
an antidepressant advertisement on

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270
an antidepressant advertisement on
 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.690
an antidepressant advertisement on
television right now and think about why

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700
television right now and think about why
 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.460
television right now and think about why
might it be that a person might see an

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470
might it be that a person might see an
 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.710
might it be that a person might see an
ad like that what are the forces that

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720
ad like that what are the forces that
 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.020
ad like that what are the forces that
are leading them to go in and ask a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030
are leading them to go in and ask a
 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.550
are leading them to go in and ask a
doctor in part in part it might be that

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
doctor in part in part it might be that
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.460
doctor in part in part it might be that
that ad speaks to some symptoms they're

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470
that ad speaks to some symptoms they're
 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.199
that ad speaks to some symptoms they're
having that are chemical symptoms but

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209
having that are chemical symptoms but
 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.410
having that are chemical symptoms but
you many of these ads play off of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420
you many of these ads play off of
 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.820
you many of these ads play off of
familiar cultural stereotypes about

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
familiar cultural stereotypes about
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.850
familiar cultural stereotypes about
gender or parenting or social class

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
gender or parenting or social class
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.800
gender or parenting or social class
other kinds of things and so I think

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
other kinds of things and so I think
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.649
other kinds of things and so I think
doctors need to be aware of both that

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659
doctors need to be aware of both that
 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.270
doctors need to be aware of both that
depression as one example is an illness

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
depression as one example is an illness
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.440
depression as one example is an illness
that has a chemical basis but also is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
that has a chemical basis but also is
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.340
that has a chemical basis but also is
deeply embedded in cultural norms about

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
deeply embedded in cultural norms about
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.830
deeply embedded in cultural norms about
gender social class race so that would

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840
gender social class race so that would
 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.449
gender social class race so that would
be one example there's great work that's

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459
be one example there's great work that's
 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.150
be one example there's great work that's
been done now on bipolar disorder by

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
been done now on bipolar disorder by
 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.240
been done now on bipolar disorder by
emily martin here at nyu and looking at

emily martin here at nyu and looking at
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.820
emily martin here at nyu and looking at
the kind of cultural basis of bipolar

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830
the kind of cultural basis of bipolar
 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.630
the kind of cultural basis of bipolar

something that there's a lot of popular

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
something that there's a lot of popular
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.050
something that there's a lot of popular
conversation about and so i think again

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
conversation about and so i think again
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.790
conversation about and so i think again
it's true for all illness but it's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
it's true for all illness but it's
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.290
it's true for all illness but it's
certainly true for psychiatric illness

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300
certainly true for psychiatric illness
 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.560
certainly true for psychiatric illness
that these illnesses often reflect

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570
that these illnesses often reflect
 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.740
that these illnesses often reflect
cultural norms in addition to biological

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750
cultural norms in addition to biological
 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.060
cultural norms in addition to biological
realities and really we have to be

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070
realities and really we have to be
 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.360
realities and really we have to be
fluent in both

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370
 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.970
well again I I think that we're we're

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980
well again I I think that we're we're
 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.380
well again I I think that we're we're
making a mistake if we don't see that

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390
making a mistake if we don't see that
 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.740
making a mistake if we don't see that
there's a cultural basis too many

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
there's a cultural basis too many
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080
there's a cultural basis too many
illnesses not just psychiatric ones

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090
illnesses not just psychiatric ones
 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.479
illnesses not just psychiatric ones
breast cancer would be one prevalent

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489
breast cancer would be one prevalent
 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.220
breast cancer would be one prevalent
example right now different kind of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230
example right now different kind of
 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.750
example right now different kind of
cultures surrounding it if you don't

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
cultures surrounding it if you don't
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.309
cultures surrounding it if you don't
understand the cultural meaning of an

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319
understand the cultural meaning of an
 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.350
understand the cultural meaning of an
illness like that you're gonna you're

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360
illness like that you're gonna you're
 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.089
illness like that you're gonna you're
gonna miss the boat even if you're a

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099
gonna miss the boat even if you're a
 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.690
gonna miss the boat even if you're a
great scientist so I don't think it's

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
great scientist so I don't think it's
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.460
great scientist so I don't think it's
the case that it's just psychiatric

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470
the case that it's just psychiatric
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.500
the case that it's just psychiatric
disorders but we know from history that

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
disorders but we know from history that
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.100
disorders but we know from history that
when we get the ultimate you know cure

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
when we get the ultimate you know cure
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110
when we get the ultimate you know cure
for a particular illness or nail it down

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120
for a particular illness or nail it down
 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030
for a particular illness or nail it down
it stops being a psychiatric illness and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040
it stops being a psychiatric illness and
 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.610
it stops being a psychiatric illness and
then it's taken up by internal medicine

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620
then it's taken up by internal medicine
 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.770
then it's taken up by internal medicine
or you know we know oh it was just an

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780
or you know we know oh it was just an
 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.110
or you know we know oh it was just an
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.699
iron imbalance or it was a vitamin
deficiency or something like that that

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709
deficiency or something like that that
 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.530
deficiency or something like that that
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.740
in a way it's taken away from psychiatry
and taken taken to medicine but but I

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750
and taken taken to medicine but but I
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.650
and taken taken to medicine but but I
think that's you know if you look at

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
think that's you know if you look at
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.289
think that's you know if you look at
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in
 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.690
diagnostic rates and treatment rates in
psychiatric disorders it's it's even

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700
psychiatric disorders it's it's even
 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.729
psychiatric disorders it's it's even
with all the controversy about SSRIs

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739
with all the controversy about SSRIs
 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.009
with all the controversy about SSRIs
right now the the improvement rates are

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
right now the the improvement rates are
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.449
right now the the improvement rates are
reasonably good compared to other

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459
reasonably good compared to other
 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.550
reasonably good compared to other
medical specialties and so I think it's

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560
medical specialties and so I think it's
 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.170
medical specialties and so I think it's
it's always going to be a negotiation

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
it's always going to be a negotiation
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.140
it's always going to be a negotiation
about what's the best way to understand

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150
about what's the best way to understand
 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.969
about what's the best way to understand
psychiatric illness but of course the

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979
psychiatric illness but of course the
 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.159
psychiatric illness but of course the
flip side of that is that there is this

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169
flip side of that is that there is this
 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.219
flip side of that is that there is this
aura of it's something we don't know in

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229
aura of it's something we don't know in
 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.779
aura of it's something we don't know in
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry
 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.190
a certain kind of way and so psychiatry
is always kind of fighting against that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200
is always kind of fighting against that
 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.590
is always kind of fighting against that
and probably that's why we had a move

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600
and probably that's why we had a move
 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.409
and probably that's why we had a move
toward saying things are slowly

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
toward saying things are slowly
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.029
toward saying things are slowly
biological in a certain kind of way is

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039
biological in a certain kind of way is
 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.159
biological in a certain kind of way is
to you know rightly move toward a more

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169
to you know rightly move toward a more
 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.770
to you know rightly move toward a more
scientific basis

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780
 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.840
terrific well I mean it's it's there are

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850
terrific well I mean it's it's there are
 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.760
terrific well I mean it's it's there are
really exciting things happening in

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770
really exciting things happening in
 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100
really exciting things happening in
genetics and neurobiology right now and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110
genetics and neurobiology right now and
 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.700
genetics and neurobiology right now and
really looking at the ways in which

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
really looking at the ways in which
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.800
really looking at the ways in which
difference just not just illnesses but

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
difference just not just illnesses but
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.540
difference just not just illnesses but
social conditions and social pressures

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550
social conditions and social pressures
 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.240
social conditions and social pressures
can actually lead to actual brain

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250
can actually lead to actual brain
 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.030
can actually lead to actual brain
changes you know there was a lot of

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040
changes you know there was a lot of
 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.320
changes you know there was a lot of
promise in the development of

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330
promise in the development of
 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.240
promise in the development of
pharmaceuticals particularly with the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
pharmaceuticals particularly with the
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.200
pharmaceuticals particularly with the
advent of newer generation of anti

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210
advent of newer generation of anti
 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.290
advent of newer generation of anti
psychotics and anti depressants and we

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
psychotics and anti depressants and we
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.150
psychotics and anti depressants and we
know from history that there's a kind of

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160
know from history that there's a kind of
 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.850
know from history that there's a kind of
natural trajectory of the way that these

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860
natural trajectory of the way that these
 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.390
natural trajectory of the way that these
own that these medications come out and

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400
own that these medications come out and
 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.820
own that these medications come out and
are accepted so initially we say these

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
are accepted so initially we say these
 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.240
are accepted so initially we say these
are cures for everything under the Sun

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250
are cures for everything under the Sun
 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.130
are cures for everything under the Sun
and there's this dramatic rise and then

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140
and there's this dramatic rise and then
 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.330
and there's this dramatic rise and then
we say wait a minute these don't work

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340
we say wait a minute these don't work
 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.100
we say wait a minute these don't work
for anything which i think is happening

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110
for anything which i think is happening
 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.710
for anything which i think is happening
with the SSRI antidepressants right now

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720
with the SSRI antidepressants right now
 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.000
with the SSRI antidepressants right now
and then we kind of figure out a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010
and then we kind of figure out a
 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.159
and then we kind of figure out a
moderated use of well they're good for

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169
moderated use of well they're good for
 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.050
moderated use of well they're good for
some conditions and not for others and

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060
some conditions and not for others and
 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.970
some conditions and not for others and
so again as I say I think that there's a

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980
so again as I say I think that there's a
 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.060
so again as I say I think that there's a
a give-and-take that's part of the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070
a give-and-take that's part of the
 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.250
a give-and-take that's part of the
process and part of it is based in

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260
process and part of it is based in
 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.890
process and part of it is based in
science but I also think you know the

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900
science but I also think you know the
 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.080
science but I also think you know the
1990s were often called the decade of

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090
1990s were often called the decade of
 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.570
1990s were often called the decade of
the brain and psychiatry where we didn't

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580
the brain and psychiatry where we didn't
 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.370
the brain and psychiatry where we didn't
need to worry about Freud or about

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380
need to worry about Freud or about
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.909
need to worry about Freud or about
gender psychoanalysis context all these

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919
gender psychoanalysis context all these
 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.620
gender psychoanalysis context all these
things were in certain ways kind of

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630
things were in certain ways kind of
 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.120
things were in certain ways kind of
pitched out the window because we were

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
pitched out the window because we were
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.350
pitched out the window because we were
going to get the answer to everything

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360
going to get the answer to everything
 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.680
going to get the answer to everything
from brain scans and I think psychiatry

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690
from brain scans and I think psychiatry
 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.260
from brain scans and I think psychiatry
itself has come to in a way like

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270
itself has come to in a way like
 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.380
itself has come to in a way like
medications are more moderated

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390
medications are more moderated
 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.120
medications are more moderated
understanding of the brain itself is

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130
understanding of the brain itself is
 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.100
understanding of the brain itself is
very important but you don't really know

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110
very important but you don't really know
 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.510
very important but you don't really know
anything about the brain unless you know

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520
anything about the brain unless you know
 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.350
anything about the brain unless you know
about social context expectations stigma

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
about social context expectations stigma
 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.640
about social context expectations stigma
as other kinds of things and so

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650
as other kinds of things and so
 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.159
as other kinds of things and so
hopefully these findings will continue

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169
hopefully these findings will continue
 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.320
hopefully these findings will continue
to be understood in in social context

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.389
you
