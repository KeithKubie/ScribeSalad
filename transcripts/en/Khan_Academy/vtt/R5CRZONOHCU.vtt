00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.400
Most physics books will tell
you that the acceleration

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.470
due to gravity near the
surface of the Earth

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.240
is 9.81 meters per
second squared.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.000
And this is an approximation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.030
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.710
is figure out if this is the
value we get when we actually

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.940
use Newton's law of
universal gravitation.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.380
And that tells us that the
force of gravity between two

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.595
objects-- and let's just
talk about the magnitude

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.210
of the force of gravity
between two objects--

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.910
is equal to the universal
gravitational constant times

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.680
the mass of one of the
bodies, M1, times the mass

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.340
of the second body divided by
the distance between the center

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.150
of masses of the bodies squared.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.840
So let's use this, the
universal law of gravitation

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.340
to figure out what the
acceleration due to gravity

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430
should be at the
surface of the Earth.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.430
And I have a g right over here.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.870
I have the mass of the Earth,
which I've looked up over here.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.649
And we also have the
radius of the Earth.

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.190
And for the sake of
this, we're going

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.650
to assume that the distance
between the body, if we're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.300
at the the surface of the
Earth, the distance between that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.020
and the center of
the Earth is just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.130
going to be the
radius of the Earth.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.272
And so this will give us
the magnitude of the force.

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:30.730
If we want to figure out the
magnitude of the acceleration,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.855
which this really is-- I
actually didn't write this

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:33.560
is a vector.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.810
So this is just the magnitude
of the acceleration.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.893
If you wanted the acceleration,
which is a vector,

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:42.590
you'd have to say downwards or
towards the center of the Earth

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.830
in this case.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.090
But if you want
the acceleration,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.920
we just have to
remember that force

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.630
is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.560
And if you wanted to
solve for acceleration

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280
you just divide both
sides times mass.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.050
So force divided by mass
is equal to acceleration.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.330
Or if you take the
magnitude of your force

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.110
and you divide by
mass, you're going

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.130
to get the magnitude
of your acceleration.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.310
This is a scalar quantity.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.560
This is a scalar
quantity right over here.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.740
So if you want the acceleration
due to gravity, you divide.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.100
Let's write this in terms of
the force of gravity on Earth.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.940
So the magnitude of
the force of gravity

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.310
on Earth, this one
right over here.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.980
So this will be in
the case of Earth.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.060
I just wrote Earth
really, really small.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.500
So one of these masses
is going to be Earth.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.140
It's going to be this
mass right over here.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.520
And so if you wanted
the acceleration

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.920
due to gravity at the
surface of the Earth,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.170
you would just have to
divide by the mass that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890
is being accelerated
due to that force.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.940
And in this case, it
is the other mass.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.920
It is the mass that's
sitting on the surface.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.150
So let's divide both
sides by that mass.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.050
Let's divide both
sides by that mass.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.400
And this will give
us the magnitude

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.270
of the acceleration on
that mass due to gravity.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.550
So this is equal to the
magnitude of acceleration,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.189
due to gravity.

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.730
And the whole reason why this
is actually a simplifying thing

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.620
is that these two, this M2
right over here and this M2

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.750
cancels out.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.680
And so the magnitude
of our acceleration

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.120
due to gravity using Newton's
universal law of gravitation

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.110
is just going to be this
expression right over here.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.570
It's going to be the
gravitational constant times

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.250
the mass of the Earth
divided by the distance

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.900
between the object's
center of mass

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.710
and the center of the
mass of the Earth.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.780
And we're going to
assume that the object is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.654
right at the surface,
that its center of mass

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:51.930
is right at the surface.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.900
So this is actually going to
be the radius of the Earth

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.430
squared, so divided
by radius squared.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.320
Sometimes this is also viewed
as the gravitational field

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.650
at the surface of the Earth.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.280
Because if you
multiply it by a mass,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.537
it tells you how much force
is pulling on that mass.

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:10.370
But with that out of
the way, let's actually

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.360
use a calculator to
calculate what this value is.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.089
And then what I want to do
is figure out, well, one,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.630
I want to compare
it to the value

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.470
that the textbooks
give us and see, maybe,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.950
why it may or may
not be different.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.680
And then think
about how it changes

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.191
as we get further
and further away

00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:26.440
from the surface of the Earth.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.880
And in particular, if
we get to an altitude

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.320
that the space shuttle or the
International Space Station

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.600
might be at, and this is at
an altitude of 400 kilometers

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.740
is where it tends to
hang out, give or take

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.910
a little bit, depending
on what it is up to.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.250
So first, let's just
figure out what this value

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.590
is when we use a universal
law of gravitation.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.730
So let's get my calculator out.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.900
So we know what g is.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.740
It is 6.6738 times 10
to the negative 11.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.340
This EE button means, literally,
times 10 to the negative 11.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.517
So this is 6.6738 times
10 to the negative 11.

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:09.100
And then I want to
multiply that times

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.410
the mass of Earth, which
is right over here.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.280
That is 5.9722 times
10 to the 24th.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.460
So times 10 to the 24th power.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.060
And we want to divide that by
the radius of Earth squared.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.900
So divided by the
radius of Earth

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.377
is-- so this is in kilometers.

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:33.210
And I just want to make
sure that everything

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.710
is the same units.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.980
So 6,371 kilometers--
actually, let me scroll over.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.855
Well, you can't see the
kilometers right now.

00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:42.200
But this is kilometers.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.900
It is the same thing
as 6,371,000 meters.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.750
If you just multiply
this by 1,000.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.990
Or you could even
write this as 6.371.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.690
6.371 times 10 to
the sixth meters.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.010
And we're going to square this.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.301
That's the radius of the Earth.

00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.220
The distance between the center
of mass of Earth and the center

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.060
of mass of this object,
which is sitting

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.960
at the surface of the Earth.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.100
And so let's get our drum roll.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.959
And we get 9.8.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.250
And if we round, we actually
get something a little bit

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.420
higher than what the
textbooks give us.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.250
We get 9.82.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.330
Let's just round.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.019
So we get 9.82-- 9.82
meters per second squared.

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:33.060
And so you might say,
well, what's going on here?

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.260
Why do we have this
discrepancy between what

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.470
the universal law of
gravitation gives us

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.460
and what the average
measured acceleration

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.680
due to the force of gravity
at the surface of the Earth.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.870
And the discrepancy here, the
discrepancy between these two

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.550
numbers, is really
because Earth is not

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.419
a uniform sphere
of uniform density.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.210
And that's what we have
to assume over here

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.360
when we use the universal
law of gravitation.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.050
It's actually a little bit
flatter than a perfect sphere.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.050
And it definitely does
not have uniform density.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.508
The different layers of the
Earth have different densities.

00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:09.460
You have all sorts of
different interactions.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.950
And then you also, if you
measure effective gravity,

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.810
there's also a little bit of a
buoyancy effect from the air.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.750
Very, very, very,
very negligible, I

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.320
don't know if it would have
been enough to change this.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.450
But there's other minor,
minor effects, irregularities.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.700
Earth is not a perfect sphere.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.300
It is not of uniform density.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.990
And that's what accounts
for the bulk of this.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.440
Now, with that out of the
way, what I'm curious about

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.280
is what is the
acceleration due to gravity

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.870
if we go up 400 kilometers?

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.290
So now, the main difference
here, g will stay the same.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.940
The mass of Earth
will stay the same,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.010
but the radius is now
going to be different.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.510
Because now we're placing the
center of mass of our object--

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.010
whether it's a space station
or someone sitting in the space

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.540
station, they're going to
be 400 kilometers higher.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.490
And I'm going to exaggerate
what 400 kilometers looks like.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.106
This is not drawn to scale.

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:59.480
But now the radius is going
to be the radius of the Earth

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.020
plus 400 kilometers.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.290
So now, for the case
of the space station,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.130
r is going to be not
6,371 kilometers.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.680
It's going to be 6,000--
we're going to add 400

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.320
to this-- 6,771
kilometers, which

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.200
is the same thing as
6,771,000 meters, which

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.550
is the same thing as 6.771
times 10 to the sixth meters.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.080
This is-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6-- 10 to the sixth meters.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.659
So let's go back
to our calculator.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.090
So second entry, that's
the last entry we had.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.330
And instead of 6.371
times 10 to the sixth,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.030
let's add 400
kilometers to that.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.842
So then we get 6.7.

00:08:47.842 --> 00:08:50.280
So we're adding 400 kilometers.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.336
So it was 371.

00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:53.970
Now it's 771 times
10 to the sixth.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.290
And what do we get?

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.710
We get 8.69 meters
per second squared.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:09.140
So now the acceleration here is
8.69 meters per second squared.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.580
And you can verify that
the units work out.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.320
Because over here,
gravity is in meters

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.624
cubed per kilogram
second squared.

00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:17.540
You multiply that times
the mass of the Earth,

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.620
which is in kilograms.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.290
The kilograms cancel out
with these kilograms.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.300
And then you're dividing
by meters squared.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.690
So you divide this
by meters squared.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.940
You're left with meters
per second squared.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.472
So the units work out as well.

00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:32.180
So there's an important
thing to realize.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.346
And this is a misconception.

00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.080
We do a whole video
on it earlier,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.640
when we talk about the
universal law of gravitation,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.580
is that there is gravity when
you are in orbit up here.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.920
The only reason why it feels
like there's not gravity

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.420
or it looks like
there's not gravity

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.700
is that this space
station is moving

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.870
so fast that it's
essentially in free fall.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.555
But it's moving so fast that
it keeps missing the Earth.

00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:57.180
And in the next video,
we'll figure out

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.140
how fast does it have to
travel in order for it to stay

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.620
in orbit, in order for it to not
plummet to Earth due to this,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.150
due to the force of gravity,
due to the acceleration that

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.200
is occurring, this centripetal,
this center-seeking

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.600
acceleration?
