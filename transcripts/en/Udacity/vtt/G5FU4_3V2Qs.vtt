00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.810
To begin, you'll want to
identify the target languages and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.950
locales for your app.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.730
You can manage your app in three main
dimensions, country, locale, and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.660
language.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.610
Language is the key consideration for
localization, but

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.700
locale is significant to format dates,
times, currencies, and such.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.720
Users control what the language and
locale used on their Android device is,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.050
and those affect how your
app will be displayed.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.790
After you've identified your targets,
you can focus your development,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.800
translation, testing, and
marketing efforts to these markets.
