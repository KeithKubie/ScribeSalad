00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.878
I was so happy when the
- (laughs)

00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:06.844
- story of Robert Kraft
going to the Orchids of Asia

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:11.319
massage parlor in Florida
came out that we were

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.917
as far away from the podcast as possible.

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:19.218
I was thinking, okay,
by the time we get back

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.717
this will have died down.

00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:23.681
It's kind of like old news and weird

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.339
to be talking about it now,

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.390
because of every story
that we've talked about

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.209
on this podcast that could
potentially get me in trouble

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:35.763
with the company that pays
my employment, this is it,

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:38.119
this is the one that I'm
the most worried about.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:42.259
This is the story that is
most likely to get me fired.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.249
- (exhales)

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.072
- So I don't want to deal with it.

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.006
Everyone knows what happened.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.521
- You know what?

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:52.317
I didn't want to deal with
the suicide of my friend.

00:00:52.317 --> 00:00:53.150
But I did it.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.079
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.279
- Can't keep playing the suicide card.

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:58.323
- So I want you to break
this story down for me.

00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:01.197
I'm a little familiar, you know.

00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:03.063
I don't work for the NFL Network,

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.651
so I'm not privy to the
details that you are.

00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.793
Gregg, do your job right now,

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:12.911
and break this story down
for me, piece by piece.

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:13.744
- All right.

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:15.987
Robert Kraft, Patriots owner, was charged

00:01:15.987 --> 00:01:19.287
in a Florida prostitution investigation

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:22.811
Palm Beach State Attorney released--

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.521
Anthony's dancing.

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.381
We're not using this as our social video.

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:29.307
We're not using it as anything.

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:34.257
He was charged for two charges,
of soliciting prostitution

00:01:34.257 --> 00:01:36.303
- That means he went twice,
they caught him twice on camera.

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:39.303
- Right. He was Male 13,
and I believe he ended up

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:41.564
being Male 8 as well.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:45.677
Two times within 24 hours,
and one of those times

00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:47.067
was actually the morning--

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.470
- Two within 24 hours?

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.303
- [Gregg] Yeah.

00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:50.269
- He went back?

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:51.102
- It was like nighttime, and then, yeah

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:52.923
it was like 5 o'clock.

00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:56.217
This is 5 p.m., and then he
came back the next morning

00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:59.733
before taking a flight
that morning to Kansas City

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.765
for the AFC Championship game, on the way

00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:03.933
to the Patriots sixth Super Bowl!

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.183
How about that.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.527
- I feel like the Super
Bowl is null and void

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.695
I think they might take it away.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.503
- Oh, please. Like, this is one of the--

00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:11.951
There's a lot of things about this story

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:13.511
but one of the most annoying things is

00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.371
non-Patriots fans being like "Oooooooh!"

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:16.901
Like, "How are you feeling now?"

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.278
It's like, I don't give a shit.

00:02:18.278 --> 00:02:19.111
- [Anthony] Nah. Nah.

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:19.944
- [Gregg] You know.

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:20.777
It's like--

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:21.610
- That's what's so great about this story,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.269
it doesn't take away
anything from the team.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.102
It's not like--

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.263
- I don't root for the--

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:28.503
I don't get into sports
to root for the owner.

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:30.371
- I met him once.

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.103
I was hiking with Jeff Ross,

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:34.615
and he and his supermodel
girlfriend asked me

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.897
to take a picture of them
in front of a street sign

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:39.845
that I guess was the name
of one of their friends

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:41.967
and Jeff Ross said, "Go Patriots."

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.103
And I just stared at him.

00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:46.977
Because, you know what, I
could see it in his face,

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:49.466
you're the kind of guy
who goes to sex slaves.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:50.425
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:51.666
- Well, he didn't you know, so

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.357
that's the bigger story is
everyone is focused on Kraft

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:58.500
and it's like, it's a bigger
operation of that, you know

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.207
underage sex workers and all that

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:02.321
and that's all serious
- [Anthony] Listen

00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.211
- I don't know how old they are.

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.731
I don't know if they wanted to be there

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:07.969
or didn't want to be there,
that's besides the point.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.802
The funny part of this
to me is that it's a...

00:03:13.704 --> 00:03:15.454
it's a massage shack.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.689
That's how I'mna say it so
my mom can be okay with it.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:21.897
It's a massage shack, you can get a

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.314
half-hour massage

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.343
and happy ending.

00:03:26.343 --> 00:03:28.638
It's a half an hour away from his house.

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:29.471
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.539
- He can get people to come to him.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.671
I don't know if you guys are familiar

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.626
with how the sex service industry works,

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:38.059
but you don't have to take
- We know you are.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.209
You don't have to take a road trip.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.151
They'll come to you, you know what I mean?

00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.390
And, I don't know if he was,
like, in love with one of them,

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.104
but it's hilarious to me
that this guy went there,

00:03:51.104 --> 00:03:52.245
to do that,

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.571
twice in 24 hours?

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:55.830
Amazing.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.930
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.831
- It's like, maybe he'd never
gotten a hand job before.

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.469
That's the only way I can
think he would go back twice.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.302
Like, he was like, "Oh my God,

00:04:04.302 --> 00:04:05.135
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:06.431
"I've been doing it wrong

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.013
"the whole time."

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:09.251
"I gotta get back to this massage parlor

00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.766
"half an hour away."

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:15.040
I wish I could hear him
telling his driver where to go.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.873
You know what I mean?

00:04:15.873 --> 00:04:17.885
That would be funny.

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:19.052
"Uh, Manuel...

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:22.984
"take 19, down to uh...

00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:24.429
that strip mall.

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:28.458
"And then wait for me for 30 minutes."

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:30.338
- Way to be racist with the driver

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:32.314
- Manuel, I think it's
a common Florida name

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:33.150
- [Gregg] (laughs)

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.983
- I don't think I'm being racist

00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:37.177
- If you read, so this
is all public information

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:40.636
they released the
probable cause affidavit.

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:44.458
One of the things that stuck out to me was

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:47.375
that he hugged the woman...

00:04:48.874 --> 00:04:50.058
each time.

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:52.769
So, that would, to me that was
the strangest thing about it.

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:53.858
- In the beginning or the end?

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:55.019
- Both.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:56.459
He hugged hello.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:59.040
He hugged hello, there are some details.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.422
It has it all written out, one of them

00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:04.005
included one woman,

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.021
included oral sex being performed

00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:12.950
and the other one,
actually, included two women

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.871
in the room, it was a repeat woman

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:19.606
and yeah, it talked about
massaging the genitals.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:20.700
- And, uh

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.780
- [Gregg] The two women

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.706
- That is phenomenal.

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:28.004
Listen, and you guys don't have
the money that I have to be

00:05:28.004 --> 00:05:30.106
throwing at sex workers.
- And it was $100.

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:31.066
- Yeah, a hundred bucks?

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:32.668
He can do better.

00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:34.328
Like when Jerry Jones,
remember those pictures

00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:35.745
of Jerry Jones with his, like, pant leg?

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:39.202
Those girls were expensive,
that he was with.

00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:40.910
He wasn't going to...

00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:42.751
He wasn't going

00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.291
to get a half and half

00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:47.124
in 30 minutes or less.

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:50.812
I think that all the other
owners are making fun of him

00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:52.366
so hard right now.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:56.776
Every single NFL owner has
had sex with a sex worker.

00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:57.876
I would guarantee it.

00:05:57.876 --> 00:05:58.709
- Stop

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:00.382
- Oh, I would guarantee it.

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:01.492
That level of money--

00:06:01.492 --> 00:06:03.472
- How about Gayle Benson?
- that travel?

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:05.400
- Gayle Benson's the worst of all of 'em.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.184
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:10.627
- Okay? Gayle Benson, I don't even want

00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:12.645
to get into Gayle Benson.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.014
Gayle Benson's gettin' happy endings.

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:17.722
Gayle Benson's gettin' happy beginnings.

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:21.466
Gayle Benson, for lunch,
gets a little happiness.

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.925
Alright, everyone knows that.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:24.758
Everyone.

00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:27.436
- Erica and Emma are
beaming with the thought

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:28.290
that my career is ending
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.217
with every word.
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.428
- Jerry Jones is laughing right now.

00:06:33.428 --> 00:06:34.282
- What about the Packers?

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:37.844
They have that whole thing
where there is no owner,

00:06:37.844 --> 00:06:41.002
but you can buy a stock certificate,

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.690
so there's like, hundreds, there's tens

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.916
of thousands of owners.

00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:47.172
- Mmm hmmm. They have, like an orgy, like

00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:50.362
in the second Matrix movie,
where they go to Lambeau,

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:52.978
and they all just start
writhing on each other

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:56.090
- The worst movie and the
worst movie scene ever

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.923
- It's the worst

00:06:56.923 --> 00:06:58.334
- [Gregg] It's the worst movie ever

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.660
- It's the most, like,
why did you do this to us?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.263
We loved you and you ruined us

00:07:02.263 --> 00:07:03.464
with this scene in this movie.

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.872
But it's like that, in Lambeau.

00:07:05.872 --> 00:07:08.610
And then, at the end of it, almost like

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.252
in a Santa Claus type way they have money

00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:11.820
in their pockets.
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.701
- They don't know how it got there.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.974
It's 40 fish, and bread.

00:07:15.974 --> 00:07:17.730
It's that kind of thing, it's biblical.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.182
- If we were ranking the fan bases

00:07:20.182 --> 00:07:25.182
that you'd least want to see
in a stadium-filled orgy,

00:07:25.206 --> 00:07:27.044
I feel like the Packers
would be dead last.

00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:27.877
I mean,

00:07:27.877 --> 00:07:28.917
they would be right there.
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:30.295
- I don't know, I mean I don't know.

00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:31.128
- [Woman] I agree.

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:32.502
- Listen, I don't know if you guys

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:35.158
have ever been to Philadelphia.

00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:37.099
But, it is a...

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:41.049
it's a dark mirror of what
normal people look like.

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:43.634
So I would think, I would
put the Eagles in there.

00:07:43.634 --> 00:07:47.990
You know, but I'm sure
the people who own stock

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.300
in the Packers are ugly, ugly people.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.772
- They have it, like,
framed in their family room

00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:54.605
and everything.

00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:55.438
Very happy.
- [Anthony] Of course.

00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:56.496
- Of course.

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.820
But whoever has the most of those

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.762
has the most paid-for sex.

00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:02.998
- [Gregg] (laughs)

00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:06.052
- It's just what you
do when you own a team.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.121
They don't have to be slaves.

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.718
Sex slavery, I'm against it.

00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:11.892
You know what I mean, you
want to be a sex worker

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:15.544
that's what you want
to do, it's a fine job.

00:08:15.544 --> 00:08:18.448
I hope for more protection
for them, you see

00:08:18.448 --> 00:08:20.413
the way they handle it in Europe.

00:08:20.413 --> 00:08:22.326
Here it's starting to
get a little bit better.

00:08:22.326 --> 00:08:23.159
I'm not against sex workers--

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:24.898
- [Woman] How do they handle it in Europe?

00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:26.872
- It's like, they're government tested.

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:27.705
You know what I mean, if you go

00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:29.662
through the red light
district in Amsterdam,

00:08:29.662 --> 00:08:32.992
which I'm sure you will,
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.710
- they have to get tested, they
have to have a certificate.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.226
It's like, you get in an elevator

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:37.792
- It's like in Vegas!

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:38.896
Isn't it similar in Vegas?

00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:39.729
- I don't know.

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:40.562
- [Gregg] I don't know.

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.395
- [Gregg] I've never been there, but--

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.698
But maybe, possibly? I don't know.

00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:44.228
- [Woman] (laughs)

00:08:44.228 --> 00:08:46.009
- I know they're trying
to do better for it,

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:48.175
but there's sex workers who
are like, "This is my job,

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.446
"this is what I do,
I'm not ashamed of it."

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.279
Okay.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.902
There's people who've
been abducted, and lied to

00:08:53.902 --> 00:08:55.485
and kept in a room.

00:08:56.632 --> 00:08:57.998
That's way worse.

00:08:57.998 --> 00:08:59.370
- [Woman] Taken?

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.491
- A little Taken. A little Taken action.

00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:04.325
Although, why would you
steal an American girl,

00:09:04.325 --> 00:09:06.885
when you know Liam
Neeson's coming for you,

00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:09.569
when you can just take,
some of these girls

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:12.135
from these, like, Russian towns where they

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:15.496
just want a better life,
and they get lied to,

00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:18.046
and they're told they're
going to be a singer,

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:21.106
and then all of a sudden
they're addicted to heroin.

00:09:21.106 --> 00:09:23.939
If you haven't seen the
movie Eastern Promises,

00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:25.177
go see it.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.813
It'll tell you everything you
need to know

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.663
about Robert Kraft.
