00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Look at this. This is amazing. Type it into Google for yourself.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can see for any reasonable amount of rounding

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for small angles, sin θ is equal to θ, and it's so close.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's such a good approximation that we can actually do physics with it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Instead of writing a = -gsinθ, we can now write a a -gθ.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, we're making some progress. We're not quite there yet.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This doesn't look like an x or anything.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is an angle, not a distance. What can we do?
