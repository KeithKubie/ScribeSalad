ANDREW HOUCK: Having a tag
like the Jacobus Fellowship

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.546
is something that
really helps her

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.570
get recognition outside of
the Princeton community,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.787
so that she can really achieve
her goals over her career.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.870
NEEREJA SUNDARESAN: My
name is Neereja Sundaresan.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.840
I am a graduate student in
the electrical engineering

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.160
department and my research is
using superconducting circuits

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.470
to study many-body
quantum optics.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.730
ANDREW HOUCK: Neereja is
an exceptional student.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.970
She -- everybody in lab
calls her rabbit foot.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.760
She's just seems
to get experiments

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.960
to work that seem really
challenging and difficult.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.580
And so I mean, I feel like
I've known her since she

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.810
was a sophomore in college.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.690
She came and worked in
my lab over the summer.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.769
And even in eight weeks as a
summer intern, as a sophomore,

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.310
you could give her
a problem, and she

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.750
would come back with really nice
solutions that worked really

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.830
well.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.680
Since she started as a graduate
student, every experiment she's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.650
been given, she just
keeps plugging away

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.680
and gets things that seem
difficult, challenging,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.707
impossible to work.

00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.290
NEEREJA SUNDARESAN:
So we take a piece

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.720
of sapphire, which
looks very clear,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.490
and we take it
into the clean room

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.120
and we deposit on top of it
a very thin layer of niobium.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.750
And so when it goes down inside
our fridge to 10 millikelvin

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.767
or below its
critical temperature,

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:20.850
it actually superconducts.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520
So there's no loss.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.260
So you can imagine that if you
have a very, very long wire --

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.300
just any wire that you
might see in this room --

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.360
and you send in a
very weak signal,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.567
that wire itself is lossy, so
by the time you get to the end,

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:36.650
it's probably -- it's gone.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.524
And you're just having
a bunch of noise.

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:40.190
But if this is
superconducting, whatever

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.398
you put in at the beginning
will be there at the end.

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:44.660
So you can think of it
as not having any loss.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.030
And so what this
means is that you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.940
can design different
types of circuits

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.104
where loss is very,
very controlled.

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.770
ANDREW HOUCK: A really
excellent student

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.660
is one who can start
off in a direction

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.120
but keep their eyes
open, and really

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.640
keep thinking about what's
going on and figure out, 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.650
when is it more fruitful
to change direction?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.265
When is it more fruitful
to do this instead of that?

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.640
NEEREJA SUNDARESAN:
We understand

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.080
a lot of things about light.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.360
And we understand a lot
of things about photons.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.030
But we don't
understand everything.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.100
There's a lot out
there that people just

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.510
don't understand yet.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.690
It's something that will come
in the future, I have no doubt.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.330
But it's by doing
experiments and doing

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.040
careful theoretical
analysis that we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.846
understand how photons behave
in different environments.

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:30.470
Understanding them
and how they behave,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.950
and getting them
to behave the way

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.360
you want to is a really
exciting area of science.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.980
And so that's what
I'm interested in.
