00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.730
Graph the line that represents
a proportional relationship

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.130
between y and x with
a unit rate 0.4.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.390
That is, a change
of one unit in x

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.780
corresponds to a change
of 0.4 units in y.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.410
And they also ask
us to figure out

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.100
what the equation of
this line actually is.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.650
So let me get my scratch pad
out and we could think about it.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.350
So let's just think about some
potential x and y values here.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.077
So let's think about some
potential x and y values.

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:29.410
So when we're thinking about
proportional relationships,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.750
that means that y is going to be
equal to some constant times x.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.500
So if we have a
proportional relationship,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.570
if you have zero x's, it doesn't
matter what your constant here

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.670
is, you're going
to have zero y's.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.740
So the point 0, 0
should be on your line.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.280
So if this is the point 0, 0,
this should be on my line right

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.340
over there.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.330
Now, let's think about what
happens as we increase x.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.620
So if x goes from 0
to 1, we already know

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560
that a change of 1
unit in x corresponds

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.610
to a change of 0.4 units in y.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.470
So if x increases by 1, then
y is going to increase by 0.4.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.932
It's not so easy to
graph this 1 comma 0.4.

00:01:08.932 --> 00:01:12.560
The 0.4 is hard to graph on this
little tool right over here.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.730
So let's try to get this
to be a whole number.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.850
So then when x
increases another 1,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.900
y is going to
increase by 0.4 again.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.930
It's going to get to 0.8.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.580
When x increases
again by 1, then y

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370
is going to increase
by 0.4 again.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.540
It's going to get to 1.2.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.010
If x increases again, y is
going to increase by 0.4 again.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.920
So just to 1.6.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.400
Notice, every time x
is increasing by 1,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.940
y is increasing by 0.4.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.950
That's exactly what
they told us here.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.630
Now, if x increases
by 1 again to 5,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.350
then y is going to
increase 0.4 to 2.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.840
And I like this point because
this is nice and easy to graph.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.130
So we see that the point 0,
0 and the point 5 comma 2

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.357
should be on this graph.

00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:57.190
And I could draw it.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.060
And I'm going to do it on
the tool in a second as well.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.760
So it'll look
something like this.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.070
And notice the slope of
this actual graph over here.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.509
Notice the slope of
this actual graph.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.480
If our change in x is 5.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.810
So notice, here our
change in x is 5.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.285
Our change in x is 5.

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:20.160
You see that as well.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.220
When you go from 0 to 5,
this change in x is 5.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.500
Change in x is equal to 5.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.340
What was our
corresponding change in y?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.780
Well, our corresponding change
in y when our change in x

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.040
was 5, our change
in y was equal to 2.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.610
And you see that here,
when x went from 0 to 5,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.760
y went from 0 to 2.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.920
So our change in y in this
circumstance is equal to 2.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.890
So our slope, which
is change in y

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.320
over change in x, is
the rate of change

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.960
of your vertical
axis with respect

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.230
to your horizontal axis, is
going to be equal to 2 over 5,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.450
or 2/5.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.460
Which if you wrote it as
a decimal is equal to 0.4.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.807
So this right over
here is your slope.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.390
So I'm going to do
this with the tool.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.140
But first, let's
also think about what

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.560
the equation of this
line is going to be.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.460
Well, we know that y is equal
to some constant times x.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.700
And we know that
the point 5, 2 is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.780
on this line right over here.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.050
So we could say, well, when x
is equal to 5, y is equal to 2.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.960
Or, when y equals 2, we
have k times 5, or k is

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.660
equal to-- dividing both sides
by 5, you can't see that.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.410
If I divide both sides by 5,
I'm left with k is equal to 2/5.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.187
Which makes sense.

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:51.270
We're used to seeing this.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.130
When we have y is equal
to something times x,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.140
this something right over
here is going to be our slope.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.490
So the equation of the
line is y is equal to 0.4x.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.560
So let's fill this in.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.270
Let's actually do
the exercise now.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.490
So we had two points,
one was the point 0, 0.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.340
When x is 0, y is 0.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.339
And when x is 5, y
is 0.4 times that.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.490
So it's y is equal to 2.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:27.470
And we said the equation is
y is equal to 0.4 times x.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.930
So let's check our answer.
