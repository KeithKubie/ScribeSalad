JEFF GOTHELF: Good morning.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.050
Thank you guys for being here.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.300
What I want to talk about--
we have an hour together--

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.990
actually, a little less.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.406
We're starting a
few minutes late.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:10.870
So I want to get right to it.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.730
What we're going
to talk about today

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.600
is how to build successful
teams inside digital product

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.760
organizations like
Google and others,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.660
and how to do so focusing
really on a variety

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.860
of different things, including
evidence-based decision

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.010
making, customer centricity,
and really great design.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.191
And to start off, I don't know
how much you know about me,

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.940
but I want to share a
quick personal story

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.070
to start off the conversation.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.830
19 years ago, I graduated
from undergraduate school,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.490
and my first job
was with the circus.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.010
I ran away.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.360
I graduated on Saturday.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.680
Monday morning I
joined the circus,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.350
and spent the next six months on
the road with this circus right

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440
here-- the Clyde Beatty
Cole Brothers Circus, which

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.760
at the time was the largest
three-ring tented circus.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.800
I spent six months on
the road with them,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.830
traveling up and down.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.120
It was an I-95 Circus
is what they called it.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.170
And I saw the circus.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
We worked every day-- no days
off-- two shows every day,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.120
three shows on Saturday.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.820
So over the course
of six months,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.420
I saw the circus 400
times in a row-- note

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.790
for note, word for word.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.065
And needless to say,
my children will never

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.290
be going to the circus,
at least not with me.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.697
The interesting part, too, is
I was driving home actually

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:30.280
the other day.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.029
I was in the city.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.080
I live in New Jersey.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.500
And there it was.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830
I hadn't seen it in
probably in 19 years.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.020
And it was set up on Route 80
just outside of New Jersey.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.180
And it just looks a
little, slightly different,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.270
but it smelled the same.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.970
I went by there to see if
anybody I recognized was there.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.650
And over the course of the time
that I spent in the circus,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.576
I met a lot of
interesting people.

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:53.950
One of the interesting people
that I met during that time

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.780
was Steven Tyler.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.980
That's Steven Tyler right there.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.150
And that's actually me
next to him 19 years ago.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.444
Time's been a little rough to
my hairline in that time frame.

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:05.610
That was really interesting.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.840
He would come to the circus,
and we all got to meet him.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.464
He's done well.

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:11.640
He's preserved himself rather
well over the last 20 years.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730
He's got that secret formula.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.270
Another really
interesting person

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.940
that I got to meet while
I was there was this guy.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.860
That's the Human Cannonball.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.280
And in case you
can't see him, that's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.050
him at the top being
loaded into the cannon.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.860
And in the circus, there
was a lot of downtime.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.187
We worked two shows every
day, but once the last show

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:33.770
was finished, you
didn't have anything

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.740
to do until the next day
when the next show started.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.840
And so there's a
lot of downtime,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.367
really no internet in 1995,
certainly not mobile internet.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:44.450
And so you get to talking.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.670
And one of the questions
that I found fascinating

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.430
and I wanted to ask
was, how does one

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.420
become the Human Cannonball?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.130
What's the career
path to ending up

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.410
in this particular
position at some point?

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.400
So I asked him, and
he told me the story.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.769
And the story that he
told me is fascinating.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.310
And as these stories
tend to do, they

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.896
start with the previous
Human Cannonball.

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.520
That's how these
stories have to start.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.810
And so the previous
Human Cannonball

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.450
had this job before this guy.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.380
And the way that
this trick works

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.180
is it's not a real cannon
in the sense of there's

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.220
no fire or anything.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.740
There's a spring-loaded
mechanism in there.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.310
The guy slides down.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.660
The Ringmaster hits a button.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.668
There's a puff of smoke,
and then he shoots out.

00:03:25.668 --> 00:03:27.292
It pushes him out of
the cannon, and he

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:31.760
lands on the other side of the
tent in a net of some kind.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.930
Now the way that they
knew where to set up

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.050
the net with the previous
Human Cannonball was they

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.900
had a dummy-- a mannequin
that weighed the same

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.020
as the previous
Human Cannonball.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.700
And what they would
do is, they would

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.400
drive this red
truck into the tent.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.940
They would aim the cannon.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.370
They would load
the mannequin in.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.480
They would fire it, and they'd
kind of see where it landed.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.234
And they would put
the net up there.

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:54.650
And we did that
every other night,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.160
because we changed
venues every two days.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.706
One night, we were running
late-- or the previous Human

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:03.330
Cannonball-- I wasn't there that
year-- they were running late.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.464
And they got to the
next place late,

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:08.880
and they didn't have time to
test where to put the net up.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.735
And so they got the truck in
the tent, and they aimed it,

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:14.700
but they left the
dummy outside overnight

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.579
and it rained that night.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.120
And the next day,
assuming everything

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.245
was exactly the same, the
previous Human Cannonball

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.770
and his team loaded the
dummy into the cannon.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.490
They fired it.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.580
They saw where it landed.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.630
They put the net up.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.652
And that afternoon, in
front of 4,000 children,

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:33.110
the previous Human
Cannonball waved

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.690
goodbye to all those kids,
loaded himself into the cannon.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.390
They fired him off, and
he sails way past the net.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.890
All right, tragic story.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.710
He doesn't die.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.420
He ends up severely
injured, as you

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.360
could imagine,
from such a flight.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.910
And he goes back to
Florida where all circuses

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.726
come from-- in case
you didn't know that.

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.850
That's where they're based.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.260
But that's also
where they come from.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.390
And he sees his pool guy.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.091
His pool guy is this guy.

00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:01.590
And he says, hey, would you
like a job upgrade from pool guy

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.710
to Human Cannonball?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.710
You only have to work
four minutes a day,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.676
and here are the risks, though.

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:08.300
And the guy took the
gig, and so that's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.342
how this guy ended up
as the Human Cannonball.

00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:12.550
Why am I telling you this
story, besides it just kind

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.770
of being a fun story to
tell and a fascinating look

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.940
into this weird subculture that
I was a part of very briefly?

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.099
The reason is this-- the
Human Cannonball's team--

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.890
the previous Human
Cannonball's team-- made

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.360
the same assumptions every day.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.940
Everything's exactly
the same, so we

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.890
should work exactly
the same way,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.240
and assuming that the
results that we get

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.820
will be exactly the same.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.710
But as it turns out, the
assumptions that they did make

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.890
were wrong on that one day,
with very tragic consequences.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.070
And the same thing is true
in the world of software

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.570
these days.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.730
The way that we've
built software

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.229
in the past, and the way that
we're building software today,

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.690
and where it's
headed are changing.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.730
And the assumptions that
we're basing the way

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.950
that we build digital
products don't

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.420
work in today's realities in the
way that we're moving forward.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.030
And the reason
for that-- and you

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.530
guys should know this
really well here, obviously,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.040
is that software's eating the
world-- every business that's

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.340
of scale in the 21st century,
every business that seeks

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.610
to scale in the 21st
century, at its core

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.980
is a software business.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.680
It's a digital business.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.640
And this became really
evident recently

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.020
with the leaked New York
Times Innovation Report.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.110
I don't know if you guys
had a chance to read this,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.150
but this is a
fascinating document.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.340
It's an internal audit
that "The New York Times"

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.970
ran for six months to see
why Buzzfeed and the Verge

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.880
and Vox and Vice Media
were eating their lunch.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.340
And at the heart of
this-- at the root of all

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.780
this 90-page
document-- was the fact

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.050
that "The New York
Times" saw itself

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.980
as a journalistic
organization that

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.410
happened to deliver content
through a digital channel,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.040
amongst other channels.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.890
Whereas the recommendation
was to flip that on its head,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.350
and they needed to think of
themselves as a digital company

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.290
that happened to do
really great journalism.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.873
And that's really
where the disconnect

00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:56.040
is for this company, and
a lot of the companies

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.930
that I work for.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.260
And we're seeing this
across the board.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.830
We're seeing it at
FedEx, for example.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.913
What business is FedEx in?

00:07:00.913 --> 00:07:03.140
You could say it's logistics,
but in reality, it's

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.870
the software of logistics.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.740
It's the running of logistics.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.360
And I think in years
past, we've seen this.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.220
As software comes into play
into existing industries,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.410
the typical reaction
from those industries

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.970
is to push back, right?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.080
It's to say, this is not the
way that we'd like to work.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.910
Software is not
going to disrupt us.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.368
And there's no way
that we're going

00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:30.330
to sell our music in
this particular way,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.860
or use this
particular technology.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.360
In case you're curious, that's
Lars Ulrich from Metallica,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.230
who was really
loud, and very, very

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.284
present in the fight
against Napster

00:07:41.284 --> 00:07:42.450
when Napster first came out.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.940
There was no way
that he was going

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.930
to allow Metallica's
music to be sold that way.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.500
Surprisingly enough, Metallica
is now available on Spotify.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.690
So software inevitably
eats the world.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.060
We're seeing this again in
the world of cars, with Tesla.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.880
Tesla's trying to sell
directly to consumers.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.020
And what is the automotive
dealership lobby trying to do?

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.560
Litigate them out of existence.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.470
They're suing them
over and over again,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.000
so that they can't
bypass the dealership

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.120
and change the way that
we sell, and upgrade,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.110
and service our cars.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.527
Netflix is another
great example, right?

00:08:17.527 --> 00:08:19.360
No one ever thought
when Netflix came around

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.170
that we'd re-think the
way that we consume media,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.750
much less produce it.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.770
And yet today, try to
find a Blockbuster that's

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.972
still in business, right?

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:31.430
Now what's interesting
is that when

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.955
you're making products
in the physical world,

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:35.330
and you've got
this assembly-line

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.210
model of production,
it works well when you

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.530
know exactly what the
end state is going to be,

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.630
how it's going to be used, and
what it's going to look like.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.500
And that's great if you're
making cars, or TVs, or even

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.580
cell phones.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.700
But what we've done is
we've taken this model,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.470
and we've applied
it in many companies

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.700
directly to software,
where there's

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.481
become this kind of
assembly-line model of software

00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:57.980
development.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.850
Someone has to define it, and
then someone has to design it,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.850
and then someone has to develop
it, and test it, and deploy it.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.900
And what's interesting
is that in software, we

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.066
don't know what the end
state is going to be.

00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:10.440
In fact, I would
argue that there

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.579
is no end state to software.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:15.120
And I would also
argue that we really

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.060
don't know exactly how
our customers are going

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.470
to use the things that
we put in front of them.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.730
And so using this model
starts to break down.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.370
And it starts to break down for
this reason-- I think again,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.440
you guys know this better
than most companies--

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.160
that software has
become continuous.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.330
There is no end state.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.150
We just simply keep improving
it, optimizing it, iterating

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.710
it, moving it forward.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.800
There is no finished product.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.450
There is no big release.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.270
There's just
continuous deployment

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.980
and continuous release
to our customers.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.670
And then ultimately, from that
comes continuous learning.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.780
What I think it's
fascinating is this--

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.000
and I'm curious how
this compares here--

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.660
this is how often Amazon
pushes code to production.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.320
Some customer
somewhere sees new bits

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.750
every 11.6 seconds at Amazon.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.730
That's staggering.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.480
That's amazing, right?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.480
Five times a minute, they
are taking tiny risks.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.790
They're trying new things,
and then they're listening.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.623
They're sitting back,
and they're listening.

00:10:16.623 --> 00:10:20.055
They're sensing the
response from the market.

00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:21.262
Did they like it?

00:10:21.262 --> 00:10:22.470
Did it change their behavior?

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.870
Did it get them to do
something differently?

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.910
If it did, terrific.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.860
Let's scale that out.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.640
Let's optimize it.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.610
Let's design it better.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.340
Let's make it easier to use.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.300
And if it didn't, let's
learn why and roll it back.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.000
Now the impact, of course,
is that the learning is huge.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.880
If you get it wrong and you roll
it back, the failure is tiny.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.210
And so taking these
tiny risks allows

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.540
them to develop this sensing
layer with their customers.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.359
They're continually
having a conversation

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.900
with their customers,
so that they're

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.310
able to sense very
quickly, and then

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.620
in theory, they can
respond equally as quickly.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.670
This is working well.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.629
Let's scale it out.

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:00.670
This is not working well.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.930
Let's find out why, and
then let's try it again

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.720
a different way.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.350
Now the interesting thing is
that insight has two sides.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.080
We can't simply just
measure, and assume

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.760
that we know why something is
working or not working, right?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.030
That's the quantitative
side of things.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.570
Insight also has a
qualitative side.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.190
We have to understand why people
are actually behaving this way.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.170
What are they doing is
the quantitative side,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.211
and why they're doing it
is the qualitative side.

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:26.710
And together, we can
build a 360-degree view

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.700
that allows us to react
very, very quickly.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.490
By comparison, this is where I
used to work a dozen years ago.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.460
Our feedback cycle--
just to give you

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.240
a sense-- Amazon gets feedback,
let's say five times a minute,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.970
potentially.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.930
Our feedback loop at AOL
12 years ago was 12 months.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.220
We would work for six
months to get every bit

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.230
of code and design
perfect, because we

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.990
had to print 20
million of these,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.514
and then send them out
to people in the mail.

00:11:58.514 --> 00:12:00.180
And that's how people
consumed software.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.370
So six months of work to get
it done, ship it in the mail,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.320
wait for people to install
it, see how they use it,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.660
six months to collect data,
and then to ship again.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.160
Right?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.950
It's a 12-month-feedback
loop, whereas today,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.480
five times a minute you
can get that feedback.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.760
Back then, it made
sense to try to get

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.160
it as perfect as possible,
because again, you're

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.740
making 20 million copies
of this particular disc.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.430
Today we can update that
much more efficiently.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.820
And because of that, these
industrial-era management

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.810
tactics don't work with
continuous software.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.900
We can't manage an assembly
line and optimize a production

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.930
process, because
we don't know what

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.520
that end state needs to be.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.650
We have to continually
figure it out, sense it,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.960
and respond to it.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.580
And so as makers of
digital products,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.230
as makers of software working
in this continuous world,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.980
there's a few questions that we
need to answer for ourselves.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.401
The first is this-.

00:12:52.401 --> 00:12:54.400
What does this continuous
world mean for the way

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.177
that we build products
and organizations?

00:12:56.177 --> 00:12:58.760
It's not enough to just change
the way that we build products.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.593
We have to build the
companies and the teams

00:13:00.593 --> 00:13:04.640
around those products that
can work in this reality,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.420
and that can do their best
within this new world.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:08.934
Right?

00:13:08.934 --> 00:13:10.100
The second question is this.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.390
How can we take advantage
of all this information?

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.098
We've got all this
information coming in,

00:13:14.098 --> 00:13:15.985
quantitative data after
quantitative data,

00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:18.360
assuming you're doing the
research underneath it as well.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.210
You've got qualitative
and quantitative.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.200
How do we actually build a
team and an organization that

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.740
can take advantage
of that information?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.590
And then lastly, how can
we maximize the creativity,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.330
the learning, and
then ultimately,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.490
the productivity of
our teams in an effort

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.760
to do their best possible
work, to build the best

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.940
possible products
for our customers?

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.510
And so in order
to do so, in order

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.170
to survive in this
continuous world,

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.850
we have to build a
culture of learning.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.770
That's the key here.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.442
We have to change the mindset.

00:13:49.442 --> 00:13:51.150
It's not enough to
just deliver software.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.520
We have to actually deliver
learning on a continual basis.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.420
That's what the
Amazon teams get to do

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.490
with 11.6 seconds of release.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.570
They're building a
culture of learning.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.700
My friend Dave Gray
wrote a book about a year

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.659
or two ago called "The
Connected Company,"

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:09.200
and it's a terrific book, and
I highly recommend you read it.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.260
Now in that book, Dave talks
about two different types

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.560
of corporate strategy.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.010
The first is
deliberate strategy.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.520
Deliberate strategy comes
from the industrial-era mode

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.530
of thinking, where it's
the executive suite that

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.680
has all the ideas.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.177
That's where the creativity is.

00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:26.260
We'll come up with everything
that you need to do,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.718
and then we'll give
it to you guys,

00:14:27.718 --> 00:14:30.580
and you can go
forth and execute.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.690
And that's the reality.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.800
And what happens in that
is really interesting.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.133
I'll show it to you in this
really short video that I've

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:38.310
got in here, about
what actually happens

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.880
when you take deliberate
strategy to an extreme.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.770
And that's Johnny Depp as Willy
Wonka illustrating my point

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.290
for me.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.152
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:51.968
[WHIRRING]

00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:53.399
[DING]

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:55.660
-Do you mean that's it?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.140
-Do you even know what it is?

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.060
-It's gum.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.100
-Yeah.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.670
It's a stick of the most
amazing and sensational gum

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.270
in the whole universe.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.020
Know why?

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.570
Know why?

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.890
Because this gum is a
full, three-course dinner

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:09.520
all by itself.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.370
-Why would anyone want that?

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.614
-It will be the end of all
kitchens and all cooking.

00:15:24.614 --> 00:15:27.030
Just a little strip of Wonka's
Magic Chewing Gum, and that

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.850
is all you will ever need at
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.620
This piece of gum happens to
be tomato soup, roast beef,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.096
and blueberry pie.

00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:37.181
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:39.180
JEFF GOTHELF: In most
cases, deliberate strategy

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.120
yields a situation where you end
up with a customer asking you,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.495
why would anyone ever want that?

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:45.870
Which is the worst
possible thing

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.370
you could hear when
you actually put

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.272
your product in
customers' hands.

00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:50.730
The second worst
thing you could do

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:51.850
is exactly what he
does there, which

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.420
is fall back on
your marketing notes

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.610
to justify all the
assumptions that

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.100
went into making that product.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.370
It will be the end of all
cooking and all kitchens,

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.160
as if people don't
want to cook, and don't

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.897
want to spend time
in their kitchens.

00:16:02.897 --> 00:16:04.730
And again, at the
beginning when you set out

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.270
to solve a business
problem or a customer need,

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.742
we have no idea what that end
state is going to look like.

00:16:09.742 --> 00:16:11.450
I think this is a
perfectly good example.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.400
You could walk past these
two hippies 40 years ago,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.320
and never think, never know
what the end state was actually

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.960
going to be for these two
particular individuals.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.460
Right?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.200
And again, that's the same thing
with the products that we make.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.660
And so what's the alternative?

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.300
The alternative, of course,
is emergent strategy.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.440
It's different and it's organic.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.590
It lets companies learn
and continually develop

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.983
new strategies based on this
ongoing culture of hypothesis

00:16:37.983 --> 00:16:38.816
and experimentation.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.404
It takes a bottom-up
approach that says,

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:46.820
the people who are closest to
the customer, the people who

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.361
are making the
product, probably have

00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:50.660
the best ideas about
how to solve this.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.850
We need to build a team that
allows them to try this out.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.260
And we need to build an
ecosystem around them that

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.060
allows them to run these
experiments while not crashing

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.260
the system as a whole, so that
we can keep doing business.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.420
That's where that emergent
strategy comes from.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.810
And again, we hear this from
a variety of executives--

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.369
Amazon-- you need to set up
and organize so that you can

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.540
do as many experiments per
unit of time as possible.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.873
Eric Schmidt calls them at-bats.

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:18.619
He's talked about it
at Google, about how

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.310
we've got to take as many
swings as possible at something

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.839
to make sure that
we get it right.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.550
And so in order to
build a culture that

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.060
supports this way of
thinking, of learning,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.890
of experimentation,
we have to think

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.260
about the structure for it.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.760
And the structure
for it is the team.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.030
The atomic object of a culture
of learning is the team.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.530
Right?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.240
That's the smallest
step we want to go.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.820
We don't have a
particular rock star

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.590
that can answer all
of our questions.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.530
We want to build these teams.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.050
And the question becomes, then,
how do we build these teams?

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.410
What makes up an
innovative team, and a team

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.890
that can take advantage of
this culture of learning?

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.820
And we'll talk about
three different things.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.740
The first is the
anatomy of the team.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.290
What's the makeup of the team?

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.120
The second is, how
do we task the team?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.940
How do we tell the
team what to do?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.780
And then lastly, how
should the team work?

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.321
Should they work in
an agile process,

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:10.562
in a waterfall process,
a lean process,

00:18:10.562 --> 00:18:11.770
whatever you want to call it.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.612
OK?

00:18:12.612 --> 00:18:14.320
Let's start with the
anatomy of the team.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.394
What is the makeup
of the team itself?

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:19.060
And to do so, I'm going to start
with a series of anti-patterns,

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.510
how not to build
innovative teams.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.500
The first is this.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.310
Putting people in silos breaks
up the communication cycle.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.940
It isolates team
members, and forces

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.322
them to communicate with
written documentation.

00:18:32.322 --> 00:18:33.780
Everybody feels
like a line worker.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.400
I'm going to do my thing, and
hand it off to the next person.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.044
And because of that, no one has
ownership of the whole thing.

00:18:39.044 --> 00:18:40.710
Everybody feels like
a service provider.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.775
Right?

00:18:40.775 --> 00:18:42.510
It just passes
through my department.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.910
I add my coat of paint on my
assembly line, and it moves on.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.456
No one has a sense of the whole.

00:18:48.456 --> 00:18:49.330
What are we building?

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.520
Who are we building it for?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.840
What's the problem that
we're trying to solve?

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.760
What does success
actually look like?

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.920
How does this fit into
corporate strategy?

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.600
Why are we even working on this?

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.880
And worse, there's no
collaboration that takes place.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.339
And collaboration really is
the secret sauce of innovation,

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:04.838
right?

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:06.190
That's where learning comes.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.520
That's where innovation
comes from, the building off

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.170
of each other's ideas.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.812
And I know this firsthand.

00:19:11.812 --> 00:19:13.520
Actually, just down
the street from here,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.853
I used to run a UX team at a
company called The Ladders.

00:19:15.853 --> 00:19:20.450
I worked there for about
four years starting in 2008.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.110
And my job was to come in there
and build a design practice.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.480
And the first thing that
I did was I set up a silo.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.700
That was our silo.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.240
And then every time somebody
needed work from us,

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.470
they would come to us.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.740
And I played the traffic
cop in the center.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:40.980
Every time-- we need some design
work-- I provided some insight.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.980
Product management said,
hey, we need some work.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.480
I said terrific.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.460
Bob's got some bandwidth.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.310
Let's give it to Bob.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.190
Engineering said, we've got a
little bit of work over here.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.285
Terrific, Bob's got
some more bandwidth.

00:19:49.285 --> 00:19:50.160
Let's give it to Bob.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.460
Marketing says, hey, we
need the website spruced up.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.260
Terrific, Bob's got a
fraction of bandwidth left.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.200
Let's give it to Bob.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.950
Now Bob's supporting three
different projects a day,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.200
and every day he's coming
in deciding which two people

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.080
he's going to piss off today.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:03.580
Right?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.704
Because you can't have
three number one priorities.

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.980
You've got to pick one
thing and move on to it.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.619
As soon as you build that silo,
people do just enough work

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:12.660
to move on to the next
thing, and the next thing,

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.451
and the next thing.

00:20:13.451 --> 00:20:15.480
And just because design
is in the center here,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.271
doesn't mean that this
is unique to design.

00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:19.970
Engineering could be the center
here, or product management,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.940
or marketing, and so forth.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.440
Right?

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.910
We've got to get people
distributed differently.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.290
And so the question
then becomes,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.190
what team structure
facilitates this culture

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.230
of innovation and learning?

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.071
Four qualities.

00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:33.820
The first is this.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.320
Small.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.020
Keep your teams small, six
to eight people, roughly.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.810
Again, I quote Jeff Bezos a lot.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.750
I like what he's doing.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.890
What he calls a two-pizza team,
a two-American pizza team.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.020
It's worth quantifying.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.060
That if you can't feed your team
with two pizzas, it's too big,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.560
right?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.520
Six to eight people.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.994
That way you know
who everybody is.

00:20:53.994 --> 00:20:55.910
You know who to go to
when you need something,

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.461
and there's amazing
accountability.

00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.460
There's nowhere to hide.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.501
If there's six people on
a team and someone's not

00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:02.510
doing their work,
you know very well

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.520
who's not doing their
work right away.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.510
Second, take those six to eight
people and co-locate them.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.340
Put them together in one
place, not in the same campus,

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.040
but in the same area so they're
sitting next to each other,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.160
so they can talk to
each other, so that they

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.980
can reduce the feedback loop
from each other as quickly

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.694
as possible.

00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:22.360
And the reality is,
I know for you guys,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.526
you've got multiple offices.

00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:25.250
Where I work, we've
got multiple offices.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.410
If you have to work
with a distributed team

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:32.210
and you want to build
this hypothesis-based,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.740
experiment-driven approach
to building products,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.297
you at least have to be
awake at the same time.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:39.630
You've got to at least have
some overlap during the day.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.260
I have colleagues in Singapore.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.720
They're fantastic people.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.230
I never get to work with them.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.480
It's a 12-hour time difference
between here and there.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.510
So we've got small, co-located,
and next-- dedicated.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.180
Everybody's working on
one project, this project

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.070
specifically, right?

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.653
That's what we want
people working on.

00:21:55.653 --> 00:21:58.820
As soon as we steal somebody off
to work to fix a bug somewhere,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.180
or to work on an
executive pet project,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.750
they're not working
on our project.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.958
And we're a small team, and
so we're waiting for them

00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.810
to come back, and we can't
move until they come back.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.390
And the context
switching is costly.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.110
It takes time to ramp
down and to ramp up

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.720
to each one of these ideas.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.390
Small, co-located, dedicated,
and lastly, self sufficient.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.877
The team should be able to
do whatever it needs to do.

00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:23.960
If it needs to write code,
someone can write code.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.870
If it needs to design,
someone can design.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.280
Research, someone can research.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.870
Product management
decisions, somebody

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.170
needs to be there to make that.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.520
It doesn't necessarily mean
that you need representatives

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.980
from all of those disciplines.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.080
You just need the
competencies on the team,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.720
so that the team can make
those decisions at the pace

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.970
that the information comes in.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.530
Remember, we're seeing
insight and information

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.310
come in super fast.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.670
The team has to be capable and
empowered to react to that.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.970
So those are the four
qualities of a team that

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.840
values learning and innovation.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.270
So then the question
becomes, how

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.561
do we tell the team what to do?

00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:01.910
How do we task the team?

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.996
This is certainly a
viable option up here.

00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:05.370
You just yell at
them for awhile.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.830
And I've had bosses who
have tried this strategy.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.680
It works temporarily, until
someone quits and finds

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.360
a better job.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.590
But in reality, what are
some ways to task a team?

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.259
And once again, I'll
share some anti-patterns.

00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:17.800
My first and my
favorite anti-pattern

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.770
is the roadmap, the
product roadmap.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.230
I don't know if you
guys make those or not.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.206
I've made a lot of
them in my life.

00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:25.830
And look, they're
compelling documents.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.330
Right?

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.410
They tell a great story.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.910
We're here, and we're
going over there,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.370
and there are five steps
between here and there.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.560
And this is what's between
us and the deadline.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.030
And this is when we'll launch.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.840
The end comes at
this particular date.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.500
And so we convey this
idea that we fixed scope,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.040
and that we fixed
the deadline as well.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.050
Now I don't know about
you, but in the 17 years

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.799
that I've been building
software products,

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:53.050
every time we fixed scope and
fixed time, one of three things

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.450
has happened.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.419
We've moved the deadline,
we've reduced scope,

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:00.710
or we've worked in crunch
mode for the last three weeks

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.035
of the project-- 80 hour
weeks-- to get it done.

00:24:03.035 --> 00:24:04.410
And then we all
resign at the end

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.460
and go find jobs somewhere else.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.040
In reality, road
maps look like this,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.123
because again, there's so
much unknown and so much

00:24:11.123 --> 00:24:13.045
complexity that goes
into software development

00:24:13.045 --> 00:24:14.890
that we simply can't
predict exactly

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.400
where these challenges
will come up.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.330
Something that was easy
turns out to be hard, right?

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.664
There's a new technology
that's entered the marketplace,

00:24:22.664 --> 00:24:24.121
and it's radically
shifting the way

00:24:24.121 --> 00:24:25.670
that we actually
deliver our service.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.272
We have to be able to
bounce around like this.

00:24:28.272 --> 00:24:29.230
And that's the reality.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.330
We can't simply predict
exactly when we'll be done,

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.010
and exactly what it will look
like when we get done with it.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.420
This is how Gilt Group does
it from a recent blog post.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.110
They say they don't
maintain a roadmap document.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.517
Their road map is simply the
sum of active initiatives.

00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:47.100
Initiatives are business goals
that they're trying to achieve.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.811
And every so often, they
revisit the prioritization

00:24:49.811 --> 00:24:50.810
of those business goals.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.190
Are we making progress?

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.490
Is it still worth it
for us to continue

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.610
pushing in this
particular direction?

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.110
Right?

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.167
No specifics about exactly
what will launch and when.

00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:02.250
And we've seen this from
the authors of "The Agile

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:02.740
Manifesto."

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.380
This is one of them.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.610
This is Kent Beck and he
tweeted this a while back.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.068
And he said, look,
product roadmaps

00:25:07.068 --> 00:25:09.990
should be lists of questions,
not lists of features.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.990
Because when you have
these product run-ups that

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:17.090
are lists of features, we're
incentivizing our teams

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.782
to deliver output,
to deliver features.

00:25:21.782 --> 00:25:23.490
And when we deliver
nothing but features,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.230
we end up with product bloat.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.670
Look, this is the Microsoft
Word version of a guitar,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.170
right here.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:30.730
Right?

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.494
95% of this guitar
is useless to 95%

00:25:33.494 --> 00:25:35.410
of the people who actually
pick this thing up.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.576
This thing was specifically
created for Pat Metheny,

00:25:37.576 --> 00:25:39.730
and really only he
can really do justice

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.070
to the entirety of this product.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.470
The rest of us could probably
make out a few of the notes

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.270
on that long neck
right in there.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.120
But this is what we
get in product suite

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.420
after product suite, when we
incentivize our teams to launch

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.330
features, to generate output.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.760
And that's what roadmaps do.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.530
They drive us there, right?

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.100
At the end of the day,
shipping a product

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.580
is not a measure of success.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.710
Too soon?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.470
Sorry.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:13.060
Simply launching the product
is not a measure of success.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.260
The reality is, did we
change customer behavior

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.960
in a positive way?

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.000
Again, as we push
features in, features out,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.980
all we end up with is
feature bloat, and products

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.040
that should do things very,
very simply and very cleanly.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.140
Now interestingly enough,
most companies currently

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.660
manage to output to features,
to getting out the door,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.540
because it's easy.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.800
It's binary.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.750
Did you ship it?

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.620
Yes we did.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.120
Terrific.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.810
You get to keep your job,
get a raise, get a bonus,

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:41.670
whatever it is.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.590
Did you not ship it?

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.090
Terrific.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.680
You get fired or reprimanded
or whatever it is.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.880
Instead, we should
be tasking our teams

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.990
to achieve business outcomes.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.640
Business outcomes are
a measurable change

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.620
in customer behavior.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.880
It's an objective
measure of success.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.640
Did we get customers
to click on more ads?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.770
Did we get customers
to come back more often

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:03.990
to the Search Results page?

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.850
Did we get them to
come back less often,

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.840
because we're giving
them the right results?

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.494
Those are measurable changes
in customer behavior.

00:27:11.494 --> 00:27:13.160
And that's how we
should task our teams.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.350
We give them a problem to solve,
not a solution to implement.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.460
Now the interesting
part is this gets messy.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.500
It's a big can of worms.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.530
It's not a binary thing.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.900
If you task your teams
to get more people

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.344
to sign in successfully
into your product by 50%,

00:27:29.344 --> 00:27:30.760
and over the course
of six months,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.740
they increase it by
32%, did they fail?

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.740
Did they succeed?

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.106
It's not as clear.

00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:39.980
It's messy, so it's more
difficult to manage,

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.690
and many companies
stay away from this.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.200
Instead, we have
to get granular.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.740
We have to give teams these
outcomes that they can directly

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.190
attribute to the work
that they're doing.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.980
Right?

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.290
Decrease shopping cart
abandonment by 15%.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.030
Did the work that we
did actually do that?

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.670
Right?

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.910
Increase the number of times
a customer visits each month.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.400
That's the kind of
success criteria

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.470
we want to give people, and
then let the teams figure out

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.190
how to actually
achieve that goal.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.800
Interestingly enough, I was on
a project over at The Ladders

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.200
just like this, just
to give you an example.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.060
I was tasked with
moving a metric

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.185
called Job Seeker Response Rate.

00:28:20.185 --> 00:28:21.810
Job Seeker Response
Rate was the number

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.950
of times a job seeker responded
to an employer contact

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.320
through our system.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.570
The team that we put together
was a small, co-located,

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.560
cross-functional team, and their
task was to move this number--

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.960
which was our current Job Seeker
Response Rate, 14%-- to 75%.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.770
That was it.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.180
No further instructions
were given to that team.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.710
Your job is to get
that number to 75%.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.500
Go figure it out.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.180
Right?

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.147
And so we got together.

00:28:48.147 --> 00:28:48.980
And we brainstormed.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.080
We did all the things that make
up brainstorming and innovation

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.020
activities-- Post-It
notes, and white boards,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.180
and all of those things.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.274
And we tried a lot of
things, and we experimented.

00:28:57.274 --> 00:28:58.690
And at the end of
three months, we

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.264
had managed to get
that number up to 38%.

00:29:01.264 --> 00:29:03.305
And we went back up in
front of the organization,

00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:05.730
and we said look, you
funded us for three months.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.500
We've moved the
number from 14 to 38%.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.980
Here's what we've learned.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.090
If you fund us again for
another three months,

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.590
this is what we're going to do.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.450
And the organization
said, terrific, go ahead.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.209
Do more Post-It
notes, which we did.

00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:21.500
We actually shipped code,
believe it or not-- features,

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.790
and designs, and so forth.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.730
And at the end of six
months, we got to 68%.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.740
We didn't hit 75.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.520
We hit 68.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.900
The company said, you know what?

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.080
That's good enough.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.110
It's close enough.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.640
We are going to move
you to the next project.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.290
And we built whatever features
moved the needle appropriately,

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.447
and could scale
with the business

00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:42.530
that we were moving forth.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.238
And what that allowed
us to do, by having

00:29:44.238 --> 00:29:45.810
those objective
measures of success,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.780
we could make decisions based on
objectivity, on observing what

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.840
and why customers are doing.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.760
And when you do that, you
collect a bunch of data.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.490
And when you've got
enough information,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.239
you've got three
decisions to make, right?

00:29:58.239 --> 00:30:00.640
The first, if the data says,
hey, this is a bad idea,

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.580
you should kill this idea.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.530
This is a bad idea.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.540
Don't do this.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.610
OK?

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.120
Kill the idea if the data
says it's a bad idea.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.890
Maybe you get some data back
that says, hey, you know what?

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.290
This is a pretty good
idea, but the execution

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.150
is not moving the
needle fast enough.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.105
That's when you pivot.

00:30:14.105 --> 00:30:15.230
You maintain your strategy.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.500
You change your tactics.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.580
When you find something
that works well,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.150
that's when you double down.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.380
That's when you scale it.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.860
That's when you optimize it.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.600
That's when you give
it to more people,

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.849
because it's moving the
needle in the right direction,

00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:31.260
but only based on those
objective observations

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.170
that you're making as you
slowly increase it now.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.740
Now look, there
easy parts of this,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.114
and there are hard
parts of this.

00:30:37.114 --> 00:30:40.040
Here's the easy
part-- measuring.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.530
Measuring is easy.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.210
It's just instrumenting
the code in such a way

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.710
that you're actually
collecting this data.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.880
Talking to customers is easy.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.380
Right?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.879
It gives you the
qualitative insight

00:30:50.879 --> 00:30:54.370
into why customers are
behaving in certain ways.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.182
Right?

00:30:55.182 --> 00:30:57.140
And then reflecting,
coming together into teams

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.930
and saying here's
what we've learned.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:30:59.680
This is what's happening.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.650
This is what
customers are doing.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.816
Here's why they're doing it.

00:31:01.816 --> 00:31:03.490
These are the easy parts.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.080
Here's the hard part.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.650
Changing course,
actually saying,

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.150
you know what, yeah,
we've gone down

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.470
this path for three months.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.580
The numbers are
coming back and saying

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.234
this is the wrong
path to go down.

00:31:14.234 --> 00:31:15.900
I know, I know, but
the executive really

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.087
wants this to launch.

00:31:17.087 --> 00:31:18.920
Or wow, we spent three
months working on it.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.753
What are we going to
do, just throw it away?

00:31:20.753 --> 00:31:22.452
Yeah, that's what
you're going to do.

00:31:22.452 --> 00:31:24.410
You're going to throw it
away, because it's not

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.470
meeting your
business objectives.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.080
The hard part is having the
organizational and the team

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.800
maturity to say, this
is the wrong direction.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.120
Let's change course.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.040
And let's move on
to something else.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.595
And again, from this blog
post over at the Gilt Group--

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.720
I thought this was really
interesting-- they define

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.090
two types of KPIs-- key
performance indicators.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.770
They've got high-level
strategic ones

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.190
that the company cares about
for an extended period of time.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.200
And then they give teams
these tactical KPIs

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.410
to achieve that they
know are leading

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.147
indicators of these
strategic KPIs.

00:31:54.147 --> 00:31:56.480
And the teams work on that
until they hit those numbers,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.760
and then they move on.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.322
That's the tactical, that's the
business objective to learn.

00:32:02.322 --> 00:32:04.030
And we have to build
an organization that

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.765
takes advantage
of the small team,

00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:09.140
and that allows them to come
up for funding periodically.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.600
It's almost like
a start-up, right?

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.308
You've funded us for
this amount of time.

00:32:12.308 --> 00:32:13.666
You've given us this objective.

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.540
After that amount of
time, you can say, look,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.665
this is what we've learned.

00:32:16.665 --> 00:32:17.870
Will you fund us again?

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.700
And the organization gets to
make an evidence-based decision

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.140
about whether or not it's
worthwhile to actually put

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.125
more money into this
particular path.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:29.000
The last thing I want
to talk about is this--

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.560
how should the team work?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.040
We talked about the
makeup of the team.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.299
We talked about how
we task the team.

00:32:35.299 --> 00:32:37.090
And the reality is,
what should the process

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:37.880
be-- the final things.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.963
How should the process be?

00:32:38.963 --> 00:32:40.252
How should the team work?

00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:41.960
And then once again,
we're going to start

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.470
with a few anti-patterns,
how the team should not work.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.550
So first and foremost, a lack of
cross-functional collaboration

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.310
really starts to break
down a culture of learning

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.060
and a culture of innovation.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.900
This is a bit of an excuse to
put more circus photos up here,

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.260
but just to give you a sense,
those are the elephants,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.540
obviously, on the end.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.960
The women in the middle walked
on large white balls up ramps.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.980
That's what they did.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.865
And that's Charlie.

00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:06.490
He served our meals,
three meals a day,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.950
if you were brave enough
to eat food from Charlie.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.444
And most days, we were.

00:33:10.444 --> 00:33:12.360
Some days were a little
sketchier than others.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.430
Now look, there was no
cross-functional collaboration

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.450
in the circus.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.390
In fact, the silos
were so deep there

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.700
were interdepartmental silos.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.990
The clowns fought each other
over who originated a gag.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.470
I mean, can you imagine
if the Human Cannonball--

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.125
and we had a tiger trainer.

00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.410
We had 10 tigers.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.960
If the Human Cannonball and the
tiger trainer collaborated--

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.800
the guy's already
flying across the tent.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.040
If there were 10 tigers
underneath there,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.540
what's the difference,
ultimately?

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.570
But at the end of the day, the
excitement of that act is 10x.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.450
None of that ever
happened, because everybody

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.000
felt like they would be giving
up something unique if they

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.550
let go of their originality
and collaborated

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.120
with somebody else.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.000
Another anti-pattern is
a fixation on job titles.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.601
We get so hung up on what
it says on our job title.

00:33:57.601 --> 00:33:58.600
Oh, you're the designer.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.500
There's no way you can code.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.700
You're the engineer.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.710
There's no way you
can design, right?

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.500
And thinking about that
greatly limits the contribution

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.159
that our small team
members can make

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.388
to the process of
learning and innovation.

00:34:15.388 --> 00:34:17.429
To drive the point home,
I want to share with you

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.239
this photo right here.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.830
Does anybody know
who this guy is?

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.780
Any guesses?

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.520
Take a guess.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.560
AUDIENCE: Nigel from Spinal Tap?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.730
JEFF GOTHELF: It's not
Nigel from Spinal Tap,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.162
but that's a great guess.

00:34:30.162 --> 00:34:31.120
AUDIENCE: Gene Simmons?

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.620
JEFF GOTHELF: It's
not Gene Simmons,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.480
but you guys are in the
right era, for sure.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.320
AUDIENCE: Randy Rose.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.250
JEFF GOTHELF: It's
not Randy Rose.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:36.920
That's a really good one.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.409
I never heard that one before.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.330
That's a good one.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.739
All right, I'll give it to you.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.389
This is who this is.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.300
This is Jeff "Skunk" Baxter.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.170
Jeff "Skunk" Baxter was a
founding member of Steely Dan,

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:51.199
and he was a Doobie Brother
for 35 years-- legendary

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.760
American rock-and-roll
guitarist.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.610
Any guesses on
what he does today,

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.875
other than playing nostalgia
concerts at state fairs?

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.000
AUDIENCE: Human Cannonball.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.291
JEFF GOTHELF: Human Cannonball.

00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:04.590
That's a good one.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.420
UX designer?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.716
No, he's not a UX designer.

00:35:06.716 --> 00:35:07.840
This is what he does today.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.020
Right?

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.520
I'll let you read
it for just a sec.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.560
Mr. Baxter is a consultant
to the US Government

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.434
on missile defense.

00:35:23.434 --> 00:35:24.430
That guy.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.390
For better or for
worse, that's the guy.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.799
OK?

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:30.590
Point here is, if he
showed you his resume,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.150
and it said, listen-- founding
member of Steely Dan, Doobie

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.730
Brother for 35 years,
would you let him

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:39.860
within a mile of a conversation
on missile defense?

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.350
And of course the answer is no.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.100
We would never let him
do that, because we

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.580
get hung up on that job title.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.780
Again, people have secondary
competencies and passions,

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.750
and they're really
good at other things.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:54.660
Let's not limit
their contribution,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.460
especially in the early
stages of a product,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.646
during product discovery
and conception.

00:35:59.646 --> 00:36:01.020
Inevitably, people
will fall back

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.260
to their core competencies.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.426
Engineers will write code
and designers will design.

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:06.490
But especially in the
early stages of a product,

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.656
let people contribute in
whatever way that they can.

00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:12.530
Other anti-patterns.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.710
A fear of failure, right?

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.935
My ass is on the line, right?

00:36:16.935 --> 00:36:17.435
Right?

00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:22.390
If I don't get this right,
something's going to happen.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.180
I'm going to get fired.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.280
I'm going to get demoted.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.030
And we create these
cultures, but we never

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.450
consider the scope
of the failure.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.158
Think about that Amazon
scope of failure.

00:36:29.158 --> 00:36:32.344
If they get 11.6 seconds
worth of a release wrong,

00:36:32.344 --> 00:36:33.010
that's terrific.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.093
They've learned something.

00:36:34.093 --> 00:36:36.680
And they can roll it back, and
they can move that forward.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.640
If we take small risks, then
the failure brings learning.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.940
That's the experimentation.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.273
And that's what we should value.

00:36:43.273 --> 00:36:45.210
We shouldn't make people
afraid of actually

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.610
getting something wrong.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.320
That should be, ultimately,
encouraged, right?

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.972
Another is arbitrary deadlines.

00:36:51.972 --> 00:36:53.930
If you owe Paulie money,
you got to pay Paulie.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:54.770
Right?

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:56.250
That's kind of how it works out.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.840
Arbitrary deadlines
are typically

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.910
just motivational tools.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.610
There's usually no
real reason to get

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.760
something done by
a certain date.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.180
And we talked earlier about
what happens when you fix date

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.620
and you fix scope.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.500
If you fix the
date, that's fine,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.170
but let the teams
build the best product

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.470
that they can by that
deadline, and then

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.306
let them continue optimizing
it after the deadline passes.

00:37:17.306 --> 00:37:19.680
What ends up happening here,
is the teams end up building

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.877
this CYA culture, where we do
just enough to get things done,

00:37:24.877 --> 00:37:26.960
and then to move things
forward to the next thing.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.200
We never do our best work.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.420
We never take risks.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.010
We never innovate, because
we're afraid that we're not

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.760
going to hit the
deadline, or that we're

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.371
going to get fired,
and so forth.

00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:37.870
And so the things
to think about is,

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:42.230
how does a culture of
learning change the way

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.069
that a team works?

00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:45.110
Ultimately-- So we talked
about who's on the team

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.990
and how we task the
team, but how do

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.510
we actually get them
to do their best work?

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.593
And there's a couple of
different ways to do this.

00:37:51.593 --> 00:37:53.530
First and foremost,
people take smaller risks.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.085
Right?

00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:55.500
That's the first tack.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.700
This could essentially
be the-- you

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.199
could argue this is the MVP
for the GoPro camera, right?

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:04.240
Let's get that out there.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.580
Let's try it and
see if it works.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.270
Let's see what kind of
product we get out of it.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.936
There's a key principle
in lean thinking

00:38:08.936 --> 00:38:11.690
that says that we're always
moving from doubt to certainty.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.770
That between us and the
end state of perfection,

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.750
which we never
attain, there's a fog.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.410
And we can only see two or
three steps into that fog.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.400
And so to mitigate the risk of
running in the wrong direction,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.190
we take small steps.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.130
We take small risks.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.750
We run experiments.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.900
We test our hypotheses.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.810
And if the results
from that experiment

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.130
come back and
confirm our thinking,

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.124
we keep going in that direction.

00:38:37.124 --> 00:38:39.790
But if the results come back and
they say that was the wrong way

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.015
to go, we roll back, or we
pick a different direction.

00:38:44.015 --> 00:38:45.640
Because we don't want
to run head-first

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.700
into the fog assuming that
it's the right way to go.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.072
We take smaller risks.

00:38:50.072 --> 00:38:50.780
This was awesome.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.220
I ran into this.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.130
This is Map My Run.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.740
You guys know this app?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.860
I was running in LA this summer
while I was working out there.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.360
Early in the morning, you can
see the dates, the time stamp,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.750
so you know I'm not lying.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.940
6:54 AM I was
already out running.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.609
And I got to the
end of Venice Pier.

00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:08.650
Venice Pier is beautiful.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.680
It goes a half mile into the
ocean, and the sun is rising,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.265
and the palm trees are swaying,
and the surfers are out.

00:39:14.265 --> 00:39:16.265
And so I paused to take
a break and kind of take

00:39:16.265 --> 00:39:17.210
in the scenery.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.360
And I stopped the
tracking of my run,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.770
and this beautiful modal
window comes up and says, hey,

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.627
would you like to take photos
and add it to your run?

00:39:26.627 --> 00:39:28.960
And at that moment, I was
feeling particularly inspired.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.490
Adrenaline's flowing,
and I'm sweating,

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.000
and I'm breathing heavy.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.030
And I said hell yeah.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.495
I also liked the fact that
they used the term MVP,

00:39:34.495 --> 00:39:35.620
coming from the lean world.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.330
They mean most valuable
player, of course.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.760
But I said, terrific.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.390
Go MVP.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.598
And I tap Go MVP, and they're
like, all right, great.

00:39:42.598 --> 00:39:43.550
Give us 30 bucks.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.170
And you can totally do that.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.520
And I was, like wah wah.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.960
No way am I making a rational
purchase decision at 7 o'clock

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.870
in the morning, wheezing, can't
breathe and eyes are burning.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.500
But, so the end of this workflow
is kind of crappy, right?

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.240
But the beginning--
none of these features

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.330
here ever have to exist.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:02.830
Right?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.470
All you have to do
is put up that modal

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:09.730
and count the taps on
Go MVP and No Thanks.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.840
And when you get
enough that say yes,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.340
I like this-- that's
when you start

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.221
investing in actual
feature development.

00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:15.720
Right?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.820
That's a small experiment.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.280
That's a smaller
risk that you can

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.190
take to see if there's any value
in actually investing further

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.020
in building this
particular product.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.770
Right?

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.860
Because the agile
world has come up

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.890
from an engineering perspective.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.310
The 17 writers of "The Agile
Manifesto" were engineers.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.220
And typically agile--
in most organizations

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.720
that I deal with-- comes from
the engineering department.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.920
It's very rare that
the designers are like,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.630
let's do agile.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.620
And the engineers are like,
no, we don't want to do it.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.580
Let's do waterfall.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.360
Right?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.230
What's happened is that we built
these amazing organizations,

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.480
these amazing software
engineering organizations, that

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.200
are incentivized for
the efficient delivery

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.850
of high-quality code.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.090
But what the agile
process doesn't

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.270
have-- as my friend Bill Scott
likes to say-- is a brain.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.980
It lacks the capacity to
determine what to build,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.420
and how to implement it,
and how to design it,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.260
and what copy to
put on top of it.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.690
And this experimental,
hypothesis-driven approach,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.930
where we take small risks
and then we learn from it,

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.540
allows us to drive the
agile process in such a way

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.920
that we get great code and
great design and great copy

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.670
that customers
actually want to use,

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.830
because we've measured
their behavior.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.040
That's our definition
of success,

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.380
is the change in
customer behavior.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.790
And we have to remember
that works as designed

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.790
is simply not good
enough anymore.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:40.810
So one more.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.470
I just want to prove to you
how healthy and athletic I am,

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.670
so I'm going to use one
more athletic story here.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.566
But this is a picture of my gym.

00:41:46.566 --> 00:41:47.440
I live in New Jersey.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.710
This is a picture of my gym.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.640
This is my favorite
feature at this gym.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.910
It's called the cardio
theater, and essentially, it

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.950
is a movie theater with
cardio machines in it.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.450
That's it.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.080
So instead of putting your
headphones on and watching

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.882
a movie on a small
screen, you got

00:42:02.882 --> 00:42:04.340
on the elliptical
or the treadmill,

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.970
and they blast the movie
out at you in the morning.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:07.470
I like it.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.290
I love that feature, in fact.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.340
I usually go in the mornings,
so I arrive around 5:30.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.632
4:30 in the morning, the
guy comes and opens the gym.

00:42:15.632 --> 00:42:16.590
He turns the lights on.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.580
He pushes Play on the movie.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.779
He sees that there's
a picture and he

00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:21.820
hears that there's sound.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.550
As far as he's concerned,
works as designed.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.960
And then he goes back
to the front desk.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.840
I show up at 5:30, along
with half the population

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.270
of northern New Jersey.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.259
For some reason, everyone's
awake at that hour.

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:36.800
And as soon as you get more than
two people back here running

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.030
on a treadmill, you can't
hear the movie anymore.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.247
Unusable, undesirable,
works as designed.

00:42:44.247 --> 00:42:45.830
I have to get off
the treadmill and go

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.990
to the front every single day,
and tell the guy to turn it up

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.821
because we can't hear the movie.

00:42:50.821 --> 00:42:53.070
So we have to ensure that
just because a feature works

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.470
as designed, people actually
want to use it and can use it.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.149
And the way we do that is with
clear definition of success.

00:43:00.149 --> 00:43:02.190
Can we change customer
behavior in the right way?

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:05.590
And we can measure that.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.100
And we use that as the mile
marker for whether or not

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.630
we're building the right things.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.140
Now again, we want to promote
competencies over roles.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.010
We want people to do whatever
it is that they're good at

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.790
to help us move forward faster.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.670
And then lastly and
most importantly,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.845
we want to promote
team self organization.

00:43:21.845 --> 00:43:23.470
Give teams a little
structure, and then

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.606
let them figure out how
best to work together,

00:43:26.606 --> 00:43:28.480
and how best to achieve
the goals that you've

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.050
set out for them.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.770
This is a quote from
Geoff Nicholson,

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.340
who invented the Post-It note.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.290
He said that 3M wanted to
productize this thing with Six

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.360
Sigma as soon as he
had thought of it.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.340
And he had no proof
that customers actually

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.240
wanted this thing yet.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.620
We don't want to impose
a process on the team

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.880
just because we think it's
good for the production of code

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.130
or the production of features.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.630
Right?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.810
Let the teams figure out
exactly what they need to build,

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:57.770
and when they need to scale it,
and how best to work together.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.700
Last thing I want to say.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.117
This is hard work.

00:44:01.117 --> 00:44:03.575
All of this, everything I just
told you to do is difficult.

00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:04.910
It's process change.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.040
It's culture change.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.920
Why should you do it?

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.420
Why?

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.570
Why invest in it?

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.450
If things are going
OK, why do it?

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.530
First and foremost, you're going
to make your customers happy,

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.662
or you're going to build stuff
they actually want and can use,

00:44:17.662 --> 00:44:19.370
which means they'll
come back and use it,

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.578
and they'll tell their
friends, and they'll share it,

00:44:21.578 --> 00:44:23.800
and you'll have more customers.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.920
You'll reduce waste by building
more successful products

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.020
and not working for a
long time on products that

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.390
don't stand a chance of success.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.750
We'll focus our people and
our time more effectively.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.499
And then lastly, this
increases employee morale.

00:44:39.499 --> 00:44:41.790
It allows people to feel like
they're part of a greater

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.480
whole, there's a bigger
mission, their ideas count.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.292
They're loyal.

00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:47.750
They're passionate
about the ideas,

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.583
because they are
ultimately their ideas that

00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:51.110
solve these problems.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.050
And that's terrific
for your hiring brand

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:55.250
and for your
retention over time.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.630
At the end of day, let
me leave you with this.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.620
You have to transform from
a culture of delivery,

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.400
focused on getting
features out the door,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.914
to a culture of learning.

00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:07.330
Thank you very
much for listening.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.334
I'd love to take your questions.

00:45:09.334 --> 00:45:15.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.520
Questions.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.811
I know we have mics over there.

00:45:16.811 --> 00:45:17.505
Yes, sir.

00:45:17.505 --> 00:45:19.630
AUDIENCE: You give some
great examples of companies

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.919
that do this, they iterate fast.

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:22.710
They learn quickly.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.540
They try a lot of experiments,
like Amazon, Facebook,

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.527
even Google.

00:45:26.527 --> 00:45:28.860
But there's a company that
writes a lot of software that

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.950
doesn't seem to do
this, and that's Apple.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.340
Nevertheless, they've
been very successful.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:37.520
So can you explain why
they managed to get things

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.540
right without seeming to try all
of these constant experiments?

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.750
JEFF GOTHELF: I would argue
that they do experiment,

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.470
and that they certainly do a
significant amount of research.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.460
I just don't think that
we see a lot of it.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.629
And I don't think that-- they're
certainly not public with it

00:45:52.629 --> 00:45:54.920
like the rest of the companies
that you just mentioned,

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.460
like Google and
Facebook, and so forth.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.770
I think what Apple really excels
at is understanding ecosystems.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.280
And they do this by
observation and by research

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.000
and by learning.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.940
And then when they come,
they take ambitious gambles

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.550
at design-driven innovation
to solve the problems

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.959
that they're viewing
in these ecosystems.

00:46:16.959 --> 00:46:18.750
Now you could say look,
hey, you know what?

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.204
They don't test, and they
don't talk to customers.

00:46:21.204 --> 00:46:22.620
I think they do
talk to customers,

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.900
and I think they absolutely
build prototypes and run

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.470
experiments.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.650
They seem to lose them in bars
in Palo Alto fairly regularly,

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:29.150
right?

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.592
But also take a look
at the iteration

00:46:31.592 --> 00:46:33.550
after iteration after
iteration of the hardware

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.780
and the software products
that you're using for them,

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.700
and you can see that
those essentially

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.690
end up being experiments.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:45.700
I mean the original iPhone
feels like a rock compared

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.840
to an iPhone 6 these days.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.930
And I think that there's
experimentation and tons

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.770
of learning there.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:55.760
Incidentally, so I
think that's one thing.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.990
Related is there's a
Chinese company called

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.300
[? Chaomi ?] that
manufactures cellphone,

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.426
mobile phones, and tablets.

00:47:02.426 --> 00:47:03.716
And they're competing directly.

00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:05.650
They're trying to compete
with Apple, anyway.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.570
They do iterative
design on their hardware

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.000
and their software in one-week
iterations, which is amazing.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.800
Every Tuesday they
ship 100,000 phones.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.710
People snap them up, and they're
on the phone with these people,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.590
and they're measuring
usage to understand

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.750
how well the products
are meeting their needs.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:24.176
And so that's what I've
seen as evidence of that.

00:47:24.176 --> 00:47:25.800
Now the last thing
I'll say about this,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.633
because this question
comes up all the time,

00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:31.230
is you can't dismiss some
level of design genius.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:32.920
Right?

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.709
You have to give some credit
to Steve Jobs and the very few

00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:38.250
people in the world
who are like him,

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.520
like Jony Ive and so forth,
who have this design genius.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.450
I don't think you
can dismiss that

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.910
as part of the component
of their success.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.220
But I think the design
genius, the creativity,

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.390
comes in in solving
real problems.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.640
And they see those real
problems by observation

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.630
and understanding ecosystems.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:57.550
That's what I think.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.337
Yeah?

00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:00.920
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.700
talk a little bit about the
structuring of small teams

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.470
in big organizations
such as here,

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:11.700
where there are literally
hundreds of engineers and tens

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.110
of product managers,
just in one product.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.820
So do you see these teams
forming and reforming?

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.587
Do you see these teams have
cross product, cross function?

00:48:21.587 --> 00:48:22.920
So how do you imagine them work?

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.882
And then related to that, what
is the decision-making process

00:48:26.882 --> 00:48:27.840
like in that structure?

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.180
JEFF GOTHELF: Yeah, it's a
great, really great questions.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.570
I don't claim to
have all the answers.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.153
I can share with you a couple
of anecdotes from my experience,

00:48:34.153 --> 00:48:37.880
and something interesting that
I heard last week on my travels.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.530
So the team structure itself,
typically designer, product

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.550
manager, and engineers, so
like, one, one, and then two

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:49.550
to four engineers as far
as each one of those pods.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.540
And I think you'll see that
repeated in some of the other,

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.700
like the Spotify
whitepaper that was out.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.650
I think what's interesting
is if you've got-- so

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.825
taking the-- if you've
got a big problem

00:49:01.825 --> 00:49:03.950
and you've got a set of
engineers or a set of teams

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.050
that are working towards
solving this particular problem,

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.320
I think you give that
problem to all those teams.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.700
And I heard Mary Poppendieck
speak last night.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.390
Mary Poppendieck is-- she's
one of the legends of the Agile

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.890
world.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.140
She's been around
35, 40 years, trying

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.050
to make this stuff work
in large companies.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:25.810
And she was talking about
giving these pods, essentially,

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:28.190
all the same problem,
and incentivizing them

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:31.270
the same way, so everyone
has the same incentives

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.530
to achieve the same
success criteria.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.812
And then they have to build
dependencies on each other.

00:49:36.812 --> 00:49:38.270
They have to work
together in order

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.690
to achieve that
overarching goal.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.600
So that's one way to
kind of unite them

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.474
in a similar direction.

00:49:45.474 --> 00:49:46.890
I think the question
then becomes,

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.740
how do you make decisions?

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.360
I've seen it work
one of two ways.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.140
And again, that's
just my experience.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.840
It's not necessarily the answer.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.710
Either there is a product lead,
typically a product manager.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:00.710
Although it could be
the design leader.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.309
There's a team lead
who makes a decision.

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:05.600
And where I've seen it work,
actually, more effectively

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.770
is that there's a triumvirate
of the product lead,

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:10.710
the tech lead, and
the design lead, who

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.650
kind of gather all these
ideas from the team,

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:15.112
and then make a decision
together, and then

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:16.320
bring that back to the teams.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.860
I've seen that work well, also.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.370
Yes, sir?

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.850
AUDIENCE: I'm Interested
in constraints, things

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.570
like legal or regulatory
or just bureaucratic,

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.010
and where they live.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.930
So these teams
are generally kind

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.100
of constraints on
innovation, as well,

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.760
or least boundaries
of innovation.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.060
Should the team itself
own that constraint

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.710
and possibly be
demoralized by it?

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.355
Or should it be
external, in which case

00:50:41.355 --> 00:50:45.940
it becomes kind of an enemy
or a systematic problem?

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.430
JEFF GOTHELF: I think you have
to work within your reality,

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.930
right?

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.180
So if you work in
health care, there

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.620
are going to be
legal constraints

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.420
and personal
information constraints,

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.640
privacy constraints, that
you have to work with,

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.990
and same thing in financial
services and so forth.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:01.750
I don't think that
you can ignore them.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:04.120
And I think you risk damage.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.510
Forget legal damage
for a second,

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.770
but I think you
risk brand damage

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.385
if you choose to flaunt those
in favor of experimentation

00:51:10.385 --> 00:51:11.195
and hypothesis.

00:51:11.195 --> 00:51:17.040
Now that being said, the
rigidity of those constraints

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.010
is debatable in
certain situations,

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:25.510
and I think that if you can
have a realistic conversation

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.450
with legal department,
for example,

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.210
or the branding
department, or IT,

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.260
or whoever is
constraining your ability

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.110
to learn the things
that you need to learn,

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:37.690
I'm confident that
you can typically

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.229
find ways to get around that.

00:51:40.229 --> 00:51:41.270
I'll give you an example.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.050
We did a lot of experimentation
with a big financial services

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.680
company downtown from here.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.470
Again, 100-year-old brand, lots
of financial data-- it's risky.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.780
Options are-- you can test
off-brand, for example,

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.940
so it has nothing to do
with the official brand.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.000
That's one test.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.807
You can opt people into
a beta-tester pool.

00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:03.390
So you're self-selecting
a little bit.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.390
There's some bias there.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.020
You get the more tech-savvy
individuals, and so forth.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.920
But at least they've agreed to
take part in these experiments.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.640
But there are ways to get around
this where you can negotiate

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.140
with the people who
are constraining

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.650
you to get some
kind of learning.

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:19.910
I think that you
have to own it, and I

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.451
don't think you can disregard
it, because ultimately whatever

00:52:22.451 --> 00:52:24.690
you come up with has to
live in that world as well.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:26.231
And I think that if
you disregard it,

00:52:26.231 --> 00:52:29.520
you're building something that's
probably destined to fail.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.289
Yes, sir.

00:52:30.289 --> 00:52:32.580
AUDIENCE: I also have a
question about the small teams.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.390
So the first question
is, what's the best way,

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.080
in your experience,
to incentivize

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.320
people to do their best
within the small teams?

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.160
And second question is, when
you have the small teams,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.690
and you want to encourage them
to kind of all collaborate

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.350
and work together on something,
but then in that environment,

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:48.990
how do you assign
credit correctly

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.599
so that people, again, have
incentives to kind of--

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:53.640
JEFF GOTHELF: Well, you
assume that taking credit

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.530
is incentive.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.510
And I suppose that
that could be.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.060
The way-- so again,
based on my experience,

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.960
the way that I've seen
the best incentive

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.400
has been to let people
figure out the solution.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.920
There's an amazing
level-- there's

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.300
an exponentially bigger level
of passion and commitment

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.870
to the success of an
initiative if the team

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.290
is working on an idea
they came up with.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:21.570
The difference between telling
a team to build something

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.020
and telling them to figure
out how to solve this problem

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.640
is the incentive.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.111
That's what gets
them to motivate.

00:53:27.111 --> 00:53:28.610
That's what gets
them moved forward.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:32.590
And the interesting thing--
if you buy my concept

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:37.150
that the atomic object of
innovation is the team,

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.727
then the team wins together
or the team loses together.

00:53:39.727 --> 00:53:41.310
There's no, the team
did great design,

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:42.700
but the engineers messed it up.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.200
Right?

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.020
There's none of that.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:44.770
It doesn't happen.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.100
The product is the product.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.670
You can't separate great
engineering from great design.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:53.260
And we managed to
achieve our business

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.941
goal and the
customer's need, and it

00:53:54.941 --> 00:53:56.190
seems to be a winning product.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.740
That to me has been the
greatest source of incentive

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.892
to get these teams to
work well together.

00:54:01.892 --> 00:54:03.047
OK?

00:54:03.047 --> 00:54:03.630
Anything else?

00:54:06.177 --> 00:54:08.510
Thank you guys very much for
spending your lunch with me

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:09.010
today.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.010
That was a lot of fun.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.614
