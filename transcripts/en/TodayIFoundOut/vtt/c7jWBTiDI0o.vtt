00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.450
Hollywood spies often have a myriad of amazing
devices at their disposal for getting rid

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.860
of bad guys in a clandestine way.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.830
It turns out, occasionally so do real spies.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.280
Exhibit A: the CIA’s “undetectable”
poison dart gun that near silently shot frozen

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
darts comprised of an unspecified, undetectable
poison.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.370
The individual hit reportedly would at most
just feel something like a mosquito bite as

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.989
the dart penetrated their skin.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.150
It would then quickly melt and the poison
would do its work, leaving the victim dead

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.740
of an apparent heart attack, with no detectable
evidence of the poison remaining.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.309
The weapon was revealed as part of a broader
Senate investigation into intelligence and

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.660
covert action abuses by the Agency.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.501
The disclosure of the full gamut of activities
and devices caused Senator Frank Church (D-ID)

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:10.039
to conclude that the CIA had become a “rogue
elephant rampaging out of control.”

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.030
Spurred by the publication of Seymour Hersh’s
game-changing article in The New York Times

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.970
on December 22, 1974, which relayed assassination
attempts and covert activities to subvert

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.340
both foreign governments as well as American
antiwar and other dissidents, the Senate formed

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.159
the Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.200
in 1975.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.840
Chaired by Senator Church, during its two
years of hearings, the Church Committee, as

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.380
it came to be known, published 14 reports
on a variety of abuses by the CIA, Federal

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.220
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and National
Security Agency (NSA), as well as others.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.390
These included routinely opening (and resealing)
US citizens’ mail since 1952, misusing tax

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.530
information to target domestic dissidents,
and conducting domestic, electronic surveillance

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.850
of peace and black power activists.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.780
In addition, for the CIA, this also included
developing weapons such as “a pistol [that]

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.690
can fire a poison dart 328 feet, kill a man
before he knows he has been hit, and leave

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.459
no clue as to what killed him.”

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.700
Part of a program named MK Naomi, established
for conducting and managing bacteriological

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.450
warfare, the poison dart gun was just one
of many experiments by the agency, which also

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.250
included pesticides to ravage crops and on
one occasion, using the NYC subway to test

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.980
out a “trial model” of a biological warfare
attack.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.514
On September 16, 1975, then CIA Director William
Colby testified before the committee, which

00:02:37.514 --> 00:02:38.514
also included Senators Barry Goldwater (R-AZ),
John Tower (R-TX), Walter Mondale (D-MN),

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:39.514
Gary Hart (D-CO), Howard Baker (R-TN), Philip
Hart (D-MI), Charles Mathias (R-MD), Walter

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:40.514
Huddleston (D-KY), Richard Schweiker (R-PN)
and Robert Morgan (D-NC).

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:41.514
The director gave remarkable testimony regarding
the development of “toxic agents” at a

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:42.514
laboratory at Fort Detrick, MD.

00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:45.960
Notably, Director Colby testified that only
“limited records” remained of these activities,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.709
even though the program spanned from 1952-1970.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.580
Among the director’s many extraordinary
statements were these from his prepared remarks:

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.140
The specific subject today concerns CIA’s
involvement in the development of bacteriological

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.040
warfare materials . . . retention of an amount
of shellfish toxin, and CIA’s use and investigation

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.680
of various chemicals and drugs
The need for such capabilities was tied to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.830
. . . the development of two different types
of suicide pills to be used in the event of

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.970
capture [during WWII] and a successful operation
using biological warfare materials to incapacitate

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.680
a Nazi leader temporarily
A . . . memo of 1967 identified . . . [the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.849
range of] project activity: maintenance of
a stockpile of temporarily incapacitating

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.220
and lethal agents . . . assessment and maintenance
of biological and chemical dissemination systems

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.350
. . . [and] adaptation and testing of a dart
device for clandestine and imperceptible inoculation

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.599
with biological warfare or chemical warfare
agents

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.010
The only application of this [shellfish] toxin
was in the U-2 flight over the U.S.S.R in

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.950
May 1960 [Gary Powers flight]
Various dissemination devices, such as a fountain

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.690
pen dart launcher and an engine head bolt
designed to release a substance when heated

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.690
[were developed]
A large amount of Agency attention was given

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.690
to the problem of incapacitating guard dogs
Work was also done on temporary human incapacitation

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.690
techniques . . . to incapacitate captives
before they could render themselves incapable

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.690
of talking, or . . . take retaliatory action
Success was never achieved [for the temporarily

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.140
incapacitating dart system] since a larger
amount of an incapacitating agent is required

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.209
to safely inactivate a human than of a lethal
agent . . . to kill him

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.209
Though specific accounting for each agent
. . . is not on hand, DOD records indicate

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.209
that the materials were, in fact, destroyed
in 1970 by SOD personnel, except for the 11

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.209
grams [of shellfish toxin].

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.209
. . plus the 8 milligrams [of cobra venom,
both found in a vault]

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.209
A complete inventory . . . was taken . . . consisted
of . . . materials and delivery systems . . . lethal

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.209
materials, incapacitants, narcotics, hallucinogenic
drugs, irritants and riot control agents,

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.209
herbicides, animal control materials and many
common chemicals

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.209
Upon further questioning by the senators,
Colby described how the poison dart gun worked:

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.209
The Chairman: Does this pistol fire the dart?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.950
Mr. Colby: Yes . . . The round thing at the
top is obviously the sight, the rest of it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.760
is practically a normal .45 . . . However,
it works by electricity.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.400
There is a battery in the handle.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.409
The Chairman: So that . . . it fires silently?

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.210
Mr. Colby: Almost silently.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.360
. . .
The Chairman: And the dart itself, when it

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.210
strikes the target, does the target know?

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.990
Mr. Colby: That depends . . . .There are different
kinds of these flechettes [darts] . . . and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.870
a special one was developed which potentially
would . . . enter the target without perception.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.970
. . .
The Chairman: Is it not true . . that the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.470
effort not only involved designing a gun . . . but
also the toxin itself would not appear in

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.470
the autopsy?

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.440
Mr. Colby: Yes; so there was no way of perceiving
that the target was hit . . . .

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.950
Senator Tower: Turning to the dart gun, was
it ever employed for any purpose by the Agency?

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.779
Mr. Colby: I think merely experiments . . . I
do not know of any actual use.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:42.449
There is no record of any actual use.
