00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.720
- After a month of just
working with my dancers,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.887
I looked at them, and I said,

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:11.110
"Whoa, they look like a real company."

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.967
And then I also said,
"Wow, Cambodia's first

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:16.467
gay dance company just
formed in my living room."

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.720
My name is Prumsodun Ok.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.720
I am a Khmer classical
dancer and choreographer.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.420
Khmer classical dance is an art form

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.160
that's more than 1,000 years old.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
The art form has animist,
Hindu, Buddhist roots,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.530
and it's all at once a
form of entertainment,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.530
a form of worship, and also
a form of educating people.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.800
In 1970s, in Cambodia,
the Khmer Rouge took over

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.520
the country, and they were a
group of radical Communists

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.250
who wanted to eliminate
all forms of elite culture.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.420
Because of this, Khmer
classical dancers were targeted.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.910
A third of the entire population died,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.050
and in that number were
90% of Khmer dance artists.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.360
So it was a real tragic loss

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.583
because Khmer classical dance
is not passed on in a book.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.620
The act of reviving this art form,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.660
of preserving this art form, is really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.500
a protest against a legacy of violence,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.800
and it's really a gesture of resilience

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.467
of beauty, a resilience
of the human spirit.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.900
I was born and raised in
Long Beach, California,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.550
which is home to the
largest Khmer diaspora

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.400
outside of Southeast Asia.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.110
I realized that, if I wanted
to make the biggest impact

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.620
on the art form, I had
to do it from Cambodia.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.200
So, in 2015, I started
Prumsodun Ok and Natyarasa,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.530
which is Cambodia's
first gay dance company.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.770
We have two primary missions.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.460
One is to preserve the art form,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.760
but also creating new work
that reflect our experiences

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.630
as LGBTQ people in Cambodia.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.670
I felt like I really opened up a door

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.230
for many young men who have
always loved classical dance

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.520
but never had access to proper training.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.100
These young men, all of a sudden,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.393
had someone that they can
seek that knowledge from.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.300
My friends are often
surprised when I say this,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.640
but in certain ways, I feel that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.040
Cambodia is much more tolerant and open

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.113
when it comes to LGBTQ
issues than other places.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.490
There have been some people,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.660
maybe they don't like gay
people or LGBTQ people,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.760
but when they see the
rigor of the dancing,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.850
the rigor of the costumes,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.700
when they see the artistic quality,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.110
they realize that it's coming
from a place of real love

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.590
and real respect and real devotion,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.043
and they also see a sense
of hope for the future.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.490
I hope that, in the future,
we take care of this art form

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.380
as beautifully as we
can, both traditionally,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.700
but then, we also use this art form

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.637
to just create things that
would make our ancestors say,

00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:39.323
"Wow, I never would've imagined that."
