00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 We have already paid much attention to 

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.448
 the molecular structure of DNA. 

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:06.435
 In fact, we have two DNA circuits, 

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.280
 forming a double helix, 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.733
 we can see the distinctive features of DNA. 

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.619
 In particular - five-carbon sugar 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.081
 in the backbone of the molecule. 

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.174
 Let us number the carbon atoms. 

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:24.102
 This is 1 ', 2', 3 ', 4', 5 '. 

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:27.057
 We can see that at carbon atom 2 ' 

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.028
 no oxygen. 

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.080
 There is no hydroxyl group attached thereto, 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.761
 so we know this is not ribose. 

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.906
 This is deoxyribose. This is deoxyribose here. 

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.141
 Here too we have deoxyribose, 

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.294
 which tells us that we have two DNA strands 

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:46.037
 deoxyribonucleic acid. 

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:47.577
 I'll write it down. 

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:49.746
 This part of the chain is, 

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:53.245
 obtained by binding of deoxyribose 

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.281
 with phosphate groups and nitrogen base. 

00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.011
 Deoxyribose. 

00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.721
 What we should do if we want 

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.225
 instead 

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:10.105
 the two strands of the double strand of DNA - 

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:14.068
 how should we edit the left chain, 

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:15.591
 if we want to introduce it 

00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.029
 as an information RNA circuit, 

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.341
 generated during transcription 

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.429
 of the single DNA chain on the right? 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.758
 To turn it into RNA or to look like RNA, 

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:32.637
 at carbon 2 'we have to turn deoxyribose 

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:35.360
 in ribose. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.236
 So we will add a hydroxyl group here. 

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:42.257
 I can add a hydroxyl group here, 

00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:45.787
 actually will stain the hydrogen atoms in white. 

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:48.377
 We will add one hydroxyl group here, 

00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:49.724
 I will do it for all sugars 

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:51.660
 in the left chain spine, 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.012
 if I want this to be a single RNA chain. 

00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:57.270
 RNA is often single-chain. 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.854
 Oxygen, and then hydrogen. 

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:05.639
 Addition of a hydroxyl group instead of 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.473
 hydrogen, 

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:12.456
 tells us that this sugar is no longer deoxyribose. 

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:13.766
 This is ribose. 

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:18.906
 We already have a ribose in the spine, 

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.240
 which is a distinctive sign that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.122
 we have the backbone of RNA, ribonucleic acid, 

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:28.678
 instead of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. 

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:31.989
 You may think we are ready, but not completely, 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.667
 because the RNA's nitrogen bases are slightly different than 

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.755
 those of DNA. 

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:43.536
 At DNA, the nitrogen bases are 

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:48.316
 adenine, guanine - 

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:52.800
 Adenine and guanine are nitrogenous bases with two rings. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.664
 Here, this is adenine. 

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:56.288
 This is guanine. 

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:01.116
 DNA also has cytosine. 

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:06.056
 I will make every base in a different color. 

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:11.066
 Cytosine and thymine. 

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.956
 This is cytosine here, 

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:14.596
 and this is thymine. 

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:18.251
 Cytosine and thymine are nitrogenous bases with one ring. 

00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.649
 We call them pyrimidine bases. 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.584
 Adenine and guanine are called purine bases. 

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.044
 It was a small negotiation. 

00:03:24.464 --> 00:03:29.248
 In RNA we also have adenine, 

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.903
 as well as guanine. 

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:36.008
 We have cytosine, 

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.885
 but instead of Tymin, we have his very close relative - 

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:44.420
 uracil. 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.471
 On the drawing 

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:49.906
 this nitrogen base - Remember when we started the video, 

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:52.658
 it was double-stranded DNA, 

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:55.519
 this nitrogen base here is thymine, 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.352
 it forms hydrogen bonds with the adenine here. 

00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:01.242
 If I want to make it a uracil, 

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:06.203
 we just need to remove this methyl group, 

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:11.149
 so I'll do it and replace it with hydrogen. 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.608
 It is understood that hydrogen is here. 

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:17.466
 We now have uracil. 

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:21.999
 We see that uracil and thymine are very close molecules 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.762
 or very similar nitrogen bases, 

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.688
 so they can perform similar functions. 

00:04:27.688 --> 00:04:32.442
 Uracil is associated with 

00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:35.590
 adenine like thymine. 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.375
 Everything else, of course, remains the same. 

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:43.657
 An interesting question is - why uracil? Why not a Tymin? 

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:46.258
 Or why tire? Why did not uracil? 

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:49.508
 Based on what I've read, it turns out, 

00:04:49.508 --> 00:04:53.247
 that uracil creates more premise for mistakes. 

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:55.543
 It can be related to different things. 

00:04:55.543 --> 00:05:00.422
 He's a little more unstable than he is. 

00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:06.801
 Ie. uracil makes the RNA molecule 

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:10.235
 or the information exchange machine, 

00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:12.307
 less stable. 

00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:16.878
 This is a more unstable way of transferring information. 

00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:21.328
 In evolutionary history 

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:25.249
 RNA is thought to precede DNA. 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:28.703
 In the early evolutionary stages there have been many changes, 

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.566
 then the uracil was appropriate, 

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:33.465
 there have been many mistakes in the transfer of information, and so on. 

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.740
 But then it became necessary information to be a little more sustainable, 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.960
 and to have fewer preconditions for errors in its transmission. 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.680
 Then Tymin helped stabilize things. 

00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:45.769
 There is also such a question, "Why has the uracil been preserved?" 

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:48.998
 RNA molecules have many different roles in the cell. 

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.682
 The information RNA gets information 

00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.018
 of the DNA and transcribes it, 

00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:58.061
 to be translated using ribosomes. 

00:05:58.061 --> 00:05:59.685
 But mRNA should not be stuck forever to the ribosomes. 

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:02.003
 We want it to be a little unstable. 

00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.055
 So this is an interesting question of reflection. 

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:06.391
 Why do we have uracil instead of thymine? 

00:06:06.391 --> 00:06:08.362
 or why do we have thymine instead of uracil? 

00:06:08.362 --> 00:06:10.739
 Urticle is one of the clearest signs, 

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:14.396
 that we have an RNA molecule. 

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:17.088
 So what we have on the left, 

00:06:17.088 --> 00:06:18.858
 all this, 

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:20.948
 let's do it in a different color, 

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:25.193
 all this, this circuit here, 

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:27.605
 as illustrated, 

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.511
 can be regarded as RNA. 

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.088
 Assuming that this happened during transcription, 

00:06:33.088 --> 00:06:35.751
 when one DNA chain wants it 

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.597
 to copy your information, 

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:42.337
 then this will be mRNA, information RNA. 

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:44.323
 Think what's going on here? 

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:50.787
 Consider the orientation of the information RNA, 

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:54.358
 we have a phosphate group, 

00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:57.716
 then 5 &amp; apos; carbon, 4 &amp; apos ;, 3 &amp; apos; and a phosphate group, 

00:06:57.716 --> 00:07:00.373
 then a 5 ', 4', 3 'and a phosphate group, 

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:05.046
 The chain is oriented from 5 '(up) to 3' (below) 

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:07.742
 and these DNA molecules are oriented in the opposite direction. 

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:10.227
 It is a carbon atom 5 '. It is a 3 'carbon atom, 

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:12.929
 so we have phosphate, 3 ', 5', phosphate, 

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.865
 we have 3 'up and 5' down. 

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:23.555
 With the help of the names of the nitrogen bases, 

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:28.167
 we see that we have mRNA, 

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:33.470
 this is its 5 'end, and this is the 3' end, 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.569
 the above nitrogen base here is uracil. 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:47.123
 And the second is cytosine. 

00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:50.475
 It's cytosine. 

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:56.449
 This is cytosine here and this is transcribed 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.471
 of the DNA molecule on the right, 

00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.595
 so this is DNA and this DNA has an antiparallel orientation. 

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:06.546
 It is parallel but turned upside down. 

00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:10.914
 Sugars point in the opposite direction, 

00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:13.879
 so this is the 3 'end. 

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.064
 This is the 5 'end. 

00:08:16.064 --> 00:08:20.158
 We see that uracil is attached to adenine via a hydrogen bond. 

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:24.996
 This is adenine. 

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.987
 I'll draw dashed lines to indicate hydrogen bonds. 

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:34.578
 Cytosine is bound by hydrogen bonds with guanine. 

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:38.690
 This is guanine here. 

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.309
 I'll make the hydrogen bonds in white. 

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.427
 There are several hydrogen bonds here, 

00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:49.532
 but to be clear, this is mRNA, 

00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:52.197
 and on the right we have DNA. 

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:56.615
 This can happen during transcription. 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.387
 What kind of RNA is there? 

00:09:05.387 --> 00:09:07.093
 We have talked about it in other videos too. 

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:09.983
 We have an information RNA that plays an important role 

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:11.989
 when copying information from DNA, 

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:13.915
 to be translated 

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:16.460
 with mRNA in the ribosomes. 

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.385
 I have just mentioned another type of RNA, 

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:24.757
 transport RNA - mRNA. 

00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:31.962
 In the general video for transcription and translation, 

00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:33.770
 we are talking about the mRNA functions, 

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:39.032
 it binds amino acids at one end 

00:09:39.032 --> 00:09:41.916
 and there are anticodon at the other end. 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.748
 Anticodons bind to mRNA codons, 

00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:51.760
 in this way, proteins can be built up. 

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.056
 This is a visualization here 

00:09:56.056 --> 00:10:01.380
 of the mRNA molecule. 

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.814
 Often, when we think of DNA, 

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:08.329
 we say, well, mRNA or RNA is a mediator 

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:10.991
 thanks to which DNA information is translated into protein. 

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:13.286
 but sometimes 

00:10:13.286 --> 00:10:15.643
 we want the RNA itself. 

00:10:15.643 --> 00:10:18.508
 RNA itself plays a role in the cage 

00:10:18.508 --> 00:10:20.702
 beyond simple transmission of information 

00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:22.856
 and one example is mRNA. 

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:25.049
 You can see that there is an interesting configuration, 

00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:28.565
 in which the amino acid binds approximately in that region, 

00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:32.222
 and the anticodon are 

00:10:32.222 --> 00:10:34.618
 in the lower right corner. 

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:37.240
 The different mRNA molecules will bind to 

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.990
 different amino acids 

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.161
 and will have different anticodins. 

00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:43.559
 This is another function of RNA. 

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.642
 There is also ribosomal RNA, 

00:10:49.952 --> 00:10:53.128
 it plays a structural role in ribosomes, 

00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:56.033
 where translation takes place. 

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:59.122
 There is also a microRNA, 

00:11:00.142 --> 00:11:03.390
 these are short RNA chains, 

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.923
 which can be used to adjust the translation 

00:11:06.923 --> 00:11:09.260
 of other RNA molecules. 

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.776
 DNA gets a lot of attention, 

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.115
 but RNA is very, very, very important, 

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:16.147
 many people believe RNA has emerged first 

00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:18.484
 and the first life is likely 

00:11:18.484 --> 00:11:22.242
 or pseudo-life ever consisted of self-replicating RNA molecules. 

00:11:22.242 --> 00:11:25.573
 It is also possible that DNA has evolved from RNA, 

00:11:25.573 --> 00:11:29.075
 but RNA has remained, as it is still very useful.
