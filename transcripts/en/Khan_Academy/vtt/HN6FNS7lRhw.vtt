00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:02.310
- Create a picture graph to show

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.818
how many wands each fairy owns.

00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:08.649
So Glenda owns two wands,
Tink owns three wands,

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.979
Merry owns four wands, and
Gracie owns five wands.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.253
And in our picture graph,
each picture of a wand

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:19.990
represents one wand, it
is equal to one wand,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.208
it means one wand.

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.657
All right, so Glenda has two wands.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:28.210
So let's see, I'll click
one, two wands for Glenda.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.229
Tink has three wands.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.932
So I'm gonna have one,
two, three wands for Tink.

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:38.275
Merry has four wands, so I'll have

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:41.956
one, two, three, four wands for Merry.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.809
And then Gracie has five wands.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.455
So I'm gonna have one, two, three, four,

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:52.287
five wands for Gracie.

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:55.248
Let me check my answer, let's keep going,

00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:58.011
this is actually a lot of fun.

00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:02.564
The zookeeper measured four penguins.

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:07.384
Their heights were 40, 44,
48, and 48 centimeters.

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:10.335
Make a line plot of their heights.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:13.713
So a line plot, we have
a number line here,

00:01:13.713 --> 00:01:16.894
and we wanna put a dot,
as many dots as we have,

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:19.552
at a certain measurement.

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:22.873
So we have one penguin
that it was 40 centimeters,

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:25.379
so at 40 we have one
penguin right over there.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:28.538
We have another penguin
that's at 44 centimeters.

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.952
So we put 44 right over there.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:34.610
And then we have two
penguins at 48 centimeters.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.744
So we could put two dots right over there.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.831
Two penguins at 48 centimeters.

00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.166
So there you go.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.652
That is our line plot.

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:46.730
Let's keep going, this is a lot of fun.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.888
There are five books on the shelf.

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:51.965
The heights of the books are 32, 36, 38,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.461
32, and 35 centimeters.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.050
Make a line plot of the heights.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.241
So let's see, there is one
book that is 32 centimeters.

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.480
Then there is a book
that is 36 centimeters.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.485
Then there is a book
that is 38 centimeters.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.570
Then there is another book
that is 32 centimeters.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.532
So we actually have two books,

00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:18.596
one, two books that are at 32 centimeters.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.174
And then one book that is at 35.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.437
So there you go, I made the line plot.

00:02:23.437 --> 00:02:26.340
And remember, all a line
plot is is it's essentially

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.859
counting how many of each height we have.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.740
We have two at 32 centimeters,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.160
one at 35 centimeters,
one at 36, and one at 38.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.517
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.919
Robin Hood measured four arrows.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.877
The lengths were 26, 26,
23, and 25 centimeters.

00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:47.000
Make a line plot of the lengths.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.971
So we have two arrows that were 26,

00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.619
that were 26 centimeters.

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.929
So on 26 on our number line here

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.717
I'm gonna put two dots.

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:58.888
We have an arrow that's 23 centimeters,

00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:00.815
so I'll put one dot there.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.588
And then I have one arrow
that is 25 centimeters.

00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:05.110
So I'll put a dot there.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.873
And we're done.
