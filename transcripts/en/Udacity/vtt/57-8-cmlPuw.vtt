00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.315
To achieve the memory efficiency of a single bit

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.265
trie with the fast lookup properties of a direct

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:09.005
trie, a compromise is to use what's called a

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.480
multi-bit trie, or a multi-ary trie. Let's start with a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.830
binary trie, where one bit is resolved at each

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.750
node. Here, the depth is big W, the degree of

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.590
each node is two, and the stride for each

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.520
lookup is one bit. Now we can generalize this to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.550
a multi-ary trie, where the depth is now W over

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.410
K if the degree is 2 to the K, and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
each level resolves K bits. The binary trie is a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.737
simple case of the multi-ary trie, where K equals 1.
