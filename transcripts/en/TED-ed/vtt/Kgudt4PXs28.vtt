00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:10.558
You and a fellow castaway
are stranded on a desert island

00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:13.610
playing dice for the last banana.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.604
You've agreed on these rules:

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:17.146
You'll roll two dice,

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:21.069
and if the biggest number 
is one, two, three or four,

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:23.353
player one wins.

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:28.326
If the biggest number is five or six, 
player two wins.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:30.154
Let's try twice more.

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:33.247
Here, player one wins,

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.971
and here it's player two.

00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:37.741
So who do you want to be?

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:42.207
At first glance, it may seem 
like player one has the advantage

00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:46.222
since she'll win if any one 
of four numbers is the highest,

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:47.236
but actually,

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:53.619
player two has an approximately
56% chance of winning each match.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.527
One way to see that is to list all
the possible combinations you could get

00:00:57.527 --> 00:00:59.527
by rolling two dice,

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:02.674
and then count up 
the ones that each player wins.

00:01:02.674 --> 00:01:05.308
These are the possibilities
for the yellow die.

00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:07.784
These are the possibilities 
for the blue die.

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:13.214
Each cell in the chart shows a possible
combination when you roll both dice.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.269
If you roll a four and then a five,

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:17.445
we'll mark a player two 
victory in this cell.

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:22.496
A three and a one gives 
player one a victory here.

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:24.817
There are 36 possible combinations,

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:28.091
each with exactly the same 
chance of happening.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.236
Mathematicians call these
equiprobable events.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.801
Now we can see why 
the first glance was wrong.

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.466
Even though player one 
has four winning numbers,

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.560
and player two only has two,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.704
the chance of each number 
being the greatest is not the same.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:48.681
There is only a one in 36 chance
that one will be the highest number.

00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:52.857
But there's an 11 in 36 chance 
that six will be the highest.

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:55.586
So if any of these 
combinations are rolled,

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:57.473
player one will win.

00:01:57.473 --> 00:01:59.668
And if any of these 
combinations are rolled,

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:01.397
player two will win.

00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:03.719
Out of the 36 possible combinations,

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.819
16 give the victory to player one,
and 20 give player two the win.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.163
You could think about it this way, too.

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.359
The only way player one can win

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.639
is if both dice show 
a one, two, three or four.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.596
A five or six would mean 
a win for player two.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:26.705
The chance of one die showing one, two,
three or four is four out of six.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:30.556
The result of each die roll 
is independent from the other.

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:33.869
And you can calculate the joint 
probability of independent events

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.386
by multiplying their probabilities.

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:40.822
So the chance of getting a one, two, 
three or four on both dice

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:46.279
is 4/6 times 4/6, or 16/36.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.467
Because someone has to win,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:54.502
the chance of player two winning
is 36/36 minus 16/36,

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:57.303
or 20/36.

00:02:57.303 --> 00:03:01.409
Those are the exact same probabilities
we got by making our table.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.045
But this doesn't mean 
that player two will win,

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:09.413
or even that if you played 36 games
as player two, you'd win 20 of them.

00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:12.624
That's why events like dice rolling 
are called random.

00:03:12.624 --> 00:03:15.903
Even though you can calculate 
the theoretical probability

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.415
of each outcome,

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:22.070
you might not get the expected results
if you examine just a few events.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.417
But if you repeat those random events
many, many, many times,

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:30.357
the frequency of a specific outcome,
like a player two win,

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:33.418
will approach its theoretical probability,

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:36.372
that value we got by writing down 
all the possibilities

00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:39.039
and counting up the ones for each outcome.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.994
So, if you sat on that desert island
playing dice forever,

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:46.913
player two would eventually 
win 56% of the games,

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.995
and player one would win 44%.

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:53.564
But by then, of course, the banana
would be long gone.
