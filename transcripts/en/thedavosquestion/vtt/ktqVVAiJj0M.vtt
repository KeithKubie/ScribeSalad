00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Kay Leave, I've been asked to try and respond

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.089
to you.
And I think you are right on the money, or

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.860
a hammer on the nail or
whatever the right way of putting it.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.559
As we see things at little old WPP are we
would expect 2009

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.790
actually be quite a different year.
I don't think I would say things necessarily

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.080
will recover in 2009
but the first half is gonna be pretty awful.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.539
And second half, I think, will be as I look
at our budgets, the way we

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.860
look at things at this time in the year, are
pretty much flat revenues

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.339
from the year but certainly first half is
tougher and the second half

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.089
gets a little bit better, always things are
relative so the first half

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:46.289
and second half in 2009.
I think I'd expect 2010 to be, in the real

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.019
world at least, to be
a little better.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.469
Here at Davos, if you take what the people
say here is being important

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.600
or serous, certainly serious, or whether it's
important or not, it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.479
won't be saying as being pretty gloomy, pretty
pleasant less.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.500
I think that's pretty uniformly in the case.
And I would be identified as an optimist.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.420
ReVeene the colonist would be the probably
be the most negative talking

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.869
about latter part of 2010 is a recovery point
and the real world

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.960
or maybe later.
The other thing I think you will see is that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.150
back half of 2009, second
half 2009, we'll see a recovery in the natural

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.770
markets.
And that recovery will be sharper than people

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.840
anticipated because of
this love of money on the side.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.049
What are we have to do to get there?
Well, I think that the first fiscal stimulus,

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.289
the plans, stimulus,
people insisting on borrowing now is so great.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.240
I think as I was seeing CNBC this morning
they were talking about the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.640
as much as 8 trillion dollars being injected
into the U.S. economy

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.670
alone one way or another in the U.S. 14 trillion
dollars is about 40

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.859
trillion out about 32, 33 trillion around
the world.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.329
So it's all depending on President Obama.
We have high hopes.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.119
He's making very good noises and speedy noises
about putting in a -- a

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.340
stimulation package, one probably that won't
result -- won't be

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.890
increase taxes.
I think identified. I will be investing in

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.780
the right areas on
technology and productivity and competitiveness.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.930
So I'm quite optimistic that we'll get that
short-term stimulus.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.740
The U.S. I think will recover.
I think the big issue is Western Europe; France,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.850
Germany, Italy, and
Spain and U.K. will have massive government

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.170
deficits. Kosovo increased
inflation and higher long-term interest rates

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.110
which won't be helpful.
And here we are having gone through recession

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.250
being asked to lend more
and spend more and long term solution is for

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.080
us to save more so the
past growing markets, will burst in the next

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.300
11, will spend more
because that's where the savings are and that's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.830
where the capitalism
that's where the continued to be.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.350
So I'm not glooming, not as gloomy as most
here.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.680
And I'm looking for recovery in the year 2010
in real world and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.720
financial world and back half of 2009.
