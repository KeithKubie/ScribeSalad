00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.710
One of the main motivations for the rise

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.290
of virtual networking was the" ossification" of the

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.600
internet architecture. In particular because the internet protocol

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.060
was so pervasive, it made it very difficult

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.840
to make fundamental changes to the way the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.210
underlying internet architecture operated. There was a lot

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.110
of work on overlay networks in the 2000's

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.470
but one size fits all network architectures were very

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.960
difficult to deploy. So rather than try

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.260
to replace existing network architectures, network virtualization

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.310
was intended to allow for easier evolution.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.460
In other words, network virtualization enables evolution because

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.660
we didn't have to pick a winner for a replacement for IP. We could

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.360
instead let multiple architectures exist in parallel.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.400
Now, this was sort of a green field

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.990
view of why virtual networking was potentially a good idea. In practice, network

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.675
virtualization has really taken off in multi

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.580
-tenant data centers where there may be

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.980
multiple tenants or applications running on

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.010
a shared cluster of servers. Well know

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.540
examples of this include Amazon's EC2, Rack

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.490
Space, and things like Google App Engine.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.380
Large service providers such as Google, Yahoo

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.780
and so forth also use network virtualization

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.460
to adjust the resources that are devoted

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.570
to any particular service at a given time.
