00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.220
It is worthwhile looking at what we call the
Brownian motion.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.840
I hope you've heard of this.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.460
Robert Brown was a botanist here in London,
who lived about 140 years ago.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.740
And he found that if he put small grains of
pollen and looked at them with his microscope,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.780
put them in suspension in water, and looked
at them with his microscope,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.230
he often saw them, he often looked carefully,
dancing forever.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.019
Whether they were... even if they were dead,
they appeared to dance,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.540
he thought at first it was because they were
living.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.300
And then people learned that you can do it
with powdered sand, anything whatever.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.520
It dances incessantly. If it is small enough
and we look at it under the microscope.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.999
I think if you'll watch Bill put the microscope
on a sample,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.400
which contains a fine suspension of red powdered
pigment,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.920
in the suspension of water.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.420
And the microscope can magnify it up, and
when it has adjusted,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.600
the magnification of about 60-100 times, you
will see...

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.920
lights down I think please.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.840
You will see on the screen the in focus moving
particles.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.980
Notice how they dance forever.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.500
It's worth watching. It's a beautiful sight.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.560
And this has nothing whatever to do with their
life or their nature.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.380
Any particles, sufficiently small, placed
in a fluid or in a gas

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.060
where they're free to move, will show this
motion,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.920
if only the system is at the temperature of
the room.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.280
You can't get rid of this motion, no matter
what you do,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.320
we'll talk about that in the last lecture
quite a lot.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.800
Notice how it goes in a random way.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.940
Now to give some feeling what's going on,
we have a model here.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.380
In the model, which you will see projected
on the screen,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.960
we have a set of mock molecules.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.860
No, I think we want lights down, please.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.640
Mock molecules which are simply small steel
ball bearings.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.479
64th of an inch across, like the Feinman motor.
Magnified up here.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.460
And caused to move by a magnetic field which
is whirling around,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.750
causing their moving off in a somewhat random
way.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.960
Notice they're not precisely random, they
tend to stick together just as you'd expect.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.680
And they fly in all directions at that impurity,
like a big piece of pink pigment,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080
which we will show you presently. Just a piece
of paper.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.220
And it is sometimes hit on one side, sometimes
on the other.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.380
And since the number of molecules it hitted
is random, why of course,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.360
sometimes there's an unusual number on the
left, and not so many on the right,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720
in which case it moves to the right. And so
it goes.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.210
It does that random dance.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.000
And that's exactly what is happening in the
real Brownian motion

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.060
which we can look at again.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.000
In the real Brownian motion, you cannot see
the molecules,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.750
all you can see are the large impurities,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.090
moving about as the molecules irregularly
press them in one direction or another,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.160
because the molecules of course are in constant
motion

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.880
and the Brownian motion is the reflection
of molecular motion

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.840
by things that are large enough to be seen
in the microscope.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
Even a brick would show Brownian motion but
the motion is so small

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.260
that we can't detect it. Only in small particles
does the scaling allow its detection.
