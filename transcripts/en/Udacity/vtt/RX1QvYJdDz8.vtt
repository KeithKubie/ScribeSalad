00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.095
So, notice that in both cases, we're finding the distance between two points,

00:00:05.095 --> 00:00:10.721
here and here, and here and here. When we found the distance between these two

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:14.049
points, we set up a right triangle and found the horizontal distance between

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.848
them, and the vertical distance between them. This allowed us to use the

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.502
Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or the diagonal between the two

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:28.748
points. The same was true in this case for town 2. We found the distance

00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:32.272
horizontally between the mile markers. And then the distance vertically, or

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:36.840
south to go to the town. We squared these two numbers and found their sum, and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.315
then took the square root to get the distance. We can do something similar if

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:47.124
we wanted to find the distance between any two points. So, let's say we had

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:52.306
these points, negative 7 and 3, and 5 and 8. We can think of drawing two

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:57.788
interstates our roads, horizontally and vertically. And the distance between

00:00:57.788 --> 00:01:01.558
the two points is the diagonal, or the hypotenuse of the right triangle we just

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:06.134
created. To find the vertical distance between the two points, we want to look

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:10.636
at the y values. We can think about this vertical distance as starting at y

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:18.378
equals 3. Then it goes all the way up to y equals 8. So, if we find the

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:22.036
difference, or the amount between the y values, we'll get the vertical

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:26.604
distance, which is 5 here. So, knowing this, what do you think would be the

00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:29.279
horizontal distance? What's this distance?
