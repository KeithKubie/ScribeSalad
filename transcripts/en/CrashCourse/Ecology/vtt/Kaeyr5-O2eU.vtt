00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
For the past 12 weeks, we've been investigating
our living planet together,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.320
and learning how it works on many levels;
how populations of organisms interact,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.769
how communities thrive and ecosystems change,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
and how humans are wrecking the nice, perfectly
functioning systems

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.030
Earth has been using for hundreds of thousands
of years.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.520
And now it's graduation day!

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.700
This here is like the commencement speech, where I talk to you about the future and our role in it,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.120
and how what we're doing to the planet is
totally awful,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.640
but we're taking steps to undo some of the
damage that we've done.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.410
So what better way to wrap up our series on
ecology than by taking a look at

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.630
the growing fields of conservation biology
and restoration ecology.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.920
These disciplines use all the kung fu moves
that we've learned about in the past 11 weeks

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.280
and apply them to protecting ecosystems and cleaning up the messes that we've already made.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.600
And one of the main things they teach us is
that doing these things is difficult,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.659
like, in the way that uncooking bacon is difficult.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.679
So let's look at what we're doing, and try to uncook this unbelievably large pile of bacon we've made!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.040
[Theme Music]

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.800
Just outside of Missoula, Montana, where I live, we've got a Superfund site. Not Superfun... Superfund.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.900
A hazardous waste site that the government
is in charge of cleaning up.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.440
The mess here was made more than a hundred
years ago,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.880
when there was a dam in the Clark Fork River
behind me called the Milltown Dam.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.620
This part of Montana has a long history of
copper mining, and back in 1908,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.780
there was a humongous flood that washed about
4.5 million cubic meters of mine tailings

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.200
chock full of arsenic and toxic heavy metals
into the Clark Fork River.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.730
And most of it washed into the reservoir created
by the Milltown dam.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.200
I mean, actually it was lucky that the dam
was there.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.850
It had only been completed six months before,
or the whole river system,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.450
all the way to the Pacific Ocean, would have
been a toxic mess.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.920
As it happened, though, only about 160 kilometers
of the river was all toxic-messed-up.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.300
A lot of it recuperated over time, but all that nasty hazardous waste was still sitting behind Milltown Dam,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.360
and some of it leached into the groundwater
that started polluting nearby resident's wells.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.720
So scientists spent decades studying the extent
of the damage caused by the waste

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.170
and coming up with ways to fix it.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.030
And from 2006 to 2010, engineers carefully removed all the toxic sediment as well as the dam itself.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.620
Now, this stretch of the Clark Fork River runs unimpeded for the first time in over a century,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.700
and the restored area where the dam used to
be is being turned into a state park.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
Efforts like this show us conservation biology
and restoration ecology in action.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.660
Conservation biology involves measuring the biodiversity of an ecosystem and determining how to protect it.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.360
In this case, it was used to size up the health
of fish populations in the Clark Fork River,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.360
which were severely affected by the waste
behind the dam,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.540
and the dam blocking their access to spawning
grounds upstream,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.580
and figuring out how to protect them during
the dam's removal.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.780
Restoration ecology, meanwhile, is the science
of restoring broken ecosystems,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.760
like taking an interrupted, polluted river and turning it into what you see taking shape here.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.160
These do-gooder, fix-it-up sciences are practical
rather than theoretical.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.349
By which I mean, in order to fix something
that's broken,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.390
you've got to have a good idea of what's making
it work to begin with.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.670
If something was wrong with the expansion
of the Universe,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.010
we wouldn't be able to fix it because we have
no idea, at all, what's making all that happen.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.780
So in order to fix a failing ecosystem, you have to figure out what was holding it together in the first place.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.760
And the glue that holds every ecosystem together
is biodiversity.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.120
But then of course, biodiversity can mean
many different things.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.960
So far we've generally used it to mean species diversity, or the variety of species in an ecosystem.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.620
But there are also other ways of thinking about biodiversity that help conservation biologists

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.690
and restoration ecologists figure out how
to save species and repair ecosystems.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.790
In addition to the diversity of species,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.570
ecologists look at genetic diversity within
a species as a whole and between populations.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.739
Genetic diversity is important because it
makes evolution possible

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.620
by allowing a species to adapt to new situations
like disease and climate change.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.080
And then another level of biodiversity has
to do with ecosystem diversity,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.440
or the variety of different ecosystems within
an area.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.379
A big ol' forest, for example, can host several kinds of ecosystems, like wetland, alpine, and aquatic ones.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.530
Just like we talked about when we covered
ecological succession,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.910
the more little pockets you've got performing different functions, the more resilient the region will be as a whole.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.560
So, yeah, understanding all of this is really important to figuring out how to repair an ecosystem that is in shambles.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.500
But how do conservation biologists take the information about what makes an ecosystem tick

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.060
and use it to save the place from going under?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.400
Well, there's more than one way to approach
this problem.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.460
One way is called small-population conservation.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.960
This approach focuses on identifying species
and populations that are really small,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.660
and tries to help boost their numbers and
genetic diversity.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.430
Low population and low genetic diversity are
kind of the death knell for a species.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.840
They actually feed off each other, one problem
making the other problem worse,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.350
ultimately causing a species to spiral into
extinction.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.770
See, when a tiny little population suffers
from inbreeding or genetic drift,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.110
that is, a shift in its overall genetic makeup,
this leads to even less diversity,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.840
which in turn causes lower reproduction rates
and higher mortality rates,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.690
which makes the population smaller still.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.710
This terrible little dynamic is known by the
awesome term extinction vortex.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.820
The next step is to figure out how small a
population is too small.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.010
Ecologists do this by calculating what's called
the minimum viable population,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.760
which is the smallest size at which a population
can survive and sustain itself.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.810
To get at this number, you have to know the
real breeding population of,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.710
say, grizzly bears in Yellowstone National
Park.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.960
And then you figure out everything you can
about a grizzly's life history:

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.080
how long they live, who gets to breed the most, how often they can have babies, that kind of thing.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.770
After all that information is collected, ecologists
can run the numbers

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.990
and figure out that for the grizzlies in Yellowstone,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.430
a population of, say hypothetically, 90 bears would have about a 95% chance of surviving for 100 years.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.520
But if there were a population of 100 bears, the population would likely be able to survive for 200 years.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.580
Something to note: ecology involves a lot of math so if you're interested in this, that's just the way it is.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.500
So, that's the small-population approach to
conservation.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.540
Another way of preserving biodiversity focuses
on populations whose numbers are in decline,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.110
no matter how large the original population
was.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.680
This is known as declining population conservation, and it involves answering a series of related questions

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.980
that get at the root of what's causing an
organism's numbers to nosedive.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.000
First, you have to determine whether the population's
actually declining.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.940
Then, you have to figure out how big the population historically was and what its requirements were.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.240
And finally, you have to get at what's causing the decline and figure out how to address it.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.900
Milltown Dam actually gives us a good example
of this process.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.700
In the winter of 1996, authorities had to release some of the water behind the dam as an emergency measure,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.020
because of a big ice flow in the river that
was threatening to break the dam.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.880
But when they released the water, a bunch
of toxic sediment went with it,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.140
which raised the copper concentrations downriver
to almost 43 times what state standards allowed.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:48.680
As a result, it's estimated about half of the fish downstream died. Half of the fish! Dead!

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.979
And researchers have been monitoring the decline
in populations ever since.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.159
This information was really helpful in determining
what to do with the dam,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.020
because we knew what the fish population was
like before and after the release of the sediment.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.360
It was decided that it would be best to get the dam out as soon as possible, rather than risk another 1996 scenario.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.740
Which brings me to the place where conservation
biology and restoration ecology intersect.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.660
Restoration ecology is kind of where the rubber
meets the road in conservation biology.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.550
It comes up with possible solutions for ecological
problems.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.250
Now, short of a time machine, which I'm working
on,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.100
you can't really get a natural environment
exactly the way that it used to be.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.800
But you can at least get rid of whatever is
causing the problem

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.700
and help re-create some of the elements that
the ecosystem needs to function properly.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.740
All of this involves a whole suite of strategies.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.830
For instance, what's happening in Milltown
is an example of structural restoration,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.850
basically the removal and cleanup of whatever
human impact was causing the problem.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.710
In this case, the dam and the toxic sediments
behind it.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.860
And then the rebuilding of the historical
natural structure, here the meanders of the

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.850
river channel and the vegetation.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.389
Another strategy is bioremediation, which recruits organisms temporarily to help remove toxins,

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.530
like bacteria that eat wastes or plants that
leach out metals from tainted soils.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.720
Some kinds of fungi and bacteria are even
being explored as ways to bio-remediate oil spills.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.000
Yet another, somewhat more invasive restoration
method is biological augmentation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.980
Rather than removing harmful substances, this
involves adding organisms to the ecosystem

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.980
to restore materials that are gone.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.420
Plants that help fix nitrogen like beans,
acacia trees, and lupine

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.410
are often used to replenish nitrogen in soils that have been damaged by things like mining or overfarming.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.770
And ecologists sometimes add mycorrhizal fungi to help new plantings like native grass take hold.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.170
But of course, we're just humans, and we're
not as smart as millions of years of evolution.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.860
Sometimes we get things wrong.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.420
For example, when you bring an invasive species into a place to eradicate another invasive species,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.860
sometimes you just end up with two invasive
species on your hands,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.080
which collapses the ecosystem even more rapidly.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.720
The introduction of cane toads to Australia in the 1930s to control beetles is a particularly infamous example.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.740
Not only are they everywhere now but because
they're toxic,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.459
they're poisoning native species like dingos
that try to eat them. Nice.

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.610
So you know what?
I have an idea.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.550
After spending the past couple of weeks talking
about ecological problems,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.660
I've come to the conclusion that it's just easier to protect ecosystems rather than trying to fix them.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.420
Because we know a lot about what makes ecosystems
tick,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.600
so if we spend more time trying to save them
from us and our stuff,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.760
we'll spend less time cleaning up after ourselves
and running the risks of getting it wrong.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.300
Because as we all know, the sad fact is: uncooking
bacon is impossible. But we can eat it.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.180
Thank you for joining me on this quick three-month
jaunt through the natural world.

I hope it made you smarter not just in terms
of passing your exams,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.080
but also in terms of being a Homo sapien that
inhabits this planet more wisely.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.160
And thank you to everyone who helped us put
these episodes together:
