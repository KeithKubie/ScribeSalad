Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Let me find my

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       waiver signed away over new [inaudible]. Right. We're live. Great. While you said that sounds great. I'm glad that people are seeing me. Neil Brennan, size witness, everyone will be a notary, notary republic. I wonder if they can live, there's a software that can listen to the sound your pan is making and figure out the lines you're drawing. You know, they have um, technology now where when people are speaking in a room with a, with a window, they can get rid of the window noise. They can know, they can tune into the vibrations of the window from the sound of your voice and pick up everything that's being said in the room.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       I heard that there's a Netflix you because before, I mean Netflix doesn't give people ratings, but there's a way that there you can get, they can gauge reflections off of with some weird fucking technology where, and it's fairly accurate. Reflections off a window. Yes. I don't sell secondhand. Yeah. Like second hand. Not at, it's like, I believe it's sound waves. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:07       oh wow. What are they monitoring? Jamie's got something. I have no idea. [inaudible] by this right now, if you want Jamie long range laser listening device, the long range laser listening device, laser microscope is a highly sophisticated surveillance apparatus that utilizes an invisible infrared laser beam to eavesdrop on a target, does the most effective long range laser listening device in the world. That allows the operator to conduct an undetectable surveillance operation on any target from Tony Stark industry with at least one window at an impressive distance of over 500 meters. That is actually very impressive are that's far as shit with the laser beam Gottschalk and you can just buy that, as I say, that's commercially available. And I wonder what is not commercially available. Oh, for sure. Right out there. Like you remember when there was that story about a some weird sound weapon they think that the Cubans are using on, yeah, Americans that were in Cuba, this probably a bunch of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       I was reading an article they can list like submarines, have technology, they can listen to basically like fish farting in the ocean. If they, if they wanted to, they can hear sounds that quiet, they can hear anything. So if, uh, like literally a fish farts, they're like, oh, what was that? What was that? Was that a sub? Nope, it was a fish next. Like what was the next sound good for us or something good for somebody? Good for us I guess. Uh, yeah, the sound thing was funny cause it was like people would get sick and they quit and then there was also, they didn't shine it too. They were like, they at uh, American civil like Ngo, like government or like kind of worked for the government tangentially. Or they worked at the embassy there. Apartments were above each other. Two separate people. And both of them, it was on 60 minutes, like not long ago. So they targeted the rooms. Yeah. It's like a dog whistle for people. It yes. In essence. And it's like, well, do you want me to

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       do, I guess you just leave. I guess it is like a dog whistle. Just shares. Yeah, the Fuck Outta here. Oh yeah. There's probably a ton of technology like that that we're not aware of. My friend Mike Swick, he used to fight in the UFC and before that he did a brief brief, spent a stint rather um, in the military he was doing something, some sort of a, he is either secret service work or something along those lines. But anyway, he was at the embassy in Russia and he said that they had found listening devices that were so sophisticated that they were being powered by the natural sway of the building. Wow. With the wind. So the wind, they didn't need a power source. The natural swaying of the building in the wind was powering up this little microphone that was listening in on things and he said they were, they were looking at this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       They're like, we don't know anything like this. Like this is completely new stuff. And that we found it in the building. I like, I mean, I don't love it, but it's like kind of cool. It's cool. Yeah. Like I just don't kill me or us. You know what I mean? Like the hope is we just boat would they have their thing and we hadn't, it's just like mutually assured destruction. Like an arms race of technology cause that's what's gonna happen. The amount do you use the cloud? Yes. I know like I don't use it for important stuff but I use it for like my apps. Yeah. All my apps are backed up in the cloud. Recordings are backed up in the cloud sets sets, but there's no photos or video. Let's just have been like, I don't know man. It's fucking crazy. I mean we're, we're, we're getting down to some very strange place with the cloud.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       Let's stuff be in the air and the amount of trust, it takes a, the presumption that we'll just never run out of energy and we'll never run out of the ability to tap into the cloud. It's like I don't, that seems presumption. I, I'm not even like a doomsday person, but I just feel like it's like the difference between how men dress in public and how women dress. Like on a night out, women are wearing heels and guys are dressed in case they have to fight. I'm still like, we will do the thing. And the mayor were like, ah, I'll fucking, I'll fuck you up. And like, that's how I feel with technology where I'm like, what do I have a backup plan for this? Even people with like, why Phi door locks? I'm like, I don't know man. I don't know man. I don't know if the Wifi goes out, what are you going to yeah. Like please be care. I don't, I don't know what the, what the negative scenario is, but even my garage in my place and I live in like a townhouse thing and there was a power outage, the gate won't open. And like there's no release was a fail. There was a release, uh, that somebody, a better person than I figured out. You know what I mean? I would have just like,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       we're like the mud kid come Uber, I didn't have a fucking plan, but someone figured out, like, you open a hatch and then there's a chain and you got to pull the chain. And then was like, okay, but it wasn't, uh, it wasn't easy. Like, I, you know, it's the doomsday thing. It's like, yeah, well

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       this Guy Graham Hancock. Yeah, this guy's been on my show several times. He's just done recently and he's one of the main proponents of this theory that something somewhere around 12,800 years ago hit the earth and fucked up everything and probably reset civilization killed off the vast majority of us. 12,200 that's not that long ago, not that long ago. At on corresponds with the end of the ice age. There's a lot of physical evidence for it and increasingly we're seeing more and more evidence in terms of ancient cultures that existed far before a 12,800 years ago. They really didn't understand that. They thought people were just hunter gatherers back then. Now they're finding evidence of things like there's a place called go Beckley tappy, which is a giant, these huge monolithic structures that are made out of stone carving, like huge columns that don't seem like they were made by hunter gatherers. It seems like there was probably some sort of a lost civilization and they know that this all happened somewhere around that time, somewhere around 12,000 years ago. So, um, it can happen again and if it does happen again, all our stuff is on digital now, which is even weirder. It's weirder than books, right? We have books, but the vast majority of most of the data that we all keep and share, we share on phones and on computers and we can't read it. We can't read it without compromise.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       I don't know the first thing about, do you know what I mean? Like I don't know anything about, I was, I was talking last night, like I don't know much about my, the different, the, the level of education women have about their reproductive organs versus men. Oh yeah. Like my, my balls, I know about my balls. I know that the medical term, his testicles. Hmm. That's about it. Don't go hot if you get them hot again, that's like, that's like a child. You know what I mean? Like Saturday. And you only know that from like, oh cause I got 'em hot one time. But I don't know how semen gets to the, I don't know the name of the two. I don't know anything cause that's my body. Right. Women know tons of, they know fallopian tubes with a vulva, cervix, like everything. Um, yeah. Guys know prostate cancer room blows my asshole. Ooh. Oh yeah. And not curious. I mean, like, not like curious in a way of like, I, let's just hope, just hope for the [inaudible] none of my business plus to get checked out, you have to have a finger in your ass and everybody puts that off. Yeah. Now me, why women do that once he constantly, they're always getting jabbed at and swab to swab. Yes. They get the Pap smear. US smear the, the title. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       We'll fuck Jesus. Just every imagine if you needed people to come inside you, he needed them to not just, not just exchange bodily fluids by kissing. Now they have to squirt something in you to make people. Yeah. I have this odd, they're poisonous little dirty DNA. Their dirty little fucking infected. It's awfully gross. Okay. Maybe you get like 10 feet away from it. You're like, Jesus, what they're doing, but why you're in the moment. It seems like the most logical you gotta do it. CanNot do it. Yeah. Did you, uh, speaking of that too, do you see the thing about Gerad? No, that I don't if you want to bring it up, but he basically came out a little on HBO, came out, came out a little too. His mom said I've had a sexual experiences with men. Oh. Um, and uh, it's a, it's just like, was she cool with it?

Speaker 3:          00:09:58       Yeah, she was cool with it. Yeah. That's, I think when I, people are like, what are you think? I'm like, I don't, that sexual preference at this point to me is about as interesting as like your workout routine. Like I just don't care. Like what are you doing? Hey, go cold. You know what I care about? Are you funny? Are you funny? And Are you cool? Yeah. And, and like do we have shit to talk about? Right. Great. Yeah, I don't, I couldn't care less who's, what type of hand you like jerk and yet, you know what I mean? Like I think it's kind of a mouth with some guys who like Tim Dillon, I think it's an advantage with his act that he's gay because he's so ridiculous. And over the top and he's just like big fat gay guy, but he doesn't really talk to them.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       He'd talk about it very much. Talk about it sometimes. Yeah, but I mean, it's not a big deal to him. He treats it the way God treats the sexuality. Look, you don't have to go blaring through the streets of your straight all the time. Right. You are. I usually assume you're really not. Right, right. There's no, yeah, there's straight. You're straight. If you're not, no one fucking cares. And the comedy community, literally, no one cares. Yeah. Doesn't it makes any difference? The only thing that bums me out is when guys hide it. It's like, come on, does it bum you out for them or for them? Yeah, I'd really bumped, but having said that, I get it. I get it. Like it's a real bummer. It's sad. We know a few guys that are in the closet and it's, you just feel bad for them.

Speaker 3:          00:11:14       Like Zach, like, yeah, man, I hope it's not unbearable. Right. You know what I mean? Like, like I get while you're, while you're in the closet. I get why actors in the closet, like especially male actors like cause it doesn't serve them to come out. It's not gonna it's not gonna help them. I think it's the worst thing for them in terms of like getting roles as a heterosexual. If you're a known homosexual, you almost can't get roles as a heterosexual. Yeah. Like I remember there were some who is a, what is that guy's named Neil Patrick Harris. He was in something where he played like this arrogant guy who likes girls. He was in a it now. Well No, and now he was on to uh, how I met your mother. Yeah. And that worked. He also played a straight guy in a gone girl pretty well.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       Yeah. Was that before or it was at Cape. Both Ben after. Really. And I was all, cause I said, I was surprised that that's what he played. But like certain people, they just, I don't know. He might put the only guy that I agree that like he came out and it's not, then he's he you buy it somehow as a romantic lead. You think that it's like it cancels that out. Like if Tom Cruise decided to come out, if Tom Cruise is gay and he decided to come out, like that would be a real problem. You know what? I was talking to somebody about this the other day, you know it be a hilarious movie into a gay couple because Tom Cruise and John Travolta, John Travolta, John Travolta gets kidnapped and gay. Tom Cruise has to save his gay husband John Travolta. But other than that it's a real action movie. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       It's just gay. I like it when that'd be fucking cool. Like just a straight get, if anyone out there, a screen writer that have at it, because I'm never going to write it. Would that fly when people enjoy that? Like if it was really good like John Wick style, I think it would. I really think it would if it was, if the guy just kicked, it's not like gay guys are like a feet and offend you. I know plenty of like rough gay guys that will whoop your ass. Like bro Bears, Bro. Her they got, they got their own crowd. That's how fucking bad these guys are. Uh, yeah. I too really it would be fucking so cool. Like, and he was going to, yeah. Cause that's how I feel with someone like drunk coming out. I'm like, I don't care. Okay. I know it's never come up are we've been good friends for a decade.

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       Just never came up. Yeah. Like he didn't seem that interested in women, but I don't, I also don't think he's not interested in just maybe there's definitely a spectrum. Right. And so people are just, yeah. And that's fine too. Yeah. I'm also not met. Like if I were on the spectrum, I think I would absolutely do it. Yeah. I'm just not on the spectrum like I, but in terms of opportunity, there's a lot of nights a year, Joe. Oh yeah. There's 365 nights a year. Yeah. You could, you're not going to do the Pussy Dick Go. You go back the same night, split it up. Dahmer. I had the best joke about that. He goes, he goes, I, he goes, this is how little I give a fuck. He goes, I wish I was gay just so I could come out. Yeah. It was, I wish, I wish I had a secret like that.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       Yeah. That's how little I give a fuck. It's true. It's like his joke about I'm gaining weight for a movie. I don't know what the movie is yet, but it's fucking great joke. Um, yeah, but uh, gay action movie was fantastic. I like it. I do too. I, within a year or two, people would be definitely ready for it. I it, if it were a legit good action movie. Yeah. I think they'd be, if it were Tom Hardy, even if maybe if they were both one of was straight and one of them was Tom already and he just plays gay and, and like he, it's, it's taken, but it doesn't have to be two gay guys can be even crazier. Two straight guys who have to make out. Yeah. They could be played by white straight guys. Absolutely. Then we're right now we're talking, now we're really talking now you caulking and commitment.

Speaker 3:          00:15:10       Because I was thinking about do whim if Tom Cruise was gay, right? Uh, and he just came out and there's a movie where he has to save his wife. Would women not believe it? Do you know what I mean? Like, like, so if you come out, so it's like, all right, so now in the next mission impossible, they just kidnap his husband. Yeah. Well for sure you could do that with lesbians if you had two hot lesbians. Yeah, of course. 100%. Yeah, no, there's zero issue. That would be no problem. Uh, there'd be no resistance. And that's a difference too. You know, a lesbian actress, they can go a woman who a lesbian. You know why the trays? I believe gay straight because there's a big portion of men who never truly believe a lesbian. I have a bit about it. Yeah. I had a bit about from one of my old specials.

Speaker 3:          00:15:57       So like we believe that you believe you're a lesbian. Yeah. But uh, just ain't got a pizza this week. Stick yet. He never spent a Saturday with me. Fucking Applebee's. I hit you with an Applebee's and the bar corner bar. Forget it. The panty dropper. Tequila shots. What do you got? Oh, Brokeback mountain. Yeah. There wasn't really an action though. I know. If we, we know for sure that both of those guys are not gay. We do not. We us, I mean Jake Dillon Hall Straight and you say, so heath ledger, but you saw that movie house. True Man. Come on, man. You saw he buy, you believed it, Jack. No one's that good at acting. Definitely crazy. There's no way he could play crazy. That guy's definitely gay. Trust me. I know things. I've seen many movies and understand them. I know when someone's acting and someone's just gay fucking kid, that was easy for him.

Speaker 3:          00:16:52       Yeah. No, it would be that, but running around. Yeah, that could happen. That could, I think that could happen. I think we're on the verge of that. I would enjoy it. I'm happy for it because then people stop getting free passes where you're goofy, but you're gay. So we let you slide with silly behavior like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want equality. I want you me to be able to call you a dunce and not have to worry about being homophobic and no one hears gay dunce. Right. When you say you just got to get this guy's a fucking dummy. Hey, hey. Yeah. God, you're homophobic. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah, it's the it, that's how we would go at the comedy cellar. Like it just like this fucking dunce here. It would count. Did I hear that the, the comedy cellar is like, seriously has a social justice warrior infestation, like they need to like spray the place.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       Oh, I don't, I mean, when I've been there and it hasn't been like that, that's me. They've been, there had been people writing about it. There've been, I mean it's like the comedy cellar, like the main hub of culture now. It's like the hub of wokeness. Yeah, I mean, but it's also like the, the main battlefield of wokeness where it's like, literally we came and they were protesters and then I couldn't sit at the table and I, because it's like, all right. I mean, yeah. I don't think it's pull your dick out. Yeah, exactly. Louie. To pull it dick out. And she was a hero. I was, I was quoting all these tweets, uh, that we're talking about it in articles that were written hero. She was heroic. I think that, I think someone sent me a Louis article today. I think there's just fatigue at this point.

Speaker 3:          00:18:23       Yes. I think people are just like taught like, what's he, I don't. Okay. Try to find a new stormy Daniels article. Yeah. Everybody's like, enough. Yeah. Try. We thought it was going to work. It didn't work. Fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. Fuck. He doesn't care. Shit. Justin Martindale was, and I'll never forget, he's in the fucking hallway of the comedy store as flamboyant as he could ever be. And he goes, that's our Monica Lewinsky. She's going to take them down. I'm like, good luck. Stormy Daniels. Yeah. I'm like, good luck man. I ain't gonna do shit. So what's the worst thing that comes out of this? That he fucked her or they paid her to keep quiet and she didn't keep quiet. What's the worst thing do we think he doesn't fuck. Yeah, it's all different strains on like we knew he was gross. No one cared.

Speaker 3:          00:19:08       The only way that we'll, it goes, he raises taxes. Yeah. Or then he'll lose his base or you a raise the taxes on lower middle class people. And if he, if he like doesn't stand by as abortion stuff, but otherwise all the donors are sticking with them. Everyone sticking with them. What happened yesterday, there was a new abortion ruling. Was it an Alabama? Yes. Basically outlawed. I personally believe it's going to backfire. You think so? Yeah. Cause I think people, the thing that that's always been true was republicans were against abortion and they would go like we and they never got to repeal it. Right. But I think they're going to repeal it and then people are going to go like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. This is crazy. If you don't want to get abortions, fine, but you can't, uh, change a law based on a lot of times, not even a plurality of, of, uh, you know, like in general elections, like in the general presidential election, like it's not even the majority of the country that elects the president.

Speaker 3:          00:20:07       Now what do, who vote? Was this something that the people of Alabama voting? No, it's the, it's the, the government, like the state a slippery slope. Yeah. And it's like you're going, you're doing 99 years in jail if you get an a, if you give an abortion or get one. Yeah. That's what it is now. Yeah. That's what it's going to, that's the law that they passed. I just personally believe that. I mean, I'm obviously hopeful, but it's a bit like, no, that's too far. It's a bit like when they made Clinton testify and people were like, ah, that was too, that was like tha tha tha tha too, too far. Uh, the aline was crossed where they may Clinton testify about sex life and it was like,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       hmm, we don't like that. We understand that you wanted to rebuke the guy but don't make the press. And I feel like I'm hoping and I believe it's true, uh, that it will be too far field for moderate people.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       Well I hope you're right and it's just, it's very dangerous when you just decide that no one can do it anymore based on a few people's decision that is going to affect the millions of people that live in Alabama.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       We'll also keep abortion laws are odd cause it it the assumption is the reason Christians want to outlaw it is because they think God is going to say what's with your vote on that? I saw that you voted for abortion. What? Like do you want to kill babies? Yeah. So you want to kill baby was like, well no I didn't. I didn't kill anybody just yet. But you voted for it. It's like they don't want to live in a country where that's legal. Having said that, if you Google the worldwide rights of abortion, it's not legal everywhere. Which surprised me because I was like, where is it? What is America's a, where do we stand within the rest of the world? And there are not a ton of countries, but there's an, there's, I think it's illegal in a quarter of the world. Wow. Um, if not more,

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       well, abortion is one of those things where it's like, okay, when does it bother you? It doesn't bother me at all. If you're two days pregnant, doesn't bother me at all. Bothers me a little. If you're four months pregnant, bothers me a lot. If you're five or six, bothers me a lot. If you look really pregnant, you get an abortion. It's like, what? What, what is that? Is that a baby that would be viable outside the womb? Cause it's one of those, it's, it's something that people just have a deep discomfort about when discussing, even if you're a supporter of it, if you just discuss the actual reality of what it is, what the act is with this surgical procedure is, and it makes, you know, it's not, it's not nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       That's the saying, it's not enough. Right. Like, and, and I think that one of the indicators that it's not nothing, and I'm pro pro choice. Yeah. Like, um, you're right wing Joe. Everybody knows that. Um, for some so far right. To go the other way and left. Um, the backside, the, I actually do want to talk about that, uh, the, the presumption about you, um, that, you know, the one of the indicators is when people talk about even getting an abortion, they are, they always whisper about it. And I don't know if it's because of the stigma or thinks because they, it's kind of not nothing. Yeah. It's a personal thing too. I don't think they want to discuss it with other folks, but I wouldn't care if he got it, if I've got a cyst removed. I mean, if that's the indication, yeah. It's just a medical procedure. And again, pro choice have added. Yeah. I'm sure. I've never, I don't, I haven't had any abortions that I know of. Um, but I don't, I don't know at what I'd be like, ah,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       when these attitudes about it, about the taboo of discussing it though and impedes rational discourse and impedes your ability to talk about things and communicate about them because you have to have this very rigid opinion that you're always pro abortion pro women's rights, woman's right to choose, which I am. It is, but we're still talking about a real thing and that real thing is killing a thing that would grow up to be a person and that's why people freak out about it and to pretend otherwise is just disingenuous.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Louis was the first one I heard talk about that on stage and in a way that was funny where like if they think they're burner babies down there, yeah, I'd protest too if I thought they were, if there was a place that I thought these people are murdering babies, right. I'm out there every day. Yeah. I, he's like, I don't care. I personally think they are murdering babies. I don't care. It's, this was before that

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       trouble and this is one of the things like when like that Parkland joke that he did, I was like, look, that's not his best joke, but it's also, he's working it out yet then stand up in 10 fucking months. He's working it out. But if you say that he's different now we're getting to see the real Louis like bitch, you better go through his library. That's what he did.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       Yeah. The apartment and was like his ninth most offensive joke. Yeah. Not even close. And he's, he's, that's what he does. It's called comedy. Yeah. They, the idea was like we'll put, we didn't know he was, he didn't know him. Yeah. Cause you know, you assume what you believed, what he fed or you, you wanted to believe. I actually, I have a theory that one of the reasons people like the New York Times and, and, and, uh, other media outlets got brought the hammer down so hard on him is because they'd heard the rumors and ignored them. So now they have to signal that like this is wrong. Because there were rumors before and they were like, we don't like they, they ignore them. So now they have to overcompensate and be like, he is absolutely, he's the face of hypocrisy and evil. I'm just like, okay, well he just caught it at the worst time.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He just a bad, he had beach front property during a turn it, yeah. Yeah. He just is like some arcades you can just tell you got the deep stilts, not this one mother fucker. Like he had flush on sure. Flat. He's walking around and I was going, oh my God, this is my cup. Oh my cup. Uh, here's what I want to talk about with you. The idea, cause whenever I tell people were friends or that I go on your show, they're like, how can, I'm like, first of all, because you're a fucking good dude and have been a good dude for 27 years that I know of. To me, um, it doesn't mean you're always get whatever. You're always good to do that. Every time I said, whatever, I don't fucking know your life. I don't know what you do. Outside of fucking Encino, uh, the, uh, and now the next question becomes why do you have cranks on, or what people would consider cranks on the show. And you and I have talked about this a little bit off the show. Explain because

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       you are basically liberal. Yes. But you believe in having hardcore right wing people on because you like them personally or you like you believe it's worth some of them I like personally, so it's worth having a conversation. Like Ben Shapiro was one that I had a long conversation with. He's one of the more controversial guys that I have on how people get upset at me and call me an outrider. You mean while he's been attacked by the alt right. You know, I mean he wears a Yarmulke for Christ sake and he's not alt right. It's not a white supremacist by any stretch of the imagination. He was the number one target for antisemitic remarks in the entire world. 2016. Well he's that. There's that. It's definitely dead. But we had an in depth conversation, a very long one about gay people. Yeah. Cause he's a little bit of it where he was like, he kind of didn't, he kinda got a little lost.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       Well, yeah, because it doesn't, well he had two different t here's David Parkman, uh, had, uh, an interesting take on it. Pacman said that if you look at his explanation, because I asked him a couple things, I'm like, do you really believe that Moses part of the Red Sea? And he said, I would look for more naturalistic explanation for that. But then when I talked to him about gay people and gay things, he wasn't interested in a naturalistic explanation. And he also wasn't interested in giving people the ability to do whatever they want. He felt like you're not, you're supposed to resist that. And his take is that like, you, you have an urge to murder people, but you don't do it because you're a good person and you should do the same thing with being gay. And I was like, wow, that's crazy. That's crazy. Mental gymnastics.

Speaker 2:          00:28:24       So that is a natch he believes the natural occurring thing that God is testing you with. I mean, I'm putting words in his mouth. I think, but essentially that's his position. His position is that God doesn't want you to do that. It's in the Bible. He doesn't do it. I mean he, he goes hard. He doesn't use electricity in the Sabba till the sun goes down the whole deal. Yeah. And um, you know, a lot of people like, you know, you've given this guy a platform. Like, look, I'm communicating with someone and I like him as a person. He's a very nice guy. I don't agree with them at all about that, about the gays. Don't you believe it's worth giving people a platform? What does that mean? I'm not platform, but like I think that's a real problem that discussing things like that, like giving people a platform because we're living in this world of DDI platform with people.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       I think that's inherently dangerous. And I think that just stopping people from their ability to communicate just makes more pressure on their side. It makes more people that are on the fence support them because they see you as being a sensor. And that's what I think we found out with Jack. I'm from Twitter, Jack Dorsey, when he came on and talk to me about it and when he brought vid, John Who's the lawyer and you know like censoring, censoring, all sort of, it's not smart, it's not good. It does the opposite of what you intended to do. It makes the other side magnified. It makes whoever you're censoring more popular. It makes them an underdog and it also goes against core American values, like the freedom of speech. And I know that these are private institutions and I know that they are not necessarily forced to uphold what we determine as free speech in terms of like how it's written in the constitution, the bill of rights. I get, I understand that, but I think that the principles of human interaction on this planet are largely dictated by our ability to discuss things even if you disagree.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       I actually do agree with you that that the, I think like d platforming and silencing and he's at the danger. I don't, there are very few people that, well, there's no one that I agree with 100% of the time. Right. Including yourself. Yes. Including your joke about like you don't agree with yourself. Like I don't, I don't, it's real. Yeah. Well that's also, there's something Buddhist about it, which is like your thoughts are not correct. Right. They're not even your thoughts. They're just like pended upon your lotion.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       Yes. It depends on your stress levels. Yeah. You know, sometimes you just like, you're, you just don't have it in you and you're like stop. And other times the same situation, you'd be super calm and reasonable and maybe you could turn it around.

Speaker 1:          00:30:50       Yeah. If you've eaten. Yeah. Like there, I saw a thing yesterday. Doctors are worse in the afternoon. Oh, I'm sure judges are worst hurt search before surgeries in the morning. Uh, yeah. So to your point,

Speaker 2:          00:31:01       yeah. The right wing thing. It's just an easy way to dismiss me because I'm not right wing. If you asked me my positions on things, it's very left wing. Yeah. The only thing that I very, with the Orthodoxy is with the Second Amendment with gun rights. I don't think it's just that simple. I know a lot of really good people that have guns and I'll know, I know a lot of really good people that would never shoot anybody that have guns to protect themselves and to label everyone the same. It's just like labeling everyone who drives a car the same as those in cells that drove into people in Montreal or wherever that was. Who's that? Toronto or wherever that was. Yeah, it's, we have a real problem labeling people and labeling people with it's lazy and it's an attempt to marginalize or dismiss their positions

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       and it also feels good. Yeah. Should do it should it feels good to like guest what? Writing them off. I'm superior. I have a very clear moral view. I'm taking out one of my moral paint brushes, Chuang Tzu. You are that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       Even if it's not a moral position, even if like that Neal Brennan, he's such a left wing cook. He's a this and of that. And Boom, there you go. I've got them in a box. I'm going to put a ribbon on it. Yep. Ship them off. So you've read the comments when I'm on the chancel you're canceled. I heard. Yeah. So, uh, I brought up that makeup boy and, um, the makeup of my daughter's in love with, she watches this makeup on Youtube and now he's been canceled. I understand he lost 3 million and she's, she was telling me to have an 11 year old sit down and tell you about a gay makeup artists and this is the funny part. She goes, well there was a couple of things. Okay. So there was the thing with, he has, um, a friend who, and he tells me this woman's name who got him into the business and then she asked him to promote her hair stuff, but he said no and he went with another hairstyle. So he totally, totally betrayed her. All right. It's like my 11 year olds telling me this and then this was the best part. She goes, there was also some talk that he know he's gay and there was boys that were not gay and he tried to get them to be in a room with him. It's just like,

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       well, listening to an 11 year old. Tell me, by the way, that also could have been how, that's how, that's the tone of the Internet anyway. It's an 11 year old girl, so I'm actually heard at least it came from an 11 year old girl instead of like so and so's canceled. You can like the yet. No, you're a fucking 40 dope. Don't, why are you talking like a little girl? You're on a fuck. You're on buzzfeed or on Fox. Like is he in the point where the New York Times is going to be doing that? Like it took close to it now? I mean I think that Alabama, oh, owns abortion people. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       What it is is the media right now, especially journalism, they're fucking starving for hits. It's so hard to make money. It's so hard. And so they're drowning. Yeah. And so they're trying to grab whatever branches they can. Yeah, they got to make a good story with it. Click baity title. Fuck it. Deceptive title. Who gives a shit? We got a good store. That store is vetted and even if it's not totally vetted, if it's a little slippery, but that you can make an amendment later, you know, I'm sorry, we have a little bit an apology and we have to make a retraction. Yeah. Nobody reads those goddamn retractions. No, you should have to have a retract. If you, if you fuck up so hardcore that you attribute a crime to someone or you do something like that and you'd have to make it a retraction. It should be on the front page of your paper and nothing else for a month. Yeah, that's it. This is your newspaper now. Well, I'm sorry, we don't get to tell you the news anymore because we fucked this up so hard that we printed out to millions of people to just put in a little column in the corner. Yeah, we'd like to,

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       Paul, we fucked up last month also. Nine 11 happened close though. Planes wrote into the World Trade Center. It's fucking too hard to be a journalist, man. Well, that's what I, this is another thing I want to talk to you about, which is,

Speaker 2:          00:34:50       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       absolute meaning if you believe like, I still believe in like institutional journalists. I believe in New York Times, I believe in Washington, Washington Post, like so, and you use the fact that they wrote about a UFC fight. They just said he was bloody and early into Mcgregor fight where bloody and he wasn't

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       just a bad, very bad description. It was very inaccurate. I'm like, why would you do that? Like, do you guys are crazy that the New York Times is allowing this? Yeah. Completely inaccurate description of something that millions of people saw. It's so silly and it makes everybody question everything else you say. And you might think it's trivial because it's just a boxing match, but it's completely inaccurate and completely exaggerating what went down.

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       Well, if you've, you've had articles written about you, they fuck up everyone. Yeah. Everyone. Now having said that, we can't dismiss all in like there needs to be an absolute, uh, kind of an absolute truth. And that's what I feel like is a sort of melting in this era of anyone who was like, well, they said this and that's not true. So everything else they say is fucking bullshit of course. Which I think the, the Trump does a lot and I think people are all too happy to believe it because they resent institutions. They resent the smarty pants motherfuckers, which I also get, I get the impulse, I just don't think New York Times, right? Yes. A smartness the old gray lady. Yeah. Um, and it's like, it just plays on every stereotype. Like there are so many stereotypes of work that can make you write it off.

Speaker 4:          00:36:31       I think we're in a transitionary period. That's what I think. I think. What do you think he gets replaced by them. That's the real problem. The real problem is they have all their pieces, all the best journalists, right. All the best people are all locked into two ancient systems. One ancient system is print medium. The other ancient system is broadcast medium, the broadcast medium. The ancient product. Part of it is it has to go on at a certain time. Tuesdays at 8:00 PM and then you have to sit there and wait for the commercials unless you DVR it. Right? Right. So that's inherently flawed. And then the print medium, while they figured out a way to get it on your laptop and your phone now, so, okay, they've got a little bit of a work around there, but they have a really hard time getting people to sign up for digital subscriptions is that the distribution's not nearly as good as it used to be and it's hard.

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       It's hard to get people to buy newspapers, but at least they've, they've got their foot in the door with click. Then I titles like the times and the post are, are, are pretty successful online. They're actually doing much better because of president Trump because he talks so much shit about them that people x slate said, I need to supply the New York Times. What is, well they, yeah, I'll check it out because they're like, fuck man, this guy's child. At times it's still irresponsible. He's trying to match what I think might have with abortion where it's like, oh wait, whoa. I don't even want to get it. But if you, if this is where you motherfuckers were headed, cause they were being held back, it was like motherfucker, I'll fuck you up. And then they got free and now they're beating the shit out of abortion.

Speaker 4:          00:37:58       People are like, Whoa, accidental pregnancies or the real problem. It's not even, I mean obviously abortion is a solution, right? If you have to, if you want to do it. But if the accidental pregnancies, the real fucking problem like it should be, it's one of the things that I talked about with Jesse Insel who was on the other day, we were talking about genetic engineering. So like they're going to eventually one day move away from sex for procreation and sex is just going to be for fun, which going to be people bonding and enjoying each other's bodies. That's not going to be how we procreate. We're gonna, we're gonna procreate through some sort of, you like a girl naked calls. It'll certainly drastically reduce the amount of people that have kids, you know? But what he said is everyone do you freeze your eggs and like give sperm.

Speaker 4:          00:38:43       I don't know how they're going to do it. I don't know how they're going to do it. I mean, I think there's also the problem that the baby's supposedly bonds inside the mother's body. Like to have a baby grow up in some sort of a fucking weird electronic womb, and then you make that kid a fucking sociopath, has no connection to people when he's born. Doesn't give a fuck just to survive. I mean, there was that test tube baby thing, which I think started before me, but I remember that being an insult. They put the bid, the baby in the body, the, they put the embryos in the person's body and there is the thing of, uh, surrogates. Yeah. So they, who do they bond with? That's a weird one man. Like that's, that's the Kim Kardashian way now. And she's having a bunch of babies with surrogates.

Speaker 4:          00:39:22       Like, you know, you show up for the wedding or that you show up for the birth in a fucking tight skirt and like, Yay, my babies being born today. Like, what? What you're, you have your clothes on? What is happening here now? She's, yeah, I got a hired somebody, my friend, I got a girl, my friend actually did that and he's gay and he and his husband, um, they, they mix their sperm. They shot it in the Turkey based or something into some Gal. I don't know how I am. I don't make an excel file the science too tight. Anyway, she got pregnant, their surrogate got pregnant, had the baby and decided to keep it decided she couldn't part with it and it's their baby. So it's their DNA and mixed with hers. And she decided to keep it and uh, she got away with it, um, sewer or they just were like, oh, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:40:08       I didn't want to push. They were very upset and then they wound up getting another surrogate and then having a child and everything worked out is quite a while ago. But uh, they were really bummed out, man. I mean, they were ready to be parents, but then, you know, some people say, we will do renewal, we're going to be purged. The first blues crews were good, noon, even have sex with him, but it is their baby. Right. It's their DNA that made that based on if they didn't adopt a child, they chose to have surrogates. So heh. Yeah. No, it's complicated and getting well that's the thing of like, it feels like the level of danger and difficulty in the world is just getting steeper by the day. We're like, wait a wow. And then there's always global warming and you're like, oh fuck. Did you see a fucking the science guy, Bill Nye going crazy screaming and he was on the elevator or the planets on fucking fire and yeah, let's get a little silly.

Speaker 4:          00:40:58       Yeah, I know. Never like Bro. All right. Go to Antarctica. Plants on fire, Bro. Uh, no. I saw a thing that an artist that was like 84 degrees. Oh my God. It's on fire. I mean, yeah, it's really, do you really see something that's in the Antarctic? It was 84 nights. Yeah. Something in the Arctic circle is 84 degrees plus three days ago. Fuck that. What it's going to be a, it's gotta be, do you ever think about like global warming, but really what it will look like, like in 70 years, what it will do to the art. Like, and I'm not talking about just Miami's gone or any,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       that's like incredibly like crazy to think about. It's unfathomable. Those Miami people, they're gonna move other places and ruined. That's probably the biggest, that's my biggest worry. Definitely. He goes, can we be Lamborghinis dudes yelling at girls and Spanish eating outside. Everyone's fucking eating outside, but like, would you fucking get indoors? You maniac though. A lot of salsa. I love going salsa and like North Carolina like fuck Outta here. Salsa dancing. Fuck out of here with the fucking dead. Ain't bet. Then um, that's a good bit there. Like another country that's attached to Florida. Yeah, it's like Europe. It's, I always say it's like people do you see like Italian people like in Beverly Hills or Miami and the, I would say to my friends, those are people that were two douchey for Ada Lee. They're like, oh wait, we got to take it to the next to do she level Miami and then that go deep.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       Uh, yeah, that, but, but you think about like k, I like, not like 28 days later, but like, you know, like huge, like scary. Fucking scary. Especially because we're going to be near dead and no disrespect, you're not going to be in the same shape you're in now and you're not. You do, I mean, people may give you respect, but like, it's going to be so fucking scary. We're going to have to move to the mountains. Where would you move to? Shit. Hit the fan. Somebody. Sam, uh, who's, what's Calvin's friend? Sam ciders. Mind Sam seater? No, Sam. Uh, the fighter's mind, he wrote him and how can I not remember his name? Yeah. Um, hold on one second. I'll tell you real quick. This is going to be worth it guys. Listeners, this is Tim. Listen, Sam Sheridan. That's right. Yeah, I'm sure. Um, thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       Told me 10 years ago that stuck with me. Go to the marina cause I live in Venice. He, he's like go to the marina and basically just get basically you gotta pay to get on a boat or just be like, I will be the hard part is how do I qualify too. Like I can help you cause I get seasick. Here's what I have going for me. Seasick queasy because you just get away. You get away from, from La. Anyone you get away from, uh, in Las case, millions and millions of people and you can, if there's a attacker, you can see them. You assume that they're not going to be like, you know, seal teams coming onto your boat. Attackers. Well, I know, but that's what I mean. Like how crazy could get, yeah, you got to go to Alaska. The how do you get there? It's good call. I'll do, can you dry reports? Closed airport. I mean I or lights connected, right? You could drive. You could technically drive. Yeah. It cut off that road all the time. And like the Napa Valley, cause the landslide will Sharon. We're gonna fuck you going to go. Yeah. Good luck. It's like Burger's got the helicopter but he, it's, he's got to go to get it. Yeah. That's his escape. A great bit about that as black and white special. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       I would move north. I'd probably move somewhere. That was a, if I could get just go to a place, if I knew I just had to get to a place, I would go to a place that is sustainable. Like uh, whether it's Alaska or Minnesota or Michigan somewhere. There's a lot of animals and there's wildlife and you have, you have cold, you have water, you have a lot. Like cold is better than heat because cold you can make a fire. Like if you have shelter and you can make a fire in the cold, you can live. I have a cat

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       argument, which is I don't, I the cold kills more people than he does hypothermia. Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       but that's just because you know, people are unprepared for it. You can prepare for cold with clothing. You can't really prepare for heat with clothing, with heat, you need air conditioning and you need water. Those are two things that are shade. Yeah. You need something. If you live in like there's people that have lived in very cold climates, as long as they have a good house and they have a good supply of wood, they're fine. If you live in the desert, man, you're kind of fucked. You're kind of fucked. If the power goes out, you don't really have anything to keep you cool. You have to stay in the shade and stay in doors, but it's not good enough and it's 110 degrees inside. It's 125 hydrated though. I don't think you will just die from x from heat exposure. No you won't, but you're not going to find a lot of water. One of the problems with global warming's going to be that things like lakes, lakes and streams are going to, there's going to be less. This gonna be less water is going to be less dribbling down to the creeks. Creeks, we're going to dry up. Streams will dry up. You're gonna have a hard time getting water if you're in a desert environment.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       If you have by by the same token, if you have enough water, you have as much water as you have wood. Obviously the, it's not a one to one analogy because you can go get more would easily, but if you had a shit load of water right. If you just had like I hear your thought about getting cold but I don't know if I had shade. I guess you don't. I guess with cold you don't have to have electricity,

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       you don't have to have electricity with cold and also you have more of an opportunity to find animals. You'll find more animals in cold climates and you're going to for delicious animals for sure. Yeah, more things to eat, but you might, you could still easily starve to death. Like the idea that it's easy to go out there and shoot a bunch of animals and eat them all the time, like not most places. Most places you don't have an abundant enough supply of wildlife. You're also a guy who does archery. Yeah, I know how to do you have skills for this and I would still be panicked. I'd be like, fuck, this is not good. If I had to feed my family with a bow and Arrow, first of all, I'd say, okay, how many hours do I have? I would have to make sure that I have enough arrows.

Speaker 2:          00:47:25       I mean, you have to practice to is not like a rifle. If I have a hundred rounds, I can kill a hundred things. I don't really need to practice that much of my rifles on off. I can have good triggered discipline. I'll pull through the shot, I'll, I'll try not to flinch and I'm not going to take any unreasonable. I have no fucking idea what you're telling me. Shooting. You don't want to anticipate. I anticipate you don't want to flinch when the trigger goes up. So a lot of guys like Tim Kennedy, who's a friend of mine who's a one of the baddest motherfuckers in the world, he'll practice with dummy rounds. So he has regular bullets and then four bullets are just not real bullets. So it's like bang, Bang, Bang, click, and then the has to get rid of that, that bullet. But he leaves.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       He knows if he was flinching because if you're flinching, you'll see this movement where there's no, no gun goes off. The boat doesn't go off, but you make that weird mood because you're anticipating in the shot. That's the way to train yourself out of it. Yeah. You have to do something like that. You have to have what's called trigger discipline. Well, first of all, trigger discipline means don't put your finger on the trigger, but also the way you squeeze. You got to just squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze and let the shot go off by surprise and not react to it. It's the same thing with a bow and arrow. You have to have a surprise shot. You want, you wanted to just do want to concentrate on the target, zone it in and which feels like you kind of can't even be there. Meaning like you just have to be like, I'm doing a thing.

Speaker 2:          00:48:52       You know, like you can't think about the release. You have to just think about the target that's very astute of you. There's actually courses is a guy named Joel Turner who has this whole course called a shot Iq. He's a, he teaches um, um, first responders like swat teams and shit without trigger discipline and about how to, how to shoot properly under pressure. And uh, he works with people with archery for this sit with the same thing cause it's a psychological thing to, but my point is with a bow and Arrow, you're kind of fucked you, you need a lot of Goddamn arrows and you need to make sure that bone is going to stay okay with all the animal to like, like a deer, deer, deer or bear would be like the most edible thing. Yeah. You want to bear if you have a bear, you could eat that motherfucker for a long time and you can take that fat and you could render the fat down, use it for cooking and use it for, you know, you could do, do a lot of things with it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       And that meat is a lot of meat. Anything big, you want a big animal because you want to be able to dry it out, make jerky. You want to have something that's going to sustain you for a few days or weeks until you find another animal. You're gonna want to dig a hole in the ground to make some sort of cold storage. You want to get below like the frost line. Yeah, you got, you got to protect it from other bears. Yeah, you got it. You're going to have to do a lot of things and you're probably not gonna make enough food. It sounds hard. It's the hardest the eye. Every time I go on a hunting trip, I always think like, imagine if this is the only way I could get food. It's so God damn hard to get close to an animal. It's so hard. Yeah. People see videos of it like on youtube and there's the deer and you draw your bow back and you hit it in the heart and the deer's down. Everybody

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       said, well, you don't see as days and days of writing all day long. Just go. If you could watch from a live stream of the moment of hunt, start to the moment you're successful and you just sat through the whole thing. Look as a fucking games of Thrones marathon, then you would understand it, but even then you wouldn't really, cause you wouldn't be out there in the cold, exhausted, hiking uphill going thousands of feet up and down and elevation and then the wind shifts and the deer smells you and it starts off, you're like, fuck, it's hard man. It's like tedious. And to survive off of that, see I'm doing it for my own food, but if I don't get a deer, I'm going to live. I'll go to a restaurant. If you're only option is deer that you catch and kill and find your shot or sick. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       And he got to fucking catch a deer. That's um, that's when you wonder, you know, you wonder how am I gonna, what am I going to watch them starve to death? That must've been really exciting for native Americans or just any ancient people of just like getting like kit. Like, you know, I think we could kill above. Hello? Yeah, we all like, we all have to be fat. Like we all have to team up and that's why humans have survived. But like it must've been so fucking like at celebration, like in he walks celebration, you know it's crazy to this day there are these areas where they find a lot of arrowheads because they would drive these buffalo off cliffs. How fucking nuts is that? Like they know the spots where they would drive them off cliffs and fall down and sometimes the bodies with decay cause I didn't eat all of it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:05       They a hundred buffalo fly off a cliff is only a thousand native Americans in this spot with the fuck are they gonna do. They're gonna eat as much as we can. But the rotten ones literally exploded and caused a forest fire in one area. They think a forest fire was caused by a rotting pile of buffalo that eventually exploded like a whale explosion. I like that kind of deal. Google that makes sure that's not horse shit cause it sounds like a lie coming out of my mouth. They believe that a rotting pile of bison was responsible for starting a fire here because that's how the, cause they found like all this chard like stuff and they're like, they were trying to piece it together. If I remember the story of properly. And I think they were like, this might have happened because the body's rotted so much. They exploded and it started fuck. Cause it's like you have the gasses Muldez rotting tissue. Like, you know, whales explode on the beach. I splatter on people. Yeah. Fantastic. So they're trying to take this to a next level, like how much heat would be generated by all this bacteria? Like what kind of explosion could this make? Yeah. And also why would the explosion, is it a spark caused, I would assume it's gooey methane gases and rotten gases. Yeah. Like they would have to be some, something to ignite, you know, those little

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       um, uh, arrowheads. They find you're supposed to leave them in a lot of places. If you find you're supposed to leave him there just for like, luck or something for you, go fuck yourself. I ain't leaving shit arrowhead. Like, Oh, you have to lead it. Words. Guns fucking going up there. Yeah. Where is it going? Like where's if I leave it, someone else can pick it up on you think the good man have a good person to pick it up. You have to leave it here. No, no, no, you can't have it. Is that like the parks commissioners are native and I know when I was hunting in Nevada they said that if you found an arrowhead yet to leave it there. I was like, Huh, okay. Oh, you know what? I haven't talked to you about what the doing these big venues. Oh Arenas.

Speaker 3:          00:54:04       Yeah. That's weird. How do you like it? It's fun, man. San Diego was a lot of fun. It's um, it's strange though. It's a lot of God damn people. Does it feel like disconnected now? Not didn't surprisingly. San Diego is interesting. Like the people that were in the front, they were right there, man. It was [inaudible] 7,000 now San Diego was 12 something, almost thirteen thousand thirteen thousand unbelief. It's a lot of people. And they was in the round. Yeah, that was weird too. And did you have a plan? Nope. But yeah. No cause like she can't really think about, you can't worry about the people that are behind you. You can't, you got, well they have giant screens everywhere so everybody got to see you. Um, I, I definitely was aware of the magnitude of the show and I did a lot of sets that we, I do like eight, nine sets that week before I did it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       Like the funny thing was I didn't understand, I was like, how is he not selling this out? And then I saw victor, then I was like, oh, it's a fucking arena. I was like, I thought Joe was as popular as ever been. And then I'm like, why is this guy posted so much? And then I'm like, oh, cause it's hard to get that last last thousand. I know. And you're still, you can't, the, I dunno if it's the human mind are like the competitive comedy mind, but like can't leave it alone. You want that fucking thousand. Like you want to hear sold out. Yeah. Like doesn't like, yeah, but you don't want to go sell Joe Rogan 12,000 people. You have a woods. It holds like 12, nine. Yeah. Aw, what a pussy. Can't even get 900 more people like you bro. And you would kind not, you would think it's a failure, but you would always be like, yeah, Josh Wolfe showed me a picture once of him on stage open enough for Larry the cable guide in front of 50,000. Jesus, he did a football stadium. Jesus get her done. Well that's what Kevin Hart does. Those big, I mean he did his uh, one of his Netflix buses, like 49,000 people. Some fucking insane. If, I mean that, I wouldn't want to see that shit. I wouldn't want to go to that weird third balcony. Like what do you even, I mean, I don't know. People like communal experiences like that. Yes. I think that's a good way to put it. But like when venues 50,000,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       you're just far away. Yeah. But I guess if you like the jeans and everyone's in there together, it's, you've created a culture. So people go to be a part of the culture. Kevin's created the culture. Larry, the cable guy, created a culture. So people go, it's like to be around their brothers and sisters. Kind of kind of, I mean straight up though, like not like it's even intentional. That's the thing I like about podcasting as a successful medium and your podcasts in particular is like the shit you're, you're into comedy, you're into fucking weed, you're into you, fos and the unexplained, you're into government conspiracies, you're into a gender issues. You're, you're legitimately into all this stuff and you created a tent where everybody feels like welcome, like, hey, it's going to talk about the thing that I'm like, you're interested in a lot of shit. Generally. You're not going, I'm only interested in comedy or, or more niche about it. You just like this, you're into, you're intently inventions and fire and guns and hunting. You're just into a bunch of shit legitimately and you express it and people love it. Well that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       Was gene actually being into shit and talking about things you're into versus talking about the things you think will be popular,

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       right? Yeah. You kind of, you can't, you can't do that for, I guess you see, I can't think of anyone could, but you'd get off the top of your, off the top of my head who that would be. But it'd be obvious that you

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       weren't really tuned in. He wouldn't be really interested in it. You're not, you, you wouldn't be as enthusiastic.

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       Yeah. And you are genuinely, you only have on people that you genuinely like or genuinely interested in and doesn't matter if they're famous, not famous, like whatever controversial, not controversial. Like it's just shit that you're into your expressing. It's the, the another reason why I like pockets, it's like watching someone exist. Yeah. It's like an expression of your subconscious or your, your brain. Like it's like the typical day in your brain. I'm just like, I like this. And then I go over here and then I go, Duh. And you and you've been able to like do it in a way, which is why it's so popular is like it is popular but it's not even the right word. It's like resonant with people.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Yeah. I think for a long time people have been doing shows where the show was produced and there's a bunch of people behind the scenes and whatever that person is, it's, it's almost more difficult for them to get their personality to shine through all that shit. But if it's just stuff that you're really interested in, yeah. Then people get up

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       and it's also be like, and then it's a girl takes off and Burt takes off. And uh, who, who am I forgetting the Joey takes off. I didn't know how long you've been friends with Joey, Joey guys, friends

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       for 23. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Theo like guys that you just genuinely like, like that they're just kind of like, even the, the, the like the sober October thing or like it's, you know, the numbers are massive. Yeah. It's cause it's just, it's like a show. It's like a, I know it's everybody's a character and it's like an old radio play. Like here comes fucking Bert Kreischer. He think he acts out something called the Mickey Mantle. Jay, what the hell is it Mickey mantle thinking about like, everybody's got like, it's set up and it's, it's not like it's sloppy in a fun way. Yeah. And uh, and it's cool and you get to reap all the reward, all the guys that are responsible for the cause. The other thing is so many times, this is the first time, like in, in certainly in media history where guys are in charge of their own everything.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       Yeah. Like you own the labor. I mean, there's not even a layer. That's just my thing there. Artists tried, like the Beatles had a record label and they would bring people on and then they would, they, it always got fucked up every single time. And this I feel like is the first time where it's like, Sigur has got like, you know, his umbrella now he's got like his, he's got his spinoffs and uh, it's fucking excellent. It's just excellent. It's so great. I was talking to a guy who used to be in charge of at Viacom and we were talking about, you know, when they, when people do shows now, like, you know, they'll pay, uh, Kenny Barron, so they'll pay, Sean arrived and the pay Dave Allen, Chris, all these guys, like 20 million, the writers get a hundred buddy of mine, Mike Schur created good place and, um, parks and rec and he's getting 25 mil a year for the next five years.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Yeah. And it shows aren't hits his heart. His shows are picked up and successful, but they're not like cheers. Right. Wow. Um, and I said to Doug Herzog, the guy from flag, I go, how much were you fucking guys making before? What were these, what were these companies making 20 years ago? Like what was ABC making 20 years ago that they, and they even Seinfeld said that he, he's like, I was the first one to get a hundred, uh, million an episode. And I go, which is a pittance compared to what they could have paid you. And he's like, I know that now, but back then $1 million in and Ah, what are you even going to deal with it? And now it's like what are they gonna do with it? What the fuck they were making? They were making 100 million in episode, but because it's a logo and a corporation go, well that's what a corporate, it's supposed to make $100 million and a half is up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       Meanwhile, if a guy makes a million, you're like, what are you going to, it's like this unfathomable thing. It's like where they get mad at basketball players and not the owners of the teams. Yeah. And it's also that distribution model of like putting something on a network is, there's so much fat, there's so many people, the silly things that you have to pay so much, so many different places. The money goes, it's almost like you have to make $100 million an episode for everybody to make out. Yeah. But also, no, they don't live, but also they're still taken 90 yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Even with all the revenues with all like the, the, the, uh, all the miles, I got a fade. It's still like a huge profit. But as a writer, do you think that like investing your time and effort into a Sitcom today?

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       It's like, well, good luck with that. I don't, dude. I like, I just started, I, we used to do the podcast may emotionally, this podcast called the champion was great. And uh, and now I just started one like a month ago called how Neil failed. Look for it and you look up things, um, how Neil you'll feel and that's the name of the pocket, got a theme song. Everything's very sick. Um, but it was, I was like, why am I trying, I did it a pilot like a year ago for a network and they gave me notes and I was like, oh, I forgot about notes. Oh, I forgot that they were going to give me notes. Like, Ugh, like I don't just let me, that was the always the thing that me and Dave got to with comedy central and they finally left the salon after like six episodes where I was like, let us show it to the audience and let them decide.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       We don't want a bomb. We want to bomb less than you guys do. Trust me. Trust me. You've never met two people who want to bomb less than me and him. And so they'd be like, well, we don't end up like, let's show to the crowd. If they like it, then great. And if they don't, then we sh they that we did this real world sketch and they didn't. They were like, we just think it's a bunch of unfunny scenes back to back. And we're like, let's just show it to the crown. And then we showed it killed and they were like, all right, we don't know what we were talking about. They literally said, we don't know what we're talking about. So do whatever you want. Unfunny what a fucking God. Oh, those people. But that's the, I get that. They feel like they have to do something.

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       Yeah. But we're with comedians are willing to like all our skin's in the game. It's all, it's all of our, it's our hide every time. So why do you feel the need to like correct us or I don't mind if, uh, if like an executive is like the first audience, do you know what I mean? Or like, Hey, your shirts fucked it, whatever. Like, like in minor stuff. But it's like material wise, most of you are not good at defining what's special about somebody or what's an innovative segment or you know what I mean? Like they don't even think about that. They just, they're ambitious people who are just like working their way up a thing and they're like, is it my turn yet? I get to fucking, I get to put my stamp on it now. Yeah. Yeah. I want to add something even if it's irrelevant, like be, I had a joke when we were doing half baked and then going two for two day, but uh, we're doing half baked and I said to David, God, we should do a thing at the end where, um,

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       we should just say, hey, let us do whatever we want. And in the end we'll pass a hat around and you guys can take credit for something because ultimately that's what you want. You want to be able to take credit for something, right? Well don't fucking make us do it. I know you just want credit. That's all you want. You just want to feel good about yourself. You want to feel like I contributed to this thing, but let us just let us do the thing. You know what I mean? And if you're like you who've just been, how long you been doing the podcast? Almost 10 years. It'll be 10 years in December, you're going to do a big network show about him kind of networked anniversary, Special Ham radio.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       That's hilarious. I've been thinking about taking over an am radio station for the day. That's so fun. That'd be really fun. So let me, um, the, uh, wonder if they'd let me, but even like in when we used to do it in your house, you know what I mean? Like, and it's like, that was a long time ago. You were on you on an episode at least seven years ago. Yeah. Oh yeah. I did too. In your house. That was back in the kids, be in the background yelling at each other and shit here in the hall. And they were a little crazy. Um, one 14. Wow. Episode one 14. How many? That's two years. Year and a half. And yeah, probably. What does episode now? What is 1297 [inaudible] 98. That was 98. Now this is number one, two, nine, eight. No, [inaudible] 98 when the podcast and started hundred episodes 1100 episodes ago.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Yeah. And it's from, look at me. I'd a Fohawk lucky you. Beautiful bastards. Fog 80% nos. That was before I realized they should put a beard on where a little bit more, a little scruff. Um, podcasts are a very, very strange thing, man. It's, it's just this, no one saw this coming and everyone can start one, but I don't even think you saw it coming. Do you know what I mean? Like, I don't call him, I didn't see this. Yeah. Like presidential candidates from my fucking show. Telsey Gabbert on yesterdays. Yeah. Running for president. I didn't watch it, but yeah, I wanted to talk about real issues that affect the world. I'm like, Oh yeah. Uh, yeah. And I'm sure do you feel, I mean, you Kinda can't change your ethos. You can't be like, I'm a role model and I need to know, no, it's not.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       No, no, no. I'm just going to be me. You know, and the world's going to be weirder, but it's just me. But it's also the thing of like, when you're in these like development TV movie worlds and you're like, just let me talk. Just fucking lie. Like I promise it'll be interesting. Like it won't all be interesting, but it'll be interesting enough. It'll be interesting enough. Often enough. Yeah, that just let me talk. Why couldn't imagine given up that reigns to someone now, like if a, all of a sudden we brought in some sort of a producer or a network, just like, look, we're going to take this podcast to the next level, but you got to listen to me Joe Show where I'm not sure that you did with Ilan Moscow. One of the great reasons that that show was very successful as the way you were dressed.

Speaker 3:          01:08:20       Yeah, I know you don't like to hear this and we tested it had nothing to do with him being weird and smoking weed and having a fucking, having a claim for our shirt. You wore a nice shirt is, I mean is there even like there's, you could never decide. You can never test like whether podcasts going to be successful, you can now just, it's all, it's all a word of mouth. It's just weird fucking, they like it. They like it. Like a conversation like this. Yes. We're actual real friends. So when we talk it's very evident. We have chemistry, what's known as a chemistry. Yes. I can try that. That's right. Normal. Yeah. Yeah. Like right here and joining your time here on this earth. Well that's the thing. Doing so doing this and I told, I remember telling somebody like, it's like doing the tonight show in [inaudible] 78 interviewed in terms of like, I was in Singapore and a guy came to the show who saw me on that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       Like every it's, you can't, it's not even worth knowing if you're, you. It's like fucking don't worry about it. Just show up and talk. But uh, I can't pay attention to that. Yeah. By paralyzing. Yeah. But the, uh, so I'm like, the funny thing is when you do TV, when you do something that's going to be seen or heard by this many people, like a TV show. If I do Seth or the daily show, like I prep this, I'm like, fucking, yeah. I don't know. We talk about like so many times, I'll run into you at the store and we basically have like a 10 minute podcast in the hallway. Yeah. You know, we just start talking. You'll say you seen this? Yeah. You pulled me aside. Like if you ever heard about ketamine, I'm like, what? And then all of a sudden you're telling me you're taking ketamine session.

Speaker 3:          01:10:03       And that's the thing. If there's no, you can't prep. And it would be odd you couldn't explain it to people 10 years ago. Like it'll just be people sitting and talking. Now the, the, the comedians are by nature pretty entertaining. At least talkative. Yeah. At least pretty talkative. And at, at, at, uh, and on the high end, entertaining and funny, he had the worst advice. He's like, you go to [inaudible] doing it for an hour, just do it one hour and edit it. Yeah. I'm like, all right. Now, you know, uh, when people turn it off or anything, nope. Um, I know that the average time that someone watches on Youtube, we know that, which is like what, 35 minutes or so. 35 minutes on Youtube, which is a lot. Yeah, that's it because the average is like 15 seconds. But yeah, the APP. What's a normal average on you? Two, three or four minutes. Yeah. Flick for everyone that watches for 10 seconds. There's someone that watched it for an hour and a half or three hours. So the average would be like three or four minutes for a normal channel. Yeah. Yeah. Well you know the difference between something on Youtube and something

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       that's a podcast that you're listening to though I think the, the people that are listening are, I don't want to say this, I'm not, I don't know if it's really true, but they might be more invested in like, cause they're subscribing to it and they're listening to it in their car on the way to work. They're listening to. A lot of times when they're at the gym, people on Youtube can flip the and decided to go to the next and what's this and that, and then they get, you don't get taken down a rabbit hole with podcasts, with audio podcasts. You just listen, you listen to one of your other. Whereas Youtube, like you could stumble upon this accidentally. Right now. Someone might be stumbling upon this very video right now on youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       Welcome. Welcome, welcome friend. The same for you, bitch. Ah, the other thing you forget is how much people fucking drive. Yeah. We're the like, I'm in my car for hours a day. You're like, what? Why? And they're like, and, and you are their friend. Yeah. That's weird. Do you know what I mean? Like you're there, whether you, it's like you don't know them, but you, they really like you and they feel like they have a connection with you.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       Yeah. And all the other people that like you and Theo and Dileo, whoever's here, you know, people that come in. Yeah. Then those people become characters in their little world play as well.

Speaker 1:          01:12:27       Yeah. Like, you'll see it in the comments, but like, this fucking skinny fuck is like literally like this. Talk me back. They read the [inaudible] was the last time I did it. The comments were so bad and I didn't even you or you texted me. I was like, boy, they must be very bad because you were like, we ma, we did something right or something. I was like, well, they must be awful. And then, uh, uh, I didn't cause I know what they're going to say. It's like, what do you think? I'm dumb. I'm not a dumb. You got to say whatever you think of me. I'm not dumb. Right. So I disagree with you politically. All right. I don't, you know, like I don't, I don't eat right.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       That's one of the reasons why I bring people on that I don't agree with. I think it's important to have conversations with people, whether on the left or the right, that you don't agree with. Just to find out who they are and what they think. Yeah. And just to have discussions,

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       testing your own feelings about a hundred percent just like, okay, no, that's, that's all right. I still feel having heard arguably their best argument or a very cogent arguments for their side and you go, Yep, I think that, I think the thing that is lost in our, in one of the things that's lost in the world now is, um, because of I partially because of the internet or blogs or whatever, where you have to be 100% in every belief and it's like I'm not 100% in any belief. No. Like I'm like, I, there are some beliefs where I say I'm 50, I'm 51% and but that still wins. 51% is still the thing I tell you where if people can't believe you either gotta be 100% or zero, you're a cock whore, you're a fucking stud. Like, uh, and there's no like, yeah, well abortions of perfect example where we're both like, I'm for it, but, but it's pretty brutal or it's pretty, it's a severe thing or whatever. The Butt and you're not allowed to have a button anymore. You can't, you just can't go. I haven't measured point of view and it's, I took the vote in my head and it's 70, 30 and you're not,

Speaker 2:          01:14:34       and it can change your mind somehow or another. That's bad. That's my whole, someone said, well, not just one person. Many people said you flip flop on things like, no, I consider things and it changed my life.

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       So not when politicians do it, it's because they, it's politically in that going to work in their favor. Yeah. You do it because you've thought more about it or you heard the right argument at the right time and just got okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       Yeah, I changed my opinions all the time. I don't, I don't, I'm not married to those fucking things. I don't need them. You know, my opinions are just the ideas in my mind or something that should be explored and there's certain ideas that I just hold steadfast. Don't rape, don't murder people. Don't steal all the obvious ones. Right? Everybody holds those. Yeah. But then when it gets to a unusual, weird, slippery things, I'm like, okay, well what is why? Why is there an inclination to lean towards a certain direction? Like what do we virtue signaling are we, you know, we are sending out the flag of tribal obedience and what are we doing when we're discussing these things? And a lot of that is what ruins discourse. And this is what I think. I have a real big problem with deep platforming. We started d platforming people in censoring people. You don't just want to not hear them, you want no one to hear them. And this is where I have a problem. It's because who the fuck are you? Like why are you the one who gets to say even if they're wrong, even if they're won't let everybody figure it out. It's missing

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       formation. That's the thing. It's like pizza gate or one of the, like Alex shall be saying like, dude, what the fuck are you doing

Speaker 2:          01:16:09       to gain is a good example, right? Because people get ramped up in it. They're like, what? And there was a guy, Ben Swan, who is a, uh, a journalist who had all these, he was, he had this video that he put out that showed like all the different connections with conspiracy theory or with pizza gate and, uh, various conspiracies and pedophilia. And it was, it was a real weird one. And everybody was like, what? Well, it's just because these things are similar. It doesn't mean there's a pedophile ring going on. They're like, what is that exactly is happening there? But then you hear about someone like Jimmy Saville and you go, wait a minute, wait a minute with this guy was fucking kids for how long? Yeah. And no one, like, how are there any other ones right now that they have it exposed? You know what I mean? Like that kind of, that kind of shit does, I don't having, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:16:59       I think there's a big, there's a ton of distance between, uh, there are pedophiles and there are pedophiles in the pizza in the

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       basement. Yeah. Like there, I believe there's pedophiles. Right. And that they should be stopped and they're mostly, yeah. And I, my bed is, I don't think none of them are powerful in that, but I don't think that there is a, uh, I just don't really buy into conspiracies. Just generally buy in some, cause there's some of them that approvable, there's some of them that really did happen where you go, Jesus Christ, they really did that. There's no, yeah, I mean like, like, like in, in like third world countries where will fuck with elections, like salmon, the shit like that. Like that is, yeah. Like that's not even a conspiracy. That's just like a poorly told part of history. That's our goal Shit Tonkin and said, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's, I think that's, well, I think that's, uh, out, you know what I mean? Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       Um, do you know about the operation Northwoods? Do you know about that one? I don't know. That one's probably the most disturbing one because that one was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were going to organize a bunch of attacks on America and blame the Cuban so that we could go to war with Cuba. They were going to arm KeyVault families and have them attack one Tanam obey. They were going to blow up a jetliner and blame it on Cuba. They had all these plans and it was signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff and then vetoed by Kennedy. He was like, what the fuck are you? What are you guys doing? You guys? I went to fucking Hyannis port and I come back and try to blow up airplanes and the thing is it's, this is something that didn't fly, but we found out about it. How many of these things we didn't find out about that actually did happen and that we think are legitimate instances in the news or real attacks and I just turned out to be false drop in the bucket.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       It's a drop in the bucket. I think it's less than 1% in comparison to actual events, actual reality per se. And so when, when people are the reason I don't like conspiracy theories, I think it people use it to explain their own failure a lot of the time. Like we say it a lot in comedy, like, well, you can't make it unless you're a, oh goodness, be warm. And you're like, all right man, that's not just, I hate that fucking, that perspective is so crazy. It's like, listen, if you're killing people are going to see you. If you kill a lot, people go to see you a lot. It's that simple. You can't fake it is a meritocracy. It really is. And it's v like there are, there are certainly like some quota of stuff in the margins, but not, no one's making it. Uh, no one's doing arenas because of, uh, the quote you can't pull.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       There's nothing you can do to get into arenas yet people have to actually like you. Um, and this, this excuse making that people do do as a straight white man. I can't get a break in his town alert. Oh my God. When you're a straight white man and you're complaining like you got one of the most fucking captivating hands of cards in world history, world history in 2019 straight has still a great hand. You might get beat with a crazy, uh, you know Nan that. Yeah. And then that hand out at the hamstrings, man, that'll get you on the river. I know she got number one. It wasn't even funny. Yeah, the fuck. Ah, man. What's anti-car alright. Uh, my take on it and then that thing and I haven't even seen it. It's like, do people like it? Yeah. Good. I saw live. Did you like it?

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       Yeah, I liked it a lot. Nice. It's like I saw in New York, I saw before it was on Netflix. Like I saw it and met her and was like, thought I was really nice. It was an awkward conversation. I'll say that. Well, she is a little spectrum me, right? Isn't that, I think that's a fair, pretty open about estimation. Yeah. Like it was, it was, it wasn't like easy. Do you find that you, when you speak to certain women, particular, you feel like almost like you're guilty of something like you, like you're a male, like you're an oppressor. Do you ever, you ever not too many women and it could just be a project. It could be my own. It could be. I'm like auto projecting where I'm like, I definitely do that. There aren't too many, but I think you have to work against stereotypes.

Speaker 3:          01:21:18       You're working against tattoos, built bald, right wing podcasts. Well cage fighting commentator. I forgot about that. Cheeses, Joe. Yeah. So like you have a lot. I'm pretty, you know, a feet. The way I look is a problem. It's like I and I, if you, what are the odds? You're not sexist or a dickhead. Yeah. Not that good. Like what are the odds like, so, uh, you try, I mean I don't, I don't feel it too much, but I can imagine how much, what percentage of women do you feel like you have to do that? With the ones who don't know me, once they know me, like I'm pretty, pretty nice. Like go to a venue, you go to the venue that you've never been to. There's a woman, the backstage, one of the works for live nation or she works the venue like does she assume that you're not if they worked for our nation, I'm nice to all those folks.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       But I think that if someone has, uh, like a very staunch feminist perspective and they meet someone like me, they might, depending upon their perspective, they might think that I'm the enemy. That that's a, that's a possibility. That like right away they looked at me like the enemy. Yeah. Well that's the thing of like, what are you absolute like even, and you, you can tell sometimes when you're arguing with, with people that are super dogmatic about whatever they believe in, let they can, you can watch them go into a line of logic that they know that they then realize, I can't cause that will like a seed, some ground to this person. They go, Duh. And it's like I saw you start to go down that like a, just a reason. And I'm not saying d, uh, stop believing what you believe. And it's just like, it's, you doesn't have to be 100% exactly. Just, it's fine. You can still, you're still win the popular vote. It's majority rules. It doesn't have to be overwhelming. Just, just don't, it's dishonest in a way because they don't want to believe. They don't want to have, uh, they don't wanna have a chink in their armor in terms of logic.

Speaker 2:          01:23:24       Yeah. To want to lump people into categories because it's easy to define them to, you know, uh, we were goofing yesterday, me and Joe List were goofing around about a Alyssa Milano sex strike and she choose for those enough. And I was like, one of the things that's offensive about that is first of all, that, um, that women would agree with you that they would just withhold sex from the person that they'd allow us. Some Alana said, guys, I'm Alyssa Milano said you should withhold sex because in fucking Georgia they're limiting abortion laws. But the second thing is, I like that you would assume that all men are responsible for this, not even just the voters in Georgia, but all men. Somehow I got a man in Minneapolis should be denied sex from his progressive

Speaker 3:          01:24:07       for that. He's going to call like his friend in Alabama. Like, man, this is some, cause I'm not getting no pussy up here bro. This fucking sex strike is for real, Bro. This is hitting us. So it's so good,

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       delusional and such a dumb flag of virtue that they're throwing up and it's such, it's such stupid 2019 woke politics. That was okay

Speaker 3:          01:24:27       by the way. It's like based on lots of Strada like uh, uh, old Greek play wasn't really. Yeah, no shit. Those are sec striking it. Yeah. And that's what that movie Shairaq was about. It was, it was a sex strike. No, in Chicago. Yeah. Did that work? It's an I don't think it's ever, I don't know. Will you Google and see if it's ever been done? Um, imagine the girls are just use it as excuse to not fuck a guy. They won't, don't want to fuck. It's also like, come on. So most of them aren't fucking anyway. It's like, yeah, like what are you going to take? Rock had that joke about like, what are you going to, you can't stop. You're already not fucking me to die. When you hear, we hear women talk about not wanting to fuck their husbands. It's like, it's such a depressing, like I was listening to this Gal, she was like, well, you know, most wives don't want to have sex with their husbands.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       Like what you listen to that you're like, Ugh, as a husband at bumps you out. Or as a, as a human being, humans and the learn a situation without the thing that people liked the most about relationships. But besides the fact that he loves someone to care, someone is having sex with somebody who wants to have sex with you. It's great fun. It's a fun time. It's very rewarding. It's feels real nice. Phil's Chris specially take a little hit. See if we really feel it. Yeah, it feels great. So when you hear that someone doesn't want that and then you know, and their attitudes that most women don't want that. Most women don't have sex with their husband. They just do it cause they have to. Well that's also, it's very hard to get a clear story about women and sexuality in that. Like it's, I don't, I think it's varies from wildly.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Oh, for sure. Like he hasn't been girls you've dated. Yeah. Even the other day I put a thing on, on, uh, Instagram where I said, how if you start following a guy, how long do you think he should wait to Dmu? Because as a guy, I'll have girls follow me and because I just do jokes on there. I'm like, this is Carolina. I don't want to be like, so you came for the comedy also?

Speaker 4:          01:26:28       I don't know. Yeah. That's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:26:31       I don't want to fall. I don't want to bomb her out if she just came to, she thinks I'm funny, but like, yes, but what about fucking me? Can I interest you in that peanuts? Yes. Um, so, and of course the answers were all over the place. Yeah. Like four days. Five days, 10 minutes. And then I said, but if he's cute, it doesn't matter. And they wrote, nope.

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       Ah, yeah. But if it's aqua man, just let them slide. I like that you're referencing aqua man is like the paradigm of hotness though. Cause he really is. He's as good as it gets. He's, well this is when my wife said she goes, he's everybody's type. Yeah. He's a including fish. Yeah. He's a big giant, handsome, beautiful man who seems to be extraordinarily kind. Yeah. Like he's got like Benny dates and older. Well, a woman that's older than him, like he's got he exercises. What does it say? Furthermore, sex strikes, I started sleeping less and didn't read it as pointed by Chicago. Whist in Kenya, the Philippines. Liberia. Thanks. Nobel Prize winner Lima. Wha How split? Say That g B o w Wilby keep, Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. We, and in Colombia where women held a 10 day sex strike in 2006 to end gang fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       Wow. And it is a great idea. It truly is. Like, if you want to affect change, just get every, I was saying to somebody last night like we all know, like every, somebody was asking me about uh, cheating on and I was like, I'm not a cheater. But I was like, every guy does what they do. Most human achievement is because they men wanted to get like, yeah, like buildings,

Speaker 4:          01:28:18       electricity. If you think that scab problem in unions, just trust me. If you got a fucking sex drive them hoes, them hoes going to come down. I was also, what am I going to you? I have no leverage.

Speaker 1:          01:28:30       This is my main leverage. Like, um, but, but yeah, like it's a, it's a great bargaining tool. Oh yeah. I mean it's the, it is the bargaining. I mean that's, in some ways that's most of them negotiation of a relationship is like where girls get like women don't control. It's like they may not control it explicitly, but I know if I do something that's going to get you in a bad mood, you're not going to fuck me.

Speaker 4:          01:28:54       And legalized prostitution is one of the, one of the best ways to combat any kind of sex strike. And that is one reason why women fucking hate the idea of legalized prostitution. They don't ever want that to not be negotiable. They don't ever want you to be able to go, oh, I'm an asshole. Yeah, I'm going for a drive. And you go right down to the store when you go to the sex store and you pay for a 10 and she's built like Jessica Rabbit and you bang and you have a time of your life and then you go home and your girlfriend's got a little bit of a gut, their ass a little saggy and you're like, I just know. I mean you can't tell me what to do anymore. I spent 80 bucks. I just, I said it wasn't that much. Yeah. If sex was legal v financially, if it was transactions, it is legal in a lot of countries are not a lot of countries, but a few cuts of view. Yeah, enough. But if it was legal in this country, how much do you think it would shift perceptions? And the way what people, I think it would, I don't know,

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       cause I was just in Singapore and apparently it's legal there by the way. I went to like there's a, I was in Singapore, did some shows. Excellent. And uh, and there was a place called, uh, it's orchard road and it's a mall during the day and at night it becomes a mall for prostitutes. They have a prostitute mall. Yes. It's dirt road. And the awful saying four it is four floors of horrors, which I did.

Speaker 4:          01:30:23       I hate you. I hate the word war. Um, I don't know. It just bugs me. I had something about, it's like you wore, it just feels like dice or the cooker. Pr. I Dunno. I like hooker is a term of endearment. Call. No, not like mouth shut your mouth hooker. Like oh yeah, like a girlfriend who's just joking around about something. They shut your mouth. Hooker and that everybody will laugh. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:30:47       so, but it, I, so the, the, the local guys, we're going there and I was like, well yeah, I'm going to go also because I want to see this place. Cause I've read about it and there was a restaurant there that they ate in, which is a whole other issue, but it's literally like a mall, like a Shitty Mall. Like not like a, you know, Glendale Gallery that where it's like, like a law. It's just one of those like square ones where it's like four floors. There's escalator in the middle and then there's just basically like, and there's just wimp, prostitutes, hookers as you call them, uh, out in the

Speaker 4:          01:31:23       walkway. Jamie's got a visual for us trying to find something, but I found a, a TripAdvisor review of Ortho. Nice. Yeah. Wow. Don't go here at nighttime unless you want to be shocked a little. The wholest place turns into a countless, into countless brothel bars. I feel like I needed to scrub myself after our visit. I, I don't diss. Like I, I was

Speaker 1:          01:31:43       there about three minutes and I was like, all right. Cause the thing is there's a difference between legally legalize prostitution and anyone wanting to be a prostitute. They don't want to be, I mean they are right. I don't think they're being forced or coerced, but is coercing

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       them. What did you doing it? What did you think about the Robert Kraft situation here? Here's what bothered me about that. Two things bothered me about that one, they, they accused him of being a part of sex trafficking. Right. But it turns out that wasn't true. They weren't, they were just regular girls who wanted a jerk guys off for money. Right. It wasn't, there was no one there on it, I think is a big word. Would willingly did it voluntarily, whatever. Um, and they were threatening to release the film footage of him. Like, so what do you do? And just trying to shame him into submission and the fact that this guy, even though he's a billionaire, he can't stop that from happening. I kept crazy. Well the funny thing is the fact that he's a billionaire and still has to go to them to the fucking drive through. It's like, boy, I wished there was a better system. It shouldn't be a better system. Yeah. I mean I think it's going to be robots. I think sex robots are going to be like blur the morality line. I was at, uh, this is, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:32:56       similar thing about like, there's no, uh, a release and relief anywhere. I was at a party recently and DiCaprio was there and there were, and there were a bunch. It was just like a huge, crazy party, like crazy holiday party, like the kind. I never go to them. And it's just like Eddie just everyone's there and, uh, Dicaprio's girl wanted to leave and he goes, well, uh, the girls are tired. So I got to leave the greatest party ever. Like he had to leave, like even did Leonardo Dicaprio, the king of kings. The girls are tired. God got to go. They'd been at the Party for, ah, I don't know, hour and a half or something, but there was like a dinner before, but it was, it was just a funny thing, like, oh, okay. So there's no, it doesn't matter who I am. You still, when they're done, yeah, when they're, when they're done, you're going to go so times. But having said that, we still all do it for some invisible, uh, Shangrila.

Speaker 4:          01:34:00       I bet she would have stayed at the party for aqua man. You know what I mean? Yeah. Aqua man was the man document. Like, it's fine, let's stay. Yeah. My feet take off my shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:34:10       Uh, yeah, the, uh, but yeah, there's still, he's still kind of, I mean, we're still doing it for some primal, like all the achievements and all that shit. It's still some,

Speaker 4:          01:34:22       yeah. Well, you want to be respected, loved, and liked, and you want people to desire you. Yeah. That's part of it. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:34:29       Even if you're not gonna take them up on it. Right. Like I told an anecdote on, on, uh, how neofill this week, um, about the best compliment I ever got. I was doing a show in Vegas with two buddies of mine who shall remain nameless. We get on the elevator at the end, woman gets on and goes, can I just say I'm married, but I would fuck all you guys, whoa. And we, and it was great, but like, Oh, you

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       get, we feel accomplished. We did a great job. At the show, you're attracted us having to be married and that's so nothing's ever gonna happen. But thank you for expressing your attraction. US A one. If she was saying, even though I'm married now, she was saying it like, just so you know, if I weren't married by, wasn't married yet, fuck and not, and she didn't mean at the same time either. She was a little drunk, she was, but even tipsy, she had some ridiculous, that's a very nice thing to say. Like that's kind of what you want to from everyone. For a guy. Yeah. Like, Hey, I would fuck you girls don't want to hear that. They're like, yeah, thanks. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. Everyone wants to come on to, yeah. Hey, how do you like doing a podcast with Bianca? I love, don't be on, she's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:35:45       She's funny. She's smart, smart and she's a pain in the ass in terms of like, ah, she is very like, no, like she has her own logic. She has her own belief system and we just argue it out. Uh, she's more in like, and she's also like 10 different races. She's like, so she's pulling from a, like her father's Middle Eastern. She grew up in Oakland. Like she's got a lot of different, like it's got Panamanian and she's got a Panamanian, she speaks German I think like for real. Like she's so she's just like from all over. And uh, she's a fun, she's fun and funny and she's funny too. She's fun to be funny around. Is she on how Neil feel? Yeah, she's on hunting field. That's the name of the, so how, how often you guys do it? Once a week. Oh, that's cool.

Speaker 3:          01:36:34       Yeah. What do you do it? Do it in my, literally in my bedroom. Oh, nice. Yeah. Beautiful. Cause it's, it's not, that's the only space we have. That's cool. But it's like, you know, it works. How many have you done so far for? Okay, cool. Nice. The beginning of a podcast. It's nice. You can see what it becomes. Low expectations. You'd be like, yeah, we're still starting out. Yeah. Uh, I like it either. Have you done any at the store? No, I literally haven't done any, I don't think maybe I did one in the basement once. It's a nice little spot, man that it is. Yeah, it's cool. It is kind of a cocoon. Yeah, it is. It's, it's the way they have it set up down there. It's pretty bad ass. And the fact that like, wow, we're doing a podcast at the comedy store.

Speaker 3:          01:37:15       It feels, it feels kind of historical because that is the thing that brought that place back. Yeah. Podcast brought that place back from the brink and made it the thriving center of comedy. I think you can all agree that is the center of comedy in the known you hundred percent. 100% yeah. And that podcast, even like Robbie from Netflix is like, podcasts are like the indicator of streams. Like you know, it's, it's pretty direct. Yeah. The correlation, and I don't know what Tom would be more popular from Netflix or the podcast. They're both pretty fucking like one on one aide in terms of he's murder in it right now. It is. Podcast has fans like whenever they do these Garth Brooke things. Oh my God, Garth Brooks is haunted. He doesn't know what to do. He's so trapped by your mom's house fans. Yeah. They just won't stop with the means and the deep fakes with Tom's face of a Garth Brooks body fight. DM The guy. Yeah. And uh, cause I was like, is it hard because it's terrifying. Someone said, I did it. Jamie used the software to make one with me with Trump's head was easy. Yes. Fuck very easy. Someone, I was talking to somebody about it and they said it bums me out in the way. Death used to bum me out when I was a little kid.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       Wow. Wow. Oh, I know what he means. It's like unfathomable. Like, oh, this is not good shot man. Chow. Check this out. God competition for us, for the US. Look at this. Are you checking in about which vice president? Former vice president Biden. The current vice president is my shorthand. He actually looks like Joey. Do you guys do that? Looks like me. If I was fat and I had a crazy haircut that looks, that's me. Everyone's competition. I view everybody's clarity. That's so good. How long did it take for real?

Speaker 4:          01:39:13       Um, it's about the, I was teaching myself how to do it really. Right. So like this version took, I let it run overnight because there's a little bit of what the machine learning kind of thing I was doing. The longer you let that run, the better it is as well. I've been learning. So this was just my test of like eight hours, maybe six hours, have multiples going at one once I made this year, months or in the hopper. The crazy thing is porn. They're doing that with gals that taken like, you know that you've, you used the word Gallop's 12, that word. I love it. This is a good time to bring this up cause I just saw something today literally. And it has to do with this, and I don't know if this is real, but this sounds, it sounds scary and this is where someone is taking this technology into a weird place.

Speaker 4:          01:39:49       Uh, a lady like as a Facebook post, it's why I don't believe it, but she said she was with her son and while she was out of her house, her husband was called saying that her son was kidnapped and that he heard his son's voice saying like, Mommy, help me, help me, help me. And to give them money. And the dad was freaking out, didn't know what to do, did, couldn't get ahold of them and for finally did after six minutes and she said they couldn't even convince the dad that that wasn't real. Like after hearing, no, I'm fine. We're fine. I'm with them. But I don't know if this is even real, how they could do that at this with the capability now I'm not sure, but they might be able to.

Speaker 3:          01:40:23       Oh, for sure they can do it. Yeah, they can do with your mind. I mean if they can do it with faces, they can do with audio. They did it with two pocket, that Coachella like five years ago. That was the way he said Coachella is exactly how he would've said it. And they have that, that Hologram that looks just like him, but like a little more jacked. Just a little like it had more of a six pack. He like you went to crossfit? Yep. Yeah. And having uh, yeah, that's, I can, I totally believe they can do the voice seven

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       ago for that one. Wow. Yeah, they're so close now. Even if you go back and watch game of Thrones, like season one and with the wolf's look like they look like shit. Really? Yeah they were. There's Shitty CGI wolves. A little clunky, but now they look amazing. Now it looks like a real fucking wolf. What is this? That's Tupac. Look, look out. Jackie is, do you have any idea how many sit ups you have to do to have a stomach like that? You gotta be on that Wiz Khalifa tense also as routine. It's also, you got to not eat any starts, right? I mean any sugar, you can't be fucking around with carbs, carbs, that would keep you from being really shredded. I mean, not all carbs, but I mean either doing some, a lot of fasting. You got to do something. And get your body fat down that low because it doesn't matter how many sit ups you do.

Speaker 4:          01:41:37       Right. It's not gonna well up to make your ab muscles bigger and make them more defined. I can see one of mine, yeah, you got to lose weight. The only way he goes on to say that, no, it's so easy to get fat too. I'm so amazed at how easy I can get fat on a vacation. Like one week I gained 10 pounds. If I go on a vacation and I just go drink and eat pasta, 10 pounds in a week. Well that's like you're running such a small margin. Yeah, and just in everyday life where it's like, yeah, if you, if you just eat, it's not a man. I mean it's fairly massive, but it's not like, what do you think it is? 800 calories a day. No, that's dry. Made the extra. I don't know. With me, man, I go hard when I, when I eat on vacation, drink, drinking and eating, like just the drinking.

Speaker 4:          01:42:25       When I'm on vacation, I might drink four or five drinks a day, maybe more every day. Do you drink during the day if you're on vacation without your [inaudible]? No, no, no. Not without my kids, but when my kids are there, I'm hammered. Yeah. You got to say, yeah, I get no, but if I'm away on vacation and I'm out, I might have a drink at the pool or at the beach, wherever I am. And then at night if I go to dinner, I might have two or three, so I might have four or five drinks every fucking day. That's not a normal day for me. Such as just piling up, piling up and what are you drinking? Whatever, whatever. What do you got got? Yeah. If I'm on vacation, you know, I'm trying to get fucked up. I'm trying to have a good time doing it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:05       Like it's my job. And Are you, does your wife get drunk? She'll get hammered. Not as much as me though. I get more drunk than her. That's fun. Yeah. Yeah. Was you don't know where to go and you could just walk to wherever you're supposed to be. Yeah. Yeah. But a 10 pounds later, I'm like, you fat. Fuck. And I'm grabbing my sides when I can go grab a fistful of meat. Right. Where my love handles on. I'm like Jesus Christ. Well cause it's so like you fucked up and you just like have a thing that you have a handful of regret. Yeah. Take a week to get everything back in line. By the way, that not that long. I mean that's not a very long time compared to compared to most people. Like at your age, fucking people, People's metabolism. Take them. People get fat a little bit and then they're done.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       Yeah. But I still do the same shit that I did when I was 21 like in terms of like the amount of working out I do. Yeah. I still, I'm still running the hills and doing serious kettlebell workouts and martial arts and all this stuff. At least five days a week I'm doing something, muscles shit every day. Are you doing Tom's? I'll do something every day. I'll do multiple workouts in a day because I have a gym at home. So I'll get up in the morning and lift and then I'll do yoga and then I'll do something later. I just, you have to keep going when you're 50 years old, like your body requires, like you can't have too much slack in that cause when you slack, if you get out of shape, fuck man, it's hard to get back in shape. It's hard. Like your body is trying to die.

Speaker 4:          01:44:38       Yes. And not trying to put muscle on and up your vo two Max. It's not interested in that. Interested in dying and the trick that continuously working out as the kind of like, Yup. I've been cranking the sauna up to 200 degrees because Gabrielle Reece told me that Laird Hamilton puts his shit on to 2100 twice. That's what she said, right? To 20, which is you cook meat at 220 degrees. That's like, that's fucking hot. And uh, I was like, there must be some sort of benefit in that. So I'm like, I'm going to ramp my shit up from one 80 to 200 and it made a big difference. What and what's the difference? First of all, it's way harder to do the difference. Gene one 60 in one, like I was at a um, a sauna this past weekend at a gym, like a hotel gym. It was a nice song, but it was not hot enough.

Speaker 4:          01:45:30       It was like one 60 ish. And at that point that hot, you're sweating and it's, it's helping, you're getting heat shock proteins. It's good for your body, reduces inflammation but not nearly as radically is when you hit 200, 200 is fucking hard to do. Like you are the, first of all, the wood in the sauna that you're sitting on is hot as fuck. You need your sweat to cool off the wood because the wood is like a plank. Like a cedar point through you're cooking a filet of salmon on the wood gets like it's how long can you stay in at 20 minutes and those last five minutes are rough. And how do you deal with the pain? Whatever the like you can't, you don't want to move, right? Yeah. The last five minutes I'd get up and I start walking around. Actually I feel like I have more of a hard time sitting still in the last five minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:46:21       So like, uh, yeah, I would think attractive. Yeah. I distract myself by stretching and moving away flip flops or that they would mouth know you. They'd probably get, well you know what works though? Surprisingly airpods those fuckers don't die out in 200 your phone would be dead as fuck, but airpods keep going. So if I put my phone just outside the door, yeah, but airpods on, I could listen to music or at least think they're hot to the touch. Yeah, they're hot. I feel them. But they're not breaking down. They don't do the hang in there at 200 degrees. Good for you or probably, yeah, they're good. And you feel it markedly different. Yeah. You feel good when you get out of there man. Like all your little aches and pains feel like to get a big bump, like a big reduction in the aches and pains and that's, and most your aches and pains, their age and working out.

Speaker 4:          01:47:11       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just inflammation in Jay. What age would you be pissed at? Be pissed. If you died at 60 would you be pissed? Do you know what? Nah. You know what I mean by pests? Like fucking fuck you. I fucking did all the right shit. Yeah. I don't know man. You know I just heard John Singleton. He died at 51 Luke Perry died at 51 or 52 stroke. Both those guys. That's like fucking, that's me. That's this age. Destroy of Stevenson. Even my, I mean he was not in good shape, but like he wasn't old. No, no. He strokes and yeah, that one's like, oh, was Keith when he had his stroke? 50 Ah, fuck. Fuck. Yeah. Like at what point would you be like, feel ripped off? Probably right now. So 60 you would be like the shit out of this body though. It's amazing. This thing works as good as it does.

Speaker 4:          01:48:06       You know, if I think about my body's like a car that I've been to, you still feel like you're beating the shit out of it, or did you feel like the Jujitsu stuff was beating the shit out of it? Well, I still do that though, but I, I went running in the hills yesterday. Hard fucking work out yesterday. How far? Two miles. But it's straight up or steep. Yeah, it's like one, one stretches more than a 200 yards straight up and it's fucking hard. It's a hard sprint. I, the dog runs ahead and I'm trying to keep up with them. Yeah, but you get to the top of these really steep hills when your legs are on fire, your lungs are killing you. But man, it makes a difference. But it's also, are you beating the shit out of your body or are you just doing it?

Speaker 4:          01:48:46       I'm strength, right? I'm doing it right, but I am, I am putting a lot of pressure on the joints. I'm putting a lot of pressure on the muscles and it's not simple. It's not like doing yoga every day. I'm doing some pretty heavy duty stuff, but I feel like, um, if you do it smart and you warm up a lot and you stretch and I've been pretty diligent about recovery sauna in the big way, but also a beginning, a trigger point muscles release therapy like which is like really hardcore brutal massage that you literally want to cry. Like, like this kind of elbows estimate each fucking puts her elbow on the back of my neck and you're like, yeah, but it's, but it makes a big difference man. All that stuff, cry out therapy, all that stuff. Everything's got a little place. Yeah. Helps. But the moment, the main thing is consistency. Like you can't, you can't take months off, you can't, you can't take weeks off. You can't just eat less. You'll, you'll, it'll slip away. Your body wants to do what it's been doing. Yup. Like your spirit, whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       Like whether it's like, you know whenever the law is that body in motion stays in motion but it just does. It's Gunna like sugar, same thing, eat sugar and you're like, we've got to get more sugar. Don't eat it. Four days later you're like, man, God could feel like

Speaker 2:          01:50:02       variety is really critical to look. I'll make sure that I get at least one or two days a yoga and at least one or two days of running at least one or two days of lifting least one or two days a martial arts, like do a bunch of different shit, mix it all up together because if I don't mix it all up together, then it's like to just too much repetitive stress possibility. Like if I'm just running every day,

Speaker 3:          01:50:23       I don't, I'm not, I don't think that's wise. And you you, why don't you do interval training with running? I do sometimes, yeah, I do. I do a bunch of different shit. I mean sometimes I just do hill sprints and then I slowly go down the hill. I'll wait till my heart rate gets below one 40 and then sprint back up the hill again. You know, I mix it up, but the key is consistency. No matter what you're doing, whether it's yoga or running, you got to do something almost every day. Yeah. I don't do some everyday, but I'd try to do like I got a treadmill and I now have a bowflex and practicing the proud owner of above. You're the last guy to buy one. I know bout to go out of business, but they go, we just got to fucking a wonderful from 1988 bro.

Speaker 3:          01:51:02       Yeah. My, my ex girlfriend's roommate had a bowflex. I remember using this going, why in the fuck did you get out of this big actually and it gets like, it's uh, takes up a lot of space. Got a boat. I didn't even put, yeah, you're right though, bro. Come on. They don't that only that's when it, yeah, it does have like a wing. It is a wing bird. Does it work? Yeah, I, yes. You got a good workout. I got, I'm getting my gains, Bro. I still have like dumbbells and you know, other shin bands. I tell people,

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       well, if you really want to work out at home, all you need is a chin up bar. Everything else you could do on the ground, you can do body weight exercises, you can do

Speaker 3:          01:51:39       plenty of. I've got to say, I don't even think you need a chin up bar. I mean again, you know 10 times more than I know, but I'm saying like what are you getting from a chin up bar that you can't get from a push up or a dip or pull ups you're getting, but I'm saying it's all done right.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       You're getting your back, you're getting your back. You're not getting your back much. You're getting a little bit. If you do Hindu pushups, we swooped down and elevate and then come back up. You're getting a little bit of your back, but you're really getting your back. If you're hanging onto a chin up bar and you using your whole body weight, that's what you want. That that is, that is an amazing works. My backout very much. No. Am I fucking myself? Yeah, for sure. You have the strength in that bitch to keep the stability in your spinal column. You want meat, you want that to be armored, you know, that's very big. I have several machines out there that are just designed to keep my back strong

Speaker 3:          01:52:28       and you just think it's good. It's best practice.

Speaker 2:          01:52:31       Yeah, I do that almost as much as any other kind of exercise. I do a reverse hyper. I do a whole series, the reverse hyper machine. Then the, the glutes, the glute machine where you you, you know, no,

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       I cannot believe how hard glutes. Like it's the hardest. That's the one after it. I'm like wow, I'm gonna fucking throw up. It's the fucking wars hard and you have to even like I was talking to a trainer and she was like, well you need to like activate your glutes. And in part of me is like, I don't even know what you're talking about. And then the more I research, it's like our glutes are dead as like normal people. We don't use our glutes and they are literally atrophied. That's why women's get get so disgusted by guys. Flat ass don't like this mother fucker doesn't even activate as no, but do you want if he's gonna run ton of Shit. Yeah. You have to do a ton of shit just to, and she's like, you would take, it would take you a couple of months to even just get them activated and I was like, I don't know what you're talking.

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       I just thought it was some trainer shit and it's you have to like turn them on. Yeah. Like you have to like do like I do a ton of shit. I don't even know if I'm doing it right. They I think iron up. Yeah, they got together. You got to get a train. I should get a train and come home, man. Yeah. You got cash. Yeah. Get yourself a training and Brennan. Yeah, I shit. Plus it's good because you have to make, is this your bowflex? No, I went the news. That's the mirror. Look, if you think I didn't almost by this you're out of your mind. Magnets. It's a snapmirror one waiting. Wait something or other. I've been seeing this online recently. I just curious if you've ever heard of it or no. If it works well it's got two chords. How much a resistance, the resistance is all internally had done just by magnet pressure that you saw.

Speaker 3:          01:54:09       What's the maximum amount of stoke? Cause I don't know if you know this but I'm jacked. No. Yeah, I heard how much? 148 pounds in the middle. I think you'd probably 200 plus pounds. I think it's, I think one 40 it'll take care of most people. Yeah. And if you just doing cables, so 148 on each side, is that what it is? I don't know. Literally I just, it's new and I was just curious if you had seen anything that looks bad ass. So the mirror is showing you your forms, forms versus video versus like are you doing it correctly and they tell you what to do and it goes up and down. It fits on the wall. Is that a gimmick? That's what I wonder. Is there any reviews that it's way it's, it's like brand new. I don't even know if the reviews are all pretty strong.

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       This is the, like, as you're saying, it all comes down to are you going to do it? Yeah. If you do it every day, it's fucking great. Right. You just, most people won't do it every day. Yep. They just, because it's got to write it down. Just like every day I brush my teeth. Yeah. So do that too, but takes longer. I meditate twice a day. It's fucking twice a day. Really. 20, 28. Wow. Interesting. Yeah. So how does that work? Like what do you do a sit down, set the timer for 20 and a closed my eyes and repeat the mantra. And what is your mantra? Sucker car. Sorry. Oh, sorry. I got um, uh, and it, I think it works.

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       I think I need less sleep as a result really since I've started, I started like a year and a half ago and I needed significantly less sleep from before and I don't know, again, because it's impossible to know why, you know, what's doing what, but what other benefits in terms of like clarity and stuff. I don't, again, I don't know. I think they're good, but I, I can't say like, well I was writing 4.3 jokes a month before and now I read 4.8 like I don't, there's no direct correlation. I am happy with my output but like, hmm. Isn't that funny? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:56:16       That like to an average person they'd be like, wait, wait, wait four point. You're joking, right? No, no. If I get four great jokes a month, that's an amazing month.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       Yeah. Well it's like that. I was going to bring it up when you were talking about deer hunting. Yeah. Right. It's like, yeah. If you it, you see the special thought of it all at once. Yeah. I'm the special, you had a great line about

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       writing and that like, like writing in a notebook or on your phone that it's like a net to catch ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:56:43       Yeah. That really is like thought about that was like that is a great way to put it. Yeah. Like here put throw this in the, put it on the thing and like, and then you can look back. You ever have an idea, write it down and then three days later looking at like that's fucking fun.

Speaker 2:          01:56:56       Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's funny. Well that's why you got to throw a lot of shit against the wall. I have pages and pages of stuff that I review like late night rambles that I labeled them late night rambles cause I write a lot of times at, at night after the store. So I by yourself? Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's asleep. I'm high and just sit in front of the computer.

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       And is it like you have a germ from the day?

Speaker 2:          01:57:19       I have sometimes some, but I have one hour they have to write. So I'm one hour in front of that computer and like give myself that one hour and then after that I can watch youtube videos or whatever you flicks, whatever. But I have to get that one hour in and man, there's been many times where I'm sitting there staring at that fucking computer for 20 minutes and then, and then sh I got an idea, I'm like oh my God, there's something. And then the next day I'd do that onstage. Boom. It gets a laugh like fuck yeah. That reward for the tediousness to is just getting through the, the sitting in front, staring at the blank screen, staring at some fucking weird notes. You're not even sure if they mean anything. Trying to find some old shit where there's just a spark of light, an amber blow on it, turn into a fire.

Speaker 1:          01:58:02       Or like I had a joke that I try that I was trying and I was like, I know it's good. I just have to come up with the right thing. Yeah. And then I try to couple, the first couple times you fuck it up, you don't say it right. It's just so it is the TD and the mild embarrassment of just like trying and failing. But uh, but having an idea, writing it down, doing it on stage is the, to me the most rewarding thing I can think of. It's one of the most rewarding things in all of life. Yeah. I mean honestly, and I don't say that light. I just mean like living a life. That is the thing. And

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       it's not, that's the one that's not really about, women are not about that. It's more like spiritual. It's like about like, uh, yeah. And, and like you, it goes through the, your your filter and you're like, no one ever thought of that. Right. Know what fucking ever thought of that. Right, right, right. That's fucking crazy. Those are the best ones. So like how did I catch you? Like how, what that cue. Thank you. Earth. How often do you write on stage? How often do you ad Lib on stage? Very rarely. I you see I come up with my sheets. Yup. Yup. And like put, I have a new joke show every Tuesday in Santa Monica and then, so I'll go up and do as much new shit as I have [inaudible] and mix it in with my ma. I mean, you know that when you have a punk then you'll put like, I can do it, I can put that part in there.

Speaker 3:          01:59:36       So he kind of have to do some old jokes that like fit in the new part. Um, and, but my, I'm like, I usually am like if I write for jokes, one of them will work. Yeah. Like, and I just like nip. Yeah. Alright. For jokes. One of them will have signs and then sometimes the other ones you're like, man, I don't know if you're alive or not. I got to stare at you for a little bit. I had to try to figure out a way to bring you to life. Yeah. Is might be something there. I'm maybe missing it on the first pass. Set it aside. You ever have a premise and years later you'll figure it out. Years later I'd decade. Yeah. Yeah. And be like, Oh fuck. And you just know how to do it now. Yeah. Maybe you have a bit that you did that taught you about something else or some other aspect of writing a pit and you couldn't explain it to any, you couldn't explain it to someone who doesn't do it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:22       No. Like you can't, it's kind of not, I mean maybe athletes a little bit where it's like they figured the game out in a different way, but it's so private and it's so like a, and that's the thing I was talking to somebody about this, like how many funny people are there in the world. There's a lot of funny people, but how many of them are funny? Standup funny. Yeah. They could just go on stage and make a roomful of people laugh. That's a hard, that's a hard couple hundred. If you're being generous, you're going to be really general. Like how many real legit professional comedians that you and I respect. Maybe 200 yeah, man, there's 7 billion people in the world and like that's the rare and I as much as comedy is like deified in ways that are sort of goofy now. It's still like, no, this is all we do every day.

Speaker 3:          02:01:14       It's fucking interesting. It's like Ed, especially now the way the culture is like we're the only people speaking freely in public or at least in an organized way in this, this format as well. Podcast and stand up those the only two things. Yeah. I mean everything else right now is compromised it seems like. Yeah. And then everybody else feels at work. You can't really talk freely at, in relationships. There's like, and it's not like we're just talking extemporaneously, like I don't even know where I'm going, but I'm fucking know what's going to happen at the end of this sentence. But, uh, but that, and that's the thing that's so riveting about it. It's like is there no one else is doing and there's only a few hundred people that can do it. Well, yeah. It's crazy. And it's also reverting to like the, the creation of like these, these little things that you come up with.

Speaker 3:          02:02:08       If you keep going, eventually there'll be a special, eventually it'll be something that we actually can record. Yeah. And there's just like these, this thought, like, I'm onto something. I've got this, I'm piecing this little puzzle together. And not even knowing someone said like, so what do you, how do you come up with? And it's like, I don't even know what I mean when I start. And then I write the jokes and I'm like, oh, I see what I was doing. Or going through. Do you sometimes rewrite a bit, like write a bit and then rewrite it from a different angle?

Speaker 5:          02:02:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:40       Uh, I mean there's obviously like threads of like, like you just do the inverse. Sometimes I'd take a bit when it's already done and I say, okay, let me put that aside. I know it's done. I know it works. Let me approach the subject from a completely different angle now. Yeah. Let me approach the subject as a hater. Well, couldn't you do you end up probably doing both of them, right? Like a lot of your feminism shit. Yeah. The thing you were closing with felt like you'd written a half and then we're like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah. And now my own robot. Well, I'm wanting to rebut myself. Yeah. I know. Also wanted to shit on myself so hard that by the time I got to shit on the feminists, like it worked. Yeah. Well, that's another thing where it's like if you couch, you can say anything as long as she's it with like I'm not a monster, just know that I'm not a monster of course, but some of these bitches are, or some of these, whoever's are like, I'm not a total piece of shit, but let's talk about that. Yeah, that's the, the, I'm thankful that I just thought of a, another like frame for, uh, for uh, like I did the three Mike's thing. Yeah, no I did for Netflix. So I thought of that frame as like three microphones on stage and I just thought of a nother certain that it's not like a structural thing, but it's a way to do a show and, Huh.

Speaker 5:          02:04:00       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:04:00       My first thought was fucking thank God. Meaning you don't want to be like, you don't want to do it. Uh, premise he show every time. Cause I did three mics, then I did a half hour on Netflix, New Year's Day, the communities of the world thing that deleon Swartz into two. And, uh, and now I'm like, I would like to do it kind of not one man show. We think just not a modeling version, but like a way to do jokes that are more, it's like jokes, but also if you can thread something else in it. It's like, do you see that there was a ground site live? I think it was Halsy who sang a song and fucking painted at the same, she painted a painting turning this off and I was like, wow, wow. See if you can bring it up. Cause it's like the song, I can't play it. We'll get, we'll get to it was the second song. It's our live. Yeah. If we play it well we'll definitely get the boot. Youtube is brutal with their copyright shit. Brutal. I mean, so what's, it's just very, it's good and bad. Yeah. But it's very easy for someone to claim copyright off of just, you play a clip and next thing you know your video gets taken down. He can't stream.

Speaker 3:          02:05:11       So part of me is like, you know, is it right here? So she's singing, she's singing and chanting. And by the way. Great. Logan. Yeah. Okay. Just got a lot going on. And she's tearful barefoot. Oh, I mean, is it amazing? No, but it's fucking amazing for singing to me. Yeah. It's better than I can do not singing. I bet she's quite a character. I don't, that felt loaded. That's set up front load of jail. Um, yeah, so like I thought of another premise, so I'm excited about that. That's awesome. When you think you're gonna film, if you will, you will. Not long ago I got a, I have, I've kind of written out, but like I'm going to probably do it like in New York, like I did three mikes where I did it like sort of op Broadway and, okay. So when you do something like that where you do like a long run and then film at the end of the run.

Speaker 3:          02:05:58       Yeah, I basically did three mikes. I did for like two months, four nights a week. So, uh, ended it all in New York. Yeah. Oh cool. And then where did you do? Uh, some theater like on the lower east side were perfectly does his, and then, and uh, it was cool. It's cool to just like have to do an hour every night. It's a cool like, oh, I'm going to do an hour and I'm in a town, I'm in the same town. That is cool and I'm doing an hour every night and you're doing essentially like a play on that. I liked it was an emotional, there was a, it was a like an emotional fucking, I talk about emotional shit. This'll be less emotional. It'll be a less wrenching, emotionally people saw three Mike's like, it's fucking pretty gut wrenching. But uh, but this'll be less gut wrenching. But you have a premise that's exciting to you.

Speaker 3:          02:06:47       Yeah. Which is fucking, you know, that's like fucking excellent. And it's also the only thing that like, it's like, well, you're gonna make money. I don't know. I don't care. It doesn't matter. It's like not even a consideration. It seems like you're wasting your time thinking about that because all that really matters is do you enjoy doing it? This is the audience. Enjoy it. All that other stuff comes out of that, right? Yes. If you enjoy it, they're probably gonna enjoy it too. Yeah. And, and even the thing where people go like, so what are you doing? And you're like, you can say you're doing the podcast or you have UFC stuff like go like, oh you have to have something that you're working on. And I'm like, I feel like I'm doing an hour comedy special for a huge stream streaming service that's going to broadcast fucking everyone's like, what are you doing?

Speaker 3:          02:07:32       That's it. You know, that's how they, and you're like, this is a, what I'm doing is fucking, it doesn't, it's not time consuming visibly day to day, but like it's consuming emotional, like thinking about it. What's your take on what's going on with Louie? Like what he's trying to do with, uh, stopping people from quoting his bits and the quoting. I mean, I think he's just trying to stop people from leaving a shit. Yeah. It was his own fault cause he just didn't have the bag. He didn't have the Undergrad like he could have him was like, yeah, it'll be fine. Yeah. What's the worst that can happen? Why Louie? So now he's doing everything. He's got the yonder bags, he's doing small clubs and he also has a sign that he puts up saying that if you leak any of the material that they have legal repercussions.

Speaker 3:          02:08:22       Uh, good. Yeah. I mean why should, why should, it's a spoiler. It's like, it's like a fucking, but it's worse than a spoiler. Yeah. It is worse than a spoiler because every, every joke is its own movie, right? It's got its own prize to exaggerate about it, but it's like, yeah, it's a huge, it's a, it's a, that's a huge problem. And it's also, it goes to that 11 year old girl thing where it's like literally said deaths and what he did that. Yeah. Uh Huh. Yeah. When you have 11 year old daughters, man, it's like you get it. Oh, now I see how people are thinking. I'm like little kids. And what's the, how would you describe it? Like sort of like simplistic. Yeah. Looking for something to be naughty. Someone to do something back. What did he do? What did she do? What are they doing?

Speaker 3:          02:09:13       Well, we'll tell you right after the break and you're like, oh, I can't wait. Yeah. Uh, but I don't, I mean, Louise a hilarious dude and, and I hope I, I'm interested to see what happens. I think he's going to come out with a motherfucker over an hour. That's what I think. I think he's going to pee. He's constantly touring. He's on the road all the time doing this. I know he's not doing it just for money cause he's only doing these little tiny places. It's doing Zane. He's in Chicago right now or Zane. He's in Nashville right now. He's going to come out with a motherfucker of a special and resubmit his position. And I think there's going to be people that are still mad at him no matter what. I don't matter. I don't think that you can please most of the people that are mad at him, no meaning and I don't, I just think it's like they're not reasonable.

Speaker 3:          02:09:59       They, it's more fun to not forgive him. Yeah. It's ideal. It feels better to not forgive him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck him. Yeah. I get it. I get their perspective, but for everybody else, we're going to get treated to a monster hour. That's what I think. I hope when he's all done, I think it's probably going to be as best hour, hour. I listened to the, the leaked one. Yeah, it was good. Yeah, it was good. I mean, 10 months out, man. No, no. Comedy it off for 10 months and then he starts doing it again and there's, you know, some bits in there that would have been great if they didn't get leaked. The thing about what are you going to do? Cancel my birthday is so fucking funny. It's in, it's like, yeah, he's so fucking funny. It's bananas. Yeah. Cause my life is over like you to cancel my birthday.

Speaker 3:          02:10:44       Ah. So God damn funny. Um, yeah. Yeah. Like I, you know, he's an, he's a fucking hilarious dude. Yeah. That's the front of the line. I mean, when it comes to comedy and political correctness and the pushback, that's the front of the line for the pushback is stand up. Let nightclubs stand up. The stuff that you and I both do, we say a bunch of fucked up things that happen to also be funny and you're doing it in front of live cry or I'd set on safety of the night, they're going to a strip club and complaining about cellulite. That's what it feels like. It's like, what do you, this is, we say a ton of shit. Some of it doesn't work. Somebody doesn't work because it doesn't cross the, the comedy barrier. Some it doesn't work cause it's ideologically fucked up. But you don't know it until you say it's like, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:11:32       Even the funny many great bits that you love are fucked up to someone sure. To someone like, or you have to figure out a way to make them more like Chris Rock's bit about this difference between black people in the end. Yeah. That bit he said bombed. Oh yeah. A long time before we figured out how to go. Shortly before he did it on his, on his uh, crazy. Um, it's great, but he knew, he's like, God dammit, there's something in this. Yeah. Uh, and, and also it is fucked up. It is a fucked up. Like it's fucked up. You can weaponize that joke. Sure. A lot of white people did like a lot of racist white. But like I told you, I've been saying to that in my car for years. Um, and that exactly, but at the same time you can't worry about that.

Speaker 3:          02:12:23       Like I was talking to uh, some, I did a thing on the pockets where I was saying like, I don't understand the problem with Jordan Peterson and you and I have talked about this at the, at the club like, and, and then, and people email me and they said, well, people use Jordan people, right wing people use him as an example of Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. I'm like, that's not his problem. Right. That's, and he promotes, someone said he promotes an all meat diet. No he doesn't. He said he does it, but he didn't promote it. He didn't make a commercial about the shit. You can't worry about how someone takes, again, this goes to a point is how someone interprets your art. Use Channy interpretation exact. And also by the way, then throw away taxi driver and uh, and uh, uh, the [inaudible] book, the Catcher in the rye cause that's responsible for killing Lennon.

Speaker 3:          02:13:19       Shooting Reagan like [inaudible] just like, okay, well, so these fucking dummies use it as their thing. Right. So now I can enjoy it. Like to fuck go fuck yourself. Yeah. There's too many interpretations. There's too many perspectives. There's too many people. You just have to be a reasonable person. Be Nice, do your shit, do your best. And you know, look, we worked together all the time, man. People are laughing. Yes. People are having a good time. Like, and, and it's not, it's also like, what's your intention? Yeah. It's not our intention is to create, right. Our intention is to come up with funny thing and like me as a person who enjoys standup, I like sitting in the back of the [inaudible] and watching someone kill I fucking July. It's the best. I told somebody that like I'm a gym rat, but for comedy club, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:14:06       I've been seeing you for 27 years. Yeah. Just hanging out, like me and Chappelle were in Vegas and some kid was like, what do you, he was a chef at, uh, this place yellowtail and, and he was just saying like, being a chef, you just fucking have to cook for 12, 10 years, 10, 12 years, just like itch hard and shitty. I was like, I've known him for 28 years. He's been going to clubs for 33 years. Like, that's the only thing that Matt, it just makes sense. It's fair. It's like it's an economy that you understand. If the idea is good enough, the we'll get this response and there's not, there's not really politics. There's not, there's preferences, but there's not like, you know, like, oh, uh, have him, although you've got the fact that you got banned from the store is hilarious. That is like from a movie, like we'll band, we have to ban one of them. Uh, but, uh, but, and you won in the end as it were. But, um, but it is a fair thing and it is like the only people as rock says, we're like x man. Where it's like they, they're always mad at the x men.

Speaker 3:          02:15:18       They're always mad at the x man. But like fucking, he's still like the ECZEMA. Yeah. You're mad. You're, you're mad at Louie. But fuck if he went on stage and you know, the mother fuckers hilarious. Crazy. Yes. If he walked on stage, they would stand up and give him a standing ovation. Yes. And there's also, it's also the, it's almost the corporate thing where it's like, if, if, um, you know, Chinese slaves are making phones, did they make this one like this part? Like, whereas with Louie, it's like this one guy is responsible for all institutional sexism. It's like, no, he's not. He's a fucking, he just was a dumb, he just was dumb. And he handled, he was dumb from beginning to end and he talked about it. He will. Yes. He was fucked. He just fucked up and it was stupid. Um, but he doesn't have to take the fall, uh, you know, whatever. Like he is valuable. Yeah. He's a valuable, these valuable to our culture. It creates a lot of, I don't think of standup this way where it's like you create joint for people. I'm like, I never think of it that way. But he did create a lot of thought and joy and like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       he's responsible for a lot of positive shit.

Speaker 4:          02:16:34       I mean, that is what the art form is. Yeah. You're literally changing a person's state and that w I mean, as an audience member, I still love it. And that was, uh, that was a struggle for me early on because I was jealous. I could see people doing well and I wasn't doing well. I was like, God, I wish I was doing that. I wish I wrote that joke. I wish I was doing that show. I wish I was. And then I realized like, oh, this is like totally unproductive. Like the opposite of productive. It's negative. And so it can be activating in terms of like, if you turn it into bleed, then work harder. Right? Well, but the problem is like, I wish I did that. Like that part of is no good or God, why is he have to get this? That part of is, there's no positive to that. But what is positive? You Watch someone kill go, God damn, he's funny. I got to go to work. Yeah, that's good. But the, the hate part is, is like spat instinct. It's not, it's counterproductive. It's really common. I think it's then 11 year old, it's, that's your first. That's the easy reaction. I'm like, no, yes, yes. Ah, the 11 year old man. And then it's like, okay, but what am I,

Speaker 1:          02:17:40       what's underneath that? What's underneath that is like respect. I don't, and then there's certain people that it's like, I've never hated Brian Righ. Right. Do you know what I mean? Like, and also like, there's so loves him. Yeah. And he's fucking hilarious in a way that's just like, I don't know this fucking dude. This dude's funny.

Speaker 4:          02:17:59       He's so funny and so clean. You could take your grandma to see him and never worry for a second. A gall, where's he going with this? Yeah. Grandma gets said so fuck, I gotta get a drink. Yeah. He, he's just, he's one of those rare cats like Gaffigan that figured out a way to make clean just as Sebastian too though. Yeah. Like Sebastian to the, I always forget he's clean and eight bar gutsy. He's

Speaker 1:          02:18:21       now like getting into that area where he's like clean southern accent. Like it's a big, it's like it's a good place to be, but he's fucking so funny if you're naturally inclined to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Like if, yeah. If you're forcing yourself to it. Um, but uh, yeah, I think that there's a ton of value in, in standup. I mean it's, it seems so obvious, but it's like, and I think Netflix must, there must be some metric of Netflix where they, at a certain point they're losing a ton of programming, meaning all of their shits licensed. Disney's taken all their shit back in like a year or two. A lot of like parents, like all of these places are starting their own apps, so they're going to lose. And I think they realize like, oh, a lot of Netflix is stand up and documentaries. And I think that must be in terms of like pry, they can never monetize it in terms of like if the Ali Wong special begat this much money, but if it costs them 500 grand to get alley walks for special, including

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       production, everything, they made a lot of money. You know what I mean? Like, and it's millions of people watched it and like as well he should because he's fucking great. So like they, it's just a cool, it's just the coolest thing I can imagine. I agree. Like being a convenience. The coolest thing though man. I mean that's, that's the, the have the appreciation and respect for something that you enjoy doing. That is actually your, your, your, your, your answer. Occupation. I mean, it's a beautiful thing. We're really, really fortunate and the gifts that we get like a low, you know what I mean? Like it's all for, it's all from comedy. Yeah. Glasses, shoes, car. Yeah, everything you're doing. Yeah. Basically like every single thing is from just a personality quirk. Yeah. And like creativity, work, grinding too. I like grinding. I really do it when I'm doing three, four shows a night, I get a kick out of it and I'm like, here we go.

Speaker 3:          02:20:23       This is how things get good. Work a joke out. Oh, the best. That's how they come alive. Yeah. I gotta wrap this up then. Brendan, tell people your podcast. How do you feel you go to find a friend, Bianca, and fucking doing it with her? She, yeah. Very cool. Yeah, it's great. We get good chemistry and um, and it's iTunes everywhere, so go check it out. It's just me. It's like this. Except it's like this. Yeah. It's like this. Yes. Except as a higher pitch voice. Disagree with not much higher. And Joe might have pretty, yeah, it's kind of high. Right. All right. Bye everybody.
