00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:02.285
- [Voiceover] In any discussion of biology

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:03.924
or discussion of evolution,

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:08.395
the idea of a species will
come up over and over again.

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:11.399
And we have a whole
separate video on species.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.859
But the general idea,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.794
or the mainstream definition of a species

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.963
is a group of organisms
that can interbreed,

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:21.463
interbreed, and produce fertile offspring,

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:24.664
fertile, fertile offspring.

00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.904
So for example, in this
picture right over here,

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:30.756
you have a bunch of species

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.227
of both modern elephants and previous,

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.365
or now nonexistent species,

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:38.122
that are related to modern elephants.

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:41.111
But today on earth you
have Asian elephants

00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:42.713
and you have African elephants,

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:44.732
and they are each a species.

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:46.151
An Asian elephant can interbreed

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:48.734
and produce fertile offspring
with another Asian elephant,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.488
and an African elephant can interbreed

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:52.909
and produce fertile offspring
with another African elephant,

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.595
but they can't do it with each other.

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:55.909
An Asian elephant and an African elephant

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.693
cannot get together and interbreed

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:59.393
to produce fertile offspring.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:02.616
We know, people have actually tried this.

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.486
But the next question, or
the most obvious question,

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.487
and this is one of the central
questions of evolution,

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:10.181
is, well, how do you get these species?

00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:12.435
We see drawings like we have on the right,

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:13.595
on the left here we have actually

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:15.320
some of Darwin's original drawings

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.495
showing this evolutionary tree,

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:18.961
showing how over and over again

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.996
we have this branching from
a parent species into two,

00:01:22.996 --> 00:01:24.819
I guess you could say
different child species.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.289
You see this here with the elephants.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.582
At some point, the Asian
elephant and the African elephant

00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:33.166
shared a common ancestor,

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.595
and it was also, based on this diagram,

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.012
a common ancestor

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.144
of the mammoth.

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:41.097
And you go even further back,

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:43.870
it's the common ancestor of this species

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.059
that I'm not familiar with, the Anancus.

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.930
And you can keep going back.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.809
But how does this tree branch?

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.798
How do you actually get speciation?

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.916
How does the variation
within a population,

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.674
within a species get so extreme

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.282
and in some ways so
separate from each other

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:00.236
that they can no longer interbreed

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:02.740
and produce fertile offspring?

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.186
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:07.517
The most obvious way that you
could imagine this happens,

00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:09.059
or maybe the most intuitive way

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.336
that you could imagine this happening,

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:13.086
is through geographic separation.

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.924
And the technical term for speciation,

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:20.126
which is the formation of new species,

00:02:20.126 --> 00:02:23.450
so speciation, actually, let
me just write it this way,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.827
the technical term for speciation

00:02:25.827 --> 00:02:29.972
due to geographic
separation is allopatric.

00:02:29.972 --> 00:02:31.805
Allopatric speciation.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.421
So speciation is just how,

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:39.093
the formation of new species.

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:42.193
And "allo" comes from the word "other,"

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:46.504
and "patric" comes from the
root or the word "homeland."

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:48.746
So it's really talking
about other geographies,

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:52.044
or other homelands, or
geographic separation.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:54.760
And one commonly cited example here

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.010
are the antelope squirrels.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.307
So if you go to the,

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:01.296
if you were to go to
the American Southwest

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:05.127
a long time ago, before the
Grand Canyon was a canyon,

00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:08.947
when the Colorado River was
just kinda going through

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:10.716
and wasn't a major barrier,

00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:12.221
there was a parent species,

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.002
an ancestral species to
both of these characters

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.312
that lived on both sides of the river.

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:19.346
And on different times of the year,

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:21.749
it was able to get across the river,

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.113
it's able to, the squirrels on the north

00:03:24.113 --> 00:03:25.441
and the squirrels on the south

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:29.170
were able to interbreed and
produce fertile offspring,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.303
so they were all one species.

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.458
But over time, the Colorado River

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.146
started to erode more
and more soil and rock,

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:38.694
and so this became what we now consider

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.550
to be the Grand Canyon.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.422
And so over time,

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:46.721
this became a very significant
geographic barrier.

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.739
No longer could, before
they could travel across,

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.430
but once it became the Grand Canyon,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.774
it became very difficult or impossible

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:56.270
for them to travel across.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.381
And so now you have these
two different populations.

00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:59.808
They have the same parent species,

00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:02.008
but they're now geographically isolated.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.375
And since the creation of the,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.579
or while we have the
creation of the Grand Canyon,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.619
since it became very hard
or impossible them to cross,

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.338
you've now had enough, both genetic drift,

00:04:12.338 --> 00:04:14.170
also natural selection,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.804
these are the evolutionary processes

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:17.159
that we've talked about,

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.110
where the Harris' antelope squirrel,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.953
which lives on the south side

00:04:22.953 --> 00:04:26.199
and is right over here, it's this picture,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.449
and the white-tailed antelope squirrel,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.156
which lives on the north side.

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:33.718
Even though they look quite similar,

00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:35.349
as you can see from these pictures,

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.760
they have now diverged enough

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.740
that they are different species,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.573
that they no longer will
be able to interbreed

00:04:43.535 --> 00:04:46.305
and produce fertile offspring.

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.902
So it's fairly intuitive

00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:51.867
how allopatric speciation can work.

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.194
Geographic separation,
no longer can interbreed,

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.239
and over time their genes change

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:59.808
through natural selection
and genetic drift.

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:03.109
But what about situations where
they stay in the same place,

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:06.705
where theoretically,
they could get together,

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.241
they could interact.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.459
Could you still have speciation?

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:12.258
And the answer is yes.

00:05:12.258 --> 00:05:13.707
And that form of speciation,

00:05:13.707 --> 00:05:16.303
where you are still in the same geography,

00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:19.824
that is called sympatric speciation.

00:05:19.824 --> 00:05:21.668
Let me write that down.

00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:23.418
Sympatric speciation.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:28.544
Speciation.

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:32.464
And examples of sympatric speciation

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.321
are a little bit less obvious,

00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:36.012
or a little bit less intuitive,

00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:39.218
but there's an example that people believe

00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:43.918
is sympatric speciation
happening before our eyes.

00:05:43.918 --> 00:05:48.085
So this species, the technical
term Rhagoletis pomonella,

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.759
I know I'm mispronouncing
it right over here,

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.635
this is native to North America,

00:05:53.635 --> 00:05:55.545
and before European settlers

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:57.925
brought apples to North America,

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.815
they hung out and they laid their eggs

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.565
and their maggots were inside of,

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:07.424
or they leveraged the hawthorn
fruit right over here.

00:06:07.424 --> 00:06:09.291
So they would go to the hawthorn trees,

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.038
and they would lay inside of the haw,

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:14.161
they would use the hawthorn fruit

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:17.074
for their, to lay their eggs,

00:06:17.074 --> 00:06:20.170
and for their young to kind of consume.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.537
But once the European settlers came

00:06:23.537 --> 00:06:26.404
and introduced apples into North America,

00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:29.216
a certain, I guess you
could say a subgroup,

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:33.967
of Rhagoletis pomonella
started to leverage the apples,

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:34.981
so started to lay their eggs

00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:37.071
and their eggs and
their maggots would grow

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.821
inside of the apples.

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.546
And they've actually now diverged,

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:45.811
not into fully different species now.

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.054
In theory, they can still interbreed

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:50.072
and produce fertile offspring.

00:06:50.072 --> 00:06:52.042
But they don't tend to do it any more.

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:53.124
That it tends to be,

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:54.538
even though they're in the same geography,

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:57.196
and it's not hard to fly
from the hawthorn tree

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:58.812
to the apple tree,

00:06:58.812 --> 00:07:00.038
they don't tend to do it.

00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:03.524
And because of this behavioral divergence,

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.286
that some decide to go to the apple,

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:07.175
some decide to stay at the hawthorn,

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:10.310
they actually are now
developing different traits

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.056
that are selected for depending on that,

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:15.602
I guess you could say initial preference,

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.091
or that initial bias for
which fruit they want to use

00:07:18.091 --> 00:07:19.321
to lay their eggs in.

00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:21.672
So for example, the ones
that are in the apple tree,

00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:24.794
they now have, their breeding cycle

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:27.547
is more aligned with the
growing season for apples,

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.099
while the ones in the hawthorn tree,

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.008
their breeding cycle is
more aligned with what,

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:33.631
for the growing cycle for the hawthorn.

00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:35.975
And so biologists believe
that this is an example

00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:39.836
of sympatric speciation
happening before our eyes,

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:42.845
that if we were to wait
a few hundred more years,

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:44.950
possibly a thousand years or more,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.848
that this will diverge
into two different species

00:07:48.848 --> 00:07:49.967
that will no longer be able

00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:53.546
to interbreed and produce
fertile offspring.

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:55.985
Another example of sympatric speciation,

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:59.325
which is a little bit
more wild in some ways,

00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:00.825
it's a little bit more out there,

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:03.137
but this would be an example with plants.

00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:07.379
So as we learn in other
Khan Academy videos,

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:09.029
organisms like human beings,

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:11.793
and in fact many sexually
reproducing organisms,

00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:13.384
they're diploid organisms.

00:08:13.384 --> 00:08:16.217
They have two sets of chromosomes.

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:22.384
For example, human beings have
two sets of 23 chromosomes,

00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:23.995
for a total of 46 chromosomes,

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:27.541
23 from your mom, 23 from your dad.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:30.017
And so we are diploid organisms.

00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:32.544
And in general, there are errors

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:33.975
that occur during reproduction

00:08:33.975 --> 00:08:36.678
and errors that occur during meiosis

00:08:36.678 --> 00:08:38.446
that can lead to polyploidy,

00:08:38.446 --> 00:08:42.529
where an organism can have
more than two sets of,

00:08:43.818 --> 00:08:46.250
or can start, or a potential organism

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.449
could have more than
two sets of chromosomes.

00:08:48.449 --> 00:08:49.699
In the animal kingdom,

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:51.168
that doesn't work out too well.

00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:54.049
Usually, that does not
produce a viable embryo,

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:55.677
a viable zygote.

00:08:55.677 --> 00:08:56.903
But in the plant kingdom,

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:59.712
this is, it tolerates
it a little bit more.

00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:00.893
So you could have a situation

00:09:00.893 --> 00:09:02.815
where you have a diploid plant,

00:09:02.815 --> 00:09:06.140
and through meiosis,
through an error in meiosis,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.179
instead of producing
haploid egg and sperms,

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:11.500
it produces diploid egg and sperm,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.152
which then are able to get together

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:16.139
to form a tetraploid plant,

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.881
so a plant that has
four sets of chromosomes

00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:22.020
instead of two sets of chromosomes.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.709
And then once that
tetraploid plant exists,

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:26.647
it might only be able to reproduce

00:09:26.647 --> 00:09:30.985
with other tetraploid plants
versus the diploid plant.

00:09:30.985 --> 00:09:32.675
So you have the diploid plants here,

00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:34.817
when meiosis is working "properly,"

00:09:34.817 --> 00:09:35.650
and I'll put that in quotes,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.324
'cause maybe, you know,
arguably this error

00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:39.535
is what helps for a speciation sometimes,

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.567
especially in the plant kingdom,

00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:45.117
it is, it can produce
this haploid egg or sperm.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.069
The tetroid plant would then,

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:48.208
would, through its meiosis,

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:50.865
its ploidy, I guess you could say halves,

00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:52.774
when it goes to the egg or the sperm,

00:09:52.774 --> 00:09:54.790
but you're now going to have a nonviable

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.565
or infertile triploid plant,

00:09:56.565 --> 00:09:59.445
because the separation
won't happen properly

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:01.043
in meiosis for this egg,

00:10:01.043 --> 00:10:02.710
if it's even viable.

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:05.756
So all of a sudden this tetraploid plant

00:10:05.756 --> 00:10:08.568
is now a, you've had speciation occur.

00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:10.272
It could be viewed as a new species.

00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:13.267
And you could think about
things like this happening

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:15.318
as a potential, and we
don't understand all of it,

00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:17.183
we don't understand how
all of the speciation

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.945
that we now observe has actually occurred,

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:22.313
but you can even imagine
as this being a mechanism

00:10:22.313 --> 00:10:25.420
for why you have an increase
in the number of chromosomes

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.473
in certain species versus others.

00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:32.240
So hopefully this is starting
to answer some questions,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.035
and hopefully even
introduce more questions,

00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.017
'cause this is a very exciting topic,

00:10:36.017 --> 00:10:38.996
about how we get species from,

00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:41.251
more species, how do we get the diversity

00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:44.668
from parent species or ancestral species.
