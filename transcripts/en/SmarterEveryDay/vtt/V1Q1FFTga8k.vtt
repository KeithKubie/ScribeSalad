00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.010
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So there are many different types of

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
intelligence in the world right? I mean think about it. If you're good with mechanics you might be spacially

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.090
intelligent, or if you're good with other people you might be intrapersonally intelligent.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
Now this is unfortunate because today I'm not intelligent in the area we're studying.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.160
We're gonna look at the components of beat boxing and then we're gonna use a Phantom to record

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
some slow motion beat boxing, which is insane, and then we're gonna use that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.210
data to study the physics of what the mouth is actually doing to produce

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.210
the sound that we know as beat boxing. Now I'm not intelligent enough

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.220
to do this on my own so we're gonna have to go meet somebody that's far more intelligent than I am.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.240
I know this might not make sense to you, but this is Flula.
- Hello guys. Boom!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.290
- [laugh] OK. So Flula is a German guy

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.320
that.. What you do.. music.. That's what you do.
- Ya ya.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.350
I like to make beat boxes and loops of techno, hip hop, things like that.
- Yeah so here's the deal.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.370
I really like his channel because it's fun and he does music and I don't really understand it.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.380
So, you've agreed to give me a lesson in beat boxing?
- Absolutely.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.430
So this is a layer looping pedal, and I can create many loops

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.470
and they layer layer layer on the top. But, if I like, I can

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
bring these to this machine and then I have 4 different tracks to use.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.550
- What?
- Yeah. So should I show you?
- Yeah please.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.590
- [beat boxing] So here is a beat.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.620
And now, let us bring it inside here.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.670
OK so now, it's in here.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.730
It's living inside. Now let us add something right?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.750
Let's do it.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.800
Boom. Watch out basses.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
And now maybe some sing-songs, yeah?

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.920
Right?
- Yeah ok ok ok. I get it, I get it, I get it.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
- For me, you know many beat boxers have different things, for me 3 things. There's a bass,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.950
Like that. And then you have like the snare,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.000
like with the sticks, the snare drum.
- Like snare drum.
- Ya ya, snare

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.040
so and I like, for me I like.. Like that.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.060
Other people like..
- That's your snare drum? [laughs]
- That's my snare.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.100
So and then of course you have the high hat.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.240
So put together...

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.270
- Yeah. Clearly, OK.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.350
Clearly there's skill here, and so here's what we're gonna do. I'm making a trade with Flula.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.380
I told him if he would teach me how to beat box, I would create a slow motion video of him beat boxing.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.420
So that's what we're gonna do. So I've got the Miro here, and what we're gonna

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.440
do is we're going to like look at your lips, are you cool with that?
- Let's do it.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.470
 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.550
 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.610
 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.690
 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.710
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.800
 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.860
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.910
 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.930
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.980
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.020
- Di... Did you s...

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.030
uh..

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.050
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.370
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.130
[laughs]

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.150
Don't even think about it. Let's just analyze it. OK check it out. We've got Flula up here

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.200
who's about to drop the bass, and above me I have what's called a spectrogram.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.260
I've got time in the X-axis and I have frequency in the Y-axis, so watch this.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.290
Check it out. Pretty cool colors.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.300
Now the brighter the colors that means the louder the frequency is at that particular point in time.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.330
Now it looks like we have these dark vertical bars, it's like we have

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.350
frequency within frequency, and that's exactly what we have and this is very important.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.400
It's called Timbre. Let's play the C2 note on a piano.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.420
Now the same note using a triangle wave.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.420
You'll notice the fundamental frequencies determine the note

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.420
and they're the same, but the overtones are different. These overtones are how our brains recognize

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.440
different instruments. It's known as the timbre or the color of the sound.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.460
So think about the texture of Flula's bass drop. It's actually two different functions

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.480
working together. The first one is a normal tone coming from his vocal chords. It's just a

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.530
normal looking sound wave. But the second thing is coming from his lips. When his lips slam

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.560
shut his mouth builds pressure back up until it's high enough to blow that lip out again.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.590
The resonant frequency of this is determined by the pressure in his mouth, the flow rate

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.630
of the air, and how tight he's pushing his lips together. Both of these functions are combined to create

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.650
a unique sound signature. So if our slow mo observations are correct, we should be able to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.680
see all these things in the spectrogram right? Yup, check it out.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.710
You can plainly see that the fundamental frequency from his vocal chords is down here,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.760
and you can see that the lip is slamming shut about every 25ms and stopping that air flow.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.790
You can then see that the sound is loudest immediately after the pressure

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.810
in his mouth gets high enough to pop that lip open, and if you look really really close

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.870
you can even see spots where his lip is slamming back shut.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.880
So there you have it. Beat boxers are not just dudes with good rhythm. They're actually biomechanical synthesizers

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.900
that specialize in the domination of not just the time domain, but also the frequency

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.950
domain. OK I hope we earned your subscription today because you learned something, but more

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.000
importantly I'd love for you to check out Flula and subscribe to him. He has never heard of me,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.030
I called him, because we were in the same city and he agreed to do this, and he's got

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.070
a smaller channel but I think it's very very clever, and I think he deserves a shot.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.100
I'm gonna leave some links over here. He's done something called auto tunes, where he drives

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.120
in a car and he plays an entire song by himself in one take.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.170
It's extremely clever and I'm very impressed. So go check that out, those are probably my favorite.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.190
And I'll show you what he did with his slow motion footage, which is pretty

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.240
funny in itself. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.260
have a good one. Can you do me an outro, and I'll use it at the end of the

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.300
video?
- Yes of course.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.330
[beat boxing]

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.350
 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.400
 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.420
 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.470
 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.520
 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.550
(Destin) Thank you very much Flula.
- Of course.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.362
