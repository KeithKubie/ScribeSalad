00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.300
And today, we are going-

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.320
spelunking!

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.280
Spelunking in the world of myth!

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.980
Also gardening in the world of myth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.940
You know what they say:

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.460
Dress for the job you want- not the one you have.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.200
Many myths take place outside of time and space,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.860
remember, "without form and void"?

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.560
But often, myths have specific meaningful settings,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.020
and over the next few episodes,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.980
we're going to talk about some of the most important places where myths have happened.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.220
According to scholars Lenard and McClure,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.040
there are many location-based tropes that repeat in myths from around the world.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.040
Sacred waters, caves, mountains, and there are mythic gardens, and forests, too.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.020
Scholar David Leeming has even added cities and temples to the list.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.000
Today we're going to look at two mythic settings side-by-side:

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.720
the garden, and the cave,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.220
which play complementary roles in various stories of creation.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.360
(Theme music)

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.700
Considering that gods hate weeding, it's surprising how

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.220
many myths involve gardens.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.360
We've discussed a few already, like the Garden of Eden,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.020
or the Garden of the Hesperides, where the apples of immortality were kept.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.540
Gardens come in different shapes, and sizes,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.980
there are even stories of gardens, inside caves.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.315
You can see this clearly in the Greek and Roman myths of the Underworld.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:24.385
Hades is a vast, underground land.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.280
Dark and shadowy, but it still has some lush garden features,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.340
there are pomegranate trees that provide food for Persephone,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.580
and grapes which tempt Tantalus.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.820
And yet, when Orpheus attempts to bring Eurydice out of Hades,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.000
He's described as bringing her up through the dark mouth of a cave.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.680
Mythic gardens and caves often work as symbols,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.600
more than literal descriptions.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.960
And where the meaning of those symbols need to overlap, they do.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.780
Sometimes in a way that's weird or otherworldly to those of us

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.540
with first-hand experience of actual gardens and caves.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.060
But this raises a question:

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.860
What symbolic values do we associate with caves and gardens?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.460
To answer, let's turn to a pair of stories about the origin of humanity.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.100
First up, the garden.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.480
We already talked about this story in an earlier episode,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.380
with Adam, and Eve, and a sneaky serpent.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.140
Then, we focused on the actions and relationships of these characters,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.300
and how they set up a social order.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.320
Now, we'll focus on how heavily rooted this story is in place:

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.820
the idyllic Garden of Eden.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.460
the idyllic Garden of Eden.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.560
We can talk about the garden of Eden,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.060
as both,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.555
a physical

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:34.535
setting and a metaphor, as a place

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:37.185
Eden is described as lush and growing.

00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:40.045
In addition to Adam and Eve, the place is overrun

00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:42.995
with nature and wildlife. Livestock

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.805
and creeping things and bests of the earth

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:48.085
According to their kinds.  Hey! creeping things, we missed you

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.495
we missed you guys. Of all the fruits bearing trees

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:54.345
in the garden, there are two that matter most.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:56.955
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree

00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.925
of eternal life. Entered the sneaky serpent,

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.845
and attempt to lied to Yahweh and... you know the rest

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:05.505
but more important than the physical features of Eden, is its position

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:08.745
as a paradise from which humans are expelled

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:12.105
because of their disobedience and as hopeful

00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:15.405
state we supposedly want to return to.

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:18.365
Eden doesn't disappear, but humans

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:21.435
never find a way past the angel with the flaming sword

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:24.485
who's stationed at and blocking the entrance.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:27.265
So, the perfect image of the garden,

00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:30.355
helps tell the story of humanity's fall from a state of perfection,

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:33.395
to one of debasement. As mythology

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:36.195
scholars Lener and McClure put it, after their disobedience

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:39.305
humans must life "in an ill word,

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.255
marked by disharmony, broken relationships

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.175
suffering and death." We can compare this

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:48.355
story and the symbolism of the garden with a creating myth

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:51.245
from the zuni people of the american west which

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.425
involves a very important cave, one inspired

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:57.265
by the grand canyon. According to the Zuni,

00:03:57.285 --> 00:04:00.205
humanity wasn't expelled from a bright garden,

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:03.015
but rather emerged from a system of dark

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:06.325
forbidden caves. Instead of paradise,

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:09.325
these caves serves as a symbol for chaos.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.275
Lets go to the thought bubble. Long ago,

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:15.015
before humanity was fully formed, they all lived

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:17.295
deep on the ground, in dark caves.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.815
No one can see could see each other, the humans have horns

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:23.615
and a tails, they have webbed finger and

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:26.615
toes and lack some... other... features

00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:29.225
too. You'll see soon enough! The sun, sees

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:32.275
humanity living in this state and sends his two

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:35.305
sons, younger brother and elder brother to help

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:38.525
the people travel off to the bright hills of surface.

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:41.605
Elder and younger find the people in,

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:42.605
gross conditions

00:04:42.775 --> 00:04:46.045
stepping and spitting and urinating on each other.

00:04:46.045 --> 00:04:49.035
So, elder and younger plant trees.

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:52.195
Pines, spruce, silver spruce and aspen.

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:54.935
Each representing one of the cardinal directions.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.465
As the brothers rise through the levels of the under realm,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.775
they drive a prayer stick from one of the trees

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:02.775
into the earth.

00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:06.205
This creates a sound like thunder,

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:09.235
that raises the people into each new world.

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:13.630
The people are now on the surface but they aren't fit for their new home.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.205
Elder and younger,

00:05:15.205 --> 00:05:18.225
given them corn, only to realize, the

00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:19.225
people have not mouth

00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:22.715
so while the people sleep, the two sneak among them

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:25.375
and cut mouths into their heads

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:28.375
so they can eat and luckily, the people love eating.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.405
Until... another problem pops up.

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:34.385
All that digested corn has no where to go. Younger

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:37.465
realizes that none of these people have anuses. [fart sound]

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.895
So, another round of sleepy top surgery and everyone

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:43.625
fells much...relieved. Over the next days

00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:46.135
elder and younger keep tweaking the humans,

00:05:46.135 --> 00:05:49.095
slicing their webbed hands so they can cook, chopping off

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:52.535
their horns and tails, until at long last, humans...

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.545
are complete. Thanks thought bubble! there are other versions of

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.495
the Zuni myth where, after emerging from a spot at the grand

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:01.745
canyon, the Zuni people set off in search of the "idiwan'a"

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:04.765
or "Middle place", where they can achieve

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:06.985
balance. On their journey, they stopped

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:10.035
at a number of sites that become sacred to the Zuni, until finally

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:12.615
settling at a spot near the head waters of the

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:15.725
Zuni river. All the sacred places are tied together

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:18.805
by the river of the region. But, we're going to talk about the sacred waters

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:21.925
in a later episode, whats important for now, is the role that

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.785
caves play in the symbolism of this

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:27.755
creation story. As a place of confusion,

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.625
out of which humanity is guided. Before,

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.705
comparing this cave of creation with the garden of Genesis,

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.640
it's interesting to look at another image of the cave that has had

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.080
profound influence on the western thinking,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.860
and echos

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.260
the association of caves, with immaturity

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:46.315
or under development. Plato's

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:49.445
allegory of the cave. In his Republic, Plato describes

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:52.415
a great cave as a way to explain, why people wouldn't

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:55.225
readily accept the wisdom of

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:58.035
awesome philosophers? like himself.

00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:00.925
It asks us to imagine a world in which humans are sitting in

00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:04.075
a dark cage, chained up so they can only face forward.

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:07.245
Behind them, out of view, unseen agents parade

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:10.295
a series of objects, in front of a great light,

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.295
from where humanity sits, they can only see

00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:16.295
the shadow that flicker across the wall, cast

00:07:16.295 --> 00:07:16.920
by the real objects

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.240
behind them.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.225
The shadows, are

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:21.505
their reality. Plato says

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:24.755
imagine that one of the chained viewers

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:28.235
breaks free and makes his way out of the cave.

00:07:28.235 --> 00:07:31.275
Just like the Zinies, Plato's imaginary escapee is

00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:34.215
blinded by the brightness of the world outside the

00:07:34.215 --> 00:07:36.995
cave. Eventually, his eyes adjust

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:39.995
and things come into focus but,  he still has difficulties

00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:43.265
believing that what he sees, is real but

00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:46.165
knowing about whats outside the cave, he runs back in

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.145
to tell the others. When he tries to explain to them that what they

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:52.405
think is really is only a projection,

00:07:52.435 --> 00:07:55.405
people in the cave don't believe him. Plato

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:58.285
suggests that those chained up might even try to kill,

00:07:58.285 --> 00:08:01.195
who ever got free. That person, who escape

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:04.555
the cave is, you guest it a philosopher.

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:07.265
Point out to the rest of us that our reality

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:10.235
its actually a pale reflection of a more

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:13.095
true world. Plato's cave and the Zuni

00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:16.075
emergence story are obviously very different but

00:08:16.075 --> 00:08:19.095
we want to involve the creation of the anus, for instance. But in both

00:08:19.095 --> 00:08:22.075
cases, the world of the cave is both physically

00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:24.805
and metaphorically dark, The cave is a

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:28.035
position of ignorance or inability and the surface

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:30.935
represents represents enlightenment figuratively and

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.985
literately. One can even say that, the emergence

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.985
leads to humanity reaching a more perfect state.

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:39.615
As Lener and McClure put it: "In the Zuni tale...

00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:42.785
humans existed in a dark, imperfect world...

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:46.045
At the calling of father , they emerged from this

00:08:46.045 --> 00:08:48.715
dark chaos into a world of light and

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.240
healthy relationships and harmony with

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:54.025
their fellow inhabitants...." This is a stark

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:57.295
contrast to the creation story of Genesis,

00:08:57.295 --> 00:09:00.065
where human beings, having being created by God,

00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:03.205
begin as perfect beings and then are

00:09:03.205 --> 00:09:06.285
forced into a state of imperfection, when

00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:09.115
ejected from the garden, like the heaveness revelers they are.

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:12.515
The story of humanity, isn't only a story of a

00:09:12.515 --> 00:09:15.575
fall but a quest to return, to

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:18.735
reenter paradise. Obviously, in the Zinies story,

00:09:18.735 --> 00:09:21.465
none is clamoring to get back into the cave of

00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:24.475
no anus. We can ask then, whether this

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:27.765
inverted orientations regarding creation make a difference

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:30.525
in their respect to cultures. Do you go

00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:33.515
about your day differently, depending upon whether you think of earth

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:36.385
as a place of punishment for leaving

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:37.915
a perfect garden versus
