00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:03.730
- Let's say that we know that
this area under the curve,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.166
y is equal to f of x, let me
label it, y is equal to f of x.

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.798
So under this curve, above
the x axis, between a and b,

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:14.098
which we denote is the
definite integral from a to b,

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:15.501
of f of x, d of x.

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.932
Let's say we know what this is.

00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:21.087
Let's say it's equal to, let's
say this area is equal to five.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:26.150
So given that, can you
figure out what the definite

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.136
integral, what the definite integral from

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.174
a plus some constant, c.

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:37.065
Let me do this in a different color.

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:40.466
So, what is going to be
the definite integral of

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:45.466
f of x minus c dx, from
a plus c, to b plus c?

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.312
So, this might look a little daunting.

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:54.216
But I encourage you to kind of try to

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:55.683
visualize what's going to happen here.

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:57.878
Try to pick a c in your
brain and try to graph them.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.647
And pause the video and try to think about

00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:02.857
what this is going to be,
given what we know about this.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:05.913
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.756
So what is f of x minus c?

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:11.966
Well that's essentially
the function f of x,

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.270
shifted to the right by c.

00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:16.278
So, let's do that.

00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:18.146
So that's going to look like,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.467
so if we take that function,
we shift it to the right.

00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:24.618
Let's say that this distance
right over here is c.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:26.633
So if you shift it to the right by c,

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.574
it's going to look something like that.

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.963
So I just copied and
pasted by original one.

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:33.518
It's going to look something like that.

00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:35.892
And I can even color code it.

00:01:36.216 --> 00:01:38.682
So this thing right over here,

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:42.816
this is the graph of, this is the graph of

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:47.816
y is equal to, y is
equal to f of x minus c.

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.050
And so all I did,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.688
it really just shifts
everything over by c.

00:01:54.688 --> 00:01:59.688
It just shifted everything over by c.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.207
And this is something you probably learned

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:10.631
in precalculus class or in algebra class.

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:12.448
And the key thing to realize is, okay,

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:15.914
when x is equal to c, you're
essentially inputting.

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:20.914
So when x is equal to c,
you're inputting zero,

00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:23.153
'cause you're gonna get c minus c.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:25.882
Your gonna input zero into f.

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:30.008
So you're gonna get the
same value here, when f.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:32.665
So when x is equal to c for x minus c,

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:34.265
you're inputting zero into the function.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.523
You're going to get the same value there

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:36.837
as when you just took the function

00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:38.483
and you just inputted zero into it.

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:40.592
So that's some of the
logic why when you take

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:44.866
x minus c, you're shifting
to the right by c.

00:02:44.882 --> 00:02:46.443
Now let's think about the bounds here.

00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:49.850
This is a plus c, so a plus, let's shift,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.850
so a plus c is gonna get us
right over there, roughly.

00:02:55.882 --> 00:03:00.882
And so, this is a plus c and
b plus c is gonna get us,

00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:04.663
is gonna get us right over here.

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:07.550
So this point right over here is b plus c.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.513
So our new bounds, our
new bounds look like this.

00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:16.513
Our new bounds, we're gonna
go from a plus c, to b plus c.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:20.183
And so this is the area, actually
let me do it that yellow color,

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:23.811
since that's what I made
the definite integral in.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:26.390
So we care about this area now.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.226
We care about this area.

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:31.217
And I think it might, it's
starting to jump out at you

00:03:31.217 --> 00:03:32.871
what this is going to be equal to.

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:36.159
This right over here is
going to be this exact thing.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.510
We just shifted everything.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.957
We shifted the function to the right.

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.703
We shifted the bounds to the right.

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:42.444
And so this is going to be the same thing

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:46.821
as the integral from a to b of f of x dx,

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.216
which in this case, and I
just kinda made that up,

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.344
in this case is going to be equal to five.

00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:52.564
But the important thing to realize,

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:54.467
and this is a tricky one,
you'll see this sometimes,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.333
sometimes in math competitions,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:57.612
or in kind of a difficult test.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:59.735
But sometimes it can actually
help you solve an integral.

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.583
Once again, if you're tackling a really,

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.767
as we'll see in the future,

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.576
we'll tackle some really
interesting problems,

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:09.576
where identifying this can be valuable.

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:11.533
You might say, "Hey, wait,
this is some bizarre thing.

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:12.812
"How do I figure this out?"

00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:15.165
And you just realize this
is just shifting this,

00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:19.265
this is just shifting this
area over to the right by c.

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:24.172
So it's going to have
the exact same value.
