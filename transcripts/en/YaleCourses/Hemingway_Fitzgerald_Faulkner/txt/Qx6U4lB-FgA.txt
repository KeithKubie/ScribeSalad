Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So, um, just want to go back very briefly to the title of as I lay dying. As you guys know, the title is taken from, uh, the other save book 11 and um, is, um, Agamemnon is, um, has gone to the underworld and his, uh, dcs has gone to the underwear and he's talking to Agamemnon power, who's telling him about the circumstances of his death and his murder by his wife are collecting the astro. So as I lay dying, the woman with the dogs, I were not close my eyes as I descended into hades. Um, so this is the original, um, inspiring moment in many ways of four, four, four Faulkner. And today I like to talk a little more, um, about the whole of modernism and the epic tradition. Um, and obviously we see with red enough of, as I lay dying to know that this is in many ways an epic journey.

Speaker 1:          01:05          It is a journey, um, very heroic or mock heroic journey, uh, to Barry. Addie, you, so is, it has all the trappings of the APIC is an epic journey on a small scale. Um, and it's also, uh, taking advantage of to epic conventions. Um, we've seen just now that we hear the voice of the debt and that's a very important adding a convention both in homer and in downtown. And as we'll see, um, it is also a very important convention in as I lay dying as well. The farmer is making very liberal use of, um, the other interesting epic conversion that I think has been involved in as I lay dying is the uncertain boundaries between the human and the nonhuman. And we have already actually seeing a little bit of that. So just wanted to refresh your memory with something that we discussed last time in terms of the two kinds of speech right now.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Last week we talked about the social dialogue on the one hand and then on the other hand, the worst with secrets. Um, and this is one instance of worst with secrets coming from vitamin. Um, so this is vitamin talking about something in the bond after he has been beaten people these horses and broken the state. Um, it is as though the dark, we're resolving him out of his integrity into an unrelated a scattering of components, snuffed things and stamping smells of cooling flash and ammonia hair and the illusion of a coordinator, the whole large, high and strong bones within which drange and siblings and Somalia and is different from my yes. Um, most likely vitamin is talking about the horse by this weekend. See as, especially as we get closer to the end of that has, um, this being that is drenched and secret and familiar and is different from mine is vitamins things to be talking really more about his brother Joel, then about Jules horse.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Um, and it's really hard to say when the human and, and when the animal begins in that particular passage. So this is, um, something that we see both in the kind of a small moment like this and as I lay down, but also in the very dramatized Merwin when volume and says my mother's a fish, uh, where obviously a strong analogy is being established between human and nonhuman. We'll come back to that statement, um, on Thursday. But today I like to, um, just to go back, um, a little bit and give you a sense of this very long epic tradition behind as I lay dying by going back to hormone and Dante and, um, in [inaudible] I want to talk about two instances. Um, the side clubs, obviously we don't know if he's fully human. Um, and, and even more famous episode is Searcy attorney humans into animals.

Speaker 1:          04:22          And then Dante following through with that convention in Inferno, uh, when humans are turned into animals, there's punishment. So first of all, homer in book, nine of the artist say, uh, Odysseus and his men are trapped inside cage by the side clubs. Um, and the way that they tried to escape is by blinding aside clubs. Polycythemia is, and so this is a moment that is reproduced by just about all the painters who, uh, paying that seen that episode in the Odyssey is the blinding of the eye. And we know that cycle of the lands one eyes. So it's relatively easy. It's the only have to do at once. Um, so here's is ucs blinding eye of the cyclops. And we can see that, um, the cyclops themes bigger, you know, the main difference seems to be in size and also the amount of hair on him.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Uh, but otherwise he seems, he looks he's a human form. But we also know that it's different if only because there's one either in the center of his forehead. Um, so he is not quite human, but his close enough and that is a condition that is especially fascinating to epic authors. Um, just give you a couple more images of the cyclops. Basically. You know, it's the same, same kind of idea. He's much larger, um, has a lot more hair but otherwise has a recognizable human form. Um, three far the man trying to um, use that spike to blind side clubs. And here is one more image. Um, so it's pretty much is that there seems to be kind of consensus, um, in thinking about is high clubs that he really basically is like us. But what is also interesting is that after his eye has been blinded, um, decide, labs wants to make sure that when his ship leave the cage that they wouldn't be humans.

Speaker 1:          06:17          Hiding, uh, going along with them. So it's counting all his sheep as they go out, as they leave the cage, even though he his cave, even though he can really see them. Um, and he surprised that his favorite shoe is the last to go and he's the last to go because this is clinging to him. But this is where science club says to his sheep, sweet cousin Ram, why lab behind arrests in the night cave? You never lingo so, but Grey's before they're more and go far to crops, wheat, grass and take your stays there were leading along the streams until an evening. You come to be the first one in the fall. Why now so far behind? Can you be grieving over your masters? I, so this is, um, not only is, um, a sense of is there a sense of kinship, um, between the side gloves and his shoes, but this is one of the earliest moments of a cross species identification that decide clubs obviously is mourning the loss of his eye.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Um, and his imagining has proved jetting that grief onto his shit and recreating kinship on a different level. Not just on the physical level, there's a connection between humans and animals, but also on a psychic level, on an emotional level, there is that kind of kinship. So the other thing I would say, it's one of the earliest moments of really interesting kind of cross species imagination at least in this one moment. Um, so, um, the more better known moment, and actually I would argue with less siloed than theirs is the transformation of humans, um, by, uh, Cersei and here's at, this is going after her because she was transformed one of his men into, uh, animal. Um, so we see many instances of this arm and this is an amazing, um, image. Uh, I mean this kind of vessel, um, with all the animals, uh, and [inaudible] house.

Speaker 1:          08:23          And I think that we recognize that actually there's a strong Egyptian influenced, um, this image is loafer Egyptian and there is in fact a constant traffic between, uh, Greece, ancient Greece and Egypt. So, um, it's partly that the impetus for thinking about humans, they're not humans is coming from, it's coming from [inaudible] as well. Um, and he has just to complete our discussion of the Arabic tradition that Dante is doing the same thing. And I just wanted to alert you that the snake is very important. Um, the connection between the human and nonhuman in the inferno, um, is that Dante is basically punitive philosophy, um, is that humans get punished by being changed into something that resembles the crime. So thieves because there's Nikki in the snake their way into other people's dwellings and of text book belongs to them. Um, that fears are turning into snakes in the info.

Speaker 1:          09:23          So lots of snakes in there. Further off, and one more dramatic representation. All these are by William Blake. Um, so we kind of have a really interesting congestion of a 19th century author going back to Dante and reproducing this very emblematic moments. Um, so there, so we have on record in 19th century author William Blake being inspired by the epic tradition. And I think the foreigner is a 20th century instance of a similar kind of inspiration, but as we're Faulkner, um, he as a, another layer of complexity to the epic tradition. And I would say that this is actually one of the most important innovations. And as I lay dying, um, in many ways more interesting than the epic journey itself is that humans are rarely identified with just one kind of animal. More often they are poor between two ends of the spectrum. Um, they sometimes identify with one and sometimes identified with the other and sometimes it's a mixture of the two.

Speaker 1:          10:34          So the two parents rooms that I would like to talk about in that context, um, uh, first is first of all a how, um, and then Jude, how was a minor character, but in many ways he's a really good example to concentrate on, um, to try to get a sense of the basic narrative strategies, um, in Faulkner. So I would just like to stop here for a moment and talk about possible paver topics. Um, when you think of the upcoming long paper, um, is to focus on minor characters. It is counted to they, um, to use minor characters, um, as the main subject of your papers. But actually, um, I promise you, especially in the case of fogging or you can get wonderful papers by focusing on focusing on someone liked how, uh, or even someone might Cora, uh, very, uh, obvious entry point, but because they are an obvious Andrea points, you can actually end up writing really interesting and surprising and compelling papers.

Speaker 1:          11:43          Um, so I'll try to give you a demonstration today of what could be done by focusing on a minor character lighthouse and then obviously moving on to central character Joe. So I like to argue that toe is basically identified with two opposing kinds of animal. One is the mew, um, the indispensable, um, animal amount, poor waste, the meal rather than the horse. Um, and then, um, Aphasia. They'll also mixed a routine appearance in Falkland Deposit. So first of all, the new and how as new, like when I look back and my new, it was like he was one of these spy glasses and I couldn't look at him standing there and see it all abroad land. Am I house sweated out of it? Like it was. The more the sweat, the broaden the land, the more the sweat, the title of the House because it would take a tight house for Cora to hold Cora like a job.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Nope. In the spring you've got to have a tight jar or you need a power spring. So if you have a big spring, why, then you have the incentive to have tight, well make jars because it is your milk sour or not. Because you would rather have milk that was sour than to have milk that won't because you are a man. I've no idea what he's talking about. Um, this, this is really, you know, I think maybe it's just the sound of it that thought that was, is to, um, get the flavor of thoughts that might have been causing through tells head. It's just a wonderful moment and talking about manhood, um, amount more ways. Um, people who don't have a lot to prove the man who went right middle, fast, no cars, no iPhone was nothing. Um, so very, uh, poor equipment with which to prove your manhood.

Speaker 1:          13:54          And the only thing that, um, tell can use, um, is just his view. And so he's looking at his meal and by looking at his knee and somehow his thoughts neander to the most important person in his life, his wife, Laura. Um, and is, that is his claim to core out. So I won't be able to tell you, you know, the logic behind this little bit of reasoning, which is really more emotional reasoning. There was a reroute reasoning, but it seems that how is saying that his claim to Cora, the way that he can keep her, keep her in a tight house, um, both in his, the physical house but also in a tight place in his heart and in her art, um, is by being a very good neighbor, by sweating, um, and cultivating the land, um, and making sure that the more the sweat, the tighter the house, right.

Speaker 1:          15:02          So this is the logic that this is the nature of manhood amount. Four ways is that it is by this web of your brow that you can win the woman's call. You know, it's nothing fancy, nothing complicated, various simple logic. But of course, it doesn't come out in a simple way and Faulkner, um, and that really is kind of the defining nature of, uh, the existence of very poor, rural people, um, is that basically you only have one thing, um, to prove yourself. And we can see that why on this one thing as a such an, an adequate specimen of masculinity is just not a very good workman. Um, so how is by contrast, someone who was fully adequate, fully competent, fully impressive specimen of manhood in that particular environment. Um, and he's very proud. You know, this is a very joyful moment. This is one of the great scenes about marriage.

Speaker 1:          16:08          And on Thursday we'll talk about contrasting scene of a very bad marriage, contrasting with his head, very happy seeing of, of, of, of a married couple in Faulkner. Um, but as we're father millstone stay happy forever. Uh, oh, humans that are like meals don't stay happy forever. So we're turning to a different meaning of the news, uh, when the journey takes, um, both an athlete but also a tragic turn when they try to cross the river. When the bridge is gone, um, and the museum as well as the pool. Um, the, the, the, the call across the river, which they know they cannot do. So they are just looking at this impending disaster. Um, and once again, the meals as emblematic of people who know that something terrible is going to happen, but with absolutely know how to stop that from happening. The Mayo stand, the fourth quarters already sloped a little, the realms high, they do our breathing.

Speaker 1:          17:19          Now, the dean who groaning sound looking back once the gays sweeps across those within the eyes are wild, sad profile and despairing quality as though they had already seen in the thick water the shape of the disaster, which they could not speak and we could not see. So I think the anti convention, um, is in fact the entire ancient Greek physician is involved in two ways, both in, um, the muse as in many ways and the medic of humans. Um, but also in the function as a tragic corals, right? You know, that this is a structural feature of in Greek tragedy, um, chorus looking on, um, knowing that the catastrophe is about to head, but with athlete and no ability to prevent this coming. So that's what the meals are doing here. That's the function. That's the ethics function within this La di very much associated with a kind of reassigned but resilient attitude, um, that we're seeing with, um, that we're seeing the towel.

Speaker 1:          18:27          But in this case the resignation and the kind of pose no bravery, um, the dose to holidays unrelated, adequate to stopping, uh, the, the, the arrival of a catastrophe. So in the next moment we sort of see what happens to the news. Um, and this is in many ways in play a logical conclusion of uh, what they have already been aware of. Um, this is a completely unsurprising, um, ending to this sequence began by the Muse as to tragic corridors between two hills. I see the views once more, they roll up out of the water in succession, turning completely over the legs. Stiffly extended as when they had lost contact with, they were. So this is in many ways a backward gesture to that burlier happy moment, uh, when the Muse of fully contended and fully capable of doing what they can do that then they all environment muse are creatures with feet of clay.

Speaker 1:          19:48          That's was clear. And this kind of sequence is that because they are creatures, we're feet of clay, they can only survive when they are on solid earth. And when they own solid of, they are very good in making that Earth projective and reproductive. Um, so this is really what, how is talking about is a very improved delta. The farmer, he's also reproductively happy with Cora. Um, that is the nature, but also to limit of a new lighting systems is that there are certain lines that Muse cannot cross. They cannot transcend the own condition as creatures with feet of clay. They can only be okay. They, and it really is no more than that. They can be okay only within one setting. And in this other moment, uh, when they left, the customer is setting, um, and they'll start trying to negotiate with a swollen river.

Speaker 1:          20:58          Um, we know that the muse will not survive in that kind of transformed setting. So in many ways, the perfect analogy for the poor wise that they can do relatively well when they're left to their own devices, when they allow simply to stick to the environment. But once they are taken out of the environment, then we know that terrible things are gonna happen to them. Um, so in, in, in this particular sequence, um, how being associated with the Muse, um, he's basically defenseless. Um, he wants just to be allowed to live, live according to his own fashion. Um, that really is the basic requirement of the muse is to be left alone and to be allowed to, uh, just to survive as they, as they know how to do, um, that is a very innocuous, um, and in many ways have very sad portrait or poor ways, but basically innocuous.

Speaker 1:          21:55          But family really also has a somewhat different image of whether poor white community, my amount to, and so he's not just going to give us an image of pool wise as defense. There's, but basically non aggressive, right? Abuse a completely non aggressive. Um, Faulkner does thing that the Ashley is an element of aggression in a very close knit community, especially the close knit community such as the poor white community. And we see that in the next image of the parole ways. Um, coming from, not surprisingly from jewel, this is how you things about his neighbors and now them others saying they're like buzzers waiting, fanning themselves, every bastard in the country coming in to stare at her. We've talked about hatred as a very important emotion as the kind of emotional bond within the family. And we now see that hatred is also a very important emotional bond within a small isolated community.

Speaker 1:          23:10          Um, not only does to hate someone like tell because they always think they are watching your every move, not only those Jew hate how, but he also imagines that there is an element of aggression, something that is not quite benign coming from the neighbors. Um, and that is really why he said suspicious of them and you know, so, uh, it be disposed was them on his part. Um, and I, the bosses actually will appear over and over again for this thing. And, um, the sound of theory, uh, the buzz was collecting, uh, around the body of the dog, Nancy in the ditch. Uh, and buses that band j imagines would go and undressed is dad, grandmother. So buzzers have already appeared in [inaudible] but in SLA dine buses as a physical presence would be quite important. Um, and also as a metaphor, a president to talk about what your neighbors might really be like in the hearts, not in our behavior but in the hos.

Speaker 1:          24:18          They might be just like buses and he has an image. Awesome. The buses to explain why. Uh, Jim, I think that the neighbors are like them. So, um, towers I said it's not obviously not the main protagonists in as I lay dying. Um, but he is an important clue to what Faulkner is trying to do because the way Faulkner portrays very important character is almost exactly analogous to the way he portrays. Tell excepted what in, how is dispersed and sequence. Um, tell is sometimes identify with the neo and sometimes identify with the buzzer. We don't actually see him being simultaneously identify with both. Um, what is sequence and spaced out in town would quite often be collapsed together as one and Faulkner's portray of [inaudible]. So in this moment we actually see Julie being a lichen to two of animals, not just one, not just his hose, which is obviously the main creature.

Speaker 1:          25:36          Um, that is a fully that with, um, not just the words, but something else come here. So Joe says he moves moving and quit his code. Bunching, tongue swelling like so many flames we're tossing mean. And to enrolling I the horse makes another shot in rush and stops again. Feet Bunge watching jaw, jaw while stellate what him, his hands at his size, say food, Jews legs. They are like figures. Coffered her blow savage in the sun. When jewel almost hugged him, the horse stands on his hind legs and slashes mean of WHO's as by an illusion of wings among them. Beneath the up rear Chaz, he moves with a flashing limberness, a snake for instance, before the Joe comes into his arms, he sees his whole body. Earth three horizontal. We're paying snake limber until he finds the horses nostrils. And of again, so many things to say about this moment.

Speaker 1:          26:48          The first, and we were referenced back to the news and the fact that they are creatures of clay, is that Faulkner is based in the king of very deep metaphoric distinction between two kinds of animals. They're animals like the muse who can swim and can only survive when they are honest, solid earth. Um, and then there are other creatures. The horse being the main example, um, who actually can leave earth for non trivial length of time, um, and they are able to survive when they're not touching the earth. So right here we know that Q is a very different kind of person from tower. Yes, he is in a white, poor white community or his parents appeared to be poor white. But for some reason there is something else about [inaudible] that makes him different, um, his more horse life than you like. Um, so this is a kind of a backward reference, um, to, to, to another input an animal in SLA dying.

Speaker 1:          27:51          But within the compass of this particular passage, what is really interesting is the simultaneous cope presence of the horse and the snake. And for those of us, the two of them, Ashley really are not that have light coming in. And it's hard to think of, you know, any kind of kinship really between the horse and the snake. Um, they look different and they have very different connotations. Um, you know, in our common understanding of those two animals. So let's try to see what it is. Then there was Faulkner, um, to bring those two animals together. Wellbeing. We know that the horse is the winged horse. So this is going back to the epic physicians in illusion with wings. This is not just a hose that is, um, uh, earthly creature, but seemingly one of the wing hoses of Greek mythology. Um, and certainly the causes acting, uh, like a method because, um, in that emotion, um, it's almost, uh, beyond just the physical capability of any earthly creature.

Speaker 1:          29:01          Um, so it is, um, the body in motion but not being register as body lor but simply as bodily pause coming into view when suddenly you are seeing that bodily part but not really the entire horse. And that actually was the way the father and was thinking of the horse as well. Right in the, if we go back to that moment, um, in father representation of the Horse in the barn, um, it was as though the dark where resolving him out of his integrity into an unrelated scattering of components. So nothings and stampings, smells of cooling flesh and have all their errands a lot. So, uh, vitamin has exactly the same kind of scatter a representation. The horse is moving so fast that we're not actually seeing or was, um, as a single integrated being but simply as different barley, barley pause, coming into view through emotion.

Speaker 1:          30:09          So really is less about the body and as a part of his body. Then about a kind of very fast and with transcending kind of version. Um, and that is really what, um, how Jews who was, is represented to us. We don't see him as a horse. We simply see him as something that is in constant motion. But more than that, it is the very and beggars relation between Joel and the horse. Um, obviously you lost his horse, you know, he's done a lot of work to get the horse. It is very much his horse. Um, but it was not exactly an affection relation, right? Was, it is a battle between two creatures, very important. Each other are the horse probably is the most important creature to jewel. Um, but there's no fashion there. So what is the feeling, what is the emotional bond between these two things?

Speaker 1:          31:14          Um, it is not common factor, which is the most ordinary and, uh, easily recognizable and recognize human bond, um, is not there. What is this other emotion that is there and it seems that we're thought new suggesting is that instead of the common human affection is a snake like quality that is binding cure to his horse. Uh, we don't know what emotions, snakes, um, they're not credited with having emotions either sneak in those, which isn't really an immersion. Um, so we don't actually know what kind of emotional bombs can come from snakes abrasion or maybe simply of hatred, but you know, but that is, that is a kind of a general, general thing. Um, it's not a benign, um, feeling, that's for sure. So right now let's just say that we don't completely understand, uh, what is going on here or why this snake is afraid.

Speaker 1:          32:23          Put a supplement to the relation between jaw and horse. Um, we're bad ones again to what we've been talking about earlier, which is the narrative as a secret bearing narrative register. There's another social dialect. This is with secrets. That's what we're saying right here. Um, and just to highlight how unusual this description of [inaudible] and the horse is, just want to go back very briefly to a contrasting moment in Hemingway. Uh, when, once again, we see a human pair with an animal that was very important to him in our time. Um, this is the, or killing the ball. When he started to kill it, it was all in the same rush. The ball, looking at him straight in front, hitting the ball charge and filotto charge. And just for a moment they became one for the other, became one little ball and then it was over.

Speaker 1:          33:22          Um, in this passage in Hemingway, actually the emotion, the emotion of patrons is quite important as well. So in an odd way, just like Faulkner Hemingway's also interested in hatred as a powerful emotional bond. Um, and that really is what enables to go fight to go off, but it is hatred so clear and so transparent and so ritualistic. And so ceremony is that it is also a transform by that ritual into the Commons love really. So, um, and Hemingway, it is very, very clear as the clarity of the, and that is in the foreground, there's really nothing more to say. The ball and the matador has become one. Hemingway keeps repeating that everything is completely clear and there is no secret whatsoever. By contrast, this is a secretive narrative, um, that flaunts his secret in our face. We don't really understand what's going on and that is the prevalence of this kind of narration.

Speaker 1:          34:37          So, um, just to refresh your memory were drawn inspiration from Frank Vamos, a classic genesis of [inaudible] and um, the moment where Foglar is highlighting and dramatizing the existence of a sacred is by way of Joe's horse. And this time is the fully dramatize moment in the sense that not only is the horse, they are not only Joel there, but everyone else is there. So this, the entire tragic chorus, uh, or maybe in this case, not completely a tragedy either, but the entire chorus is there witnessing this dramatic exchange and it is no longer an exchange between Ngo and the horse. But someone else, Joel Masa looking at him, I give, give, give. Then she began to cry. She cried hard not hiding the face, standing there in a faded wrapper looking at him and him on the hose, looking down in her, his face growing cold. Those slick looking until you loved away quake and cash came and Tajay you go onto the house, cash said, does he have grounds to West for you?

Speaker 1:          35:58          You go on. Now that night I found master named decided bed where he was sleeping in the dark. She cried a whole lot, maybe because she had to cry. So required mainly because she felt the same way about tears. She did about this seat heating herself. We're doing it, hating him because she had to. And then I knew that, I knew, I knew that as playing as part of the day I knew about do the, so is the moment when the secret is exposed and is exposed of course without thought they'd ever coming close to the very simple nature of that cigarette. Um, it is completely by way of this, the tour around Joe's horse, the way we know that there is the secret is that ad his response to a horse is nothing like what would have been a normal response to [inaudible] sun disappears and night after night, you know, people don't know where he goes.

Speaker 1:          37:13          Um, and then all of a sudden he comes back with his horse. Um, [inaudible] hood of possession amount more ways. Muse would be to stand the Alamos to half a poor ways of horses, not at all the thing to have or that anyone could have. So, um, this is a procession, um, that is inappropriate for Paul Weiss. Uh, vitamins response is what would it have been an ordinary, completely understandable responses. Let me ride a horse. So volume it is reacting as anyone would react and his response is by crying. Um, which I guess is, could still have been normal except that the response then from too is that his face is growing Cole. And then he's looking at her and the more he looks at her, the more sick looking he becomes. So that is not in the script at all. If the horse had been anything but a good event, right?

Speaker 1:          38:28          If the pause has simply been a joyous acquisition, none of this would have happened. So what is it that transforms a joy's acquisition into something that people can either cry about, I'll be very uneasy about, or something that requires some degree of confidence, which is what cash seems to be doing here is this proud mother. Um, and add a ought to be a proud mother and instead cash is talking to her as if someday to terrible had happened to her. Go on back to the house, go on now to ground is too wet for you. The solicitor, you coming from cash is also an explicable. So we can say that from every single person to overreaction of addy, the crying, the sake looking expression on Jews phase, the over illicitly or coming from cash. All of those things are things that should not be in the script but surprisingly are in the script.

Speaker 1:          39:33          And then we know that there really is something that could be named that can be identified and named. And even though, um, dow is not going to name it for us, he comes as close as he can to saying that word. Uh, so the way he tells us is that I knew that as playing on that day as I knew about do it. Hell. So right here we see a kind of bad word reproduction. Um, in terms of farmers characterization, we know about doing nails pregnancy out of wedlock first, right? And this is the thing that Dow those about is transparency with it is duly dose out of wedlock pregnancy that is being reproduced in her model. This is the kind of interesting backward reproduction like mother like daughter. Um, and in this case we know about the daughter's condition first and it's because now is exactly the same reaction now in exactly the same degree of knowledge.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Now that we know that in fact, what do we do? Dell is doing now has been done once before in the family, her mother. So a lot of things are hanging together. The fact that Joel has a very different height than can be explained. The fact that you can require the horse when nobody else in a poor work community that can be explained as well. A lot of things are falling into place with USCIS. A suspicion that's nuts just sneaking up on us. And I think that this is really why the snake is so important to father is that the discovery is knitting up on us. It is sneaking up on everyone else. This is a snake that is not, um, like the snake in, in, in Dante, the snake that takes, um, the possession of someone else. Although there's an element of this as well.

Speaker 1:          41:48          But a snake that insinuates itself into our consciousness and implore us to us, the degree of knowledge or the kind of knowledge that maybe we would prefer not to have. So this is really the very early snake, the snake that is the bearer of knowledge coming to Adam and eve, um, that, that has been involved here. Um, and it's just too clearish the case just to make everything very, very clear. Um, father now resource to another epic invention, um, bringing at a back to life. And so that she actually gets to say something. Um, and there is no other explanation other than the license, the piloting license afforded by the antics form that will allow for, uh, a completely non realistic representation of the voice of a dead person and otherwise realistic novel. But that is relative license that thought and is taking. So in a very, very strange moment, basically at the very heart of SLA dying, we see the voice of a addressing us and talking about a past moment in her life, I would think of sin as I was thinking of the clues we both wore in the world's phase of the suit inspection necessary because he was a, he and I was I to send the more other and terrible since he was the instrument or they by God who created the sin to stand defy that sin he has created.

Speaker 1:          43:28          Why waited for him in the worst waiting for him because he saw me before he saw me. I would think of him as stressed in stand here. The more beautiful since the garment which she had exchange with sin. The sand defied, um, is um, and the confession I guess as close to her confession, um, as we can gather about the paternity of jewel. Uh, but that confession about the paternity of Julio is characteristically couch in terms of a strange con of satisfaction, um, that any guests from this particular kind of affair, which is that the Garmin that her partner in sin has exchange for that sin is Ashley. All the more beautiful because it is sanctified by God. So that houses who the father is running. Um, and um, following as being tongue in cheek here, the father we figure out is probably which seal is the only likely candidate.

Speaker 1:          44:42          There's really no one else in that small community of could be the father. So they could only be one. Uh, but, um, it turns out the Faulkner naturally has taken his name, uh, from a historic figure, a fairly influential preacher. Um, 18th century. Appreciate Benjamin Franklin. Um, send them, when he would go to here with Phil, he would make sure that he will have very little money on this person because he just know that he would empty out his pockets. Uh, when he, when, when he goes around and ask for donations. And sure enough, even though he takes very little money with him, he always walks away with empty pockets after review was done. So that's a very powerful one of the most famous preachers of the 18th century. Um, and Faulkner has recreated this preacher, uh, but with a twist and SLA dying. And this is his with you.

Speaker 1:          45:33          It was his hand that bore me safely about the float that fan at me from the dangers of the waters. My horse was frightened. Am I own hearts? They only as the logs and the approved the trees pour down upon my littleness, but not my, so I knew then that forgiveness was mine. The flood, the danger behind. And as I rode on across the firm, uh, so, um, the bundling's unable to cross the soul and river, the muse in the river, one person is able to cross the river because his horse is able to cross. Um, so this is the genealogy of the horse, both as wholes and obviously also is snake as well. Full spectrum of meanings of the creatures snake. Um, uh, review to us in pieces. And that is really the nature of the narrative, right? That we don't actually get the whole picture all at once.

Speaker 1:          46:49          We see different bodily pause coming to you with the emotion of this creature. And uh, with this, um, establish, funnily establish kinship between Jews, horse and with fields cause um, in this case of very well behaved for it's not a lot like the wild west of joule was also explains why, um, with you is a minister, uh, whereas a Jewess nothing like that. Um, so it's the wireless in the offspring that actually backwards reproduces the mostly law abiding but not completely law abiding identity of the father. Um, and just to add to that, um, here is down. So then everything, and this is the clearest indication that the animal for Whitfield is also the horse on a horse. He rode out to arms stairs and came back on the hoses almost too heavy handed to emphasize this detail over and over again. I would have been completely uncalled for of, except for the fact that we really need to have a narrative genealogy for jaw. And it is a narrative genealogy that is tall Ashley. Not through, not only through a human story, not only through the monologue of, of, of, of, um, of added, um, in this epic convention, uh, of the desk speaking. Uh, but there's also a parallel at the convention of human story thread through another human creature.
