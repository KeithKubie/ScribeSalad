00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
&gt;&gt; This piece was on Google in the New Yorker
and I worked with him -- I talked with him

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.249
extensively about that piece and we've become
good friends ever after.

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.339
And that was ten years ago, I think, that
piece.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:21.650
It's kind of incredible how time flies.
Anyhow, I'm excited to welcome him back to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.050
Google.
He's obviously visited many times.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.380
But now, he's visiting us as the person we
get to interview.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.250
So the roles are a little bit reversed.
And I'm excited to welcome him to talk about

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:45.239
his new book about 'Denialism'.
And then we get to grill him and, just like

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.340
ten years ago, you got to torture me.
Now, I get my revenge.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.820
So welcome, Michael.
Please come on up and talk.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.699
Michael Specter: First time I came here, there
were less than a hundred employees.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.620
So it's kind of -- every time I come here
now, I get lost in more and more creative

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.460
ways, including today.
I just want to talk about my book and the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.941
themes in it for a little bit.
And then there will be questions, I'm sure,

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.310
and I'll be happy to answer them.
The name of the book is Denialism, and immediately

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.340
people wonder what I mean by that.
I think we've all been in denial at one point

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.970
in our lives.
Something bad happens; we can't deal with

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.890
it.
It's kind of normal.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.900
It might even be good for a little while on
an individual level.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.520
It's extremely harmful when it lasts.
And it's very deleterious to society when

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.490
we do this in an institutional way.
And I think that's what's happening in a whole

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.711
number of areas of life these days.
And I'll talk about that.

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.200
I should also first say what I didn't write
about, because that seems to interest people

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.630
too.
I didn't write about climate change and I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
didn't write about creationism -- both of
which are truly denialist issues.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.860
And why didn't I?
I went down to the Creation Museum in Kentucky

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.410
 -- which I urge you all to do -- and I kind
of ended up feeling that, if somebody wants

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.979
to believe that their ancestors rode around
on dinosaurs, there's nothing I can do to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.439
have a conversation with them that will be
of value to either one of us.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.930
With climate change, I just felt that the
preponderance of evidence is so powerful that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.060
 -- so many people have written so convincingly.
There's so much documentation -- that for

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.230
me to add a chapter about it would be kind
of like putting a feather on a mountaintop.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.030
So, while I do address those issues in the
book, they're not the things I focus on.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.670
I try to focus on things that are possibly
more daily-life activities, and lately in

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.709
the news, and that wasn't on purpose, but
one of them is vaccines.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.280
And this is an area of life that I can never
stop being mystified by, because vaccines

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.290
are the most effective public health measure
in the history of the world except for clean

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.709
water -- no debate, no argument.
41 percent of Americans say they won't take

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.709
the H1N1 flu shot or give it to their kids.
To me, this is mind blowing.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.439
So far, 11 million doses of this vaccine have
been administered.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:19.740
And I think there have been reports of two
or three serious side effects -- and that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.120
will happen.
If 11 million people drink water, there will

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.859
be a side effect.
I mean, this is the thing that people don't

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.840
ever -- you never look at the other side.
Five thousand people have died so far from

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.579
this flu -- five hundred kids.
Thousands more will die.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.189
So when you do the math -- and people almost
never do -- it's not really a difficult equation.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.129
But part of denialism is that people don't
do the math.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.290
They feel comfortable in their own intuition,
in what they think is evidence, in their own

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.319
anecdotal experience -- and it almost never
works.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.439
I was at a party a week ago, and a pregnant
woman came up to me, and said -- I had written

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.359
a story in the New Yorker, just a little thing
about the flu -- and she said, "Oh, you're

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.760
the flu guy."
Which, believe me, I've been called worse.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.970
I said, "Yes?" She said, "Well, I'm not going
to get that vaccine."

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.230
And I said, "Well, that's good.
Because you're exactly the person who should

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.060
be getting it.
So that makes perfect sense."

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.400
I said, "Why aren't you getting it?" She said,
"Well, I feel fine."

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.270
[laughter] And you know, you don't feel pregnant
until you get pregnant either.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.130
I mean, these things can't be stopped.
And I tried to talk to her and tell her that

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.390
viruses don't care if you feel fine now, but
it wasn't going to happen.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.870
Then, I got an e-mail the next day which was
more disturbing to me.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.631
It was from a college classmate of mine who
had heard me on a radio station or something.

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:47.370
And she said that some of what I wrote about
she agreed with, but she certainly wasn't

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.700
vaccinating her child against polio, because
'we don't have polio'. Cool.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.220
You know, the longest flight in the world
is shorter than the shortest incubation time

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.660
for an infectious disease.
And polio exists in the world.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.820
So, what does that mean?
If somebody in Nigeria gets on a plane -- doesn't

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.590
know he has polio, but certainly could, because
it's there -- flies to say here, goes to Google

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.020
for an interview, you can get infected.
That hasn't happened. Maybe it won't happen.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.470
It would be great if it didn't, but it's insane
to believe that it couldn't happen.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.780
And to walk away from what is really a miraculous
scientific advance, but people do it all the

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.580
time.
And it really -- it never ceases to amaze

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.470
me.
But I'm beginning to think it's fear, and

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.370
fear is just as infectious as any other virus.
And people are afraid of what they hear.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.580
They're afraid of autism with vaccines.
And it doesn't matter that there have been

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.270
3 million kids studied to see whether autism
is related to measles vaccines.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.490
And that's kind of a study you can do pretty
well, because there's a lot of kids that have

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.280
been vaccinated and a lot of kids who haven't.
And if you look at the rate at which autism

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.020
develops, you'll see it's the same progression
in either case.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.251
So how that could happen, I don't know. Is
that?

00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:19.240
What are we looking at? [laughter] Is that
competition or what?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.470
Anyway. Cool. I love -- I like technology.
Okay. [laughter]

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.640
&gt;&gt; Sorry about that.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.000
Michael Specter: Sergey, you're gone, right?
Okay, cool.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.700
I look at these issues and I just wonder what
people are thinking.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.130
And I know some of what people are thinking
makes sense.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.090
We don't have measles in this country.
People don't know what measles is.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.920
They don't know what polio is.
They don't know what smallpox is.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.990
Smallpox is gone from the world, but it killed
billions of people not that long ago.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.980
I mean, these diseases were in this country
not two generations ago but one generation

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.650
ago.
And the idea that they could never come back

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.560
 -- I'm hoping that smallpox won't come back,
because if it does, someone's making it in

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.860
a laboratory.
We can get that later -- people are just anxious

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.360
about what they don't know, and they don't
do any sort of rational thinking about things

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.110
that affect them personally.
And I find this very clearly in another area

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.490
that I write about that I think may be dear
to many people's heart in this area, which

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.700
is food.
The fight over organic food and genetically

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:32.510
engineered food is the stupidest, most ridiculous,
culture war that exists in this country.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.220
It is of absolutely no -- there's no reason
to have it.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.370
All food we eat is genetically modified food.
They didn't have cantaloupes or tangerines

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.470
in the Garden of Eden.
Over time, we have bred both animals and plants

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.900
to do the things that we want them to do.
Now, genetic engineering isn't more powerful

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.920
technology, and the idea that it's just the
same as anything else is kind of silly and

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.080
wrong.
And there are lots of problems with genetically-engineered

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.180
food, and you're probably aware with some
of them, but what are they?

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.440
One is monoculture, just like one crop taking
over a huge area.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.000
Another is heavy use of pesticide.
Synthetic chemicals.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.800
Those things are very serious and severe,
and they have kind of nothing to do with genetically-engineered

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.760
crops.
They have a lot to do with the way those crops

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.060
are treated.
All this stuff happened with conventional

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.570
crops before these crops came along.
When people start yelling at me about organic

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:38.540
food, what they often seem to be yelling about
in the end is multinational corporations,

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:45.329
deadlocks on patents on seeds, things that
you don't think are fair, like owning parts

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:49.589
of nature.
And I think all that is completely legitimate,

00:08:49.589 --> 00:08:54.149
and we should have conversations about it.
And there are amazingly effective ways to

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:58.319
prevent that from happening in the future.
But it isn't the science. Science isn't a

00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:01.930
company.
Science isn't Monsanto. Science is science.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.129
And it has worked really well since the Enlightenment
at least.

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:10.800
It has brought us so far.
A kid born in Bangladesh today lives longer

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.389
than a rich man who was born in Park Avenue
a hundred years ago.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:19.990
That, to me, is an amazing fact.
And it isn't a coincidence. It's because of

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.949
the tools we have.
And when people say, "Genetically-engineered

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:28.170
food shouldn't be used at all."
You know, a billion people go to bed hungry

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.300
every night in this world?
A billion.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.480
And in 40 years, we're going to need 70 percent
more food than we have right now.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.199
So, you guys are mathematically more gifted
than me, but it seems to me there's two ways

00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:45.930
to get more food.
You can grow more on the land that you have,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.749
or you can use more land.
If we use much more land, we're basically

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:55.490
cutting down even more rain forest than we've
already destroyed, and I don't really think

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.490
that's an approach.
Getting more, as they say, 'crop per drop'

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.420
is an approach, and it is a solution.
It is not the magic solution.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.610
But, you know, you can eat vine-ripened tomatoes.
I just had a fantastic meal here.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:14.959
It's great, but we're not in sub-Saharan Africa.
Hundreds of millions of people in the world

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:18.110
subsist on cassava.
I don't know if you guys know -- it's just

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.139
a bunch of carbohydrates.
It has no protein. It has no micronutrients.

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:29.230
It's not something you can live on.
So genetic engineers have decided to engineer

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:36.100
all the stuff you need to live on into cassava
 -- vitamin A, micronutrients, protein -- and

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.860
it's working.
It's happening. And it's not planted yet.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.230
And when they get done, there will be field
trials.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.569
But the idea that we can do this in parts
of the world that have nothing else.

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:48.670
You know, that might not be the tastiest food
in the world, but it's going to keep them

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.550
alive and it's going to make them better.
And for us to say, "This is bad" -- especially

00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:01.290
for reasons that kind of don't exist -- it
makes me, as you might sense, kind of crazy

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.379
and mad.
I just don't like to see this become an ideological

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:10.100
war, and I think it really has.
Now, there are some legitimate reasons for

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.129
that.
I think genetically engineered food kind of

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:16.290
got unleashed on the world without anyone
ever talking about it.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.390
And people tend to say the thing I just said.
It can do miraculous things, but what does

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:28.170
it really do these days?
You know, so we can factory-feed animals,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.680
shoot them with hormones, and make them sick
and make ourselves sick.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.269
It's not a pretty picture.
It doesn't have to be that way just because

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:39.589
it is that way.
You know the car industry in the United States

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:40.949
sucks.
It's terrible.

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:43.319
Should we not have cars? Or should we make
them better?

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:47.000
Should we use fuel that's clean?
I kind of think we can do that. We're already

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.389
doing it.
We need to do it more and better and we can.

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:56.700
But to walk away from science and agriculture
when so many people really cling to it, is

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:05.119
something that -- it worries me as it worries
me when we walk into a vitamin store and we

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:08.869
buy tons of vitamins.
We swallow 20 vitamins a day.

00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:13.649
We drink antioxidant formulas and elixirs
and potions and pills.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:19.699
And almost none of this is of any value whatsoever.
It's, if you want dark, you're in. It's great.

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:25.439
And there are vitamins that are important
 -- vitamin D, vitamin B sometimes, folic

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:31.509
acid for pregnant women -- but most of the
stuff that you see in your vitamin store could

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:35.850
be put in a giant bag and thrown into the
ocean and the only bad thing about that would

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.999
be that it would pollute the ocean, because
it's of no value.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:42.970
So why do we do that?
Well, I don't think it's actually totally

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.720
for stupid reasons, though I think the effect
is really damaging.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.110
Our health care system is a disaster; it costs
too much.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.790
Even those of us who are insured don't really
get what we ought to get.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.930
People don't like pharmaceutical corporations
sometimes for good reason.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.800
They charge too much; they're predatory.
Our doctors seem to be distant, remote, and

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.529
cold.
Things are bad.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:09.040
So you go into a vitamin store and everything
seems natural.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.740
And they say it's natural and all the support
your cardiovascular health and your eyes.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.519
They sell a lot of vitamins that have vitamin
A and it'll support your good vision.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.420
You need vitamin A; it's really important.
There is no person in the United States that

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.869
has a vitamin A deficiency.
We don't have that problem here.

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:28.959
We have the "too much calories, eat fat, and
hormones" problem.

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:33.860
So yes, in the developing world, we need to
deal with that, but we don't need to buy it

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.220
in, you know, the vitamin advisor across the
street.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:43.350
But you see it over and over again.
And I understand -- it's a reaction to something

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.980
that is genuinely troubling.
But what are we getting when we get those

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.990
vitamins?
We think they're natural?

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.350
I mean, do you know who makes those vitamins?
How they're regulated? What's in them? No

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.529
you don't.
Do you think those people -- we spent $28

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:59.879
billion on it last year.
You think those corporations didn't want to

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:02.279
make money?
They're doing it just because they want you

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:08.029
to feel good, whereas Merck wants you to die?
I mean, when I talk about this on the radio,

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:13.259
that seems to be the supposition.
And I did write -- the first chapter of my

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:18.220
book is on Vioxx, which was a nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory -- and I wrote it for two

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.240
reasons.
One is, I want people to realize that I'm

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.959
quite aware that there are legitimate reasons
for mistrusting authority in this country.

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.749
And the other is a more complicated reason,
which I'll discuss.

00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:35.639
Vioxx was a drug that people took for arthritis.
And it was -- at the time of its introduction

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:41.029
 -- seen as miraculous.
Aspirin works, up to a point, but causes tremendous

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:47.230
gastrointestinal distress.
Advil, the same. People have even died from

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.300
it.
It's difficult to live a life where you're

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.259
taking 40 aspirin a day.
Vioxx seemed to circumvent that problem.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:58.050
And it was, you know -- you couldn't turn
on a television set without seeing an ad.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.560
You couldn't open a magazine.
It was the most heavily-marketed drug in the

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.279
history of the United States until the little
blue pill came along.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:12.019
And you know Viagra dwarfs it in all ways.
But it turned out that the miracle wasn't

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:15.360
so fabulous, because people started dropping
dead of heart attacks.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.389
And, in the end, 55,000 Americans -- that's
an FDA estimate.

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:23.449
It could be more or less -- died as a result
of taking Vioxx.

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:26.490
And the drug was withdrawn, as you would expect
that it would be.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.629
And Merck knew this; they knew there were
cardiovascular risks.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:33.959
They didn't go out and warn people, and it's
shameful.

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:37.449
It's horrible what happened. There's no excuse
for it.

00:15:37.449 --> 00:15:41.810
But having said that, I'll say another thing.
Why is Vioxx off the market?

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:47.709
I mean, should it be off the market?
Because millions of people had a tremendous

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:53.019
benefit from that drug.
And its flaws were very easy for a doctor

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:56.019
to notice.
You're obese, you have diabetes, you have

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:59.209
cholesterol problems, you have a history of
heart disease -- these are things that you

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:04.279
can know -- you yourself, your physician.
There's no reason that a drug like that can't

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:08.170
be prescribed in the right way.
Actually, there is a reason, because in this

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.209
country, once a drug is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration, you can do whatever

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:16.019
you want with it.
You can call it a chair and sell it as furniture.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:20.279
I mean, it's ridiculous. And so, that's a
problem.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:24.679
And given that situation, the thing to do
is get rid of drugs like that.

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:30.230
But I do believe that we shouldn't be in a
country where you can't use things effectively

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.970
and intelligently.
And that's what the move to genomics is about.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.829
But it's a slow transition.
And people don't think about the other side.

00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:44.390
You know, if we regulated cars the way we
regulated drugs, then no one in this country

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.749
would be allowed to enter a car.
Absolutely no one.

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:53.540
Not only that, we kill tens of thousands of
people in cars every year.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.889
We know that we do that.
If we even lowered the speed limit by ten

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:02.050
miles, we would save five to eight thousand
lives a year. Totally known fact.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.939
But we want to get to the mall. And that's
more important.

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:09.079
So the idea that, "Yeah, we can kill them
in cars. That's fine.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.110
Because we want to go somewhere.
But we won't take any risk with the drug.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.779
If a drug kills four people, it ought to be
yanked off the market."

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:20.589
It's kind of a crazy way to think.
If every American took two aspirin right now

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.740
 -- I don't know -- three, five hundred of
us would be dead by dinner.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.899
Does that mean -- I think 19 billion aspirin
were swallowed last year.

00:17:28.899 --> 00:17:31.950
Should we not have aspirin?
I think it's a great drug.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.860
I think it's helped billions of people.
We should have it, but there are risks.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.309
And there are risks to every single thing
you do in the world.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:44.360
And people don't want to think that way.
And that's one of the vaccine issues.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.630
You don't see measles.
You just see a needle coming in, and so you

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.399
think, "Oh, my baby.
And I've heard this stuff."

00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:56.010
And it is a little daunting.
But I don't -- you know, I talk to someone

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.809
who said, "It's just that I don't want to
put a foreign substance in my body."

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.919
I mean, what do you think she does at dinner
every night?

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:08.350
Those are foreign substances. It's no different.
But people don't think that way.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.429
And they also are suspicious of authority.
And I understand that, but we need to get

00:18:12.429 --> 00:18:14.590
beyond that.
And I think we kind of need to get beyond

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:20.211
that in a hurry.
And the way that we can do that, I think,

00:18:20.211 --> 00:18:23.730
is to look ahead.
And if we look at personal genomics, if we

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.419
look at synthetic biology -- and I've wrote
about those in the book.

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:32.370
Synthetic biology, in particular, seems to
me to be an area where we can do something

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.190
we didn't do with genetically engineered food,
which is, have a conversation.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.840
I think one of the big problems with genetically
engineered food and organic food is there

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.149
are these screaming sides and nobody actually
thinks about what they're saying.

00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:48.419
Synthetic biology can do a lot of things.
It already has.

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:54.350
We've made fake versions of Artemisinin, which
is the most important malaria drug.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.750
And we'll be able to make all the malaria
medication we need in the world in one vat

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.000
in one factory and it'll be cheap and it'll
be off-patent and accessible.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.130
It's developed by Jay Keasling in Berkeley,
and it is going to be an amazing thing.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.740
Because right now, they grow it in Africa.
They grow it in Asia.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.710
It's a question of whether farming, the health
of the farmers, you know, you're dependent

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:24.019
on the sun and the rain and the wells.
This is terrific, but there are also risks.

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:26.460
And we're doing this with other things.
We're doing it with energy sources.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.159
We're going to be able to make diesel and
other fuel that can theoretically -- and actually,

00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:38.190
in real life now -- power cars without emissions
that are the things that we try so hard to

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:44.559
avoid and yet never do.
I think this is a really exciting way to deal

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.120
with climate change.
And I think we're going to have to employ

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.520
it.
It doesn't mean that we're going to solve

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.169
our problems -- with that or any single technology
or solve our food problems with one technology.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.950
But we need it.
We need science to help us.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.350
And I think the only way that people are going
to accept this in this country is to talk

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.940
about it now, because it's scary.
It is actually scary.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.419
When you start making fake organisms out of
chemicals, then all that Dr. Frankenstein

00:20:08.419 --> 00:20:12.450
stuff is actually real -- and it is.
I wrote a piece for the New Yorker a year

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:18.720
and a half ago about some scientists who were
taking extinct retroviruses that had been

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.110
extinct for, in some cases, hundreds of thousands
of years, and sort of stitching them back

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:29.120
together and bringing them back to life.
And people responded to this not in a happy

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.100
way.
Why would you do that?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.240
Well, there's a guy in New York, Eckard Wimmer,
who bought polio.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.260
He made polio out of synthetic chemicals and
was hated for it.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.010
And I trashed him in the story.
And he called me up and said, "You don't know

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.460
what you're talking about.
You're totally wrong."

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.240
Which does actually sometimes happen.
So I went up and saw him.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.570
I spent a day with him.
And he was completely right.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.480
Because what was he doing by making fake polio?
He was putting the constituent parts together

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.650
so you can make rapid vaccines against -- we're
trying to learn how to make vaccines that

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.750
you don't -- what we do now is we grow vaccines
in eggs.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.200
That's exactly the same thing we did after
World War II.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.610
I mean we have wifi here, except for some
of this technology works really well.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:18.440
We shouldn't be growing vaccines in eggs in
Pennsylvania and hoping that things turn out

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.600
okay, but we are.
And what Wimmer is doing and what a lot of

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.601
people are doing is saying, "Let's get the
constituent parts.

00:21:24.601 --> 00:21:27.190
We know what the molecules are.
We know what the proteins are.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.419
Let's put them together so we can take them
apart.

00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:34.330
Let's figure out ways to disable them."
And that's really exciting, but it's also

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.460
genuinely scary, because once you start making
things -- to take a dead virus and make it

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.059
infectious after two hundred years is not
a minor thing.

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:47.630
And I think scientists sometimes are guilty
of saying, "Hey, this is science.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.769
Let's just do it."
What, are you an idiot?

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:54.320
And you know, people need to step back and
talk about this.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.159
I say in my book -- and people call me utopian
for this -- "We should have a national conversation

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:02.260
about this in the president of the United
States should lead it."

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.559
He has town meetings about the economic crisis
and the economic crisis is real.

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:11.510
But the future of our planet isn't real?
I mean, these are very serious issues, very

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:16.980
serious theoretical solutions, and high risks.
And I think we should sit down and say, "Are

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.539
the risks worth it?
What are the benefits?

00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:22.710
How much does it cost?
What do we need to do?" We never have those

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.860
conversations in this country.
We just sort of go ahead.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.889
And often that's worked, that they just went
ahead with trains and that Internet thing

00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:34.539
and it just showed up.
But I think we're at a point now where we

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:39.029
really are doing something that makes people
uneasy.

00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:42.080
And I don't think the answer to that is not
to do it.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.250
I think it's to explain it.
And I think, when things aren't explained

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:50.559
properly, what you have is denialism.
You have people hiding in their own wishes,

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:56.260
superstitions, what makes them feel comfortable.
And usually what makes you feel comfortable

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.639
isn't actually the thing you want to do, down
the road.

00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:06.360
So I just like people to be a little thoughtful
about -- not just themselves -- but other

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.419
people.
You know, when you get a vaccine and you don't

00:23:08.419 --> 00:23:10.529
get it?
It's not just you.

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:13.000
It's not just your kid.
It's the people who go to school with your

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.360
kid.
And it's understandable to be afraid, but

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.620
you need to also look at the other side.
And we just so rarely do in this country.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.799
We so rarely think that something is anything
other than a plot that it's really getting

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.289
kind of scary.
And I think we're getting away from who we

00:23:31.289 --> 00:23:34.260
are.
And Google is the representation of who we

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.769
are.
I mean, we can do amazing things.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:41.259
And we don't want to walk away from our ability
to do that, because we're afraid of science.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:46.149
And that has happened I think.
Anyway, that's my thing.

00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:50.419
People can question me if they want.
I'm sure that others might have different

00:23:50.419 --> 00:23:55.030
views and I'd love to hear them.
So thank you.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.710
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:04.870
Michael Specter: Everyone agrees to everything
I said.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.259
This is first time in recorded history that
that that's happened.

00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:12.320
All right. Good. Bummer.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.510
Q If I could ask a question. Does this work?
So you mentioned it would be great if Obama

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:22.360
would lead a cover station on a more rational
way to deal with this country.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.460
My concern is there's a political system that
would immediately spring to force to try to

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.299
counter anything.
How do we finesse the politics to get the

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:32.299
conversation going?

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:34.880
Michael Specter: I mean, you know, it's a
good question.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.509
And this is not a minor thing, but we do have
a president now who -- I don't want to make

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:44.750
him into more than he is, but he's appointed
some really good people and scientists to

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.289
run the agencies.
He actually believes in things like evolution.

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.980
So we're moving forward in the presidential
arena.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:57.809
And I think that there are people around him
that I even know who can start having this

00:24:57.809 --> 00:24:59.809
conversation.
And yes, people will yell back.

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:02.919
They yell back about everything.
But if we don't have it, we're just being

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:05.419
drowned out.
We're being drowned out right now by people

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:10.320
who actually think that creationism is this
 -- 40 percent of the American people say

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.230
that, you know, we descended in our current
form 10,000 years ago.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.799
That scares the hell out of me -- it really
does.

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:20.370
So, how do you do that?
You educate people.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.130
And we don't do that very well.
We don't do it very well in school.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.179
One of the things -- I don't say this in my
book but -- we should teach kids statistics.

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:31.549
We don't teach them statistics.
We teach them physics and chemistry, so for

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:35.919
some people, that's useful.
I'd much rather have my 16-year-old daughter

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:40.990
be able to go like this than to do experiments
with chemistry, which is something that I

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.290
have a feeling she won't be doing down the
road.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:47.240
But we don't do it.
And it's really starting to take a toll on

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.279
our country.
You know, you can lose your edge.

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:53.380
You don't have to be the most advanced, technological
society forever.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:26:00.620
There's lots of historical examples of countries
that have been advanced and have disappeared.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.120
And that can happen to us.
And if you look at the education -- especially

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.170
math and science -- and you look at America,
say in '96, we are where we were 13 years

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:14.490
ago.
China? India? Hong Kong? Singapore?

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.240
I think Japan's good, but maybe not as good
as they were.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.970
You can't stand still, and we are.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.399
Q I share your concerns. Thank you.

00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:24.870
Michael Specter: Thanks.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.690
Q That segways really nicely into what I was
going to ask about.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:35.100
So, it sounds like you think the one of the
problems we're facing is the decline in the

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.250
attractiveness of math and science to young
people.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:47.530
Do you think that's a trend that we can reverse
in, you know, five years, ten years, twenty

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.530
years?

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.179
Michael Specter: I don't want to put a, "We
can do this in three years if we work really

00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:56.570
hard" on it.
I just know that if we make the case that

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.919
our lives are dependent upon these things
 -- and I actually think they are -- people

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:03.580
will respond.
I mean, we're not dumb in this country, and

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.519
we're really advanced and progress has defined
us.

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:11.859
And part of the problem is that we used to
believe in progress so blindly and foolishly

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:17.100
 -- and have been let down a lot -- that now,
we kind of don't believe in it at all.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.019
And I think that's sad.
But we can talk about that and get the word

00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:23.690
out there.
I actually believe that or I wouldn't have

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.690
written this.
Thank you.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.000
Q Yeah. This all moved into exactly what I
was going to ask about education and stuff

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.159
like that.
I sometimes wonder whether we should give

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:37.780
up on the current generation and just try
to engage our efforts into changing the education

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.860
of the next generation where we actually have
a better chance.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:47.240
And along those lines or even if you think
we should still pay attention to the current

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.779
generation.
I mean, you wrote a book and that's great,

00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:52.190
but I think you're preaching largely to the
choir here.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:56.799
The question is, What are your practical -- I
mean, we agree I think a lot of us with what

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:03.000
you're saying, but do you have practical suggestions?
How should we actually make a case for change?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.990
We're not all going to go off and write another
book and.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.140
Michael Specter: I hope not, because my sales
will plummet if you do.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.370
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So you know, practical suggestions?

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.370
Michael Specter: It's a really good question,
but I think that there are practical ways

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:21.649
to deal with each of these issues.
When someone tells you that they swallow antioxidant

00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:27.649
formula D and vitamin E and vitamin C and
it makes them feel better and they know it

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:29.759
does, ask them why?
Ask them what they know about it.

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:33.610
Ask them did they see the study that says
actually it makes you sicker?

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:39.019
You know, echinacea is the second most used
herb in this country.

00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:42.090
Everyone thinks if you take it, it will prevent
you from getting a cold.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.419
Actually it doesn't help, and with little
kids, it just encourages respiratory infections.

00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:52.340
So, it's going to seem silly, but I think
we just need to talk about these things.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.220
I think we need to teach them.
And I think especially, you know, you say

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.040
'preaching to the choir', I'm surprised so
much on the food issue that I think I'm preaching

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.830
to the choir and I actually feel like I need
to have cosmetic surgery and move to Honduras.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:14.220
Because you should see my e-mail.
And again, I think if people had a conversation

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:20.399
where they were told, "You know, your feelings
about multinational corporations may or may

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:24.710
not be serious and you might be right, but
that's not what this is about.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.279
This is about a technology.
And we can use a technology in any number

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:31.490
of ways just as we can use vaccines in the
third world."

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:36.370
You know, in Africa, the rate of measles is
plummeting.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:41.289
It still kills 300,000 people a year.
But the only place where it's growing is in

00:29:41.289 --> 00:29:44.320
this country and Europe.
I mean, how shameful is that?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.720
So I think these things have to be communicated
and they are.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.090
And the media and the Internet are, I think,
partially to blame at least, I have to say.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:59.309
We tend to scream at least as loudly as anyone.

00:29:59.309 --> 00:30:07.350
Q I had a friend in grad school, a doctor
in computer science and then worked at NASA

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.340
and then, last I talked to her, she's become
a doctor of homeopathy.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.440
Michael Specter: [Uh!]

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.009
Q How do you respond to that?

00:30:14.009 --> 00:30:16.240
Michael Specter: I responded. [laughter]

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.289
Q How should I respond to that?

00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:21.799
Michael Specter: I wrote about homeopathy
in my book.

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:26.279
So this is amazing.
I mean 'homeopathy' is the principle that

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:29.110
'like cures like'.
You could take like a little billionth of

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.259
a molecule of the thing that makes you sick
and dilute it and distill it and swallow it

00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:38.350
and you'll be fine.
Now, any number of studies have shown this

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.870
to be complete and utter bunkum, but it doesn't
matter to people.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.580
They still want it.
And I think sometimes they want it because

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.840
it seems real and comfortable.
And drugs don't seem real.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.710
And they make you sick.
And by the way, we've been told that, you

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.179
know, we're going to have cancer cured and
this pill will take care of that.

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:59.130
And so often medicine isn't like that.
It's more an art than a science.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.820
It doesn't banish things.
Sure, if you have strep throat, there's a

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.080
drug.
But often it's much more complicated and I

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.120
think we don't sell it that way.
And people get annoyed and then they go running

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.470
to something that seems comfortable.
Like homeopathy.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:18.030
But woe, NASA to homeopathy. That's a bad
route.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.030
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:27.250
Q So one thing you haven't talked about very
much in your talk so far is religion.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.679
Michael Specter: Yeah.

00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:37.950
Q Do you think the fact that a lot of people
are indoctrinated from early age to believe

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.490
things that aren't proved or provable affects
their take on things later in life?

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.789
Michael Specter: Yeah. I try to duck the religion
thing as much as possible.

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:44.899
But I will say this.
I don't think that religion has to be in conflict

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:47.879
with science.
And there's lots of examples, including Albert

00:31:47.879 --> 00:31:53.379
Einstein, to prove me right.
Yeah, there are fundamentalists -- Christians,

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:57.850
Jews, Muslims -- tons of people who are never
going to accept reality.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:03.390
But most people are not like that.
And I don't see why a religion -- if people

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.460
feel good about religion and it gives them
some peace, I don't see why that has to interfere

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.870
with the scientific method and talking about
repeating studies, showing how they work,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.519
showing what they do, and showing what happens
when you don't do them.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:22.499
I may be utopian, but I don't think that is
the fundamental problem.

00:32:22.499 --> 00:32:23.499
But it is something to think about.

00:32:23.499 --> 00:32:37.350
Q So my knowledge of history is not that great,
but my impression is So Europe sort of went

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:53.590
through a transition a couple of hundred years
of sort of superstition to having a method.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:33:02.059
Since then, a lot of other countries have
made that transition or are in

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:03.059
the process of transition.
Have you researched at all, How does that

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:04.059
transition happen?
You know, what's -- we have different cases,

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:05.059
because it happens in different kinds of places,
like different here than there?

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:09.409
Michael Specter: Well, it's a good question.
I think some of it is just level of education

00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:13.749
and the number of people and the percentage
of people who are educated at a certain level.

00:33:13.749 --> 00:33:17.049
But I would say this about Europe.
Yeah, they went through a transition a couple

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:19.519
hundred years ago.
I think they might be going through another

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:23.139
transition right now.
Because you say the word 'genetically modified

00:33:23.139 --> 00:33:27.029
food' in that part of the world and you better
have a suit of armor.

00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:31.379
And again, there are reasons for that because,
you know, they don't need genetically modified

00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:36.549
corn or tasteless tomatoes, but their opposition
is so profound.

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:41.450
And the thing that kills me about that is,
So you're an environmentist and what do you

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.059
want?
Less water use? Less insecticide on the land?

00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:48.460
Less energy used to get to crops?
These things can do that.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:52.789
And actually the World Wildlife Fund has,
thank God, come out and said, "Gee, maybe

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:57.649
this biotechnology stuff is okay."
But I see it going in reverse in Europe actually

00:33:57.649 --> 00:34:03.000
more rapidly than it's going in reverse here.
I don't know why they are okay with evolution

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.260
and we're not.
That's over my head -- above my pay rate.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.760
But on the other stuff I don't think -- I
do see them moving backwards.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:18.809
I see a lot of moving backwards.
Well, there may be a pendulum and that may

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:24.149
seem natural, but all I know is that, you
know, we used to die at the age of 40.

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:27.089
That was when we died.
It wasn't thousands of years ago.

00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:32.069
It was 125 years ago, or 150 years ago.
And now, we die at the age of 80.

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:36.569
My grandfather died when he was 62, and that
was about 40 years ago.

00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:40.970
And it was sad, but nobody said, "Oh, my God.
He was only 62," because you were supposed

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.329
to die when you're 62.
Well now, you're supposed to die when you're

00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:49.099
82.
And people say when someone dies at 62, "Gee,

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:52.929
he got robbed of, you know, a bunch of life."
That's just in one generation.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:58.319
That isn't 500 years.
So the advances we've made are just incredible.

00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:03.170
And yet, we seem to be sliding backward in
the way we approach them, and, I think, part

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:11.730
of it is we take for granted what we have.
But for what it's worth.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.309
Anything else?
Okay.

00:35:14.309 --> 00:35:21.630
Go forth, plant genetically engineered food,
