some of them might allow life like our

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
some of them might allow life like our

universe some of them may not allow life
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.430
universe some of them may not allow life
and our universe is just one lucky draw

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
and our universe is just one lucky draw
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440

in which case we are accidental we are

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570
in which case we are accidental we are
 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.640
in which case we are accidental we are
an accidental universe and so the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
an accidental universe and so the
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.210
an accidental universe and so the
historic mission of of science and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
historic mission of of science and
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.960
historic mission of of science and
especially physics to show that that we

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
especially physics to show that that we
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.690
especially physics to show that that we
are our universes is the unique result

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
are our universes is the unique result
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.880
are our universes is the unique result
of a certain set of fundamental

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
of a certain set of fundamental
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.540
of a certain set of fundamental
principles that historic mission is no

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
principles that historic mission is no
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.930
principles that historic mission is no
longer feasible it's no longer possible

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
longer feasible it's no longer possible
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.050
longer feasible it's no longer possible
this conclusion makes theoretical

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
this conclusion makes theoretical
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.310
this conclusion makes theoretical
physicists extremely unhappy because it

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320
physicists extremely unhappy because it
 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.650
physicists extremely unhappy because it
means that a lot of our mission is an

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660
means that a lot of our mission is an
 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.550
means that a lot of our mission is an
illusion but that may be the way nature

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
illusion but that may be the way nature
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.920
