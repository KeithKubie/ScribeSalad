00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.785
This episode is supported by Hims

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:05.760
Your body is cool and all, but have you ever wondered how much

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.500
is it all worth? Let's start with selling your body

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.375
one piece at a time. Sperm? You can make $35

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.465
to $135 a shot, with some banks paying donors

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:17.515
$1500 for a one-year commitment,

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.295
the criteria being you are healthy, tall, young, and educated.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.355
The price for an egg, however, is much

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.915
greater at $10 000 and is likely

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.000
due to the more invasive 20-minute procedure

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
to retrieve eggs that can put you at a risk of infection or even

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.660
endometriosis. The protein rich part of your blood

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.620
aka plasma can be worth $50

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.740
However some of the wealthy and aging among us are paying

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.960
$8 000 a session to be infused with young blood.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.740
Though evidence is in its early stages, the "fountain

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.720
of youth"/"young blood" hypothesis

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.440
comes from research at Stanford University where old mice

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:55.335
injected with plasma from umbilical cords of newborn

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.220
human babies improved the old mice's performance

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
on memory tests. Weird. The price of

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.880
an organ transplant can be extremely expensive with more than

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.535
116 000 Americans waiting to receive

00:01:06.535 --> 00:01:09.295
a transplant. A kidney transplant is over $400 000

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.440
while a heart can be $1.4M.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
That is, however, the cost of the transplant surgery

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.540
and not how much you would make selling your organs.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.920
Though illegal in the US and most other nations, the organ

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.000
black market does exist. Based on reports by the World Health Organization,

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.775
a kidney in India can go for

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:29.815
$20 000; in China, $40 000;

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.985
but in Israel, you can make as much as $160 000

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:36.015
Not willing to part with,

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:38.715
well, a part of you? Try selling your hair! A real

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.645
wig can cost $800 to $3 000

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.660
It's clear that some body parts are worth a lot, but some people

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:47.200
have really put a price tag on their parts

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.705
Sources state that Rihanna's legs are insured for

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:52.595
$1 000 000, but that's nothing compared to Cristiano

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.580
Ronaldo, whose legs are $144 million.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.600
Then there are the services your body provides. Right now,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.000
you're breathing. You exhale 11 000L a day

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.755
and that means you can blow up the tires for about

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.955
275 cars. Your sneeze

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.940
has a wind speed of 4.5 meters per second

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.075
which is enough wind to power a small electric wind turbine.

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.735
Your cough is even more powerful at 22.4 meters per second

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.845
and could power a utility scale windmill.

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:21.885
Your farts? If your diet is rich in beans, you can

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.865
produce 68 mL of carbon dioxide in a single day.

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:27.765
If you store these (we won't ask you why)

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:30.795
but if you did, in 40 years you would have an approximate

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:33.855
metric ton of CO2. That's a lot

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.975
of gas, but it would only be worth $220.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.935
Meanwhile, your brain can store 100 tb

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.105
of information. The retail value of a hard drive that big

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.340
is upwards to $2 500.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.565
Then, there are elements that make up you. Though we're made

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.605
mostly of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, there are some

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.705
very valuable trace elements that contribute to your design like

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:57.895
copper, gold, and even uranium. However,

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.935
if you added this all up, your elemental dollar amount

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.095
is close to... one dollar.

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:06.475
A huge thank you to Hims for sponsoring today's video and giving all

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.420
of our viewers a month's trial to their comprehensive hair kit for only $5.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.700
Hims is a brand that offers men high quality medical products

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.420
for the things that we sometimes don't talk about

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.580
like sexual well-being, hair loss or acne

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.620
But actually 26% of people who experience erectile dysfunction are

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.700
under the age of 40.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.420
Your privacy is taken completely seriously and they have really

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.680
affordable deals on medical great products, because they use the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920
generic equivalent instead of the name brand.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.720
They use personalized recommendations for prescription and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560
non-prescription products with advice from real doctors.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.000
All you have to do is head to forhims.com/asaphair to get a virtual

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.680
visit with a doctor and a month trial of the comprehensive hair kit for just $5.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.460
We'll see you next week for a new science video.
