00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.680
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Expect you've
heard them three times already,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.070
and in any case, I've
forgotten them all.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.680
My name is Jonathan
Yardley and I am here--

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.000
&gt;&gt; We can't hear.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: --
ostensibly from the Washington Post

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.200
but I left in a long time ago.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.720
About 18 years ago, my wife and
I were living on Capitol Hill

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900
with my stepdaughter who
was working at the time

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.810
at the National Geographic.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.820
And one day Laila said to us,
"Could I bring a friend home

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.120
from the office for dinner?"

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.420
And we said, "Sure."

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.720
&gt;&gt; We can't hear you.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.020
&gt;&gt; We can't hear.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.320
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: I'm afraid
that that's a technical problem

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.190
that someone else is going
to have to cope with.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.300
If I shout does that help?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.900
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: OK.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.150
Our-- My stepdaughter was
working at National Geographic

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.760
and one day asked if she could
bring a friend home for dinner.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.060
And we said, "Sure."

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.720
So the next day at dinnertime,
this lovely young woman shows

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.870
up with our-- my stepdaughter
Laila, and my wife

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.560
and I were immediately
enchanted with her.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.340
And she is still lovely
and young and enchanting.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.800
But now she is one of the most
respected, most accomplished

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.310
and most successful writers

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.040
of serious nonfiction
in the United States.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.390
Candice, it's very
good to see you again.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.690
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: It's
very good to see you.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.510
Thank you.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.010
[ Applause ]

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.470
And could I just say just very
briefly what an incredible honor it

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.690
is to sit here with Jonathan
Yardley, who all of you know is

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.970
such a huge figure in
the world of journalism

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.210
and in the world of books.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.000
And if you-- If by some crazy
chance you don't know his work,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.780
I urge you to go out and find it,
he's really absolutely brilliant.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.670
So it's very humbling to me,
and I should be interviewing him

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.790
because he's a much more
interesting figure than I am.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.000
So, anyway, I just wanted to--
and thank you [inaudible].

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.290
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Flattery
will get you everywhere.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.050
Candice, so we will get over
to Winston Churchill and "Hero

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.320
of the Empire" soon enough.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.470
We'll have a couple of
questions about how you got

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.830
to this point in your life.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.740
You were at National Geo
for what, four, five years?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.040
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Six years.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.340
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Six years.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.230
National Geo has a reputation
for being a very tightly,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.570
if not severely ended publication.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.570
You were an editor
and you were a writer,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.320
what influence did
your years there have

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.560
on your own evolution as a writer?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.890
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, I always say

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.410
that my real education actually
happened at National Geographic.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.980
I learned so much about
storytelling, about the fact

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.960
that the world is full
of fascinating people,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.390
fascinating events and stories.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.560 position:56%
But most of all, I learned about
research and I learned that you need

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.320
to dig deeply, you need to
take the time to understand it,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.870
and you need to find the people
who really know the subject

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.750
that you are going to look into.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.910
You know, at National Geographic,
you could be working on something

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.690 position:56%
about meerkats one day and then
something about a river another day.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.690
So it really fluctuated.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.820
And so-- But the one
consistent thing throughout is

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.940
that there's always somebody
who knows the subject

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.440
and knows it really, really
well and have spent most of his

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.760
or her life studying it and
you need to find that person

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.210
and make him your friend.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.760
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: When
and how did it come to you

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.070
that you should try to write
what became "The River of Doubt".

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.370
You were young.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.410
You were not a trained historian.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.240
The subject involved
travel to a dangerous place,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.900
dealings with languages
other than your own.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.920
Tell us about the challenges
and apprehensions

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.050
that confronted you
when you started out.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.160
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: So I first
heard the story, I was having lunch

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.810
with a friend of mine, James
Chase, who wrote the book "1912".

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.110
Did you know?

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.570 position:56%
And a really-- an extraordinary man,
and this is the election, you know,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.270
the Bull Moose election
where Roosevelt tried

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.100
to regain the presidency and lost.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.060
And he said, "Have you heard about
this trip that Roosevelt took

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.370
in the Amazon after that election?"

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.080
And I had read about Theodore
Roosevelt, I was interested in him.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.930
But because it's after his
active political career,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.490
it was sort of glossed over.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.000
And I started researching it,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.930
actually went back to
National Geographic.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.620
They have a great library there,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.570
and then went to the
Library of Congress.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.860
And I was stunned because, you
know, there is murder, drowning.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.190
You know, they left the
murder and the rainforest.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.830
Roosevelt nearly took his own life.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.130
It's set in the Amazon, the
richest ecosystem on earth,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.100
something I would love
to write about.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.600
And so, I was just
hooked right away.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.870
But it is daunting to take
on Theodore Roosevelt,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.830
to take on the Amazon, but--

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Take on a book.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.570
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Right.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.820
To take on a book, exactly.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.920
But I was really excited about it
because I knew that to a writer,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.300
this is just a gift, it
had so much to work with.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.360
And I, thanks to my years
at National Geographic,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.880
I knew how to do research.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.210
That was the only thing
that I was confident about.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.830
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: But you,
you went to the Amazon, right?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.130
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: I did.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.100
I did. I went to this river,
which is still incredibly remote.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.150
I did some research in Rio and
then I went to this little town

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.270
in northwestern Brazil
called Porto Velho.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.090
I rented a plane, I hired a
pilot, and I flew for hours

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.710
over unbroken rainforest,
horizon to horizon and I--

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.550
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: OK, now this
raises the question, how did you go

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.740
to get the money to do that?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, I had an advance.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.100
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: You did.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.400
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.700
So, I--

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: From Doubleday?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.300
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Yeah, from Doubleday.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.600
So, I've gotten an agent.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.900
And in fact James Chase
sent my proposal

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.300
to his agent, very generous man.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.790
Unfortunately, he passed away
right before the book came

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.560
out which was really
difficult for me.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.940
But anyway, so Doubleday gave me
this great advance you get kind

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.240
of in three parts.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.990
One part, you know, when you
sell it, one part when you turn

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.710
in the manuscripts, and
one when it comes out.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.870
So, I had that money and
I-- that's how I used it.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.170
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Well,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.840
I would have thought you would
have flown the plane yourself.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.730
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Nope,
that was not a possibility.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Well, I say
that because in "River of Doubt"

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.510
as in your other two books,
you're incredibly generous

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.930
in your acknowledgements.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.550
You seem to deal with
a great many people

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.360
and travel to a great many places.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.050
You seem to be endlessly curious,
unafraid-- afraid of nothing.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.460
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, that's not true.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.550
I'm actually-- I have a lot of
fears but I think my fears are sort

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.500
of shadowed by my interests and--

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.800
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
Did you go down into a--

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.820
Did you go down a mine
in South Africa?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.780
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: I went
to where the mine was.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.320
It's now-- The colliery
is closed now

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.710
but there's the hole where it was.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.010
Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.080
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: So far you've
written about Teddy Roosevelt,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.010
James A. Garfield and
Winston Churchill.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.690
What, if any, common elements
drew you to their stories?

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.990
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
So, what interest me,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.340
and we were talking
about this earlier.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.200
I loved to read biographies,
but as a writer,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.220
I like to tell a tighter story,
a more sort of personal story

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.480
where I can spend five years really
focusing and digging in deep.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.200
And I-- I'm looking for a story
that I hope is eliminating

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.110
about the person and about
the time in which they live.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.020
And specifically what interest me,
I think that often when we look

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.160
at history, we're kind of drawn

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.510
to the big public moments
of triumph or of infamy.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.260
But what interest me are the
more private moments of struggle

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:07.000
when someone is sick like
James Garfield or terrified

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.890
like Theodore Roosevelt, or
desperate like Winston Churchill,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.050
and searching for a
foothold and uncertain.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.200
And I think it's in those moments,
and it's true for all of us.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.260 position:56%
This is something that we all
share, that we share with these sort

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.860
of great historical
figures is that that's

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.830 position:56%
when you're true nature is revealed.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.650
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
And quite specifically,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.630
what drew you to Winston Churchill
and his role in the Boer War?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.790
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: So I had
heard the story 25 years ago.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.770
My husband was a journalist for
the New York Times for years

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.840
and he actually began his career
in South Africa, covering the ANC,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.720
the African National
Congress in the early '80s.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.660
And when I met him 25 years ago,
he mentioned to me, he said,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.280
"Did you know that Winston
Churchill was a prisoner of war

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.020
in South Africa and
that he escaped?"

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.780
And I thought, "You are kidding me.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.140
How do I not know this?"

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.140
And so it just stayed with
me all of these years.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.670 position:56%
And after I turned in the manuscript
for my second book, we went to lunch

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.340
and he said, "Do you have any
ideas for your next book?"

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.830
And I said, "You know,
I would love to write

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.210
about Winston Churchill
and the Boer War."

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.930
And he said, yes.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.410
And so, it just went from there.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: I wondered
reading your wonderful book,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.680
with its story of Britain's
nearly disastrous war

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.650
in a place that's scarcely
understood at all.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.820
I wondered if Vietnam War was
somewhere in the back of your head

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.210
when you were writing that.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.420
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: To be honest,
nothing was really in the back

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.090
of my head and I can
see the connection but--

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.390
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
Well, it was in the back

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.690
of mine when I was reading it.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.990
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Was it?

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.290
I could absolutely
see that connection.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.590
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: But
I'm of that generation.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.890
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.190
I can see it.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.530
But to be honest-- So, you know,
I-- As you know, I have three kids,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.280
I live in Kansas City, I have
this very normal day to day life

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.490
of laundry and dinner plans and
stuff, but I have an office outside

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.130
of my home, and when I go into my
office and I close the door, I--

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.430
It's like a time machine.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.010
You know, I literally feel
like I'm going back in time

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.680
and I just immerse myself in
the documents that I've gathered

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.840
and the pictures and maps
and things like that.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.080
And I'm really only thinking
about this moment in history.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.380
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
Speaking of time,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.960
you seem to be very strongly
drawn to the late 19th

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.980
and early 20th centuries.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.280
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: I do.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.380
I think that's fair.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.150
I didn't set out that way.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.030
I didn't think I-- this is what I
want to write about and I never do.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.770
But I do find it very evocative.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.580
You know, I do feel like I can
really, you know, that time period,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.670
you can see it, you can
smell it, you can taste it.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.550
I mean it's-- And-- But especially
what interests me in it is

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.680
that there is so much
primary source material.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.810
You know, it's just this
enormous wealth of letters

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.050
and diaries and newspaper articles.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.880
And especially for the
kind of writing that I do

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.460
with narrative nonfiction,
you have to have that.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.290
And you have to have not like a
lot or not even a huge amount,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.690
but you have to be drowning in it.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.990
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.380
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: And there are
certainly times when I'm working

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.260
on a book and the research takes me
most of the time that I'm working

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.940
on a book and I feel like
good God, I will never get

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.240
through all of these, you know.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.870
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Well, I have
done projects much less ambitious

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.320
than yours, but they're-- have
that wealth research material.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.550
Of course there is the problem
of choosing what to use.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.140
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
That's right, that's right.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.090
But I would be interested
to see if you agree

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.170
but I think that-- And
most of it I don't.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.030
Actually, you have
to whittle it down

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.820
and you have to be tough about it.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.540
But I feel like all of that
kind of informs, you know,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.920
me and I hope the reader in
the book, and because you have

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.070
to truly understand it before
you can begin writing about it.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.430 position:56%
So, whether or not it actually makes
it into the book, it does in a sense

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.610
that I understand this event
much better because of it.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.200
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: One
thing about the late 19th

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.610
and early 20th centuries,
Churchill [inaudible] in his memoir

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.440
"My Early Years" is that
it's really a lost world.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.640
It's the period when the
world began to change

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.180
in incredibly dramatic ways,
even more than it's changing now

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.450
because you literally went
from the horse and buggy

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.750
to the car to the airplane--

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.050
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Right, right.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.350
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
-- in that period.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.650
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Right, and
that's another thing actually

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.070
that interest me about because
the world was changing so quickly

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.140
in every conceivable way.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.950
But also our knowledge
of the world, you know,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.050
this is sort of the gilded age
of exploration, you know, and--

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.280
And so that too is
absolutely fascinating

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.620
and Churchill was right
in the middle of that.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.920
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.930
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: He's right on
the cusp of this incredible change,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.270
and it's fascinating to
see it through his eyes.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.080
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: A couple
of things that are connected,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.580
you write as Churchill escaped
the Boer prisoner of war camp

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.670
and faced dangerous
challenges, quote here,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.610
would be a grand adventure, an
exploit of a most romantic kind.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.290
The notion of British
ideas of wars as--

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.420
war as romance is a strong
undercurrent in your book.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.890
And William Manchester in his
introduction to Churchill's memoir

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.150
of "My Early Years" says that
his experiences in India and then

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.310
in South Africa led him
to see "the glorification

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.190
of war for the fraud it was".

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.010
Do you agree with that judgment?

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.310
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah, I do.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.790
It's-- You know, at that time, the
British Empire was huge, you know,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.300
ruled 450 million people,
a quarter of the population

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.410
and they were spread
all over the world.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.610
And so they were spread very thin.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.880
You know, they are constantly
putting down, putting down revolts.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.200 position:56%
But to them, you know, these little
colonial wars that they would fight,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.520
it was all about gallantry,
you know, and being dashing

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.660
and they hated losing
their red coats.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.010
You know, they thought the khakis
made them look like bus drivers

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.300
and they were still even, you know,
for the Boer War, when it began,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.270
they were still fighting in
these perfect precise lines.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: So the Boer War
really was a prelude to World War I.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.330
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
It absolutely was.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.900
It was the beginning of modern
warfare and I think, you know,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.210
not that many Americans especially
know much about the Boer War

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.080
but it was some of the
first guerilla fighting,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.190 position:56%
it was the first concentration
camps, the modernization of weapons,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.610
and all of those things
that the British Army going

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.440
in was completely different from
the British Army coming out.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.300
And it prepared them
for World War I.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.600
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.010
You're right really splendidly
about the Boers people whom most

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.640
of us know are about
whom we know very little.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.860
Is the Boer presence in South
Africa still very strong?

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.160
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Well, they--

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.800
obviously the prelude to the
Afrikaners and fortunately,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.230
things are changing a lot.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.190
You know, the Boers
were interesting people.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.280
They were very independent,
they're very religious,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.210
and they were unabashedly racist.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.290 position:56%
And, you know, that's sort of what--

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.210
And you may have heard
of the great track or--

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.730
and the 1835 they moved from
the Cape hundreds of miles

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.050
into the interior and that was
set up primarily by the fact

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.880
that two years earlier the British
Empire had abolished slavery.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.560
And so even though the British
Empire promised people in Africa,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.060
native Africans and the Indian
population that was living there,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.230
that as soon as they won the war,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.850
things would change
and be better for them.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:48.640 position:56%
As we all know, that took much
longer than anyone would have hoped.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.590 position:56%
And so, of course, there is still
an Afrikaner presence but, you know,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.520
obviously Nelson Mandela was
a huge breaking point for that

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.820 position:56%
and things have changed quite a bit.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.660
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Tell us
a little bit about Churchill.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.700
I-- he did change his--

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.050
The experience in South Africa did
change him, but I kept thinking

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.650
as I was reading your book
that a perfectly apt title

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.150
for it would have been
"Naked Ambition".

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.450
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.750
Absolutely.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.830
He was just a bundle
of burning ambition.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.000
That was the one description

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.290
of him that's absolutely
true throughout his life.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.590
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
You think that that--

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.480
you think that that is traceable
to his feelings about his father?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.040
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Some
of it I think it was--

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Because, you
know, naked ambition in well to do--

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.530
of course they weren't rich in
the British-- but prominent.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.040
Naked ambition is not that
really all that competent

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.400
in that particular class.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.780
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
It's looked down upon.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.080
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Yeah.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.380
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
It's looked down upon.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.680
And I've always felt that
that was the American in him.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.970
His mother, the beautiful socialite
Jennie Jerome was American.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.050
And he-- and in fact he told his
mother, this is a pushing age

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.350
and we must push with the best.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.650
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right, right.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.950
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: And so
he-- She was very connected.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.110
She had all these powerful
men who adored her.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.350
And so he was always having
her, you know, help me out here,

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.430
have this person get
me an assignment.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.330
Because he was always
throwing himself into wars

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.750
because he thought that's the
best way for me to win fame

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.290
and propel myself to
political power.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.600
And he called it the glittering
gateway to distinction.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.900
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.320
You quoted the famous remark
by his first love, Pamela--

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.620
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Plowden.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.920
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: -- Plowden.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.720
Who said, when you first meet
Winston and you see all the things

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.830
that are wrong with him, and
once you get to know him,

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.540
you see all the things
that are right with him.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.840
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.140
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: What
was wrong, what was right,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.870
and as you came to know him?

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.240
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, so what was wrong,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.970 position:56%
he's obviously not only ambitious
but incredibly, incredibly arrogant.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.270
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.570
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: And that
is probably to throughout--

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.870
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
And self-indulgent.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.170
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Through--
And throughout his life.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.210
It was absolutely all
about, about him.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.890
In fact, I found it entertaining
because again and again and again

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.390
in letters and journals and
different newspaper articles,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.440
people would say you know

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.580
that Winston Churchill,
I cannot stand the kid.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.760
He's going to be prime minister
one day but he drives me crazy.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.060
And--

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.020
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: A very
amusing, a very amusing story

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.450
that she tells us while
he was in prison

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.200
in South Africa, he
ordered a tweed suit.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.500
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.800
Exactly, yeah.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.100
To look-- and look like--

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.010
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: And he
went to South Africa with what?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.990 position:56%
Cases of champagne and whiskey and--

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.460
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Yeah, and his valet and,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.580
you know, 10-year-old whiskey.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.380
Right. So, he-- You know,
he's willing to risk his life

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.390
but he doesn't-- he doesn't want
to be uncivilized while he's at it.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.620
But what was interesting about him
to me at this point in his life is

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.090 position:56%
that if you look at pictures of
him, you almost don't recognize him.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.360
So obviously when we think
of Winston Churchill,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.390
we think of the older ones
and Churchill during war

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.770 position:56%
and he is overweight and he is older

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.830
and he's got his cigar
and his whiskey.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.690
And this one, he is
young and he has red hair

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.360
and he is sort of energetic.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.910
And he is the one throwing
himself into war.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.780
But inside, inside he was already
the Winston Churchill we know

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.100
and it's fascinating to read the
letters that he wrote at that time.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.380
And there was one in particular
that he wrote to Pamela Plowden.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.440
So he ran for parliament before
the Boer War and he lost.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.900
But during the election, and he
is loving it, he's loving all

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.360
of these opportunities
to be on a stage.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.740
And he writes to her, he says, "You
know, I don't know what's going

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.040
to happen with the election.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.250
I don't know what the
outcome will be.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:38.090
But with every speech I give,
I feel my growing powers."

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.760
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Something
you don't go into in the book

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.030
because it really occurs after
the period that you covered,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.070
what happened between
him and Pamela?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.190
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: So, this
is a great story actually

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.490
because he was in love with her.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.870
She was this beautiful young woman.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.550
He had met her actually in India

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.060
when he was there fighting
and British India.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.560
And she was sort of the toast
of London when she went back.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.290
And so she had many admirers.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.250
But he was in love with her
and he wanted to marry her

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.700
but her father wouldn't let her
marry him because he didn't think

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.110
that Churchill would
amount to anything.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.210
[ Laughter ]

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.520
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Finally,
Candice, before we turn this

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.540
over to questions from the floor,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.550
could you say a few words
about "popular history"?

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.540
In his favorable notice of
your "Hero of the Empire",

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.160
a reviewer for the Wall Street
Journal last week describes you

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.760
as "a smooth riding
popular historian".

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.230
I guess that was a compliment.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.860
But the phrase "popular
history" has always seemed to me

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.400
to be slightly pejorative and
condescending, even though much

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.820
of the best history now being
written these days is being done

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.500
by non-academics, Max
Hastings, Antony Beevor,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.330
David McCullough and yourself.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.580
I'm sure you're pleased
to be put in such company,

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.450
but do you ever feel defensive
about being "popular"?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.590
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: I
don't-- You know, I--

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.570
To be honest, I feel
so incredibly fortunate

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.990
to be able to do what I do.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:06.350
Every day I go to work, I think, I
can't believe that this is my job.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.560
You know, my job is to read
most of the time and to dig

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.050
into these fascinating-- at
least to me fascinating stories.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.620
And, you know, I know
a lot of historians.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.830
I read a lot of academic
histories and I respect them.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.130
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.430
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
It's just not what I do.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.970
And I hope that it's actually
a collaborative thing.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.770
You know, I hope that
there are people who--

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.260
And a lot of people I've
met, you say, you know,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.980
I thought I hated history.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.120
I was never interested in history.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.420
And then I read something
by David McCullough

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.290
or Antony Beevor and I was hooked.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.120
And a lot of times they say, and
it made me want to know more.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.070
And so then I started
to read more deeply.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.830
And I-- So I hope that in a way
there's a conduit for people

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.630
who think that they don't
like history to realize--

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:55.080
Actually they do and there
are these fascinating stories

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.630
that they will absolutely love.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.930
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Well,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.100
the so called popular historians
have also stepped into a gap

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.850
that has been left by the
decline of narrative history

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.610
in the academic departments.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:12.680
And there are various theories
about the cause of that.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.710
But as the academic historians
dig more and more deeply

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.810
in the very specialized
areas often with political

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.410
or etiological patents to model,
a field is really left wide open

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.710
for people who tell stories.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.010
Yeah.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.310
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Tell stories, right.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.610
And that's what I love to do.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:29.910
Yeah. I agree.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.210
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: There
are microphones in the middle

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.040
of each aisle, I believe.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.330
And you're welcome to come up and
ask Candice anything you'd like to.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.170
You were first, so you
get the first question.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.470
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.770
Hi.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.700
&gt;&gt; Well, being a-- part of the
time at least I teach history

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.430
and other things in high school.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.260
I appreciate your books
because they are colorful.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.240
You know, history to
me is very exciting

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.660
and when you take colorful figures
or compelling historic figures

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.950
like you've written about that
you've had a lot-- quite a bit.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.330
Now when dealing with
Churchill and the Boer War,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.690
of course one of the
primary source is going

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.080 position:56%
to be a lot of what Churchill wrote.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.850
But I always find that he
exaggerates things and he likes

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.340
to put himself in the best light.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.100
So, how did you deal with the
challenge of dealing with that?

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.690
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Well, you know,
the nice thing is that for most

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.420
of the part, the time,
he wasn't alone when he--

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.980 position:56%
So, the way he is captured for those
of you who don't know, he was very--

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.430
So he went to the Boer War
to cover it as a journalist.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:32.060
He was on a-- very soon after he
arrived, he was on an armored train

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.070
that was attacked by the Boers.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:39.040
And so his good friend, Aylmer
Haldane, had invited him along.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.950
He was actually in
command of the train.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.020
Invite him along and he was
there and many other men,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.060
including the Boers who
were attacking them.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.200
And so I have their
accounts of it as well.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.910
And the same thing when he was in
the POW account, the other men.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:58.290
So, there almost always-- and
even when he was on the run,

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:02.290
he hid in this coal mine shaft
with his white rats for three days.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.790
The men who helped him also
wrote about it and so--

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.090
And they really did corroborate.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.530
The only thing that I
found that he got wrong

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.370
and he was very insistent
about this.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.140
So he-- The man who
organized the attack

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.930
on this train was a man named
Louis Botha, and you may know,

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.400
he later became the first
prime minister of South Africa.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.110
And he was a very young,
charismatic, exciting general.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.510
And they became friends
later in life.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.880
And Churchill always insisted

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.010
that it was Botha personally
who had captured him.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.840
And then later, Churchill's
son started researching.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.910
He was writing a biography of
his father and he said, you know,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.910
I've done the research and I don't
think it could have been Botha's.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.950
Just it's impossible that it was
Botha who personally captured you.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.280 position:56%
And Churchill said it was, you know.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.810
End of discussion.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.180
And-- But it wasn't--
But Botha was there.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.280
Botha organized it, Botha saw
everything and talked about it,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.490
but that's the main that
I think is just not true.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.090
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Thank you.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.390
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Sir.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.690
&gt;&gt; This is a more of a general
historical question in terms

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.860
of your writing and hearing about
how you decide what you're going

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.190 position:56%
to use in your research and what you
don't use when you do your research.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:29.920
How do-- How do historical
writers avoid revising history

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.220
to their own liking?

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.350
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
I'm sorry, they avoid--

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How do you avoid revising history

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.610
to your own personal
opinions about the things?

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.870
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Well, I do
a lot of research, you know,

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.680
and I don't come at it
sort of with an opinion.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.120
I really don't-- So,
for instance my--

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.580
I wrote a book about James Garfield

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.250
and I honestly did
come to admire him.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.290
But I didn't even set out wanting
to write about James Garfield.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.980
I was wanting to write
about Alexander Graham Bell,

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.680
and I found out that he invented
something called an induction

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.480
balance to try to find
the bullet in Garfield.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.920
And I thought, huh, I wonder what
James Garfield was like, you know,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.750
he was killed so early
on to his first term

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.940
and he's largely been forgotten.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.290
And so I start researching
him and he was extraordinary.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:23.010
He's absolutely brilliant, he
was kind, he was instrumental

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.640
in bringing about black suffrage.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.050
He was just a decent, modest human
being and I was impressed with him.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.790
But I didn't start out thinking
I want to make people think

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.540
that he is this extraordinary man.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.710 position:56%
I took him as I found him and that's
what I try to do with all my books.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.160
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: I
should-- I might interject.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.420
I know that what he is
complaining about just to--

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.920 position:56%
not to pick on one person but Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr. in his first--

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.100
first in his multivolume
incomplete history

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.490
of the Roosevelt administration,
Franklin Roosevelt,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.950
and then in his various writings
on John Kennedy was writing

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.360
from a very distinct ideological
point of view and was--

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.290
and may have been for-- may
have been bending history

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.830
to suit his ideology.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.130
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Sure,
sure, which it does happen.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.580
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: And
so it does happen, yeah.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.380
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Absolutely, of course, it does.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.680
Yeah.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.980
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Yeah.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. So my question is actually
about "Destiny of the Republic".

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.650
I loved it.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.420
And I came away after reading
it thinking that we missed

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.620
out on a potentially
great president.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.030
So, I just wanted to
hear your thoughts

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.990
on if Garfield had
not been assassinated,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.370
what type of president do
you think he would have been

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.500
and would he have been
different than maybe some

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.520
of those other string of
19th century presidents.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.600
I agree. I believe that he
would have been one of our--

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.920
one of our great presidents.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.810
And I think that he was an
inspiration really to the country

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.630
because he had come from
such poverty and he seem

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:59.140
to bring the country together in
a way that was a sharp contrast

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.790
from what happened after
Lincoln's assassination,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.830
or really divided the
country even more.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.510
And it's because so
many people admired him

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.010
and so many people have
put so much hope into him.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:15.060
And as I said, he was a very
progressive thinker for that time.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.820
He-- And if you can imagine it,
didn't even want to be president,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.300
was forced, shoved
into this situation.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.970
And so I think that because of
that, he was uniquely powerful

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.700
because he wasn't beholden
to anyone.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.510
You know, he hadn't
made any promises,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.450
he hadn't made any sacrifices
because it's not something he,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.620
you know, he hungered for.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.710 position:56%
And it's-- he used to call it the
presidential fever and he saw it all

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.500
around him because he had been
in Congress for almost 18 years.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.070
So I do think that would have made
him a uniquely powerful president

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.370
had he lived.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.500
And I do think it was quite
a loss to the country.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.760
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: I told Candice
when we talked before that I came

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.290
at the end of "Destiny of the
Republic" with a tremendous sense

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.110
of loss that this man
never had his opportunity

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.640
to be the president
he could have been.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.940
Yeah.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.240
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Thank you.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.980
&gt;&gt; You made a brief reference
to the British policy

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.120
of concentration camps in the
Boer War, which was really one

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.180
of the most shameful episodes
in the British Empire's history,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.870
particularly its impact
on women and children

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.030
and mother and noncombatants.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:32.890
Did Churchill ever acknowledge that
or did that affect him in any way?

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.950
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Well,
it-- what affected him--

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:38.370
and I don't know this but--
was his own imprisonment.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.670
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Right.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.260
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: And
it affected him deeply.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.640
And he never forgot it.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.130
And even though it was completely
on the other end of the spectrum

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.850
from the concentration camps
and just for those of you

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.990
who don't know, so
the British had gotten

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:56.600
into the war thinking it's going to
last a couple of months and, well,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.800
it started October, it
would be out by Christmas,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.710
and it ended up lasting
almost three years.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.300
And so by the end, they
were desperate to get out.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.720
And so they did some
pretty horrible things.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.050
They resorted to-- scorched
the earth policy and they set

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.670
up these concentration camps for
as you say the women and children

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.320
who were supporting
these men who were

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.390
out fighting in the
field, the Boers.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.530
And so that they wouldn't
have any support.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.070
And it was disastrous.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.190
It was what-- And Native
Africans were also forced

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.980
into concentration camps and even
more of them died in the Boers.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.330
Churchill on the other hand, his
imprisonment, the Boers were eager

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.130
to show the British that
they were civilized too.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.190
The British had always sort
of dismissed them as sort

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.010
of being backwards and rough.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:45.550
And so they allowed just
like incredible leniency.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:50.330
But Churchill couldn't stand
the idea of being captured.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.570
And in fact he said he hated
this period in his life more

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.870
than he had ever hated any
other period in his whole life.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.700
And he was desperate to get out.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.170
And he remembered that.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.410
So, later on when he
gets into public life

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.100
and he becomes home secretary,
it was one of his missions

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.130
to show compassion to prisoners.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:18.210
And, you know, he made sure
that they had access to books,

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.520
they had access to the outdoors,
that they could exercise.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.660
Because he said, you know,
whether or not they are guilty

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.240
of some horrendous crime,
they are still human beings.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.950
&gt;&gt; First off, I'd like to say your
first two books were wonderful,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.270
some of the best I've ever read.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.570
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Thank you very much.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.660
&gt;&gt; My question is that early
on in the book, there is a sort

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.360
of a passing reference
to Teddy Roosevelt.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.610 position:56%
I think the other journalist, Atkins
I believe, had met him in Cuba.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.910
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Right.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:54.470
&gt;&gt; And I just couldn't believe
how close those two seemed.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.910
So could you contrast Teddy
Roosevelt and Winston Churchill?

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.210
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Yeah.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.860
I-- Throughout the process, I kept
thinking how much they reminded me

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.540
of each other, how many
similarities they were,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:12.870
these young incredibly ambitious
men, very arrogant, drive everybody

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.030
around them crazy, incredibly well
read, very, very talented writers.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.850
They had so much in common.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:26.930 position:56%
And I think that's why they really
didn't like each other, too similar.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.100
And they did meet.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.600
And yeah, it definitely
wasn't a love affair.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.900
Yeah.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.590
&gt;&gt; Since Churchill went to
South Africa as a journalist,

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.110
he had certain kind of preconceived
notions about the British Empire.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:48.850
And as he experienced the Boer
War, how did his view change

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.150
about the British Empire?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.420
Did he really realize-- Did you
see evidence that he realized

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.070
that the sun was actually setting
on the British Empire at this time.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:02.940
And my second question is if he
did, did that contribute to some

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.510
of the most amazing things he did
in life like the battle of London

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:12.400
when Hitler was trying to take over
England and he was so stalwart,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.720
that idea of I don't ever
want to be dominated again.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.250
Did you see evidences

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.780
of him changing his thinking
towards what the British Empire was

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.350
and how he wanted it
to fit into the world?

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.300
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, I think we all know

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.930
that Winston Churchill was
far from a perfect man.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.000
And one of the things about him is

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.070
that he was an unabashed
imperialist.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.350 position:56%
He was very proud of the British
Empire and its standing in the world

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.790
and felt that it was part of
his mission to keep it intact.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:49.910
And I don't think the Boer
War changed that at all.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:55.870
I mean I think that-- Another
thing and on the opposite side

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.810
that I will say about Winston
Churchill and something

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:01.490
that I admire is that
although no one fought harder

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.820
than he did during war, no
one was quicker to reach

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.920
out the hand of friendship
afterward.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.340
And he was incredibly magnanimous
in trying to help someone who had

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.140
so lately been his enemy.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.530
And that was true absolutely
during the Boer War and it got him

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.020
in trouble with his
countrymen and it was, you know,

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.100
true later in his life
you can see that.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.130
And that was a-- sort of a
constant throughout his life.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:33.560
But he was at that
time and for many,

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.830
many years absolutely
an imperialist.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:42.610
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just wanted to say
that I felt that "Destiny

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.510
of the Republic" was
an extraordinary book

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.940
and how much I enjoyed reading it.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.240
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Thank you.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:53.070
&gt;&gt; As I was reading it, I totally
marveled at the conversations

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.950
that the characters had with
each other and, you know,

00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:00.050
as if you had a tape
recorder in the room.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.720
And I was wondering how you--

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.170
what you drew upon to get
such their similitude in terms

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.010
of what these people were
actually saying to each other

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.140
or how you did that so well.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.440
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
And that's interesting.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.380
My father said the same thing
after he read this book.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.340
He is like the dialogue
that you have is like,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.720
you know, a novel or something.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.360
And it's very, very important
to me that everybody knows

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:30.070 position:56%
that this is all absolutely factual
and I get that dialogue from letters

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.330
or from the accounts that they
wrote themselves, you know.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.150
And so, I was talking to Churchill
and he said this and I said that

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.230
and that's where all
of that comes from.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.530
And it's very important to me.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.830
I think that there is
sort of a trend sometimes

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.860
in narrative nonfiction
that in the notes section,

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.090
you just get a paragraph
about each chapter saying kind

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.770
of in general this is--
these were my sources.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.540 position:56%
But in my books, you can look it up.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.860
I put-- I use notes.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.440
And so you can say what-- How
does she know that he said that?

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.630
Well, turn to the notes
and you can find out

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.530
and you can look it up yourself.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.720
And so that's something that's
really, really important to me

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.040
and just going back to
primary source material.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.010
I mean it takes me a long
time before I will commit

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.430
to a subject even if I think
it's a fantastic story.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.700
And there have been stories that
broke my heart because I really,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.290
really wanted to tell them
but I finally had to give them

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.960 position:56%
up because I just didn't have enough
primary source material to work

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.780
with to have that dialogue,
to have those details

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.510
that you hope will
bring a story alive.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:37.940
And so unless I do, I just won't
commit to it and I had a wealth

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.750
of information to work
with for this book.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.050
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Sir?

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.350
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Thank you.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.080
&gt;&gt; Hello. You may have
touched on this earlier,

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.020
concerning "The River of Doubt".

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.250
As I was reading it,
I was just amazed

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:59.200
at why Theodore Roosevelt
was doing this.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.120
Aside, why do you believe-- what
was his motivation for doing it?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.580
I mean he's just-- I just--

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.730
I don't want to give
you my own opinion but--

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.030
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Well, so for those of you

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.050
who don't know the story,
so the-- Theodore Roosevelt,

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:18.310
he lost the election of 1912 and
then he goes to South America

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.030
and he goes down this incredibly,

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:24.220
incredibly dangerous
rapids choked river

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.110
that no one knows where it leads.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:30.250
That's why the man who found the
headwaters called it Rio da Duvida,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.400
the River of Doubt, and because
no one knew where it was going

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.800
to take them and what
was around each bend.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.770
And the reason he did it was
because he was Theodore Roosevelt

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.850
and Winston Churchill
would have done it too.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.880 position:56%
So he's a-- So, you know, he had won
and won and won throughout his life

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.490
and then he loses, and he loses
this huge contest and he's a pariah

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.540
for the first time in his life.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.960
He's put Woodrow Wilson, a
Democrat, in the White House

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.380
because he split the
Republican vote.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.530
And he, you know, have this
depression that had sort

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.310
of haunted him through his life.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.550
And he was devastated.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:14.040 position:56%
And so he gets this invitation to go
in a speaking tour in South America.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.980
He is this incredible
naturalist, has written many books

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.830
about especially birds
and so he's going

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.790
to take another collecting trip.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.480
He gets there and nobody
has been prepared.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.870
He let this, this friend
of his who was a priest

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:33.200
who hired an arctic explorer to
plan this trip in the Amazon.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.410
And so they're not even prepared
for this-- a collecting trip.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.490
And he gets there and the foreign
minister says, you could do that,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.420
or you could map an unmapped river

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.060
and Theodore Roosevelt is
going to say no to that?

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.500
No. And so he throws himself
and the people with him

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.780
into this outrageously
dangerous trip.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.080
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley:
Just time for one more.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.380
Thank you.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.680
You're the lucky first.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.510
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit about
how you reconstructed the events

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.110
after President Garfield was shot,

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.300
particularly the medical
care he received?

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.970
And I find it so remarkable that
if the doctors had left him alone,

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.190
he might very well lived.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.490
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Right.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.790
Yeah. He would have.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:16.020
So, again for those of you
who don't know, so the--

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.140
So, Garfield was shot actually in a
train station that was on the mall.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.140
It's where the National
Gallery now sits.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.740
And to my outrage, there is
no plaque, no notice at all

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.460
that an American president
was shot here.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.240
But the bullet that hit him, that
went in the right side of his back,

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.060
it didn't hit any vital organs,
didn't hit his spinal cord.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.190
His injuries were far less severe
than Reagan's when Reagan was shot.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.620
And his-- But he had
twelve different doctors,

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.330
especially this beautifully named
doctor, Doctor Willard Bliss,

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.900
whose first name was Doctor,

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.010 position:56%
who repeatedly inserted
unsterilized fingers and instruments

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.000
in his back probing for this
bullet, even though Joseph Lister

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.330
of Listerine had discovered
antisepsis 16 years earlier

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.460
and come here and spoke
to American doctors.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.760
And so it is sickening to watch
this, you know, through the lens

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:20.040
of 135 years happening to
this extraordinary man.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.210
And so I went-- A lot of-- So I
did a ton of research obviously

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.040
at the Library of Congress because
even though Garfield was president

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.420
for a short time, he had been
in Congress for almost 18 years

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.140
and his papers and a lot of the
people surrounding it were there.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.270
But also I went to the National
Museum of Health and Medicine

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:42.110
and they actually have
the autopsy report there.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.310
But more than that, they have--

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:49.200
I held in my gloved hand a
section of Churchill's-- Sorry.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.580
Garfield's spine with
this red plastic pin going

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.030
through where the bullet
had gone through.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.360
And it's stunning.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.870
And they also have strangely there,

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.690
they have what I called
the assassin's drawer

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:09.020
because they have these-- they
have the remains of Charles Guiteau

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.000
who assassinated Garfield.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.300
And then they also have the remains

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.060
of John Wilkes Booth kind
of in the same drawer.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.360
They have-- There is the femur,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.900
there is the ankle
bone, it's just bizarre.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.500
They also have a jar with
chunks of Guiteau's brain.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.910
And they-- He was insane
and he was mentally ill.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.940
And after he was executed, they
exhumed his body and they wanted

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.910
to study it for science to
see, especially his brain,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.780
to see if you could see
physical signs of insanity.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.280
And so they cut up his brain
and they send it to experts

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.870
around the country and they
send it back and said, well,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.540
he probably had syphilis
but that's all we can tell.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.130
And they put it in this
jar and they still have it.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.430
Thank you.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.170
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Yardley: Candice told
me before we started this program

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.270
that she is still looking
around for her next subject.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.020
She also admitted that a book for
her is about a five-year project.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.340
Candice, I am almost
77 years old and I want

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.010
to read your next book
so you better get going.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.470

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.770
Thank you very much.

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.070
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard:
Thank you so much.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.870
Thank you, Jonathan.
