ELIZABETH ANCARANA: So now,
I turn to our panelists.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.200
And thanks again for coming
and talking to our new faculty

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.960
here today.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.770
It's just a delight
that you're here.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.200
We have Katia Bertoldi who's
the John L. Loeb Associate

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
Professor of the
Natural Sciences

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.980
at the Johnny Paulson School
of Engineering and Applied

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.380
Sciences.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.770
After earning her
Ph.D. in Mechanics

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.270
of Materials and Structures
from Trento University in 2006,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.340
Katia did a post-doctoral
fellowship at MIT

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.180
and then served as an
Assistant Professor

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.940
of Engineering Technology
at the University of Twente

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.190
in the Netherlands.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.930
She joined the Harvard
faculty in 2010.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.140
Katia's work focuses
on the relationships

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350
between the internal
structure of a material

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.190
and its mechanical properties.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.420
Her research on
materials, especially

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.800
those with tunable
properties, has direct use

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.930
in many critical fields,
including acoustics, optics,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.800
and electronics.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.029
Next to Katia is
James, or Jay Mitchell

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.820
who's is an Associate
Professor of Genetics

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.700
and Complex Diseases at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.270
of Public Health.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.960
After completing his
doctoral training

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.850
at the University of California
at Berkeley on Human Telomerase

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.190
Biochemistry, he did his
post-doctoral studies

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.240
also in the Netherlands at
Erasmus University in Rotterdam

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.450
where he focused on the genetics
of DNA repair and aging.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.270
Jay came to Harvard
in 2008, where

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.960
since, he's been focusing on
the restriction of calorie

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.220
or nutrient intake
to increase stressed

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.480
resistance, particularly
during major surgery,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.770
and the improvement
of metabolic fitness

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.780
and the extension of longevity.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.750
We also have
Lawrence Ralph, who's

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.330
the John L. Loeb Associate
Professor of the Social

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.050
Sciences in the
Departments of Anthropology

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.760
and African and African-American
studies in the Faculty of Arts

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.220
and Sciences.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.490
After earning his
Ph.D. In Anthropology

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.390
from the University
of Chicago in 2010,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.310
Lawrence served as
a Mandela Rodney

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.580
Dubois a post-doctoral
fellow at the Center

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.090
for African and
Afro-American studies

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.930
at the University of Michigan.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.770
He then joined the
Harvard faculty in 2011.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.130
His scholarly work explores how
the historical circumstances

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.120
of police abuse, mass
incarceration, and the drug

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.820
trade [? naturalized ?]
disease, disability,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.200
and premature death
for urban residents,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.950
showing how violence
and injury play

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.920
a central role in the daily
lives of black urbanites.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.090
So we have a nice array,
a very interesting array

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.210
of work and backgrounds.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.050
Each panelist will speak
for about 10 minutes,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.700
and then we'll open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150
So would you want to
maybe start with Katia?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.240
KATIA BERTOLDI: Yes.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240
OK.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.560
So first of all, welcome
to everybody to Harvard.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.520
So I was here in 2010,
so a long time ago.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.320
So as Elizabeth told you, I
started in January 2010-- no,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.630
sorry, it was in 2009
because I started in 2010.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.710
So now you might think
it's a long time ago.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.180
But you'll see, time will fly.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.600
And soon you will be on this
side of the table speaking

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.470
to a new faculty.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.700
So what do I remember
of the first days?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.020
The first days are kind
of mixed feeling, right?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.160
At least for me was.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.530
On one hand, you
feel the pressure.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.660
On the other hand, you
would like to do things,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.950
but you don't know what to do
and you don't know how to move.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.430
And then, you need to adjust.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.460
Adjust to the new place.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.290
In my case, I was
moving back from Europe,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.670
so you need to fix
your family life.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.000
My husband needed to find a job.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.820
So all these sort of different
pressure coming to you.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.880
So what can you do
to deal with that?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.890
So I think the best
suggestion I got was,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.807
before coming here,
I was deciding

00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:59.390
whether to leave Europe and come
here and to accept this offer

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.480
or not.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
And my mentor in the Netherlands
just told me, look, Katia.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.399
This is a unique opportunity.

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.190
We know that there's
going to be-- probably

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.080
you're going to
have some pressure.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.040
It's going to be tough.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.070
But it's really unique.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.760
And there, you have
the opportunity

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.520
really to do great things
because mostly the environment.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.910
The people around
you, the resources.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.129
It's a seven year period
that is tenure, yes.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.420
It's not so easy to get tenure.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.530
But forget about it, and
try to enjoy every day,

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.680
and really to make sure that
at the end of the seven years,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
you can say it was
worth doing it.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.010
And just make sure that you
take advantage of the resources.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.030
And this, I think, was the
best advice I really got.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.995
So try it try to
forget about the fact

00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:45.705
that there's going
to be a promotion.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.330
There's going to be
several promotions.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.720
One in between, and
then the final one.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.900
And just really take
advantage of the resources.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.320
Now how of take
advantage of resources.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.492
So in my case, I was lucky
because people in my area--

00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:02.450
so I'm in the School of
Engineering and Applied

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.660
Sciences.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.390
So people working in an area
related to my area of expertise

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.840
go for lunch together every day.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.110
I was the only junior faculty.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.620
Now there are a couple more.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.810
But this has been
very, very helpful.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.160
It's true that maybe you waste
one hour of your day every day,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.977
noon to 1:00.

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:24.060
And maybe you could write
a paper or do something.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.310
But now I realize
how important it

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.780
has been because in this
informal discussion,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.850
you get to learn how
people move around.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.750
And I was assigned, as
probably most of you,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.970
to a mentoring committee
at the very beginning.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.640
Honestly, because of
these informal lunches,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.390
daily informal lunches
and discussion,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.280
I never used the
committee just because I

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.580
have this informal
committee every day.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.920
And I find it much more
useful, because after a while,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.295
after you go for
lunch every day,

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:00.490
you can also ask these
sort of questions

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.470
that maybe are intimidating.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.460
You don't want to ask to
somebody that you just

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.120
meet once a year.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.720
So this has been
quite helpful for me.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.110
And what else can I tell you?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.860
Clearly, at the
beginning for me was also

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.780
difficult to suddenly
manage so many tasks.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.980
Before, I was a post-doc.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.370
I was a faculty for a
while in the Netherlands.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.580
But there, the environment
was very different.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.630
I was sort of a senior
post-doc because the structure

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.850
of the academic system
is very different.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.590
So suddenly, I was pretty
much spending all my time

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.080
doing research.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.790
And then when I started
here, suddenly I

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.706
had to manage a group.

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:40.730
I have currently 20
people in my group.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.820
So it's a medium-sized
group, I would say.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.100
You need to write grant to
make sure that you get money

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.160
to support the group.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.820
You need to teach, mentoring
these people, and write papers.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.880
So it took me a couple
of months to adjust.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.770
But then what I figured out
was in my case very useful.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.310
Every morning when
I wake up, I just

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.970
try to make a list of
things on a piece of paper

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.150
and just cross lines during
the day as things move.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.110
And make sure that
I try to balance

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.570
all the different things,
because sometimes, I

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.680
have the tendency
only to focus on one.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.780
And then it's 5:00
PM, and suddenly you

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.210
realize you have to
do other three things.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.867
So trying to find a
balance is always useful.

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:28.700
Beginning, I found it
particularly difficult

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.090
to manage students
and manage post-docs.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.820
So maybe I was a bit unlucky.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.310
At the beginning, I had some
cases that were not so easy.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.800
Also, this was
also because of me,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.216
because probably
at the beginning,

00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:42.430
I was not so sure about
the quality [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.200
into the people I was hiring.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.890
So I can see that now,
over time, I improve a lot.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.360
Now I can select people
in a much better way,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.950
and I'm much more sure
that the people I'm hiring

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.100
are exactly what I expect.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.520
But you learn by mistakes.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.580
So I spend quite
a bit of time also

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.840
dealing with managing people.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.890
I didn't take much advantage
of the resources around campus

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:12.060
that I-- I just mostly talk with
senior colleagues around me.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.480
And this was after
I solved the cases,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.390
and to try to basically
smooth out all the issues,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.680
I figured it out.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.730
Something I found
particularly useful

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.250
was to try to put
a limit on travel.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.470
So at the beginning, I look
at this as a compromise

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.540
with my husband.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.590
Clearly you can travel, and you
can spend almost all your time

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.750
on planes and visiting
beautiful places.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.929
And not only visiting, but also
giving talks at conferences.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.250
But you also need--
life is a compromise.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.720
So clearly, my husband was
not at all up for that.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.370
And so we realized, OK,
why don't we try to limit.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.830
We came up with
sort of agreement,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.850
let's try to limit the
travel to once a month.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.950
It's not a strict rule.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.000
But let's try [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.810
Sometimes it's two.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.020
Sometime it's zero.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.530
Sometimes maybe three,
but try to put some limit.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.770
A cap, at least.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.440
At the beginning,
I look at that,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.280
I thought a fine compromise,
but a limitation.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.200
Now what I realize is
that helped me a lot.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.050
The fact that I need to
think where I want to go

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.300
and I need to think
why I want to go,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.430
and I need to be selective,
because traveling

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.760
is tiring and takes
out time that you need

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.850
to spend doing other things.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.060
So I find it really-- now
that when I look back,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.970
I'm thinking that this
is helping me a lot.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.070
So basically
compromising between all

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.710
the different tasks.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.105
So still keep visibility,
but also being very selective

00:09:43.105 --> 00:09:45.480
and making sure that you choose
where to go in such a way

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.243
that you maximize some
of the visibility.

00:09:47.243 --> 00:09:49.742
And make sure that you meet the
people that you need to meet

00:09:49.742 --> 00:09:52.450
and you want to meet.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.960
And yeah, I don't know.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.967
What else do you
want me to tell you?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.566
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Well,
that's a good start.

00:10:03.566 --> 00:10:05.066
Maybe we'll have
each panelist talk,

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.954
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:10:06.954 --> 00:10:08.800
JAMES MITCHELL: Yeah, OK.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.950
I'll take over then.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.750
Jay Mitchell from the
School of Public Health.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.430
I was going to
apologize at the outset

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.430
because I'm a
research scientist.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.270
I run a lab.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.311
And I thought that might
be not so common with what

00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.810
people in the
Engineering School do,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.350
but perhaps not so different.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.481
So I'm going to take you
through some of the things

00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:27.980
that I've done over the last
eight years that have gotten me

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.380
to this point, and some of
the lessons I've learned.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.460
So what Elizabeth told
you, just to refresh

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.000
on what I do specifically,
basic research lab.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.100
I'm trained in genetics
and biochemistry.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.860
And my lab focuses on
aging and nutrition,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.000
and the mechanism by which, when
you eat less, you live longer.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.490
That is you if
you were a rodent.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.830
And we work on mice primarily.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.420
Or if you were a fly or a yeast,
the same thing holds true.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.440
But what I actually
do is study how

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.040
the mechanisms that allow
you to live longer actually

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.490
increase your stress resistance.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.760
And that turns out to be
very handy when you have

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.010
a planned stress in your life.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.530
And so what we actually
work on is surgery.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.070
And we're trying to figure
out what you should--

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.080
or in this case,
shouldn't eat-- before you

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.010
go into a major surgery to
increase your body's resistance

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.810
to stress.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.070
So that's what I do.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.350
And the reason I tell you that
is because the first key lesson

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.210
I learned at Harvard
is to be able to define

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.390
what you do in two sentences.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.950
And it has to be
hopefully exciting,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.550
and it has to sound
really important.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.425
And most importantly,
you have to be the best

00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:35.450
person in the world at that.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.039
So you really have to
define your niche carefully.

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:40.330
And I still struggle with
that, because my lab actually

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.315
does a lot more than just that.

00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:44.440
We work on different
organisms, different pathways.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.440
And I continually struggle with
how exactly to define my niche,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.300
my role.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.590
To make myself that most
important person doing

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.980
that most important thing.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.290
But I think it's a good lesson.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.530
And for me, learning
that lesson has

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.990
helped with a lot of other
aspects of the business that

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.170
are very important.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.780
Publishing, for example.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.320
Getting grants.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.100
It's easier to publish and
get grants based on things

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.930
that people know that
you're the best at.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.050
Things that they trust
that you know how to do.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.600
When you get outside
of your core business,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.030
you're area of focus, people
don't have that trust.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.090
They don't know you.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.260
And unfortunately, a
lot of this business

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.600
is based on personal
interactions.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.990
Who you know, their
judgment of you personally.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.050
So it's enormously helpful
just to keep that focus.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.175
What is your core business?

00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:36.008
What do you work on?

00:12:36.008 --> 00:12:37.140
What are you the best at?

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.550
And build out from there.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.130
Not easy, but very important.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.220
So a corollary to
that is writing.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.330
And I wasn't a particularly
good writer coming in,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.579
and I've really had
to sharpen my skills.

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:53.620
Communication in general.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.020
I wasn't a very good speaker.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.910
And I've tried to
sharpen my skills.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.660
These days, it's
not good enough just

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.379
to write well and
speak well, but I

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:02.920
think you have to
be even more clever

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.500
with social media and other ways
of getting your message out.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.110
So the more often you
can get your message out,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.200
I think it does have benefits.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.380
And this can be at
meetings, traveling, perhaps

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.600
in the public realm.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.140
The media itself, sometimes
they find something

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.990
you do interesting.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.159
And you can try to use them as
a route to convey your message

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:26.450
and how interesting it is,
and how it should be funded,

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.459
for example, by the NIH.

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:30.000
That's a bit of a
double-edged sword,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.420
too, because the media can
take what you do and twist it

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.770
into something else.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.670
But it's by and large
probably worth it

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.007
to try to get that
attention on what you do.

00:13:44.007 --> 00:13:46.340
So that's the key lesson, the
two sentence, the elevator

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.710
pitch.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.650
Setting up a lab.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.081
An assistant professor is like
a small business entrepreneur.

00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:55.080
You have to run a group.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.260
You have to obtain funding.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.390
You get your investor.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.080
The university gives you,
in our case, about two

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.079
and a half, three years.

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.420
At least that's how it
was eight years ago.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.540
But you probably
have no training--

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.230
at least if you're a
geneticist like me,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.540
you're not trained in
organizational skills.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.800
You're not trained in finance.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.710
And you're certainly not trained
in choosing people or managing

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.210
them.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.190
And for me, that's been
the biggest struggle

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.990
is to choose good people.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.370
Of course, Harvard's wonderful.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.150
The students, the
post-docs, even

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.890
the technicians that we have
access to is tremendous.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.350
But I really wish I had
a sixth sense to know,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.420
that's the one that's
a good fit for my lab.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.290
A mutual good fit.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.120
And I don't.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.110
And talking to my colleagues,
even the senior ones,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.650
they get better.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.480
But I don't think anybody really
has the secret to choosing

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.060
people that are a good match.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.980
But we keep trying.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.710
Grants after the three year
start-up package runs out

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.930
fund everything, including,
in my case, 70% of my salary

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.060
is through my grant.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.990
So that's primarily what I do
these days is write for grants.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.327
But of course, to get grants,
you need to have the papers.

00:15:00.327 --> 00:15:01.910
And for the papers,
you need to choose

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.868
the good people, the
students, the postdocs who

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:04.959
then deliver the data.

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.500
And it's that
preliminary data, then,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.200
that allows you
to get the grant.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.652
So it's just a revolving circle.

00:15:12.652 --> 00:15:13.610
And where do you start?

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.420
You come in here.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.100
It's your first year.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.210
I've seen two different
patterns that people follow

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.040
to break into the business.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.300
One is to hire senior
people, a senior lab

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.090
manager or technician,
senior postdocs,

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.730
and to have a very
high burn rate.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.660
Just churn out
mature data rapidly,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.570
and then enter the
publications and the grants.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.530
I chose a fundamentally
different route--

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.230
to do everything
myself very slowly,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.790
and to learn and make all
the mistakes along the way.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.570
I think both paths
can be successful.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.620
It probably just depends
on your personality.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.754
So there are unfortunately
no generalizations

00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:53.420
that I can make.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.040
I've seen both succeed,
I've seen both fail.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.340
The one thing that I can
say is choosing my path,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.630
at least I do know
how to do everything.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.420
And also coming
from Europe, there

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.920
was some necessity
to that because I

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.710
didn't have any idea
how things here worked.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.690
So that's maybe situational.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.860
But I think those
two paths can work.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.110
Taking advantage of resources.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.450
Of course, as we've
heard, they're tremendous.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.200
And I already
mentioned the students,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.830
and we heard from Alan
Garber, the faculty are also

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.130
wonderful resources not
just for what you do,

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.900
but for things that are
tangentially related,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.330
which might have some
influence at some point.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.520
Collaboration is
a wonderful thing,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.770
but I'll give one example
for me that it was enormously

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.730
enriching.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.454
But I entered it with
a false pretenses

00:16:41.454 --> 00:16:43.120
of what I thought I
might get out of it.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.152
So being in the School
of Public Health--

00:16:45.152 --> 00:16:47.360
and we have a Department of
Immunology and Infectious

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.620
Diseases-- I struck
up a collaboration

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.000
with a biologist who
works on malaria,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.790
which I know nothing about.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.117
We were interested in
how what the host eats--

00:16:56.117 --> 00:16:58.700
and the host being the mouse,
in this case-- how what they eat

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.000
affects the course of disease.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.791
And we found some really
interesting stuff.

00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.109
Namely, that if you
restrict food intake,

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.510
you don't succumb
to the illness.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.640
So very interesting.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.569
And I thought,
this is wonderful.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.369
It's really enriched how I
think about my core business.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.230
But the mistake I made is to
think that I could turn that

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.060
into another core business.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.940
And that has been
enormously difficult.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.450
To go, then, to different study
sections, different journals

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.240
who don't know me.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.440
I'm not a malaria guy.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.810
And to try to recapitulate
the same thing

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.950
that I'm doing in my core
didn't work out, in my case.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.440
That was my expectation,
to diversify my funding.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.000
And it was a false expectation.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.990
I keep trying, because
it's really interesting.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.650
And so I would say
the take home was

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.570
that it was so interesting
and so enriching

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.676
for my core business that
it was totally worth doing.

00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:46.300
But it's hard to
predict ahead of time.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.990
So I just don't have
false expectations of what

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.330
you might get out of it.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.930
Equipment is another thing maybe
specific to the lab sciences.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.460
But it's all out there.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.520
You just have to figure
out where, and who to ask,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.230
and how to ask.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.100
And I don't have any good
advice except for perhaps things

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.850
like this.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.920
So if there's anybody
who has a GC that

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.022
detects hydrogen sulfide, I
would love to talk to you.

00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:09.730
It's worth a try.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.150
Navigating the
Harvard environment,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.210
there is very little here
that is as it appears.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.332
And you get to learn that
probably pretty quickly.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.040
You've probably already
figured that out.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.590
So for me, mentorship
was really a key

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.980
to surviving this
opaque environment.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.920
And mentorship from
the tenured faculty

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.902
was enormously helpful
in figuring out how

00:18:33.902 --> 00:18:36.360
the school, the School of Public
Health and the university,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.020
how they interact.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.644
How that works.

00:18:37.644 --> 00:18:39.640
What's important, where
I should spend my time.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.730
But wasn't really
helpful for how

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.150
to climb the tenure ladder
because they had done it

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.340
in a different era.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.180
So for that, getting to know
your colleagues who are just

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.190
one step above you is
enormously helpful,

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.680
because it's different,
I think, now that it

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.630
was even five or 10 years ago.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.964
Lastly, the relationship
with your department chair,

00:19:02.964 --> 00:19:04.380
who you can't,
choose, by the way.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.087
It's like kids and parents.

00:19:06.087 --> 00:19:06.920
You're here already.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.169
You've got a department chair.

00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:10.320
But it really is of
critical importance.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.080
Although I don't
see my department

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.460
chair except once a month
at faculty meetings.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.440
He's also my formal
adviser, so I

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.520
see him annually to discuss
mentorship-related items.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.750
But my relationship
with him it's

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.660
critical if I run
into a gap in funding.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.680
It's going to be my
department chair who's going

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.904
to pull me through or not.

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:33.070
He's the one who sets the
pace of the tenure ladder.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.620
So again, it's not
something you control,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.370
but it's certainly
something you should be

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.220
aware of, at least in my case.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.710
And I've heard this
in other institutions

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.900
in the lab sciences, too,
of the critical importance

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.720
of your relationship with
your department chair.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.120
Finally, a piece of advice.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.960
And I think we just
heard it from Katia.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.070
Don't worry about
the tenure too much.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.845
In our case, it's a
10 to 11 year process.

00:19:57.845 --> 00:19:59.350
So maybe it's easier
for me to say.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.050
I have other colleagues who
it's a five to six year process,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.560
and that seems far
more stressful.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.050
But in any case, with
the longer clocks,

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.770
you can really say-- I
can say in all honesty,

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.620
possibly I'll get another job
with a bigger salary running

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.580
a department somewhere
before I make tenure.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.370
That's something I see happens
to my colleagues all the time.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.810
Another thing that might happen
is you run out of funding

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.643
and you don't have to
worry about it anyway.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.970
But hopefully you
will enjoy, you'll

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.420
find a good work-life balance.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.690
And that period of
time, you won't just

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.926
be focused on making tenure,
but you'll actually learn

00:20:34.926 --> 00:20:36.550
and enrich yourself
during that period.

00:20:39.442 --> 00:20:40.410
LAURENCE RALPH: Hi.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.000
Again, I'm Laurence Ralph.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.010
I'm in the Department
of Anthropology

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.000
and African and
African-American Studies.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.120
I guess I'll begin by just
reaffirming some of the things

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.590
that the panelists
have said, and offering

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.234
some concrete details.

00:20:55.234 --> 00:21:01.300
I think the first thing is
use the people around you

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.480
as a resource.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.570
I think not only
professionally, but personally.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.580
One of the biggest
things in my first year

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.430
was that the people that
I met in orientation

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:18.300
in this Institute as
well became people

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.830
that I would hang out
with for happy hours

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.410
or what have you because we
were all new to Cambridge.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.960
And we were all going
through the same process

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.070
at the same time.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.380
And we still have
sustained relationships.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.780
So I think that's
a critical thing.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.170
Or at least it has been for me.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:46.670
The second thing I'll say
is that my first year, I

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:57.290
had a striking experience
at this very faculty club.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.380
And it wasn't during
this Institute,

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.900
but shortly after, when my
department had an event here.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.030
And we were upstairs
in one of these rooms,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:14.650
and there were
waiters with gloves on

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.640
and silver trays passing
out lobsters or something

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.790
like that.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.580
And it was like a glee
club in the background.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.470
And I was looking around,
and I was like, where am I?

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.510
And I had just came from the
University of Michigan State,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.810
a state school.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.200
And just as I'm
having this thought,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.920
like, what is this place?

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.570
One of my colleagues said,
man, before the recession,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.440
we got two lobsters.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.300
And I couldn't believe it.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.350
I say that to say that there
will be moments like that

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.750
here at Harvard.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:06.370
And those moments can
intimidate you, right?

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:12.020
Because at the same time, you
need to interact with people.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:17.020
And what's especially
jarring is the juxtaposition

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.180
between those moments
and the conversations

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.640
that you have with people who
are actually down to earth

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.930
and friendly and funny.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.720
But you might not think so in
particular environments here.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.070
So I would say that
that's an important thing

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:39.330
to remember because again,
the people in your department

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.393
are resources that you can
turn to for particular things,

00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:44.960
right?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.910
I'm in two departments, so
I've had different takes

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.490
on how Harvard operates.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.981
And even how a
department operates,

00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.230
relationship with the chair
of the department and what

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.540
have you.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.470
And what's interesting is
that in terms of things

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.090
like mentoring, there's no
real one fixed way that you can

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.460
expect to be mentored, I think.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.910
In both of my
departments, mentoring

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.400
has been really active
at particular moments.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.130
And you can tell that senior
colleagues had a discussion

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.990
about, this is what we're
going to do about mentoring,

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.700
and they've
implemented something.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.120
But at other moments,
it's not been on the radar

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.400
in the same way.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.010
And it's oscillated
between both departments.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.880
So I would say that what's
presented to you now

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.650
might not be how it
is in the long run.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.510
So it's important to take
advantage of the opportunities

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:49.180
that you have, particularly
around mentorship, because they

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.590
might not always be there.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.750
One faculty member might
be really into mentorship,

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.260
and that might be her
thing or his thing.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.480
And they might be
driving the other faculty

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.812
members towards that direction.

00:25:01.812 --> 00:25:04.020
But they might be on leave
the next year or something

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.520
like that.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.320
So you don't know how
it's going to pan out.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:18.030
I think in light of that,
one of the best ways

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.080
to approach a mentorship, I
think, is around your research,

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.040
and around your
area of expertise.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.924
And soliciting feedback
on what you do.

00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:30.340
And I think this
goes back to what

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.690
Jay says about
knowing your strengths

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.020
and knowing who you
are as a scholar,

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.740
and branding yourself,
for lack of a better word,

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.710
as the type of scholar
that you want to be.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:51.320
I think that particularly
around if you're

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.720
writing a paper, if you're
writing a book chapter--

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.840
my field is a book field.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.380
But also, when you're
applying to grants or things

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.210
like that, when you can have
concrete things to share

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.960
with people and
solicit their feedback,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.430
it can be a way both to get
help on what you're writing,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.980
but also a way for
them to know what

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.590
you do so when
they see articles,

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.010
they might send it to you.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.970
Or when something comes
across in the news,

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.090
you might have those
happenstance conversations

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:29.460
about that particular area or
that particular research topic.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:34.370
And I think that it's
especially critical coming

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:40.710
from another university, or if
this is your first job coming

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.630
from graduate school
where you have

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.690
a built in network
of your cohort,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.320
or you have a built in
network of your dissertation

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.650
committee or
something like that,

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.120
this is like-- I would think
of it as reconstituting

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:58.220
another network of
scholars that can help you

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.130
in the next phase
of your career.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.120
And there's particular--
at least in the Faculty

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.620
of Arts and Sciences,
there's particular centers

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.380
that can help you with that.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:20.480
One is the FAS Research
Administration Services.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.630
And I would assume that other
schools have similar things,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:31.980
where if you have a grant,
they can not only give you

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.330
an idea of what kind of
things that you can apply for

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.950
based on your topic, but
also what faculty members are

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.790
doing similar research.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.440
So they'll put you in touch
with different faculty members,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.560
even in different
schools, actually.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.580
You can get a letter
of collaboration

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.830
that can help your grant
and things like that.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.720
Another thing is the various
centers around Harvard

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.470
could be a way to
present your research

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.320
and develop organic
relationships in that way

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.710
with faculty that are
doing similar things.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:15.860
And I would say that
developing this kind of network

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.820
can be a way of thinking
about Harvard as a home

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.750
base for your research
agenda, right?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:27.300
What I mean is that it can
be quite daunting to think

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.910
about yourself as
a researcher that

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.460
has to have a public
presence, that

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.380
has to have a website, that
has to have Twitter, Facebook,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.040
and all of these things
that-- not only are you

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.700
doing research, but there's
more and more obligation

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:49.160
to present your research
to the wider world.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.510
Make it accessible to
the wider world in ways

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.900
that we're often
not trained to do.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.210
In ways in which we are not
necessarily comfortable doing.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:04.030
But I think one way is to
think about it as, what

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.830
are the various ways that you
can just promote your research

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.480
around the university, right?

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.270
And that's less daunting, right?

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.799
Can you develop a relationship
with the Harvard Magazine,

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.340
or the Crimson or
something like that

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.270
that can also promote your
research in a different way

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:26.280
that's not at the same scale,
in a way that allows students

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.260
and colleagues
around the university

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.640
to know about your research,
know about your research

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.000
agenda, and have these
organic conversations.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.120
And just a quick
story on that note

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.200
is that the last research
grant that I received,

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:54.170
it was different in the sense
that your department had

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.465
to nominate you for the grant.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.950
Then it went up the
ladder and the provost

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.910
had to select different
applications out

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.740
of the nominations
from each department.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.070
And then it went to
the granting agency.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:18.410
But in my case, the reason
why my department chair

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.640
knew that this grant would
be great for me, that

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.670
was a great fit
for my research was

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:32.010
because I had just shared with
him a NSF application, right?

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.420
And so he had read
the NSF application.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.110
He had wrote a letter of
support for the NSF application.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.570
And that application
wasn't successful.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.780
But this other grant was
that was particularly

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.860
for my research topic, right?

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.880
And he wouldn't have
known that and had that

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.080
on the forefront
of his mind if I

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.340
hadn't been active about
sharing my research,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.680
and sharing my research
interest with him

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.620
at that particular
moment in time.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.380
So I think that it's
never a lost cause when

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.790
you try to build a network.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.830
It might take time
and it might take

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:14.260
energy and things that are
kind of difficult that you

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.060
don't always have.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.550
But I think that in the
end, it will pay off

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.470
for your ultimate
research goals.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.980
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Thank you.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.340
OK, lots of great, great advise.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.700
And just to follow up on what
you were saying, Lawrence.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.430
There's also a
resource available.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.480
It's open access.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.520
It was created in our
office a few years ago.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.160
Faculty finder.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.250
So you could just even
Google Harvard faculty finder

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.070
and it'll come up.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.340
Or the office website
is faculty.Harvard.edu.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.040
And there are lots of resources
available to you there as well.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.060
But Harvard faculty
finder on faculty finder,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.890
you can find other
faculty at Harvard

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:02.430
that are working on similar
research topics as yours.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.490
And that's a way to develop your
network around your scholarship

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:07.850
as well.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:12.522
Do we have questions for
any one of our panelists?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.650
And we have a [INAUDIBLE]
mic that's coming around.

00:32:23.922 --> 00:32:25.130
SPEAKER 1: I have a question.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.190
This is for Jay or any
of the other panelists

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.650
if they want to
give a stab at it.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.410
So I want to follow
up on the comment you

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.210
made about being an
assistant professor

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.590
or running a new lab essentially
as being a small entrepreneur

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.920
and running a startup, which is
something that I've read about.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.810
And one thing I wanted to ask
is, how does this analogy carry

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.810
over to getting funding?

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.820
So from the perspective
of this analogy, what

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.440
does it mean about how
proactive one must be,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.360
or what kind of
strategies, essentially,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.430
one could use to get
your venture funded.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.130
JAMES MITCHELL:
Right, so the rules

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.530
used to be that you
can rely on the NIH

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.290
for biomedical research.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:10.240
And now you have to diversify.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.310
So I think we try to
train our post-docs,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.475
and even our students
these days-- I

00:33:16.475 --> 00:33:17.600
wasn't trained in this way.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.490
But to always think about a
strategy to take those data

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.350
and turn them into more money.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:30.660
And that can be in the form
of NIH grants, of course.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.380
It can be in the form
of foundational support

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.270
for some disease.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.700
It can even be from
corporate sponsorship.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.470
And Harvard is
fantastic at bringing

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.920
in corporations who are
interested in funding research

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.670
at Harvard.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.520
And I've recently been able
to take advantage of one

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.980
of those types of grants.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.390
So the idea is about
diversification of funding.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:02.330
And I made the comment
about the department chair

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.510
is the one who, if you
can't make payroll,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:11.489
they're the one who'll bail you
out, because that's how it is.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.130
You can see things--
NIH grants at least last

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.719
typically around four years.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.300
So you can see it coming.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.560
But it's not something that
you can turn around rapidly.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.360
So it could take you a year
or two to get one renewed.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:31.080
But I think the people prepare
a certain way these days.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.440
You just take this into account.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.815
You're going to
have to diversify

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:37.530
beyond the traditional
sources, and be creative.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.380
I've heard on the radio
about crowdsourcing

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.670
of certain things.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.080
It hasn't come to that
for us, but I think

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.191
we all have open minds now.

00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:47.690
And I have to say, I don't think
it compromises our research

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:48.189
at all.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:50.870
It's the same data,
the same interest.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.190
A lot of what I do is
obviously translational.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.719
If somebody wants to pay
for that, that's great.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.300
And I don't see that as
compromising our mission

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.113
at all.

00:35:00.113 --> 00:35:01.903
KATIA BERTOLDI: Can
I add something?

00:35:01.903 --> 00:35:04.390
So on a very practical
side, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.550
very different strategies.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.390
So I've seen young
colleagues basically

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.160
say, OK, I'm going to
write one grant per month.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.120
Even two grants per month.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.230
And I've seen them
sticking to this plan.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.360
And some of them have
been very successful.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.470
Some of them, not so successful.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.920
I've seen colleagues instead
be more strategic and say,

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.510
let's first collect-- let's
put together a very good idea.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.090
Let's refine this idea.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.150
Let's maybe have some
preliminary contact

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:38.270
also with managers, with
NSF Manager, NIH manager,

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.580
and make sure that
what I'm going to write

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.420
is likely to be funded.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.970
Again, also in this case,
you're never sure, right?

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.930
But also in this case, I've seen
50% of this class of colleague

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.440
being successful, and 50% not.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.796
So I believe there is not really
a single path to go around it.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.430
And also, something I found
very useful, anyway, in my case,

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.780
is money from industry.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.710
So don't forget to talk to
also people outside academia,

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.400
outside funding
agency, because if you

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.160
are able to start
the right relations

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.620
and meet the right people, that
might be very, very useful.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.770
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: We
had another question.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.114
SPEAKER 2: Question for anyone.

00:36:30.114 --> 00:36:32.030
How close to the vest
or not close to the vest

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.847
do you keep your ideas,
or intellectual property.

00:36:34.847 --> 00:36:36.180
I hate that term for what we do.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.540
But intellectual property-- I've
seen senior faculty, and not

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.910
even senior faculty be very
secretive with things they're

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.650
working on, and that
makes me kind of sad

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.920
as someone in academia.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.950
At the same time, I had
lunch with a friend of mine.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.540
She's a post-doc and she
applied for a faculty job

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.190
at another institution.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.870
And a couple months later, the
chair of that search committee

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.370
didn't talk about the job but
said, oh, can you look at this

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.350
grant that I'm writing.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.610
It's basically an idea that
came from her application.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.460
And then I thought back
a couple months ago,

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.225
where Professor x
from Institution y

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.100
said, oh, what are you
working on these days?

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.990
And I kind of said, well, I'm
thinking about this new space.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.340
And they're like, well
send me what you have.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.506
I'd love to just look at it.

00:37:13.506 --> 00:37:15.960
And I didn't send anything,
but I was like, oh no.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.930
What did-- that
makes me kind of sad.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.683
So how did you think
about that at all.

00:37:22.683 --> 00:37:24.874
LAURENCE RALPH: Yeah, I can
say a few words on that.

00:37:24.874 --> 00:37:26.790
I think the fields are
a little bit different,

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.850
but I think on
things like this, it

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.830
can be kind of
counter-intuitive in the sense

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.410
that if more people
know about your work,

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.330
I think it's less likely that
somebody takes your idea.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.360
But if you keep it
close to the vest,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.090
it could be more likely because
the person that you shared it

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.200
with could then take it.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:55.550
So I think that speaks towards
getting your ideas out there,

00:37:55.550 --> 00:38:02.200
having them in circulation,
presenting your ideas.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.440
And I also think that
you're here for a reason.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.610
You're here because they
believed in what you do.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.340
And so I think that
they ultimately

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:20.320
want you to develop that core
sense of your research agenda.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:27.700
So I think that you have
to have conversations

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.490
with your colleagues about
these kind of things.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.490
And getting your
ideas out there.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.700
I think can help.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.310
JAMES MITCHELL: Just a quick
note from my perspective.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.570
We've all heard these
stories, and they're real.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.220
These things do happen.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.910
And I think it's
a risk assessment.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.990
You have more to
gain, or more to lose.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.390
And I like to say that,
for the most part,

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.640
I think I have more
to gain by sharing.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.050
That being said, people
are creatures of habit

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:59.210
and do develop reputations
for doing these things.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:01.910
So to some degree, that can be
part of your risk assessment.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.785
You can find out-- if
somebody's specifically

00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:07.940
asking about an idea of yours,
that it's in an idea state,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.720
check it out.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.584
SPEAKER 2: Thoughts, Katia?

00:39:12.584 --> 00:39:14.460
KATIA BERTOLDI:
No, I totally agree

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.265
with what Laurence and Jay say.

00:39:17.265 --> 00:39:19.090
Typically I tend to be open.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.580
I know there is some risk
associated with that,

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.450
but I really think that the
advantages in being open

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.190
are much larger and much
more than the disadvantages,

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.680
because what you
want to make sure

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.690
is that people know
about what you're doing.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.010
And if you are very secretive,
and you keep everything

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.717
as a secret, people
don't get to know.

00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:37.800
And maybe then you really
run the risk of somebody

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.380
get the same idea without
knowing what you're doing,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.253
and they get it.

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.590
JAMES MITCHELL: Last thought.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.190
People love collaborating
with Harvard.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.400
So if they're from
without, it can definitely

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.570
be used to your advantage.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.200
SPEAKER 3: I just
had a question.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.130
I was reflecting on all the
various things you said,

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:06.660
and in some sense, it's, no
offense, a bit of a downer.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:11.060
I was curious if you could speak
to-- the point of this exercise

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.157
is to have fun on some
level, and to live

00:40:14.157 --> 00:40:14.990
an interesting life.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.850
And I was wondering what things
you've done over the years

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.690
to preserve the actual point
of the exercise in the face

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.980
of worrying about money, and
worrying about promotion,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.670
and all of that.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.669
How do you keep the joy?

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.200
KATIA BERTOLDI: Well, I'm
still proud when I meet people

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.370
outside Harvard in the evening.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.299
And after a while, they
ask me, what's your job.

00:40:41.299 --> 00:40:42.590
And I tell them what I'm doing.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.060
They're very surprised.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.760
And what I always
tell my husband,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.000
the day they assume I'm a
faculty, I'm going to quit.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
So I think it's possible to
keep a level of joy inside,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.410
and to combine it with
an academic career

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.670
and with your job.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.970
And also, within the job,
I think it's a lot of fun.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.430
I really enjoy interacting
with the students.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.032
And I'm probably more fun now
than when I was a post-doc

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.240
and I was doing the research.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.860
I was in the lab by myself.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.980
Now I'm in the lab only
over summer a few times.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.960
Most of my time, I'm in my
office writing or a meeting

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.090
with people.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.470
But it's still a lot
of-- it's even more fun

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.950
because now I have the ability
to work on multiple projects

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.930
and develop more ideas, and to
work with these extremely smart

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.880
people, it's just amazing.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.540
LAURENCE RALPH: Yeah, I would
echo some of those comments.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:41.590
I think that the people
in both of my departments

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:47.770
are leading figures of
the kind of research

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.150
I do in different ways.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.500
And so the ability to have
just conversations with them,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.150
the ability to pick
their brain, the ability

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:02.040
to get concrete feedback from
them is actually enjoyable,

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.940
and it's actually helped me
personally and professionally

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.970
as well.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:14.150
And so I think that things
loom large in the background.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.750
But I think that being here
and having the platform that we

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.530
have and having the kind
of interactions that we

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:26.470
have is a humbling experience.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.100
It's a fun experience.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.090
And also, just the
amount of people

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:34.830
that circulate through
Harvard at any given semester,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:38.840
let alone a year, is a
really, really fun experience.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:46.560
And you really have the
resources to just imagine

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.410
what you want to happen.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.900
There's no person
that I can think

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:57.700
of that I couldn't imagine
inviting to Harvard, period.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.940
That includes, I don't
know, entertainers.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.190
It includes scholars.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.720
It includes athletes.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.900
It includes anybody who
I would want to meet.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:14.140
And I think it's not out
of the realm of possibility

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.360
that they would
accept an invitation.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.720
And so I think being able to
have that kind of imagination

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.820
is fun.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.570
It's part of the reason
why I wanted to be

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.863
a professor in the first place.

00:43:33.142 --> 00:43:35.350
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Jay, do
you want to add anything?

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.780
JAMES MITCHELL: I'd just
echo these sentiments.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.170
Doing research is
what drives me,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.100
and this is the best place
in the world to do it.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.387
And that makes me very happy.

00:43:44.387 --> 00:43:46.220
And I feel very lucky
to be able to do that.

00:43:49.057 --> 00:43:50.390
STEPHEN GRAY: I have a question.

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.931
Stephen Gray.

00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:53.070
I have a question
to sort of follow up

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:57.440
on that one that relates
to balance and time

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.945
management and joy.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.690
Being someone-- I just recently
came from private practice

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.600
and I had a half time
appointment at MIT.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.850
But primarily, my contribution
was through my practice.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.330
So now I'm moving fully into
the academic realm, which is

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.740
a little bit different for me.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.690
But I also have a young
child, and I have a partner.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.670
My wife, who would
love to make sure

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.770
that she sees me
at the same hour

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.100
all the time in some
sort of predictable way.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:31.030
So what do people do for
balance with their partners

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.020
and their children,
and carving out time

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.900
strategically to do the things
that we need to do in order

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.100
to push thinking in our
respective disciplines?

00:44:43.372 --> 00:44:45.080
JAMES MITCHELL: I'll
take a stab at that.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.500
I have three kids who are in
the middle school to high school

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.340
range.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.120
And I think one of the biggest
advantages of being in academia

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.090
is you can set your
own schedule, largely.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:58.790
I don't travel that
much by choice.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.230
So I can do all
the little things

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.070
that many of my colleagues
in other fields can't do.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.480
I can go to breakfast shares.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.470
I can go to plays in
the middle of the day.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.170
I can do all those little things
that cumulatively, I think,

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.340
really enrich my life.

00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:19.850
KATIA BERTOLDI: I think one of
the big advantages of academia

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.090
is flexibility.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.220
But then we need also to
be very careful about that

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.380
because my husband
has an industrial job.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.720
So it's 7:00 to 5:00.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.690
At 5:00, they get out
and it's over, right?

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.130
And then you start
the day after.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.660
When you have a
flexible job, you

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.670
have the tendency
to run over, right?

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.720
And there's so much to do.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.410
But I think at a
certain point, it's

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.960
important to recognize that even
if you spend eight days a week

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.360
and 48 hours a day,
it's not enough to do

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.380
what you should do.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:50.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.790
There are limits.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.960
And you need to
accept your limits.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.100
And apparently, it's not
possible to do everything

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.240
you would like to do.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:05.570
And just accept that, and try
to find a good compromise.

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:09.534
And it's also true that the
tenure process is quite long.

00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:11.200
In Engineering School,
it's seven years.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.840
It might be longer,
but probably I

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.320
don't think it might
be much shorter.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.830
So maybe you want to spend--
if it's one month time period,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.880
you're willing to spend all the
period just doing one thing.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.587
But for seven years,
it's 1/10 of your life.

00:46:25.587 --> 00:46:28.170
So it's really important to make
sure you find a good balance.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.980
ELIZABETH ANCARANA:
Question here?

00:46:37.925 --> 00:46:38.800
SPEAKER 4: Thank you.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.940
My question is directed
to all the panelists,

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.510
but I think it's
gets a little bit

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.430
to the point around networking.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.630
And it's about how
much time you try

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.430
to dedicate-- if there's a
specific amount of time--

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:55.110
to engagement in non-research
or non-academic activities

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.570
within your
departments or schools.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.944
And I'm specifically thinking
about committee engagement.

00:46:58.944 --> 00:47:00.270
I have two extremes.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.270
I have a secondary
appointment in the Department

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.430
of Biostatistics where
literally in any given week,

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.580
I'll get three requests
for committee membership

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.820
of academics or
curriculum that would take

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.452
five hours a week for months.

00:47:16.452 --> 00:47:18.410
On the other extreme, in
my primary appointment

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.020
in the Department of Global
Health and Social Medicine,

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.720
I know these committees exist,
but there's no open invitation

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.890
to join them.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.390
And I'm just wondering,
one, how much

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.910
do you value these
memberships in committees

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.130
both in terms of your
professional enjoyment,

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.260
but also your
professional advancement.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.800
Two, do you have a set
idea of how much time

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.930
you would want to try to
commit to those activities?

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.050
How do you balance that
when you, like you said,

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.410
have so many things that
you're trying to balance.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.140
And then three, are
there any committees

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.190
that you've just really
learned a lot from,

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.930
or that you would recommend
that junior faculty get involved

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.850
in because they can learn
a lot about the underbelly

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.990
of the school, or
how things work,

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:03.434
or how promotion
committees work.

00:48:03.434 --> 00:48:06.836
LAURENCE RALPH: Yeah,
I'll take a stab at that.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.240
For me, it's been trial
and error, actually.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.400
Just figuring it out.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.580
I think my approach
has been committees

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:24.410
that-- particularly when it's
outside of the department

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:30.520
or the departments that I'm
in, just wider FAS committees,

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.740
it's been things that I enjoy,
and that I know that will

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.650
nourish me in a different way.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.890
So I'm on the committee
for public service.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.860
And I think thinking
through those ideas

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.880
around public service
and meeting students who

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.590
are interested in public
service in particular,

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:55.870
I think that is fun for me.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.200
Or women and gender
studies, or ethnic studies.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.540
So basically, I'm
on committees that

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:11.990
enhance my research interests
outside of what I specifically

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.334
do.

00:49:13.334 --> 00:49:16.590
But as far as committees
for the department,

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:20.540
I think setting limits is
a good idea, especially

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.650
for me in two departments.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:30.240
I think that it's
fine to say that I'm

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.210
on this number of committees
in this department,

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:36.980
and this on this, so I really
can't take anything on.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.730
Or there's committees
that are only

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:43.000
particular to specific
times of the year

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.690
that you can plan
to manage, or manage

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.490
your time in different ways.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.810
Prize committees are like that.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.200
So if you're on a
prize committee,

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.020
it's really at the
end of the year

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.250
that you would
have to read a lot.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.240
But it's only sustained
for a couple of weeks,

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.160
and then it's over.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.340
So you could do that.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.540
Like the Hoopes Prize
is one of those things

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.470
where it's actually enjoyable.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.690
You actually get to read
a lot of different theses

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.020
from students
doing amazing work.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.010
And it's a lot of
work, but it's a lot

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.690
of work for a particular amount
of time, and then it's over.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:29.560
And this same thing with
selection committees

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:36.820
for graduate school when you're
admitting graduate students.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.270
That's a particular
time of the year,

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.980
at the end of the
first semester.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:45.260
But once you're done
that, it's kind of done.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:52.900
And that way, you can be a good
citizen to your department,

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.780
but you're not in
committees where

00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.740
you have to meet on a regular
basis for the whole year.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.240
And so I would
think strategically

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:09.420
about the kinds of committees
that you like personally.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.050
The ones-- what kind of time
commitment they take up.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.620
When in the year they take
up those time commitments.

00:51:20.465 --> 00:51:22.100
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.120
it's trial and error,
because you'll figure out

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.920
which ones that you
enjoy, and which ones

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.550
that you don't want to do.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:35.570
And it's really a personal
thing on many levels,

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.950
whether you enjoy
curriculum or you

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:41.680
enjoy hands on
student committees,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.510
or you enjoy things like that.

00:51:48.467 --> 00:51:50.050
JAMES MITCHELL: No
is a full sentence.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.220
For me, it's very
difficult to say,

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.710
and I think the advice from
Laurence is really good.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.040
But even some committees-- the
one I least like to serve on

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.670
is the IACUC committee, the
animal ethical committee.

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:08.600
It's a huge time commitment.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.770
But I'd have to say, I've
learned a tremendous amount

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.800
from that one.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:18.140
Not just about the business
itself, but also because it's

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.920
on a Harvard Medical area, the
Longwood Medical area level.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.600
So it's closer to a
university level committee.

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.530
And that's been really
interesting starting

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.202
as a young assistant
professor who naively accepts

00:52:32.202 --> 00:52:34.160
an offer from his department
chairman who said,

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.360
oh, it's just a
few times a year.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.780
Really not a big deal.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:43.070
So it was a hidden opportunity,
I would say, to learn a lot.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.700
SPEAKER 5: So
actually, following up

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.770
on that exact point.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.140
I'm curious to know what
your strategies have

00:52:54.140 --> 00:53:01.820
been around the art of saying
no, whether it's committee

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.120
meetings or service,
maybe guest lecturing,

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.180
or doing review
articles or chapters.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.620
How have you all
navigated saying

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.680
no, particularly to senior level
people within your departments?

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.005
KATIA BERTOLDI: It's not easy.

00:53:18.005 --> 00:53:19.870
It's not easy.

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:23.110
So at the beginning, I
was afraid to say no.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.160
And so I said a lot of yes.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.680
But then I ran into trouble.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.330
Big trouble, because
I was over-committed,

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.460
and then I was not able to
deliver what I promised.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.430
So quickly realized
that that was

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.670
much worse than saying
no at the very beginning,

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:41.910
because if you say yes, then
the person expects something

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.250
from you.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.000
And then, you need to deliver.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.450
So I quickly realized that.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:52.080
Fortunately, at the beginning,
you have the excuse,

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:52.690
you're young.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:55.480
So you can use the excuse,
sorry, I over-committed.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.615
I didn't realize that.

00:53:56.615 --> 00:53:58.323
And come out with this
sort of apologies.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.420
So if you say too
many yes, you will

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.440
learn at a certain point
you need to say no.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.050
But I think it's better to say
no from the very beginning, so

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:09.549
yeah.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.698
LAURENCE RALPH:
So some strategies

00:54:16.698 --> 00:54:21.323
that are complicated that
I've had trouble with.

00:54:21.323 --> 00:54:24.980
One is the deferral strategy,
because people do remember

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.550
and they do ask you later.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:30.930
So that one doesn't always work.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.130
I think setting limits
actually is a good one in terms

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:42.240
of-- this is what I've
committed to for the year,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.370
and I can't do anything
above that in order

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.670
to do what I have to do.

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:51.570
I think people understand that.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.726
And that goes for, I
think, travel as well,

00:54:54.726 --> 00:54:58.380
like when people are
inviting you to things.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.000
You'll get suddenly
a lot of invitations,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.370
and setting limits.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.470
Really thinking intentionally
of how many times

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:07.970
this semester am I going
to leave or go out of town,

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:09.680
or something like
that, because that

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:13.370
will affect your ability to
deliver what you promised here

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.210
as well.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:20.730
And I think one of the
biggest strategies,

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:24.600
though, is asking people
how to say no, too.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.890
I think this office is good
at giving advice about that.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:34.290
Like you can ask somebody,
or even ask a mentor,

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:39.750
what kinds of things can I say
no to, and what kinds of things

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:43.230
are really good for me to
do, or expected of me to do?

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:46.610
Or if you can't
actually do something.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.440
A lot of times,
you can't actually

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.710
do things because you can't
be in two places at one

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:53.480
time, things like that.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.980
But just the minutia
of knowing how

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:03.530
to frame a response to somebody,
you can seek out help for that.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.366
And it can be very useful.

00:56:10.141 --> 00:56:12.390
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: We
probably have time for one more

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:17.990
question, if anyone has any.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:20.540
OK, well this was
really informative.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.520
Really wonderful.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.250
Thank you to all three
of our panelists,

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:25.270
Katia, Jay, and Laurence.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:34.070
We have time for about
a 15 minute break,

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:39.570
but we're going to start
again right promptly at 3:45

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:42.450
with our tenured faculty panel.
