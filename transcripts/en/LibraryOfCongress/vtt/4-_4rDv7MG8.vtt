00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.250
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's June
7th 2018 and I'm Nancy Groce.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400
I'd like to welcome
Andrea Graham here

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.150
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.540
Andrea has just given a
wonderful Botkin lecture

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.070
on the Art of the Hunt
and is a well-known

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.970
and widely respected folklorist
especially known for her work

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.270
on the Intermountain West.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.570
We're going to be talking a
bit about your career, Andrea.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.040
How you got into folklore
and what you're doing in some

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.790
of your projects because
you've been involved

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.680
in many projects over the years.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.980
Welcome.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.280
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Okay.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let
me start by--

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.880
Where are you from originally?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.180
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Born

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.480
in Schenectady New
York upstate New York

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.240
and lived there till
I was in junior high.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.820
Then my family moved to
suburban Philadelphia

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.450
so I finished high school there.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.300
Went to college at
University of Pennsylvania.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.830
My parents were always--
We were always travelling.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.810
We would always visit things
like local historical societies

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.610
and historic house museums.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.680
We'd have to ride
the steam trains

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.070
because my dad loves old trains.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.840
I grew up interested
in local stuff

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.690
and then every place
had a story.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.630
I think that influenced
my later interests.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You did
folklorist at undergraduate?

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.910
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: No.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.910
I was anthropology as an
undergraduate at Penn.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.290
I started as a biology
major and I quickly figured

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.820
out that wasn't exactly
what I wanted to do.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.800
It was more human behavior,
so I switched to anthropology.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.660
Then I took an introduction
to folklore class

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.630
from Barbara
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020
when I was probably a
sophomore or a junior.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.400
That was it.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.410
That opened up all
the possibilities like

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.370
"This is what I want to do."

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.020
It's everyday life but it's the
creative parts of everyday life.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.070
She talked about
nicknames and jokes.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.360
We went on field trips to a
palm reader in Philadelphia.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.750
It was just a wonderful class
and she's a fantastic teacher.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.140
That's why I became
a folklorist.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.720
I finished my undergrad
as an anthropology major

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.910
and then immediately applied
to the folklore program

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.300
that was at Penn at the time.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.360
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
was it, the leading one

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.660
in the country in the-?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.960
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.260
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This
was in the 70s?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.560
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.860
Undergrad I graduated in '78.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.040
I just had my 40th reunion.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Congratulations.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.640
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I didn't go.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.460
Then two more years of
grad school at Penn.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.020
I never wanted a PhD.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.680
I never wanted to be
a college professor.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.520
I wanted to be a
public folklorist.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.440
I didn't even know
that term didn't exist.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.990
It was just getting
started in the mid 70s.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.950
I didn't know there
was such a thing

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.930
but I knew that's what
I wanted to do maybe

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.220
from spending all this
time visiting museums.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.820
My mother used to
work in a museum.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.120
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Where
did she work?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.930
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: In
Schenectady Museum.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.560
I spent many hours looking
through their exhibits.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.020
I had that interest that I
want to learn about this stuff

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.500
but I wanted to bring
it back to a public.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.760
I knew that's what
I wanted to do.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.430
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were really
among the first generation

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.820
of public folklorists.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.610
The NEA was just setting

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.410
up state folklorist
programs in the late 70s.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.130
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Mid 70s
is when the NEA program,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.800
the Library of Congress
program were established.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.120
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What was your
first job as a folklorist?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.830
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: It was working
at the Blue Ridge Institute

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.910
in Ferrum, Virginia-- far rural
southwestern Virginia south

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.210
of Roanoke.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.240
A friend of mine in grad
school had mentioned

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.280
that she knew the guy
who was the director

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.650
who had gone to Cooperstown.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.250
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who was that?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.680
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Roddy Moore.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.380
I just wrote him a letter.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.990
This was back when you mailed
letters looking for jobs.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.540
I just wrote and
said, "This friend

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.830
of mine mentioned
your organization.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.130
I'm looking for work."

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.880
He wrote back and said, "We
don't have anything right now

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.110
but we've applied for NEA
funding to set up an internship,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.110
sort of a training
position for here.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.100
We'll let you know."

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.210
He did. He got back to
me in the fall and said,

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.860
"We've got this funding."

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.120
He was up visiting family in
New Jersey so we actually met

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.030
up and did an interview.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.070
That was my first job.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.900
It was a small regional
folk life program based

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.660
at a little Methodist college.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.700
They did a folk life festival.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.000
They did exhibits.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.220
I helped them set up an archive.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.310
I learned to write
for program books

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.450
and write press releases
and exhibit text.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.120
Everything that I do today
I learned on that job.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.090
My education at Penn
was very theoretical.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.760
There were no classes
in public folklore.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.680
That first job, that
was my training ground.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.240
It was a wonderful experience.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.540
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: How
long were you there?

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.790
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I was
there for almost two years.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.090
They had a farm museum.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.390
They had moved in a farm
building so I got to dress

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.610
up and cook over a pyre.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.090
It was very small and
everybody got to do everything.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.170
They just threw me in
and said, "Do this."

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do you remember
your first interview there,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.310
first field work?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.770
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
I did a project.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.680
They let me pick a
little field project.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.080
I researched funeral traditions.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.120
I'm not sure why I was
interested in that.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.300
I had done some gravestone
research earlier in grad school.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.140
I interviewed-- I don't even
remember who I interviewed now

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.630
but I found some
interesting old photographs

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.770
and poked around in cemeteries.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Then from
Ferrum where did you go next?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.880
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Next
was the 1982 World's Fair

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.400
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You
were involved in that?

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.000
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I was
involved in the World's Fair.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I've
heard stories.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.600
Tell me about that.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.860
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: There was
this whole folk life festival

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.660
component of the World's
Fair which went for 6 months.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.510
It was 7 days a week, 10
hours a day of performers

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.910
and craft demonstrators.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.730
I was running the food
demonstration area.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.010
We had a working
moonshine still.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.050
A bunch of folklorists
worked there.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.350
A lot of--

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.650
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who else
was down there at the time?

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.080
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Blanton Owen was the head.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.870
What was his name?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.920
Dick Van Kleeck was
sort of the manager.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.260
I'm not sure where he is now.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.660
Blanton was sort of
the senior folklorist.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.830
He did a lot of fieldwork
and scheduling everybody.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.270
Drew Beisswenger worked there.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.890
I'm trying to remember who else.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.190
A lot of folklorists--

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was Peter
Bartis down there at the time?

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.790
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
I don't think so.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.140
I think maybe Mick Moloney did
some of the original research

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.130
and planning for the festival.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.240
Lots of artists came through.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.760
I was going to say something--

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
really learning under fire.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.070
Six months every day?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.370
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.950
6 months every day all day.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.550
Mary Hufford is the one who--
She started out working here

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.590
and she set up the
Foodways program.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.700
Then she got the job at
the Library of Congress

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.210
and she left a month or two in.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.680
I was able to step in and do
the Foodways demonstration.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.060
We had people cooking possums.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.970
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The usual.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.270
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.920
Fried apple pies and grits.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.410
Southern food traditions.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.430
Then we had this working
moonshine still that was

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.640
with some very entertaining
characters who were in charge

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.220
of it and telling all kinds
of lies to the visitors.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That
was in the early 80s?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.900
'84?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.200
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: '82.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: '82?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.800
Then-- ?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.900
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Then we
went without work for a while

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.850
because the festival ended.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.150
I was with--

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.450
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: When
you say 'we'?

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.750
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I was with
Blanton Owen at that time.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Were you
married at that point?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.350
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Not at that point.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.650
We were married later.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:19.610
We lived in western North
Carolina near his brother.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.330
There was a house that
needed house sitters.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.950
We had a place to stay
and applied for jobs.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.650
Then he got a job in Florida
at the Florida program

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.540
to start their apprenticeship
program.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.500
We moved to White
Springs, Florida.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.930
I did some contract work.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.370
Then one of the other staff
people had left for a year

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.370
to go back and get
a Master's degree

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.200
so I filled in for her position.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who was that?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.200
Peggy Bulger?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.500
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Mary.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.800
Peggy was there at the
time and Ormond Loomis-

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.400
Peggy Bulger was there?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.700
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Peggy Bulger.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.000
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who
was here at the library

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.300
for many years, of course.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.600
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Right.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.900
Yeah. Ormond Loomis was the
director of the program.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.200
Nancy Nusz was there
when I was there.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.500
It was a great group
of folks too.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It remains a
small field but at that time

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.360
in the early 80s there weren't

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.060
that many people doing
public sector folklore.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.410
I remember looking at everybody
as sort of an extended family.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.340
Do you have those memories too?

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.640
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Oh, yeah.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.270
I got to know people by working,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.080
and especially working
in the South.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.640
There were a lot of
folklorists there.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.950
I got to know a lot
of those folks

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.950
and Blanton had known a lot
of them too through music.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.670
He'd been in the field
longer than I had.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It was
slightly different than say,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.960
being a historian where if you
came to someone's town you sort

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.410
of expected them to put you up

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.400
and stop everything
and take you around.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.860
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Oh, yeah.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: At least I
had a lot of houseguests.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.470
You probably had a lot of
houseguests too at that time.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.770
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Maybe we
were all just so underpaid

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.770
that that was the way we got by.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.070
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.170
These were all short term
contract jobs, some of them.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.480
The first five years
was all grants

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.040
or the World's Fair
that had an end.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.250
That was in the South.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.680
The first five years
I worked in the South.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.730
Parts of it I miss.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.250
The culture is so
rich and the music

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.960
and just the language
and storytelling.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.680
I always really enjoyed that.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: When
and how did you get

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.610
to shift your focus to the West?

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.760
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Blanton had interviewed

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.430
for the Nevada Arts
Council folklorist position.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.730
It was a brand new position.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.320
It was in 1980.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.620
No, '85.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: These were
the state folklorist positions

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.720
that [inaudible] had--

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.020
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Right.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.320
They had applied--

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.620
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: They
were at the NEA, right?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.410
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: -- applied for
NEA funding to start a position.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.840
Partly what helped him get the
position was the first national

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.280
cowboy poetry gathering which
happened in January 1985.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.180
The arts council had just gone
to the legislature saying,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.220
"We would like to have
a folklorist position."

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.620
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This
was in Elko?

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.450
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: The
arts council was in Reno.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.110
The state government
is in Carson City.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.110
They had gone to the
legislature and said,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.060
"We would like a
folklorist position."

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.500
Then the cowboy poetry
gathering happened

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.310
which got tremendous
national publicity

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.360
and stories in TIME Magazine.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.180
The arts council was able to go
in to the legislature and say,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.960
"This is why we need
a folklorist.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.090
They'll do this kind of stuff
and bring attention to Nevada

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.670
and feature Nevada artists."

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.250
That first gathering
really sparked the position.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:41.510
Blanton got the position in the
fall of '85 as the folklorist

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.580
for the Nevada Arts Council,
so we moved to Nevada.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.130
That was a culture shock.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.740
Although me moving from
suburban Philadelphia to Ferrum,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.970
Virginia was a pretty
big culture shock too,

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.270
though I loved it.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.390
I grew up in the
suburbs but I've always

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.730
since then gravitated to small
towns and small communities.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.030
I just like that better.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.980
We lived in this little
town, Virginia City

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.370
in Nevada even though
the office was in Reno.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.650
He started that program.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.270
I did some contract work.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.000
We did a lot of work together.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.430
I ended up writing for the local
weekly newspaper just piecing

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.750
together work.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.820
I had no training
as a journalist

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.540
but I knew how to
interview people.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.400
That was really fun.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.430
We got connected with the
Western Folklife Centre,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.730
the Cowboy Poetry Gathering.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.380
We would go out to that every
year and help with that event.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Who was
running that at the time?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.000
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Hal.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.640
Hal Cannon who had started it.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.080
He was still the
artistic director.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.380
I worked in Nevada.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.860
Then Blanton and I split
up in about five years.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.900
1990. He took a leave from
the job at the arts council

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.020
and they hired me as a
replacement because they knew me

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.990
and I knew the whole
history of the program.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.690
Then he ended up just
resigning from that position

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.620
so I took over that position.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:17.290
1990 to 2000, 10 years I worked
for the state arts council.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.840
It moved from Reno to Carson
City in that time to the capital

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.710
where it should have
been, where it belonged.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.560
It was much easier
to have a presence

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.730
with other state agencies
and the legislature

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.470
when we were in the capital.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What kind

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.190
of field work were
you doing in Nevada?

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.410
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I did a lot
of work in Las Vegas which was

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.820
at that point, the early
90s, was just starting

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.050
to really explode
population wise.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.930
People were coming in
from all over the world,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.120
all over the country
for jobs, service jobs.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.680
There was a tremendous
number of immigrants

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.130
from South America,
the Philippines.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.610
There was an Ethiopian
community.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.000
Those communities were
really starting to grow.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.280
We did a lot of field work
with those newcomer groups.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680
It was hard because a lot

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.080
of them hadn't found
each other yet.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.990
It's a 24 hour town.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.480
People are working
different shifts.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.580
It was very hard for
people to get together.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.250
It was hard to do fieldwork

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.240
because people hadn't
made those connections.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.820
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Were you doing
work with the casinos at all?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.120
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: A little bit.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.610
We did a little bit of work with
the traditions of the casinos.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.800
Like craps dealers have
an incredible language

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.070
that they talk to each other
so they can communicate

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.820
without the players
knowing what they're saying.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.710
They have different
kinds of rolls

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.010
and different kinds of bets.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.840
It's a very rich language.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.780
There was actually a craps
dealer who was documenting.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.560
He was documenting the
occupational traditions

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.990
of that field.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I know
some of your fieldwork

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.540
from that period I
think has just come

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.010
into the Library of Congress.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.240
Is some of this material in our
collection now, do you think?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.080
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I think
it was the stuff from '85

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.620
to '90 is what's
been sent so far.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.230
That was mainly when Blanton
was running the program

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.130
but I did a lot of
that fieldwork,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.190
helped with a lot
of that fieldwork.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.600
Yeah, the arts council has been
getting that stuff organized.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.940
It's all slides and black and
white film and cassette tapes.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We're
delighted to have it here.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:28.150
The material I've seen
has been excellent.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.730
The archivists love that it's
coming in in very good shape.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.030
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.860
Rebecca [inaudible] who works
for the arts council as one

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.300
of their folklorist
program managers

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.050
and is really good
at organizing stuff.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.170
I think she's working on
the next batch of stuff.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.260
There was a lot of
stuff from Las Vegas.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.870
We started a folklife festival

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.610
down there working
with the city.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.160
The county cultural affairs

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.030
and the state museum
had a branch there

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.230
and put together a festival

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.770
to feature these
artists who had come in.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.890
A lot of people who lived
there didn't know about.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.850
Didn't know these
newcomer artists.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:08.180
It kept going for-- I'm
not sure it's still going.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.330
We eventually had to pull back

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.560
because it was just
taking all of our time.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.660
We had also started a similar
festival in Reno working

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.340
with the local arts council.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.680
We started in Reno.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.670
We were doing two
festivals a year

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.230
and we couldn't do
anything else.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.940
The idea was that these local
groups would pick it up.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.040
The Reno group wasn't able to.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.760
Las Vegas they kept it
going for quite a while.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.690
Then we also had an
apprenticeship program.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.450
We were working with a lot

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.600
of Native American
artist do that program.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.130
Basket makers.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.450
There was a revival of basket
making among the Washoe,

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.050
Paiute and Western Shawnee
were the three main tribes.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.430
They organized a basket makers
group that we helped support

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.660
that was teaching and really
strengthening that tradition.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.000
That was wonderful to see.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
a nice feeling

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.090
when you feel you've helped
sustain something and--

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.390
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.690
It came from them.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.990
The impetus came from them.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:19.660
We were just able to support
it, fund it and promote it.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:26.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You left the
Nevada Arts Council in 2000?

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.890
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: 2000.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Where
did you go from there?

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.080
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: From there
I went to Pocatello, Idaho.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.200
I met another guy
who lived there.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.170
We got married and moved there.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.850
He had a daughter who lived
there so he couldn't leave.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.160
I was the one who had to move.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.100
He had a much better
paying job than I did.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.060
He understood I was
going to be freelancing

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.290
and that was okay with him.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.860
I was able to do
quite a bit of work.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.140
I just let people know that I
was available for contract work,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.110
and especially people
in state arts councils.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.320
They're so busy doing
paperwork and managing grants

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.980
that they never have time
to go out and do fieldwork.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.170
That's what they
needed help with.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.840
Those people they would
have a particular region

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.330
or a particular topic and
they needed some fieldwork.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.600
I did a lot of contract
fieldwork.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.740
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Small jobs?

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.040
Small contract jobs?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.340
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: For
example what?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.940
What were you doing?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.240
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: One of
them was back in Nevada.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.380
A county on the Utah
border, just one county.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.310
They hadn't really done
much work out there

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.890
and wanted a folklife survey
of who was there in the way

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.230
of traditional artists.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.640
I did that.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.710
Then actually the county next
to it, the adjoining county

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.800
in Utah they had been talking

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.150
about creating a heritage
area in that region.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.040
It was originally
supposed to be bigger

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.340
and other people backed out.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.020
It was these two
counties centered

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.790
on Great Basin National Park
which is right on the border.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.560
The people in Utah knew
that I was working in Nevada

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.020
and they said, "Would you
come do this same thing here

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.020
on our side of the line?"

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.140
We worked through the state
arts council in Utah and got,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.910
I think it was the
humanities funding.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.850
Then I did a field survey
in that adjoining county.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.790
We had the two counties and
made some recommendations

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.890
on these are the things
that you could promote

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.190
through a heritage area.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.300
It is now the Great
Basin Heritage Area.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Could you just
take a minute and describe

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.490
when you do a survey, how
do you go about doing it?

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.790
You're dropped in the middle

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.090
of someplace you've
never been before.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.060
Where do you even start?

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.120
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Usually
you have a few leads.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.710
Maybe somebody, whoever set up
the project knows a few people.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.970
You just start with
those people and ask them

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.000
if they know anybody else who
does these kind of things and--

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What kind

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.900
of things would you be
looking for say in that area?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:07.850
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Quilters, wood carvers,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.530
occupational traditions.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.160
I've always included that even

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.830
if it's working for
an arts council.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.260
Cowboy poetry would be.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.720
I mean that's ranching
community.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.550
Different occupations.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.460
If t has a history of mining
so not really active anymore

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:31.250
but people who used to work
in the mining industry.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.550
Local museums.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.490
I always go to the local museum
because they know people.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.190
Sometimes they'll have
stuff in their collection

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.190
which is obviously
a homemade something

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.800
and you say, "Who made that?"

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.870
I was working in Idaho
in Twin Falls, Idaho.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:52.300
Went into a museum and saw these
little folded paper umbrellas

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.640
and Japanese lanterns
made out of folded paper.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.250
I said, "Who made those?"

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.530
They said, "This old Japanese
guy who's lived here all

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.830
his life."

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.600
I got his name and went
and interviewed him

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.910
about how he made these out
of old place mats that he got

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.100
from a senior center because
he needed a whole bunch

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.140
with the same design.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.410
Just these folded
paper umbrellas.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.250
I found him at a museum.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.110
Local museums are
great resources.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Have you heard
the term 'windscreen survey'?

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.770
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.850
Some of it is just
driving around

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.720
and looking at the landscape.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.770
People make customized
mailboxes.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.140
I love those.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.080
They look like tractors
or whatever.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.760
I'll take pictures of those.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.460
That's the kind of
windscreen stuff.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.770
Or ranch gates.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.040
Like I talked about in the talk,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.930
who makes those metal
signs on ranch gates?

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.750
Sometimes you can find out
and talk to that person.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.550
Shops. Sometimes local shops
will have local artisans' work.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.820
I found a guy who makes
willow furniture doing this

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.610
Nevada survey.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.770
I think he had some little
baskets or something in a shop.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.370
I found out who he was.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's sort of
like detective work, yeah?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.460
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: It is.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.670
Everyone you talk to you
ask, "Do you know anyone else

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:29.490
who makes things or
sings songs or whatever?"

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:35.970
Cowboy gear makers, sometimes
they're harder to find

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.600
because they just make gear for
their friends unless you happen

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.350
to talk to somebody
who knows them.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.650
Local architecture.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:52.900
If there's a distinct building
style, especially on ranches.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Like
barns or fencing?

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.490
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Farms or fences.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.490
There are traditional patterns

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.940
of the way people will
set up a ranchstead.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.240
[Coughs].

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were
at Pocatello till when?

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.870
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I was there
for nine years, I think.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.450
I had been doing some
contract fieldwork in Wyoming

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.900
for the arts council on
this hunting project.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.790
I'd also had a long
term contract

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.780
with the South Dakota Arts
Council managing their state

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.600
folk arts program.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.890
They only have three
people on their staff.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:42.820
It's a very small agency
but they got NEA funding

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.730
for a contract folklorist
position

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.100
to manage their program.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.110
They had an apprenticeship
program.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.780
Then I would do various
projects, a lot of exhibits.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.090
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were working

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.230
in both Wyoming and
South Dakota?

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.840
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah, as
part time work and I would--

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: How
much driving did you do?

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.600
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
My poor little car.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.170
I was putting 20,000
miles a year on my--

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: For field work?

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.080
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: -- on my
little car for fieldwork.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.520
In 2009 the University

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.890
of Wyoming American studies
program had established this

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.090
position basically for
a public folklorist.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.960
It's classified as a
researcher in their system--

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.900
probably one of their
research public programs.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.630
Annie Hatch at the Wyoming
Arts Council had worked

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.940
with John Dorst in the
American Studies program

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.860
to set this position up.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.780
They'd gotten NEA funding.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.610
That job opened up in 2009.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.510
I moved to Wyoming.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.600
That was only three
quarter time when it started

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.850
but I still had the
South Dakota contract

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.970
that had been going every year.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.480
I knew with the two of
those jobs together I could

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.890
support myself.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.190
[Laughter].

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.930
I moved to Laramie to
this small town in Wyoming

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.400
where the university is based.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.420
It's the only university
in the state,

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.930
the only four year university.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.930
The American Studies program
had been very supportive.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:15.060
Annie Hatch was there to work
with also at the arts council.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.040
We did this big Art
of the Hunt project

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.340
that was already underway.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.000
I'd actually done some
contract fieldwork--

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The one that
you just gave a Botkin lecture

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.050
on today, right?

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.350
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Right.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.650
I had done some fieldwork
already.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.640
Then when I came in I knew that
was going to be my big project.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.370
It was something that I
knew very little about.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.320
I don't have a hunting
background.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.100
It was a real education
but it relates

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.270
to everything in Wyoming.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.410
Hunting is just a part
embedded in the culture.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:52.160
It was a great way to
get to know the state.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
are you working on now?

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.230
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
After we finish the Art

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.530
of the Hunt project-

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which was 2014?

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.130
2015?

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.430
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
The exhibit was 2014

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.060
and it was up to Labor Day 2015.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.770
Then it was over.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.270
This had been 6 years
of my life.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.640
Annie and I both sat up
and said, "Now what?"

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.030
We had just been so
focused on that project.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:20.690
I have a lot of flexibility
at the university so I needed

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.670
to come up with another project.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.580
I had noticed driving
around doing a lot

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.270
of this survey work these
little community buildings,

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:32.080
community halls in either
very small towns or sometimes

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.630
out in the country not
near anything else.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.570
Some of them were
obviously still used,

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.330
some of them looked
like they weren't.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.930
I just got curious about
these community halls.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.940
I had seen them a
little bit in Nevada.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.260
I'd seen them in western South
Dakota in rural communities.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.280
I just got curious.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.090
Who built these halls?

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.930
When were they built?

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.070
Why? What were they used for?

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.370
Who are they-- ?

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: How do they
function in the community?

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.770
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Right.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.070
Why are some of them
still used and some

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.860
of them looks like aren't?

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.730
I picked that as my project
and started driving around

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.780
and finding these buildings
and trying to find someone

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.900
who would let me in-- figuring

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.110
out who the people
in charge were.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:21.550
A lot of them are
founded by women's clubs.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Really?

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.790
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Homemakers
clubs or through extension

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.290
or just a group of women in a
rural community who got together

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.780
to meet and visit and have
luncheons and whatever.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.950
Then they would decide, "Our
houses are too small for this.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.220
We need a place where the
community can get together

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.520
and meet."

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.180
They would raise money and
have bake sales and box socials

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.490
and get their husbands
to build a building.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:53.220
A lot of them, that's
how they happened.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.800
There's sort of a pattern
to them so they must have--

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.100
Were they communicating?

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.450
Did they hear about
others or see other ones?

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.960
Or was it just sort
of logical like,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.810
"We need a place
to get together.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.110
Let's build a building"?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.170
In some communities it was a
school that was already there,

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.850
like a one-roomed school sort
of served as a community center.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.390
A lot of those schools
have closed

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.500
when they were consolidated
and so they would turn them

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.340
into an official
community center.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.720
A lot of them are
former schools.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.790
Some of them the community,
for whatever reason, dried up

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.600
and people aren't there and
so the halls were abandoned.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.200
Some of them are very,
very actively used,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.610
especially the ones that
are really in small towns

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.160
so there are people around.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.950
A couple of them the
firemen meet there

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.980
and they have church
services there

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.790
and 4-H meets there
and a lot of them--

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: They're really
the nexus for their communities.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.940
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.270
A lot of them especially in
earlier days were dances.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.970
Every Saturday they'd have
a dance in these halls

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.440
that brought people together.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.890
Funerals, wedding showers,
anniversary parties.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.840
They're just wonderful
community spaces.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.770
How does a community develop
its sense of community?

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.360
These places really
help with that.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.650
I'm in the midst
of doing fieldwork.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.310
I have a list of about 80
so far around the state

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.470
and I know there are more.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:33.800
Just getting out on the road
and finding them or finding

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.570
out who has information
about them.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.930
That's the same thing.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.780
I go to one and I say, "Do
you know of any others here?"

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.080
They'll tell me and I'll say,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.380
"Who should I talk
to about that?"

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.870
and they'll get me
a phone number.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Just basic
fieldwork, that thing?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.990
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Fieldwork, detective work.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.290
Yeah.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: If you step
back, the whole idea of doing--

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.970
What attracts you to
the Intermountain West?

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:04.490
Is it the landscape or the
people or the way it played out?

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.890
Do you see it as
a unique region?

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.690
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
As a region, yeah.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.530
It's different than the
Midwest or the coast.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.950
I just got very fond of it.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.740
I never dreamed I'd end up
out West but these small--

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.100
Like I said, I like
smaller communities.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.910
It's much easier to do fieldwork

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.210
because everybody
knows everybody.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.790
You're never more than
two degrees of separation

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.130
from anybody in Wyoming.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.690
You talk to someone and you
find out you have someone

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.130
in common that you know.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.630
That happens all the time

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.350
and that's what I
love about Wyoming.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.560
It's not like Las Vegas.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.860
Especially when I was there

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.470
and these communities
hadn't coalesced.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:50.770
It was very hard to do fieldwork

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.450
because people didn't
know each other,

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.060
and that's how you do
fieldwork is making

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.420
that chain of connections.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:01.370
That's very easy to do in
small towns and rural areas.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.550
That's one thing that I like.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:09.340
These ranchers live 100 miles
apart and they know what's going

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.540
on in each other's lives more

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.700
than I know my next
door neighbors.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.920
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Why
do you think that is?

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.940
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: They
depend on each other.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.970
People have this idea
of, 'We're individuals'

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.580
and 'We don't need anybody',
but they totally need each other

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.880
and depend on each other.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.900
If someone's branding,
all the neighbors

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.550
for 100 miles will come and help
then they'll go help the other

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.510
neighbor in return.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:42.490
They do depend on each other
because they are so isolated.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.740
I think it's the same of
folklorists in the region too.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.720
When you move out the Western
regional folklorists had been

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.620
meeting in Logan, Utah for
several years in conjunction

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.130
with this Fife conference

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.830
that Utah State's
folklore program put on.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.930
They would bring in some
folklorists as presenters

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.670
and the Western public
folklorists.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.450
We tried to figure out
what the first year was

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.110
but it was in the early 1980s.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.690
It was the first regional group
of folklorists to get together.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.840
I think it was the same thing.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.830
We were so scattered.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.900
I wasn't there at the
time but they were so few

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.940
and so scattered they
needed to get together.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.900
It was like their
community hall.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.840
They had to get together
and support each other

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.510
and share stories about how they
were building their programs.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.830
They were all new
programs in their states.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.010
We connected with that
group when we got out West.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.800
That was wonderful in that
we were lifelong friends

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.910
and we would see each other once
a year, same with the ranchers,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.870
but we knew what we were up to.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.170
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You
kept in close.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.490
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: A
sense of community.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.960
Then when the cowboy poetry
gathering started which started

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.540
from that meeting, they
wanted a regional project

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.090
that they could do together.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.810
They had started hearing
about these cowboy poets

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.360
and realized they were all over.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.780
That was a regional project
that brought everyone together

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.910
and ended up as the gathering

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.740
and now the Western Folklife
Centre in Elko, Nevada.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.040
We get together there too.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.900
All the folklorists come
in and help host sessions.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The
community halls here--

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.370
Are you teaching also?

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.980
You were involved
with a field school

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.790
with the American
Folklorists Centre last summer.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.090
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:46.400
My job at the university
eventually two years ago became

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.700
full time.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.000
It had been three quarter time.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.810
The university found
some extra funding and--

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do I
remember rightly that that's

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.420
when you stopped
working at South Dakota?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.720
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
That's when I stopped.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.020
They overlapped.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.320
There was about nine months

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.450
where I was still doing
both and it was too much.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.750
I couldn't.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.050
I couldn't be in
two places at once.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.480
A year ago June I dropped
the South Dakota job

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.050
after 15 years, which was sad.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.740
I really liked it, but I
just couldn't keep doing it.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.350
The university job is full time.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.310
What was added was
teaching one course.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.480
I teach a course on public
sector work in American studies

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.650
which is mainly guest speakers;
people coming in from museums,

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:33.410
archives, humanities
council, main street programs.

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:37.140
All kinds of public
sector cultural work

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.840
so the students can
hear from people

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.740
who are actually
doing that work.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.120
I've taught it once.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.870
I'm teaching it again in
the fall, but I'm supposed

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.300
to teach that every year.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.120
That's been a new
challenge for me.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I forget,

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.120
did the American Folklife
Center approach you or you

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.240
and the Western folklorists
approached the American

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.540
Folklife Center?

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.840
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
For the field school?

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: For the
field school in 2017.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.040
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: The University

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.450
of Wyoming has a
research station

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.730
in Grand Teton National
Park right

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.610
on the shores of Jackson Lake.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.650
It started as a ranch and then
it was sort of vacation homes.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.750
There are all these
historic log buildings.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:21.020
All summer they have researchers
who come in, mostly biology

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.010
and geology and scientific
researchers who can stay there

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.750
and do research projects
in the park.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.050
I went up there.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.350
A colleague of mine

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.860
at the university was doing
historic preservation programs.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.870
She had a field school
out in Teton Park one

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.170
of the first years I was there.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.470
I went out for a couple of days

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.960
and we did some oral
history interviews.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.790
That's when I saw this
research station, the AMK ranch.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.070
I immediately said this
would be a perfect place

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.150
to do a folklife field school.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.670
It's so beautiful and it's
inexpensive to stay there

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.390
if you're connected
with the university.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:58.770
I had been thinking about it for
years but just me, by myself,

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.290
couldn't really organize
something

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.160
like that that far from home.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.100
I saw that the Utah state
folklore program had done a

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.110
field school a couple of
summers ago in Logan working

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.380
with the folklife center staff.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.900
I approached them.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.710
I said, "Are you guys
going to do this again?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.010
Would you like to
do a joint one?

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:20.010
I have this great place that
we could do a field school."

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.540
They said, "Well, okay."

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.330
It took us a year and
a half of planning

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.810
because of the logistics
of working that far away

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:31.020
from either of our bases.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:36.650
We talked to the cultural branch
at Teton Park about a project.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.580
Did they have any
research they wanted done?

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.390
They suggested dude ranching.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.080
There's one dude ranch
that's actually in the park,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.080
the last one that's still
operating in the park.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.840
They said, "We would like to--

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.450
What is contemporary
dude ranching traditions?

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.840
You could help us
document that."

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.670
We said, "That sounds great."

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.980
We worked with the folklife
center staff using your model--

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We have
mostly Maggie Kruesi

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.140
on our staff and Guha Shankar.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.440
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Maggie and Guha.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.740
They had the school built model.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.460
We recruited students, most
of them from Utah State

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.170
because they have
a folklore program

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.230
but we had three students from
the University of Wyoming--

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.510
worked with this research center
to get the space reserved.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.920
We had a big log house that we
were all staying in together.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.920
We got there and after a couple

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.880
of days we realized the
house was full of bats

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.350
and there have always been
bats at the research station.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.700
The science guys
just say, "Whatever.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.000
We're going to deal with it.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.300
We're not worried about it."

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.020
There were a lot of bats.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.910
One of the other
Utah State faculty

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.390
who was there just visiting--

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.070
she wasn't part of
our school faculty--

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:48.600
got really concerned about the
bats and started asking around.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: They
might be rabid?

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.200
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
They might be rabid.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.800
I should preface this by saying

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.740
that the American Folklife
Center has been doing training

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.500
sessions and field schools
for many, many years,

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:07.530
but yours in 2017 became
legendary because--

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.850
What happened?

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.380
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Jeannie Thomas
from Utah State talked to this--

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: An
esteemed colleague, yes.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.390
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: -- talked to
the Centre for Disease Control.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.420
She went right to the top and
said, "Here are these bats."

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.700
They said if you are
sleeping in a room

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.690
with bats you don't
know if you've been bit.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.740
You could have been bit because
they have little tiny teeth.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.330
They said, "We recommend
you don't stay there."

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.130
There was a very recent
population explosion

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.820
in this house that
was unexpected.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.580
They've always had a few but
there were baby bats everywhere

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.050
and bats on the floor and
bat guano all over the place

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.110
and they were flying around.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.060
It was unnerving.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.920
Actually Utah State
risk management said,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.220
"You can't stay there.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.520
You have to leave."

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.290
That their students
had to leave.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.650
We had to leave.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.870
They put us in another
building at the research station

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.290
for one night but then
they didn't have space.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.590
People were coming in.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.120
We had to find somewhere else
to stay in Jackson in August

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.940
in peak tourist season.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.550
We eventually found motels at
great expense which Utah State

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.520
and the university
had to pay for.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.100
They had to shut down the lodge.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.090
They wouldn't let anybody
else stay there and--

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.080
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did you also
have to get rabies shots?

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.380
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yes.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.680
Most of us had to
get rabies shots.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.400
Preventive measure
because you don't know.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.000
We kept hearing it
in Washington.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.580
We were getting these concerning
emails and phone calls about--

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.880
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
We made the paper.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.180
We made the local paper.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.750
They didn't quite get everything
right but "Local students run

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.000
into hordes of rabid bats."

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.700
Well, no, but they
could have been.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.000
We had to--

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's
nothing to fool around with.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.600
It's really very serious.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.900
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.200
It's a whole series of shots.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.080
It was very disruptive to the
field school but we kept going.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.490
We briefly thought of "Do
we need to bail on this?"

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.790
We said, "No.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.090
We want to keep doing it."

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.390
The students were amazing.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.450
They just charged
into the fieldwork.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.980
We had to condense our training.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.530
Then they had a week to do
interviews with the dude ranch,

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.870
the family that had owned
the ranch for 70 years--

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:25.250
many people in that family,
the employees, guests.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.750
We did lots of interviews about
the traditions of dude ranching.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.450
Of course it's a
fascinating topic.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.020
It's right at the
base of the Tetons.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.540
It's a spectacular location.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.590
The students were great.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.890
They hung in there.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.070
Most of them had to get shots.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.420
Most of us had to get shots.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.800
It ate up some of our time.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.640
We were supposed to do
a final presentation.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.380
The research station has
a series of presentations

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.070
by researchers and
so we were scheduled

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.540
to talk about our fieldwork.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.680
We ran out of time, plus we were
not allowed to go back there

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.280
because of the bats so
we had to cancel that.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.580
We went back later.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.240
We went back in November
some of us.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.380
Some of us were supposed
to go and then it snowed

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.470
and we couldn't get there.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.890
People went back to Jackson
and did a presentation

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.300
on our field research.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.670
Then they had put all
of that material online,

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.190
the Utah State archive.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.570
Randy Williams is just amazing.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.430
The whole collection is online.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:26.600
They did a little online exhibit
about dude ranching traditions.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.150
We told all the students,
we said,

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.590
"This whole bat thing is
going to make a great story.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.390
Maybe not right now
but you're going

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.100
to be telling this story
to your grandkids."

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.090
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Really,
people are still amazed by--

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.390
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.690
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's
something you didn't prepare

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.050
in your graduate
school training for.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.350
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Right.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:47.620
Yeah. You just deal with
it when it comes up.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.920
It's always something.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.040
It's usually not that dramatic.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.610
Utah State they had been
really strict about--

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.410
They did training on.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.400
We were all got bear sprayed.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.340
They talked about
rats and Hantavirus

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.130
and all these things
to be aware of.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.140
Nobody mentioned bats
in that safety training

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.900
and that was what did us in.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.980
It turned into-- I think
we got really good results

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.330
and we had a wonderful time.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.090
The host, the family that owns
this Triangle X dude ranch,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:23.760
the Turners are just the most
hospitable, welcoming people.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.810
They were very generous
and let us troop

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.840
around and ask questions.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's online?

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.000
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yes.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.920
If you go to the
Fife folklore archive

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.920
at Utah State you can find it.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.000
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
haven't I asked you about?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.030
What do you think?

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:50.230
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I was telling
you earlier why I think I'm

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.490
interested in folklore
or why I'm a folklorist.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, you were.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.840
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: I grew up
in these two different places

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.570
in the East but neither of them
were where my family was from.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.410
People ask me, especially
out West,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.710
they say, "Where are you from?"

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.600
I usually just say back East
because that's all they care

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.450
about if you're not
from Wyoming.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.770
They're very welcoming
but usually that's enough.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.640
I don't feel like
I'm from anywhere

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.670
because I don't have family
roots in those places.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.180
I wasn't in either of them
long enough to really feel

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.480
like that's where I was from.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.880
Then I worked and moved around
and worked in other places.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.420
Like I said, I've always
liked smaller towns

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.720
and smaller communities.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.970
I sort of always
wish that maybe I was

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:38.270
from a traditional community
where you knew everybody,

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.110
which is what folk
communities are.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.850
I think that's my
attraction to folklore is

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.380
that I'm envious of
that way of life.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.690
I'm sure it's not ideal either

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.500
where your neighbors know
everything about you,

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.480
but I like that idea of
knowing my neighbors.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:01.460
I think that's a factor that
I had this suburban upbringing

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.350
and didn't have that
sense of roots.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do
you think working

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.280
in folklore has given
you these roots?

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.150
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Certainly
the community of folklorists.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.830
They're my people even
though they're spread out.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.500
The Western group is very close.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.540
We're all really good
friends, so it's good that--

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You seem
to be doing a lot of going

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.210
to each other's weddings and
hanging out with each other.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.510
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
Yeah, going on vacation

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.560
and making plans for retirement.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.160
Buying a big house
together and-- Yeah.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.970
They're my favorite people.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.490
I love working in these
small communities too.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.800
Partly because I think
it's easier to work there

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.710
because it's easy to
make the connections,

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:47.660
but I just like that
sense of community.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you so
much for coming to Washington

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.680
to present a lecture and
also to talk about things.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.340
We're delighted to have your
fieldwork from Nevada here.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.020
People will be using that.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.320
Thank you, Andrea.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.620
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.920
It's exciting.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.220
Thanks for having me.
