00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.790
&gt;&gt; Quick, this woman needs a blood transfusion.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.550
&gt;&gt; Why what happened?

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.940
&gt;&gt; She was in a car accident and she's lost a lot of

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.495
blood and she may not survive if she doesn't get a transfusion soon.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:07.500
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, well what's her blood type?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.700
&gt;&gt; Well we don't know, we need find out.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Knowing a person's blood type can

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.730
be really important. If you give somebody the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.570
wrong blood type their immune system can

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.560
mount a response and actually cause you harm.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.590
&gt;&gt; So how does the body know it's the wrong blood type?

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.370
&gt;&gt; Well, your immune system does a really good job at recognizing

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.370
self versus non self, and it does this because when you're growing up

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.420
it knows the blood type that you're growing up with

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.830
because that's what it's exposed to. And so when it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.200
sees a blood type that it doesn't recognize it knows

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.880
it doesn't belong there and it tries to attack it.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.900
&gt;&gt; Sounds really important, no wonder there's so many tests

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.615
you can take to tell what your blood type is.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.380
&gt;&gt; Right in the clinic that's very true, but

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.860
what's really cool is your genome reveals the same

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.990
information. In this lesson we're going to discover how your

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.430
genome uses its code to create your blood type. Also,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510
here's an incomplete concept map for lesson three that you can also download

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.600
from the instructor's notes. As usual, print it out or just keep it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
handy and see if you can fill in the empty blanks as you

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.470
go through the lesson. Now if you prefer to have the complete version just

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.940
skip to the end and look in the instructor's notes for the complete

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.710
concept map. However, I highly encourage

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.610
you to try using this incomplete version

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.540
now, filling in your own notes as the lesson progresses and then we'll

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.610
check your progress out on the completed map at the end of the lesson.
