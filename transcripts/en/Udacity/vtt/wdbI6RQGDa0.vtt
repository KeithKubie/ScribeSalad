00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, how hard we push definitely matters.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If I push really hard, the cart could accelerate really fast.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The mass of the cart also matters.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's much harder to get a very massive cart, a heavy cart, moving than it is to get a light cart.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The color, of course, doesn't matter,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the material it turns out doesn't matter either.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You might have thought that a lightweight material, well, maybe that will accelerate faster.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But then we're changing two variables.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You'd be changing both the material and the mass of the cart.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When we're thinking in terms of designing an experiment,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we want to make sure that the variables we alter we're altering in isolation.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If I have two carts that are the same mass, it doesn't matter what the material is made of.
