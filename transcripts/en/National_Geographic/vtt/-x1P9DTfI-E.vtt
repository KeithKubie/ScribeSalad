MARK: Rafaela, I know
you feel grateful.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:05.633
Yes.

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:06.900
To The Wonderful
Company, and they have done

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.934
things that no farmer will do.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.033
Yes.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.233
There's a park now.
There's--

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.100
- Yes, I know.
- The roads are better.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.200
There's some houses.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.000
But the wages are still minimum.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the water is
still a problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.734
Mm-hmm.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.133
MAN: Arsenic.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:30.967
Yeah, arsenic.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:32.333
Si.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:37.200
So the farm workers
don't have water to drink,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.433
but the trees have
plenty of water to drink.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.166
Yeah.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.934
ROSANNA: Almost all the
water in this valley

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.800
is full of toxicity.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.533
One of the first things
that happened to me when

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.867
I started working here is--

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:05.667
I was going door to
door, visiting residents,

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.266
and a couple of women
said, "Come in, come in."

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.033
And they offered me a
glass of what they were

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.967
calling, "Lost Hills Lemonade."

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:14.200
And they were laughing about it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.266
And I could smell it.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.800
I could smell the chlorine.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.233
And that was our introduction
to the water here.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.800
Have you asked the
water district here

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.166
why it's coming out yellow?

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.433
I have, and their
response that I've received

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.133
is, "Well, it's an
infrastructure problem."

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.400
because--

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.433
That means it's the
pipes in the house?

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:32.700
It's the pipes in the house.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.667
But with all this
infrastructure changes,

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:37.533
did the Resnicks improve
the water system?

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.867
No.

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.700
The infrastructure of the pipes
going into people's homes?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.967
No.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.734
And this is what we're seeing
throughout Kern County.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:48.867
That some areas are
parched, and some farms

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:54.667
are drying up, because who
holds the rights to that water?

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.300
And who is going to
benefit most from being

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.200
able to grow more pistachios
and more pomegranates?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.500
That's the California story.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.800
There has always been
a fight over the water.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.066
And just like any war, it's
just collateral damage.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.700
Yeah.
