00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.460
Let's think a little
bit about two terms

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.360
that you'll see
throughout your geometry,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.350
and really, mathematical career.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.730
One is the idea of things
being perpendicular.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.470
And usually, people are
talking about perpendicular.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:22.570
Actually I'm misspelling
it-- perpendicular lines,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.260
and the idea of parallel lines.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.050
So perpendicular
lines are two lines

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.360
that intersect at a right angle.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.090
So what am I talking about?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.000
So let's say that this is
one line right over here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.790
and that this is another
line right over here.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.460
We would say these two lines are
perpendicular if they intersect

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.340
at a right angle.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950
So they clearly intersect.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.950
In order for them to
intersect at a right angle,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.280
the angle formed
between these two lines

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.027
needs to be 90 degrees.

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:00.610
And if any one of these angles
is 90 degrees, the rest of them

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.114
are going to be 90 degrees.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:04.530
So this is 90 degrees, then
these are perpendicular lines.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.980
And if that's 90
degrees, then that's

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.230
going to be 90 degrees,
that's going to be 90 degrees,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.990
and that's going
to be 90 degrees.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.073
So if any of them are 90
degrees, the rest of them

00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:15.570
are 90 degrees, and we
have perpendicular lines.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.760
If you have two lines that
on a two-dimensional surface

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.050
like your paper or like
the screen never intersect,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.300
they stay the same
distance apart,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.230
then we are talking
about parallel lines.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.120
So this line right over here
and this line right over here,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.900
the way I've drawn them,
are parallel lines.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.429
They aren't intersecting.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.470
They're both kind of going
in the same direction,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.670
but they're kind of shifted
versions of each other.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.210
They will never intersect
with each other.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.380
So these two are parallel.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.420
If we have two lines that,
let's say, they intersect,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.250
but they don't intersect
at a right angle,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.250
so let's say we have that
line and we have this line

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
right over here, and they're
clearly not intersecting

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.000
at a right angle, then we call
these neither perpendicular

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.160
nor parallel lines.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.674
These lines just intersect.
