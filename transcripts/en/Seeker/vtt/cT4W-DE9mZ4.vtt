00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.340
Both the brain and law regulate human behavior.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.000
Only recently have all of these lit medical
tools became available:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.589
CTs, MEG, ERPs, and my favorite, the fMRI,
which allows the human brain itself to finally

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:12.589
be studied.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.219
We now have a dope set of brain-imaging techniques,
so can we use our fantastic new neural knowledge

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.970
in the courtroom? Can we?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750
Well, the intersection of neuroscience and
law is called neurolaw.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.929
You can deadass put neuro in front of anything
and make it cooler! Watch.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.210
Neurocountry music… nevermind, I broke it
already.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.300
In fact, “my brain made me do it” is becoming
a more popular defense in the courts — such

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.329
as blaming earlier head trauma or brain disorders
for criminal actions.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.510
On one hand, a person in court using the excuse
that “my brain did the crime” is in the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.149
wrong; any neurotypical person should act
in a prosocial way, obey the law, and only

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.190
use their brain to, I don't know, tweet memes.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.059
On the other hand, that person in court is
in the right; the brain did make them do something

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.891
and if neurological evidence shows that they
have abnormal activity in their brain or a

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.760
previously undiagnosed disorder, these things
should be taken into consideration.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
And there are different legal terms to define
a defendant’s culpability, or even an individual’s

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.239
capacity to take the stand.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.630
These defenses argue competency, criminal
responsibility, and diminished capacity of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.900
the defendant, causing them to commit the
crime in question.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.482
However, these are based on psychological
evaluations — which are 100% cut and dry

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:14.482
in the courtroom.

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:15.482
Right?

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:16.482
Well, you're wrong.

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:21.360
For example, memories of events are very important
in courtrooms but memories are not fully reliable.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.460
They deteriorate over time, trauma might make
us remember events very differently from our

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.210
points of view, people are really good at
remembering the gist of things but details

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.540
are more difficult, and the way questions
about those details are asked could make people

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.740
remember details falsely.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.530
And that’s why we use lie detectors, right?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.530
Nope.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.350
If you’ve watched any courtroom procedural
you’ve probably heard that lie detector

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.830
tests are “inadmissible in court.”

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.830
Why?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.960
Well, a polygraph measures blood pressure,
perspiration, and heart rate and attempts

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.900
to correlate them with telling lies.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.810
Those metrics aren’t 100% correlational
which makes them unreliable.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.650
But what’s stronger than a lie detector?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.130
An fMRI, perhaps?

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.070
First, yes, fMRIs have been found to be able
to differentiate truth vs lies by changes

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
in prefrontal cortex activity, but a guilty
suspect who firmly believes that they are

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.259
not guilty may be able to finesse a false
positive in a fMRI study.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.040
Furthermore, even if fMRIs find an increase
in activity in certain regions of the brain

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.840
when a subject is lying, this does not mean
that that increase in activity means that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750
the participant has to be lying.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.019
Again, correlation, not causation.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.810
So what is neurolaw good for...absolutely
nothing??

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.930
... Moment of Truth…Rush Hour? Edwin Starr? Good God, y'all.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.090
Until concrete, infallible techniques can
be brought to the stand, neurolaw’s at a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.099
standstill.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.430
Both medical and legal procedures need to
be taken into account to bring neuroscience

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.650
into the courtroom.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.209
Both a bar council and a medical board would
need to come together regularly to review

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.819
the techniques and advances in order to bridge
the two disciplines.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.680
More knowledge about the use of science in
law and law in neuroscience would need to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.060
be added to curricula so future neurolawyers
can grasp how their disciplines would be used.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.189
(“Neurolawyer” is such a dope job.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.599
Immediate right swipe.)

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.090
Now, I may be a simple city science boy, but
in my humble opinion, neurolaw would help

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.290
us apply medical knowledge and technology
to the law as it stands to make a more equitable

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.290
legal system.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.319
Mental health status, racial bias, and deterioration
or damage of decision making or impulse control

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.379
areas of the brain could help prove liability
could do wonders in the courtroom.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.810
Yo thanks for watching.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.150
Make sure you subscribe to Seeker.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.380
Speaking of crimes and brains, guess what,
we’ve got more crime and brains for you.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.209
Check out this other episode about how Einstein’s
brain was stolen, preserved, dissected, and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.519
sent across the whole country in pieces.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.519
That’s crazy.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.230
And if you’re really in your feelings, good
or bad, leave me a comment below.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.169
And again thank you so much for watching.
