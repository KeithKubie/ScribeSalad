00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.100
Four years ago, dirty water contaminated
with lead started flowing from Flint's

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
taps, causing sickness and death, while
officials denied there was a problem.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.640
“When we are dead and gone, these children will suffer for what we failed to do!”

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.120
Now, officials insist the water is safe to
drink – but residents don’t trust them.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.980
How many people have me buried and babies have

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.400
died because of this, and we're just
supposed to get over it?

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.329
As an ordinary citizen, if I poison one
individual, I would be in prison. And they

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.520
poisoned an entire city of people and no
one is being held accountable.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.360
The state of Michigan has stopped providing free bottled water to Flint, forcing people to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.190
spend thousands of dollars on water to
drink, cook, bathe and even flush the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.900
toilet. And water bills here are already
some of the highest in the country.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.480
Why should the people of Flint pay for water that poisoned them, that they don't trust

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.360
and, in a lot of cases, they don't even use?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.440
Because the water is safer.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.200
It's crazy to think that it's been over
two years since we were last here in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.220
Flint, and being back here now, it's clear
that not much has changed.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.680
The last time we visited, things were in bad shape.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.840
They said something about the water not being fixed until 2035.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.040
Whoa.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.540
The crisis began in April 2014 when the city temporarily switched

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.640
its water source from Lake Huron to the
Flint River to save money. But the water

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.540
from the river wasn't properly treated,
so the pipes corroded and leached lead.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.920
Discolored, foul-smelling water started
flowing out of taps. Despite complaints,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.980
city officials denied there was a
problem for almost two years before

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.900
declaring a state of emergency. More than a dozen people died, while others lost hair and developed rashes.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.880
Since then, 15 officials have been charged, some with involuntary manslaughter.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.480
On the four-year anniversary of the day Flint's water was switched, residents were no less angry.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.040
Bottom line is I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.960
I didn't know things like

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.640
this go on in America, and I'm 37 years
old and disabled and worrying about my

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.780
kids every night, like all of us are.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.160
Christina Murphy is a single mom of three. Since the water crisis began, she's struggled to stay afloat.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.100
So you're told your water is fine. You stopped getting this free bottled water? And now you have to buy it?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.060
In April, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder announced the state would stop providing Flint with free bottled

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
water, claiming nearly two years of test
results showed the lower lead levels.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.100
That sparked outrage. Christina, like other Flint residents,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.560
relies on filters. Even though she doesn't trust the water, she still has to pay hundreds of dollars a month for it.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.080
My water was shut off last month, and they made me come up with $860 – no, $838.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.660
Wow.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.740
And I'm living off of like $600 a month right now.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.280
Christina’s youngest child is 2-year-old Declan. She was 16 weeks pregnant with him when news broke about

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.100
lead in the water. As a newborn, Declan made headlines after his first bath was given entirely with bottled water.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.160
So this baby has never known clean water his whole life? He only knows bottled water?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.980
Bottled water, or heavily filtered water.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.220
Has he had any sort of health side effects of the lead? Do you know?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:03.940
We do know that he could be cognitively impaired, but we won't find out until he's like 3 or 4 years old.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.300
Last year, Christina had her children screened for various toxins, including lead, through hair follicle tests.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.200
Arsenic is somewhere around 70, 80.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.340
The lead is beyond the 95th percentile.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.120
Yeah, the lead's beyond.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.380
And then the total toxic representation is 100.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.620
As her family reels from the effects of the crisis, Christina’s lost all faith in the government.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:37.000
What was the governor's words to the mayor the other day? "Get over it." Well, tell my my kids that. You know,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.520
please, Governor Snyder, tell my kids that to their faces, to get over the fact that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.200
they've been poisoned and that their
legs hurt, and that they have night

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.860
sweats and that they shake sometimes. And that their mommy can't play with them

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.700
the way she used to because she's too
sick. And we're just supposed to get over it?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.560
Because so many of Flint's children are
exposed to lead, there's now an entire

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.400
school created specifically to help them.
Cummings Great Expectations serves 142

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.580
young ones, ages zero to 4.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.340
So each of these children has been affected by lead?

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.780
Every single one in our building has been
affected by the water. So they were a part

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.820
of the water line from April 2014 through August 2016. You coming to say hello? Checking everybody out?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.120
Site director Lindsey Kerry showed us how classrooms

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.140
double as observation rooms and teachers are trained to look out for symptoms of lead poisoning.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.040
So this is one of our early head-start classrooms that has the

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.020
observation window where people can come in and observe the classroom without

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.960
being intrusive on their day. There's a
lot of different challenges that we see.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.740
We see some developmental delays, whether it becomes, you know, speech and language,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.320
the cognitive, taking a little bit longer
to talk. Our kids really struggle in the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.080
social areas. We're seeing a lot of asthma, skin conditions from the exposure to the lead in the water.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.160
So how did you
feel when it was recently announced that

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.380
free bottled water will no longer be
provided to Flint residents?

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.080
Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I cried.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.140
A lot of people tell me, “You've got to be so happy that the water crisis is over now,”

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.080
and my response is always that blank stare of "it's not over!"

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.360
In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau declared
Flint the poorest city in the country

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.940
for its size. 40% of people here live
below the poverty line. And it's so

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.740
difficult for Flint's poorest residents
to pay their water bills that

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.080
foreclosures are becoming more common.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.960
For most residents, it's just another result of a long history of neglect.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.820
Certanya Johnson has some of the highest water bills in Flint.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.820
In 2017, she received a letter from the city stating

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.880
she owed $10,000 in water payments. It was later reduced to $6,000.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.420
"Our records indicate that you have a past-due balance for the amount of $6,916." And then they say,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.700
"When you do not pay the amount, you incur the penalty and are on our shutoff list."

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.700
So they're threatening to shut off your water?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.680
Yes.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.360
What are you going to do?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.000
I don't know.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.920
Certanya's only income comes from Social Security, which is roughly $800 a month.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.980
Her health is suffering. She's had five
strokes since 2015.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.760
What do you think the city or the state owes you right now?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:41.220
To pay my bill, I really do. Get that water bill resolved, they owe me that much.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.560
This is one of the areas where they're replacing thousands of contaminated pipes to remove any

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.020
traces of lead. The work is scheduled to
be completed by 2020. Now, if you live in

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.540
a neighborhood that hasn't had its pipes
replaced yet, chances are you're not

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.300
using the water. But you're still getting
charged for it.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.620
Hughey Newsom is Flint's new chief financial officer. He comes from the private sector and supports the

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.200
city shutting off people's water for lack of payment.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.440
Why should the city of Flint pay for water that poisoned them, that they don't trust and, in a lot of

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.640
cases, they don't even use?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.840
Because the water is safer.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.120
We have worked so hard to get to go from where we were at, the beginning of the crisis to now.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.160
The poverty in Flint is undeniable, and
people are still reeling from being

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.520
poisoned by the lead in the water and yet
they have some of the highest water

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.280
bills in the country. Is that fair?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.320
I don't think it's fair, but it's – unfortunately, right now it's a financial reality, and we're working very, very

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.360
diligently to address that. We've really
tried to communicate to residents that,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.440
you know, if you're using the water, you
have to pay for it. If you don't pay for it,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.240
other residents have to pay for it, but
then other bad things happen. The last

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.160
thing we want to do is to have someone
else control this.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.560
A lot of people would argue that they shouldn't have to pay anything. That someone else should step

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.680
in, maybe the state, and pay their water bills.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.600
Well, and I don't want to get too deep into what the state should or should not be doing.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.680
People, when they're billed for water,
they're billed for water and sewer together.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.760
You're using sewer. There's no question you're using it, so you should

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.200
also be paying for that service as well.
So let's not talk about what happened in

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.360
the past so that you can circumvent paying for a service that you have now.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.920
But residents we spoke to still haven't let go of the past. Rapper Ira Dorsey, who goes by "Bootleg,"

00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.520
grew up here. His group, the Dayton Family, has used music to call attention to the entrenched poverty in Flint.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.320
Growing up back in the early '90s, this was an affluent

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.000
neighborhood. I mean, there was people
everywhere, people were working for

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.160
General Motors and everybody income was well and families were living good, the

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.480
violence was real low. And it was a fun
place to grow up.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.280
Back in Flint then, it was over 200,000
people here. And now it's down to like

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.440
80,000 people. So this is just a remnant
of what Flint used to be.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.600
What does justice for Flint look like to you?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.760
I would like to see people being prosecuted.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.360
Because to me, as an ordinary citizen, if I poison one individual, I would be in

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.760
prison. And they poisoned an entire city
of people, and no one is being held

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.120
accountable. Not at the level where the
decisions are being made.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.800
Flint is still one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. according to FBI statistics.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.200
Budget cuts have slashed police and fire departments.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.040
For locals, the water crisis is just another systemic failure.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.400
They let us down. The EPA stood by and left us out here to die. And that's the way we feel.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.120
Bootleg's song "City of Lead" calls out former and current officials

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.000
for their failure to adequately address the water crisis.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.360
“We got lead inside the water, we got lead in our guns. These politicians poisoning

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.560
our sons and daughters for fun. Washing my face and hands with nothin’ but bottled water and wipes to save

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.360
a buck while this administration ruined the pipes.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.440
And now we’re fighting for our lives and asking who can we trust…”

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.320
This is not a third-world country. We live in the wealthiest country in the world.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.920
And at the end of the day, while we're fighting battles overseas in other countries,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.760
we need to invest in our country.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.680
"I wish the governor could walk a couple blocks in my shoes

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.760
so he can witness all this poverty and crime that exists

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.720
and all this hatred and racism that we've been fighting against — City of Lead."

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.080
Hey guys, it's Dena. that's an update on the Flint water crisis.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.540
Make sure you come back next week. I'll still be in Michigan reporting on how

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.160
Nestle is getting a lot of water from the state for cheap and folks aren't happy about it.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.760
