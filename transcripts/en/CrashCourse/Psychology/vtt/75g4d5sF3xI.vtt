00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.810
In your lifetime, you have probably stared
down any number of ability tests and course

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.280
exams and PSATs, SATs, ACTs, GREs, GCSEs,
whatever you got in your country.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.130
Humans, it seems, really get a thrill out
of measuring, ranking, and comparing each

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.559
other's intelligence.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.349
Unfortunately, as you saw last week, historically,
we have been kind of bad at that.

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.590
Today, we think of intelligence as determined
by a series of factors related to genetics,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.769
environment, education, perhaps even randomness
itself, some aspects of which may correlate

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.670
with belonging to a particular social group,
and others not.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.590
The key here, though, is that we don't fully
understand how or how much some of these factors

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.590
work.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.140
How do elements like personal history and
conditions like poverty, access to education,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.830
stress, even nutrition affect someone's scores
on cognitive tests?

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.760
And if a group of people share some of these
conditions, how will they respond--both as

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.800
individuals and as a group--to certain potentially
biased intelligence tests?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.510
In the end, the irony is that in our ongoing
effort to measure human intelligence, most

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.850
of what we've learned is simply what we don't
know.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.290
[Intro]

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.090
What is a piano?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.520
Which one of these things is least like the
others?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.590
Juice is to glass as hand is to what?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.729
Which one of these numbers does not belong
in the series?

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.380
Bernice had x number of jelly beans.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.539
She ate one, then gave half of what was left
to Bruno, then she ate another and gave half

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.970
of the remainder to her dog.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.330
Now, she only has five beans.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.869
How many did she--ahheh uhhhh.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.149
These questions are similar to what you'd
find on today's most widely-used intelligence

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.149
tests.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.990
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, or
WAIS, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.709
for Children, or WISC.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.031
Originally published by psychologist David
Wechsler in 1955, the current edition of the

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:49.399
exam consists of fifteen different sub-tests
that assess things like vocabulary, similarities

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.579
between objects and concepts, and patterns
in letters and numbers.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
Cognitive tests usually fall into one of two
categories: achievement, or the kind that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.249
reflect what you've learned, and aptitude
- the kind that's supposed to predict your

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:03.820
ability to learn something new.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.399
So the WAIS and the WISC are aptitude tests,
and your final exam at the end of your math

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.950
class is an achievement test.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.970
So, how do we know if an intelligence test,
or any other test for that matter, is actually

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.970
any good?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.000
Well, today, we do have some standards.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.190
To be widely accepted, a test must hit three
important marks.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.800
It has to be standardized, reliable, and valid.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.280
Standardization is basically about comparability.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.250
Whether you answer 15 or 50 questions correctly
on a test actually means very little until

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.570
you can compare those scores against how others
performed.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.580
So, to achieve meaningful comparisons, test-makers
must first give the test to a representative

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.420
sample group, which sets a standard by which
to compare future test-takers.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.480
You've probably heard of a bell-curve.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.200
Whether you're measuring height or mental
aptitude or love of the Beatles, it's often

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.900
assumed that everyone you're measuring will
fall into what's called a normal pattern:

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.570
most scores will fall in the mid-range, while
fewer hit the extremes.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.700
And actually, it's those extremes that intelligence
tests are most widely and effectively used

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
for.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.710
It might help an educator identify a gifted
student who totally blows the roof off a test,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.750
but they're also useful in helping clinicians
determine who might have a disability or be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.400
facing some specific barrier.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.500
With victims of traumatic brain injury or
stroke, for example, a WAIS test can do a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.310
nice job of sussing out whether a patient
who's struggling with language actually has

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.070
a problem remembering and identifying words,
or if they're just having a hard time processing

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.250
the information quickly.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.150
But these tests should be regarded more skeptically
when it comes to issues that are either way

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.450
more specific or way more broad.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.710
Like, they won't be able to answer questions
along the lines of, "Will Jesse get into Harvard?"

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.620
or "Are women smarter than men?"

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.610
They're just not designed to do that.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.420
And in any case, simply knowing where you
fall on a normal curve on a standardized test

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.230
doesn't mean much if the test is poorly designed,
so along with being standardized, a good test

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.570
has high reliability, meaning it yields dependably
consistent results.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.970
One way to determine this is to have people
take the same test a second time, or some

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.180
similar version of it.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.401
If the two performances resemble one another
-- if the scores correlate -- then the test

00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:02.780
is thought to have good reliability.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.120
And the third requirement for the testing
trifecta is simply validity, or the extent

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.410
to which a test measures or predicts what
it's supposed to.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.380
And there are different kinds of validity
-- for instance, if I take the WAIS IQ test

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.100
and my scores accurately predict how good
my grades in college will be, that's a simple

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.489
kind of predictive or criterion validity.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.960
On the other hand, if I take the test and
my scores correlate strongly with my results

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.690
on another similar cognitive test, like the
Stanford Binet, that falls under the broad

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.790
category of construct validity.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.590
The key is that all of these are ways to see
if a test measures what it claims to measure.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.190
But the stickiest wicket of them all is what
we make of the test scores themselves.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.300
We've all heard plenty about the influence
of both nature and nurture in psychology,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.341
so the big question is: do our genetics influence
our intelligence, or does our environment?

00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:52.430
And this is an easy question to answer because
they both do.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.540
And that is important.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.820
If the history of intelligence testing has
taught us anything, it's that assuming everyone

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.380
is smart in the same way and for the same
reason can lead to disastrously bad conclusions.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.430
So let's look at the scientific evidence,
and the best place for that is the wealth

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.720
of twin and adoption studies, which have been
fascinatingly helpful in illustrating how

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.030
genetics and environment can both influence
intelligence.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.450
For example, research has shown that identical
twins who were raised together have the highest

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.000
rate of similarity in intelligence scores
of any group.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.410
Fraternal twins who share only half the genes
tend to be much less similar in their scores,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.990
even when raised in the same home.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.870
Likewise, neuroimaging studies show that certain
brain regions, like those associated with

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.669
language, are structurally similar between
identical twins, and show similar activity

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.810
while doing the same kinds of mental tasks.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.000
The brains of fraternal twins raised in the
same home are very similar in some areas,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.400
but less so in others.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.990
But identical twins who are raised together
have the same brain, at least, according to

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.040
neuroimaging scans.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.060
Some studies even showed that identical twins
raised apart from each other show higher intelligence

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.300
correlation than fraternal twins raised together.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.699
And maybe even more interesting is that these
intelligence correlations actually increase

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:01.699
over time.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.910
In one mega-study of eleven thousand twin
pairs in four countries, that correlation

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.169
kept increasing from middle-childhood to adolescence
to young adulthood and continued to increase

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.230
through adulthood.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.450
Similar research has looked at adopted children
and compared their scores with those of their

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.650
adopted siblings, parents, and biological
parents.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.090
And the results can be kind of surprising,
because as adopted kids grow up, their mental

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.440
similarities to their adoptive families actually
get smaller over time until there's virtually

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.770
no correlation by adulthood.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.080
Instead, they become more similar in terms
of mental aptitude to their biological parents

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.060
over time, even if they never met.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.199
In other words: genes appear to matter.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.370
You could take a hundred kids and raise them
in the exact same way, and as adults, they'd

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.660
still have different aptitudes.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.090
But, does this mean that when it comes to
intelligence, we're all nature and no nurture?

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.120
Well, luckily, and somewhat obviously, no.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.400
Life experiences and environment also matter.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.870
One sad example of how early environments
affect children can be found in the work of

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.950
American psychologist J. McVicker Hunt in
a destitute Iranian orphanage in the 1970s.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.830
Conditions were really, really bad; infants
received minimal care, and whatever attention

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.860
they did get was on a routine schedule, never
in response to whether they were cooing or

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.230
crying or anything else.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.010
Basically, they were being raised with no
cause and effect between their behaviors and

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.720
the responses of their caregivers, and as
a result, they didn't learn how to communicate.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.800
With no stimulation or social response, the
kids were just kind of passive, vacant lumps.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.340
Deprivation was essentially trumping any inborn
intelligence.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.530
So, Hunt started a program.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.820
He trained caregivers to actually talk to
infants, to teach them how to mimic sounds

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.180
and actions, and eventually, sounds and words
from their language.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.780
The results were tremendous.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.300
The kids started to learn really quickly,
and basically just came alive.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.740
While it's an extreme example, Hunt's research
showed how malleable early childhood intelligence

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.120
can be, especially in disadvantaged and stressful
conditions.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.440
So you can see that environment and heredity
interact to affect intelligence, and that

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.400
some tricky implications can come out of that
conclusion.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.210
But that's hardly the only controversy when
it comes to how we view and measure intelligence.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.120
There have been some sensational headline-courting
studies of genetic and social influences that

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.720
have suggested that fundamental differences
in intelligence may exist between genders

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.000
and races, but many of these studies are tangled
up in questions of how potential testing bias

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.280
may affect performance.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.470
Basically, if a test inadvertently measures
differences caused by cultural experiences

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.680
or social factors instead of what we might
call "innate intelligence", then you might

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.360
say that the test is biased.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.580
Extreme example: in the past, immigrants to
the US were classified as "feeble minded"

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.339
if they couldn't answer distinctly American
questions, like "Who was the first American

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:42.831
president?" or "What's a milkshake?".

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.150
Today, concerns about bias focuses on differences
among members of the same general culture.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.089
Say, a poor, rural kid who might be plenty
smart, but will test low if questions involve

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:56.140
urban, upper-class concepts like taking taxis
and drinking tea out of china cups or the

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.140
rules of tennis.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.390
So the questions themselves can skew performance
results, but who administers the test can

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.220
also affect outcomes.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.300
Women tend to do better with a fellow female
administrator, and African Americans often

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.279
score higher if their test is given by an
African American instructor.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:14.200
And the risk of bias may even fall to the
test-takers' own expectations.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.590
For example, many studies have found that
if you give a math test to equally capable

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.900
men and women, but just before starting, you
tell the subjects that women usually score

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.000
lower than men, you actually negatively affect
the women's performance.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.210
This self-fulfilling concern that you might
mess up and inadvertently fulfill some negative

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.589
stereotype is called stereotype threat.

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:37.460
It was first described by social psychologist
Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, and it's

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.160
been demonstrated frequently across a whole
host of interesting studies.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.020
Now, we've only scratched the surface of this
mess that is intelligence testing.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.750
An important thing to remember next time you
ace or bomb a test is that you are far more

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.190
complicated and nuanced than any test score.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.440
Don't let a number puff you up or drag you
down, and don't let it define you.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.680
We all have room for self-improvement.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.810
We are all full of infinite surprising potential.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.670
Ah, and answers to the questions I asked earlier:
A piano is a musical instrument played using

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.950
a keyboard, banana is the least similar to
the others, juice is to class as hand is to

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:15.010
glove, the number two does not belong in the
series, and Bernice began with twenty-three

jellybeans.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.080
Today, your intelligent mind learned how we
currently use WAIS and WISC tests to measure

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.960
intelligence, and how important it is that
a test be standardized, reliable, and valid.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.480
We also looked at how genetics, environment,
testing bias, and stereotype threat can affect

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.459
IQ test performance.

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:36.290
