00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.861
 Which x values ​​make the ordered pair 

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.704
 x Semi - Minus 2 System Solution 

00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:09.815
 inequalities presented in the graph below? 

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:11.719
 So let's look at it. 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.876
 We are limited to all points 

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:16.792
 of the x-type minus 2, 

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.545
 which is another way to say it will 

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:22.550
 we limit to equal to minus 2. 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.290
 If we limit to less than 2, 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.958
 what should be true for x to be this point 

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.705
 solution of this system of inequalities? 

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.261
 I recommend that you pause the video, 

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:40.140
 take a look at this chart here and then choose one of the answers. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.230
 Okay, now let's do it together. 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.401
 Just let us know what we have here. 

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.887
 I will choose a few points. 

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:50.414
 This point here, it is not a solution of 

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:52.945
 none of the inequalities in the system. 

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.453
 You can see this as the green system 

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:57.124
 and this as the blue system. 

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.646
 To be in the multitude of decisions, we must be 

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.401
 in the colored area for this system. 

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.964
 So this point here is not in the multitude of decisions 

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:07.236
 for none of the inequalities in the system. 

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:09.091
 This point here, 

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.039
 it will also not be in the multitude of decisions for any of them, 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.131
 because it lies on the broken green line. 

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.395
 If it was a solid green line, then it would be part of it 

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.063
 of the green set of solutions, but since the green line is interrupted, 

00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:25.268
 the right itself is not part of the decisions. 

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:27.328
 Now, this point here, 

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:32.675
 this point satisfies the green inequality, 

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.301
 it is part of his multitude of decisions, 

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:36.636
 but does not satisfy blue inequality, 

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:40.431
 so it's not from the multitude of system solutions. 

00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.414
 Now this point here, it will actually satisfy both 

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:47.095
 and the reason to satisfy them both, 

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:51.367
 it is clear that she is in the colored area for green inequality, 

00:01:52.017 --> 00:01:54.781
 but it lies on the rights of blue inequality, 

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.428
 but that's good because we include the rights itself 

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:58.499
 in the multitude of decisions; 

00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:01.404
 this is a dense blue line. 

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:03.633
 So this point will be in the set of solutions for 

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.278
 the system of inequalities; 

00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:06.774
 this will be in the set of solutions for 

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.701
 the system of inequalities, all these points, 

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.195
 because they are in the multitude of the decisions of the blue inequality, 

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.029
 which we see in the green. 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.885
 We assume that the green just goes down. 

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:18.209
 And in fact what we see here 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.217
 is actually overlapping. 

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:22.771
 Now that we understand things better, 

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:23.920
 let us actually answer the questions. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.206
 We are limited to equal to minus 2. 

00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.597
 Actually, let me draw a right here that shows everyone 

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:32.708
 points in which y is equal to minus 2. 

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:35.135
 This shows, at least on the graph, 

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:38.130
 where y is equal to minus 2. 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.054
 Given that equals to minus 2, what should be true for x, 

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:47.007
 to satisfy the inequality system here? 

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:49.948
 Well we're going to deal with all the x values, 

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:52.658
 to the right and including this point. 

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.979
 I can also say, because the blue inequality, 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.888
 we can also have equal points of rights; 

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.896
 we can actually be right. 

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.996
 Finding rights, we will be part of the set of solutions for both 

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:09.328
 or all that is right. 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.166
 So that's all 

00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:17.618
 is part of the set of solutions. 

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:19.880
 And thus, if we limit y to be equal to minus 2, 

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:24.247
 we see that x should be greater than 

00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:27.755
 or equal to minus 3. 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.940
 And we see that 

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:33.433
 this is this answer, 

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:34.880
 this answer is there, 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.481
 x is greater than or equal to minus 3. 

00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:41.136
 Now let's resolve another, instead of limiting y, 

00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:44.195
 now we will limit x. 

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:48.594
 Which value of y will make the ordered 4-digit pair y 

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.403
 solution of the system of inequalities presented 

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:53.110
 through the graph below? 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.336
 Again, I recommend that you pause the video 

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:58.482
 and see if you can do it yourself. 

00:03:58.482 --> 00:03:59.727
 Okay, now let's do it together. 

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:03.420
 In this case, we restrict x. 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.293
 We say x must be equal to 4. 

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:07.529
 So, x equal to 4, 

00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:13.601
 these are all points of this right 

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.749
 right here. 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.002
 We are limited to points, 

00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:20.300
 but we want to be part of it 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.088
 of the multitude of decisions. 

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:25.420
 So we want to be on this right, 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.312
 which limits us to a value equal to 4, 

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:30.087
 but we want to be in the area of ​​overlapping sets of solutions 

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:33.041
 of the two inequalities to satisfy the system. 

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.433
 So let's see. 

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:38.598
 We want to be in this area here, 

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.279
 this is the overlap of sets of decisions 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.525
 of the two inequalities. 

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:46.930
 And thus, if we limit to x equal to 4, 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.787
 y should be larger than, because we do not include 

00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:54.259
 the green line itself, it is interrupted. 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.439
 So u must be greater than minus 1 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.770
 or we can say minus 1 should be less than y, 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.242
 and then u can have values ​​only 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.528
 up to 3 inclusive. 

00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:11.036
 Up up to 3 including this blue line 

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:12.278
 is actually dense. 

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.948
 So everything that's on the blue line 

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.233
 will be in the multitude of the decisions of the blue inequality. 

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.497
 And this point I show here is definitely 

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:23.736
 is located in the area of ​​overlap of the two inequalities, 

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:28.554
 so u should be less than or equal to 3. 

00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:31.290
 Therefore, if x is equal to 4, y should be 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.560
 greater than minus 1 or less 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.961
 or equal to minus 3 ... 

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.260
 And less than or equal to 3, I had to say. 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.724
 Let's see which of these answers: 

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:42.914
 minus 1 is less than y, is less than or equal to 3. 

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:45.303
 This is, once again, the first answer.
