&gt;&gt;Ann Doyle: Hello. I'm Ann Doyle. I'm the
author of "Powering Up: How America's Women

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.020
Achievers
Become Leaders", and I've been invited here

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.070
to Google's headquarters in Ann Arbor to participate
in

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.900
your Authors, is that what you call it?
&gt;&gt;Female in audience:#1: MmmHmm.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt;Ann Doyle: Kind of an author's forum, which
I really appreciate. I'm a Michigan person.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.670
So, and I'm a
graduate of the University of Michigan. So,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.529
this is kind of home here in Ann Arbor. But
I'm going to talk

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.669
just a little bit about what the books about,
what motivated to write it, and what I-I-I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.890
hope a reader will
get out of picking this book up. And then

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.110
I would love you to ask me some tough questions.
I was a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.550
journalist for 15 years and made a good part
of my career. I made a pretty good living

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.580
asking really
difficult questions. So, I hope you'll do

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.840
that, and I'll begin by just saying that I
am a woman who is, I'm-

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.409
I've been a professional woman for 40 years.
And so I-I have seen tremendous change in

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.310
my adult
lifetime in terms of what's happened in the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.570
work place in terms of women. And so, and
because I was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.000
a woman who was really part of that generation
that was really on the cutting edge in terms

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.909
of pushing
the edges of women moving into a really nontraditional

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.510
jobs. I-I-I-I did those things myself, and
I also

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.380
was a journalist who covered all that. And
so I really was very, very close to what happened,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.720
and how
far we've come as women, and also really conscious

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.771
about how far we still have to go.
And so I really got to a point in terms of

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:49.490
after all this period of time where I, people
always said to me,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.730
"Ann, you know, you really oughta write a
book." Because my background includes 15 years

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.979
as a
journalist, where one, five years I spent

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.689
as one of the first woman TV sports broadcasters
in the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.530
nation. So I helped to open the locker rooms
in this country, the sport's locker rooms.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.700
And so I call that
a leadership laboratory where you are tested

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.410
in some pretty tough environments.
Then I spent the second part of my careers

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.980
at Ford Motor Company, and the auto industry
has a pretty

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.900
famous steel ceiling, as I call it. So, you
know, I had the corporate experience of understanding

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.650
what it
takes to, for women to push, raise that ceiling,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.680
uh, which are very much still in place in
the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.840
corporate environment.
I'm also a single parent. I-I have a 19 year

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.150
old son. I would call parenting a leadership
laboratory. His

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.950
father died when he was very, very young.
So I pretty much raised him by myself. And

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.080
then the
fourth piece of really what I bring to this

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.080
conversation is I ran for office last year.
I've always been out there encouraging women

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.860
to run for office. We do not have enough women
running for office, and I'm part of something

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.370
called the "White House Project," which is
training. We

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.590
plan to train 35 thousand women by 2014 to
run for office. And someone finally said to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.560
me, "Ann,
you're always telling everybody else to run,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.680
why don't you stick your neck out there?"
So, I did that,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.920
too.
So, I bring all of that experience to this

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.640
conversation, but when I finally decided that
I was going to write

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.040
a book, I knew that it wasn't, it shouldn't
just be memoir. This is not memoir. You know,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.849
I have some
pretty great stories, and I-my stories are

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.099
woven through this book. But I knew that this-
this country at

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:43.739
this point is really just loaded with incredible
women who can match me story for story. And

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.099
so I put
on my journalist hat and I went looking for

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.849
the story. What's the story now? In 2011,
what's the story

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:03.730
now? And I interviewed 125 of the most incredible
women, the leaders from all different professions,

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.239
from all different generations, all different
races and cultural backgrounds not only from

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.500
the United
States but also from other parts of the world.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.440
And-and the question was asking women from
other

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.850
parts of the world was, "What's your message
for American woman?" Because this is really

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.850
about
women; how women become leaders in our culture.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.910
But I wanted the global perspective on that,
and

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.840
so, the good news is that I could have gone
on interviewing incredible, high-achieving

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.470
women for
years. I mean, this country is-has become

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.550
a nation of women achievers, and it's happened
in my adult

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.650
lifetime. And it's really incredible to see.
And there are now three very, very distinct

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.070
generations of high achieving women in the
workplace

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.020
today. And I write a chapter about each one
of these generations, because we're very,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.410
very different.
And I think it's really important that we

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.810
start to understand each other, because there's
a lot of

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:17.780
dissonance between women. We're not helping
one another. And so, we're there in big numbers,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.460
but
the story is that even though we become this

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.930
nation of high achieving women, we are leader
ship

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.880
underachievers. And some people really bristle
at that, you know. But, I mean the facts are

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.760
just
devastating in terms of proving that story,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.520
and we hold an average of 18% of the leadership
positions

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.180
in every work sector. Now it has been 20 years
since men earned more college degrees than

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.320
women in this country. And that's a whole
other topic about what's going on with men.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.120
But women have been
earning more college degrees for 20 years,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.570
they're earning more graduate level degrees,
and they just

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:11.600
cracked more PhDs. So women are incredibly
qualified and the middle keeps getting bigger

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.740
and bigger
and bigger.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:22.930
And it was very clear to me that women today
are, too few women are going anywhere that

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.500
women
haven't been before. And I really felt, that-it-and

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.509
I would say we've been stalled for at least
10 years,

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:38.590
maybe more. And there's sort of an unconsciousness
about it in terms of the importance of big

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.150
numbers of women moving up into those leadership
positions. And because I have the experience

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.620
as a
woman who, women of my generation who've really

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.440
moved into those non-traditional jobs, we
have

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.979
first, first, first all through our resumes.
Yet we were all alone when we were doing it.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.639
But we also
knew we were part of something bigger than

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:07.580
ourselves, and so we knew we were like moving
women

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.680
forward in this country and we were. There's
no sense of that right now. I just don't see

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.539
enough
women daring to take the risk that it takes

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:26.229
to lead. And so, that's what this book is
about. That's what,

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:33.800
when I became very clear about what the story
was- is that we needed a book about graduate

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.440
work.
On what it takes for women, who are high achieving

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.930
women, highly educated, have mastered the
fundamentals of being successful, but-but

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.229
really needed almost like a field guide of
what the-what's

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:54.130
the graduate work? What do you do now? What's
next? If you really believe your leadership

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.020
material,
what is that working on? What are the skills

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.340
you need to have? And that's what this book
is about.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:09.120
And those were the questions that I was asking
women. I have over 100 hours of transcribed

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.930
interviews with some of the most incredible
women. And one of the women right now, Major

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.940
General
Maggie Woodward is the person who is in charge

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.599
of the U. S., United States Air Operations
over Libya.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:32.150
She made news a couple weeks ago because never
before has a woman commanded such a military

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:38.360
operation. And those were the ki- that's the
level of women that I had access to. And you

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.159
know, after
a while when you started doing all these interviews

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.219
and you start asking, you know, because I
wanted

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:48.280
to know, what do they know? I knew what I
know. I knew what I had learned over 40 years,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.480
but I really
wanted to go hunting for, I knew there was

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.199
a tremendous amount of knowledge out there
and I

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:58.779
wanted to know what did they know? What did
they know that I didn't know? What did they

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:02.249
know
that we could pass on so that other women

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:05.480
wouldn't have to learn it one-by-one. You
know, I want

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:14.239
women to go faster. I want more women moving
into higher levels, aspiring higher, and I

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:16.309
want them
to go faster than we did. And so that's really

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:21.689
what I was looking for. And that's how I came
up with the

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:28.230
really, the second half of this book, I mean,
is the seven practices. I call it the "Seven

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.059
Practices." You
all have heard of Stephen Covey and his "Seven

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:35.220
Habits of Highly Effective People."
Well, this is- these are Seven Practices that

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.040
I say that high achieving women, who believe
they are

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.420
leadership material, this is what you need
to master next. And I didn't just make these

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.300
up. As I said,
they come from my experience, but they also

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.029
come from the themes that came through over
and

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:57.749
over and over again in these 100 hours of
transcripts. You know, and interviews that

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:01.949
I did with
incredible women. And I listed all the women

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:04.899
in the back of the book. You know, so you
could read

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:11.949
and see who these women are. And also on my
Facebook fan page, which is called "Powering

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:14.160
Up
Women Book" I think it is. But you can just

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.649
Google it, because it's a publ- you can just
Google it,

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.569
[laughter]
Because it's pub, because, I love how that's

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:26.899
become a verb, because it's a public site
now. But I've-I'm posting pictures of all

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:33.490
these women. You know, so that you can see
what they look like, and I'm asking these

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.739
women to give me not only like a professional
picture or kind of an office picture or head

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:43.470
shot. But I said give me an action picture.
You know, give me a shot of you doing your

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.139
work or, you know, with
your family or you know something that kind

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:49.360
of tells, shows somebody a little bit more
about to you.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:58.230
And so you can look it up. They're right on
the fan page, and you can see Commander General

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.540
Maggie
Woodward with her paratroopers. You know,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.170
she's a pilot. You know, that's her training
and

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.939
everything, right you know. And all their
flight gear in front of the plane. And those

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:12.269
kind of cool
pictures. So I listed all of them, but I will,

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:15.920
I guess I'll just mention, and then I hope
we can kind of have

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.850
a conversation here.
I divided the book into three parts, three

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.199
major parts. And the first major part is "Who
are we?" "Part

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:30.429
one: Who are we?" And that's where I basically
make my case that the first chapter is so

00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:33.230
many
achievers, where are our leaders? You know

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.019
and I basic, that's where I make my case about
where we

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:39.309
are right now.
And then I have a chapter on each of these

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.589
three distinct generations of women, of high
achieving

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:48.660
women. And these are really subsets of the
generations. You know, we talk about baby

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.790
boomers and
gen Xs and new millennials. And I'm talking

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.439
about a subset of those groups. I'm talking
about women,

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:03.920
and I'm talking about aspiring women. And
that means women who are educated, usually.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.839
They don't
have to be, but, you know. Are lucky enough

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:10.699
to be, you know, these are women who are struggling
to

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:16.899
survive usually. These are women lucky enough
to be in positions to start shaping our nation,

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:21.379
our
culture, our organizations. And so I divided

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.290
them into 3 groups and I named them. And nobody
else

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:30.949
has ever done this before, really named these
cohort groups. And I call them the interlopers,

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:33.990
that's
my generation. I call them the pioneering

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.999
interlopers. And if you know the definition
of interloper, the

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:42.399
dictionaries says," It's someone who imposes
herself or himself where they're not wanted

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:46.369
or in
other's business." So, you know, when I was

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:49.239
imposing myself and insisting on as a woman
journalist I

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:53.839
should have equal access to sports locker
rooms as the men who are going in there, I

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:57.509
was an
interloper. And so these women were very much

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:59.989
in situations like this. So I called them
the

00:12:59.989 --> 00:13:05.569
pioneering interlopers. And we're in our mid
50s and older now. Geraldine Ferraro, we're

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:09.269
starting to
lose some of our interlopers. Geraldine Ferraro,

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:12.920
first woman ever to be on a national ticket
as Vice

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.319
President of the United States on the Democratic
ticket, just died of course, a pioneering

00:13:19.319 --> 00:13:23.059
interloper.
The next generation are the women who are

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:27.549
really kind of mid-thirties up to early 50s,
and they are- I

00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:34.799
call them the "influential insiders" because
they were very, very different from the interlopers.

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:40.130
Because while the interlopers needed certain
skills to- I mean really we were like fighting

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.389
our way in
the door. Nobody wanted us. We were fighting

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:48.209
our way in the door and ran into a lot of,
you know, a

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:52.370
lot of hostility even.
And this next genera- sometimes I call us

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.639
the marines. You know, we had to put on our
flak jackets

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:02.290
and really take some heavy fire right out
of college. And-and so we were kind of the

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.419
marines for
taking the professional beaches.

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:11.069
This next generation the "Influential Insiders,"
I really call them like the diplomats, because

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:14.519
they came
next, and they were, by the time they got

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:17.919
out of college and were moving into the workforce,
things

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:24.019
were changing. And the biggest thing that
changed was there was room for one woman.

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:28.779
They didn't
have to fight their way in the door. They

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:32.639
actually had, they were good. The ones who
are honest will

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:39.410
tell you it was an advantage to be a woman,
because, but there was only one woman. There

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.970
was
room for one woman, and so what happened was

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.689
it pitted women against one another. You were
competing with other women for the woman's

00:14:46.689 --> 00:14:52.269
spot, the woman job. And so those women as
a group

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:57.239
tend not to be very supportive of other women,
because they were their primary competition.

00:14:57.239 --> 00:14:59.410
The
other thing about them, they're the "I'm no

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.110
feminist but" women. I must have heard that
a million

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.980
times. They ran away from the whole thing
about feminism, because by that time feminism

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.540
had really
been changed in terms of its definition in

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.269
a lot of ways had been corroded and changed
from what I

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:20.990
understood it to be. And it really became
the "F" word in corporate America. It became

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.990
very
dangerous.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:28.799
And they, the most successful "influential
insiders" were the ones who made it very clear

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:32.579
to the work
cultures they were in that they were not one

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:35.600
of those trouble-making interlopers. They
got along.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.389
They're not boat rockers. And so that's characteristic
of this group, and it's not a criticism. It's

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:45.129
kind of
what they needed to do at that time. And they're

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:47.540
the women who had the opportunity to play
sports.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.839
They're post title nine. They had some chances
to play sports. And I never had that chance

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:56.519
in high
School, in college. They are the first of

00:15:56.519 --> 00:16:00.480
women to graduate from military academies.
So they are

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.649
more and more lawyers, more doctors, you know,
a very, very different group and a very important

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:10.290
group.
And now we come to probably most of you, who

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.639
are, I call you the "I'll do it my way innovators."
So

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:20.430
we have the interlopers, the insiders, and
the innovators. And I don't need to tell any

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.670
of you about all
the stuff that has been written about new

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.160
millennials and what you know about yourselves
in terms

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.160
of, I mean, I look around the room and just
look at the culture here at Google, which

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.509
is, you know, it's
fascinating. It-it's great. And even the way

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:39.869
you dress and the way you work and your expectations
about how you should be able to work are very,

00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:44.949
very different and I think it's really very
exciting. And

00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:55.240
you are the most educated and ambitious generation
of women in the history of the world. That's

00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.540
just
a fact. And you know, we, American women,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.499
are not ahead of women in other parts of the
world, but

00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:08.419
there are several things that are different
about us. Number one, we are lucky enough

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:11.880
to be born into
the United States. One of the most influential

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.679
nations in the world and where we have legal
rights and

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:22.529
cultural rights; opportunities that women
all over the world just dream about. And so

00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:26.809
it's just given.
And then the other huge piece of it is that

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:30.980
there are so many of us. You know, there's
no other nation

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:40.210
in the world, no one nation with so many highly
educated, economically- independent women

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:49.410
in the
world. You know until the potential of what

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.649
your generation can do and also, what these
three

00:17:52.649 --> 00:18:00.899
generations of women can do in terms of shaping
the world that we live in is incredible. And

00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:03.450
that-
that's what really has inspired me, because

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.269
I just see the table set. The table's just
set.

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:13.330
But I'm also very discouraged because I see
women standing at the gates of leadership

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.789
and - and
they're not pouring in. And it's really time

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:22.899
for women to start pouring into top leadership
the way I

00:18:22.899 --> 00:18:30.580
witnessed women pouring in to non-professional
jobs in the 60s and the 70s. I saw it happen.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.929
I know
what it feels like when you change a culture

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:37.440
dramatically. And you don't change culture
dramatically

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.700
with exceptions to the rule. You do it with
big numbers. And that's very much what I care

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.240
about. You
know I care about, and I feel very passionately.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.150
I know that the world would be a better place
when

00:18:53.150 --> 00:19:02.289
women are also- our voices and our experience
and our values are also at the table, you

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:05.630
know,
shaping decisions that are being made. Because

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.120
right now I kind of think of the human family
as sort

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.299
of, it's almost- most parts of the world it's
kind of a single father making all the decisions,

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:20.179
you know.
The mothers in terms of mothering leadership

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:24.580
at those decision making tables. Whether it's
political,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:34.090
corporate, economic, cultural, all of those
things, every piece that shapes our culture,

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.191
our nation, our
world, the decisions that are made. Most of

00:19:36.191 --> 00:19:42.039
those decisions are made by men. And, you
know what?

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:49.679
That's imbalanced. There's some really important
pieces that are missing, and I know we'll

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.710
make better
decisions when we get women. And women are

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.139
ready to be there.
So, that's pretty much is what my book is

00:19:57.139 --> 00:20:00.210
about. And you know, one other thing I would
say about this is

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:06.700
that I like when I speak to women and I like
to say, you know, we're in a very steep learning

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:12.519
curve. because if you think about it, men
have been bred for leadership for thousands

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:22.379
of years. Thousands
of years and they have, they have millions

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:29.120
of models of men doing all these different
leadership,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.210
taking all these different leadership roles
in every possible profession there is. And

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.610
women, number
one, were blocked out of all that. I mean,

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.809
it's all really very, very new in terms of
cultural evolution.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:49.409
This is really pretty new stuff. We only started,
got the right to vote in 1920 in this country,

00:20:49.409 --> 00:20:54.659
and really, I
mean, women couldn't even, you know, play

00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:56.900
on; there were no sports teams for women when
I was

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.080
growing up. Until, you know, really mid-seventies
before it started actually organizing some

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.659
of that.
And so, an-and then, you know, you really

00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:10.259
didn't even have moving, women moving into
these.

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:19.860
Being doctors and lawyers and judges and major,
very visible journalist's roles. All those

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.000
kind of things,
I mean, it's really new. It's really new.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.559
And so we are on a steep learning curve, but
I uh, you know,

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:35.529
when you're trying to learn anything. The
faster you can cut that learning curve, you

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:40.529
know, the better
you get at something quick. And so that's

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:44.963
my book. That's and I guess I didn't mention,
and I should

00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:48.610
mention the seven practices, right?
Should I mention what those uh, yea. I mentioned

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.850
that there's three generation, yea, oh yea,
let me

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:57.100
finish this and then maybe we can talk. You
know that there's, the book is divided into

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.490
the three parts
about: Part one being who we are. And I talked

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.520
about these three generations, kind of making
the

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.539
case about where we are and then the three
generations.

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:12.669
Part two is just two chapters and I call it
"Where-where are we?" And that's one of them

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:17.070
is called "Why
girls don't rule." and that's a whole discussion

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.910
of how women undermine ourselves, and how
we

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.420
undermine one another. And then there's a
very important chapter called, "What do men

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.659
have to do
with it?" The answer to that, of course, is

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:32.710
plenty. It's you know men can be tremendously
important

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:40.510
allies and they can also be blocks, you know.
So that's a very important chapter. I had

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.139
an incredible
father. I am one of seven children. I have

00:22:44.139 --> 00:22:46.920
three brothers and three sisters. So I talk
about my brothers,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:52.190
of course. And here I am also raising a son.
And I talk about him, of course. And so, you

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.730
know, the
whole role fathers and brothers and husbands

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.179
and bosses and colleagues, I mean, men are
very much

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:01.580
a part of this. So there's a whole chapter
about that.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.070
And then the last half of the book, are these
Part three. I call it "How achievers become

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.809
leaders" in, that's these seven practices.
So, my seven practices are: the first one

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:18.330
is discover your purpose. Discover your purpose
and that's where you get your passion, and

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:23.820
that's where you get the energy because leading
is not easy. It's hard. So, you first have

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.360
got to find your purpose. And um-
The second one is "Raise your voice." You

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.269
know, we've talked to-for a couple of decades
about

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:35.039
women finding their voices. Uh, it's time
to raise our voices. And this, so that's the

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:39.769
next chapter.
Um, next one is "Break the rules." Of course,

00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:42.679
you can't start breaking the rules until you've
mastered

00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:47.451
the rules of the game in the first place.
But the leadership piece is having the courage

00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:50.100
to break the
rules and knowing how to do it.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.860
The fourth one is "Claim power."This is basically
about the fact that no one is going to give

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.179
you power. I
have this analogy that I use in my mind that

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:04.630
I say. Women are like these leadership wallflowers.
That

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:10.909
we are all dressed up, tapping our toes to
the music, hoping somebody's going to invite

00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:13.360
us to the
leadership dance. And I basically say, you

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.150
know what, nobody's going to invite you to
the leadership

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:22.049
dance. You have to claim the power, and that
means run for office yourself. Go for those

00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:27.049
jobs
yourself, but also women really need to encourage

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:30.490
other women to do that, too. We know that
it

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.979
takes women, there's plenty of research about
this, we know that it takes women about ten

00:24:34.979 --> 00:24:37.500
years
longer than men to understand how good they

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.330
are. I want to cut those ten years, I mean
that's just,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:50.730
come on. I want to get over that and start
figuring out earlier and start claiming power

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.529
and going for
those positions earlier.

00:24:54.529 --> 00:25:00.659
The next one is "Drink at dangerous waters."
That's all about taking risks, but it's also

00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:04.570
about getting out
of your comfort zone. And it's about, you

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:12.110
know, this whole global world that we're in
and developing

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:20.039
the skills to work really well with and recognize
talent in and build relationships with people

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:22.820
who think
differently from you, who are different from

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.960
you and it even means working with rivals
and people

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:32.250
you don't like. And it even talks about professional
enemies in there. So, "Drink at dangerous

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.940
waters"
is that one.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:40.371
Then the last two are "Get back in the saddle,"
you can imagine what that's all about. That's

00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:43.570
about
getting knocked down. Everybody gets knocked

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.700
down; everybody fails. I like to say, if you're
not

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.159
failing, I mean really failing, not just little
mistakes, I mean really failing. You have

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:56.879
no idea what your real
abilities are. And so you really have to fail,

00:25:56.879 --> 00:25:59.529
and what differentiates people is how fast
they get up. How

00:25:59.529 --> 00:26:04.440
fast they get up and get right back in there
and get back in the saddle.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:11.129
And then the last one is- it's a word that
I coined and it's called "Womaninity." The

00:26:11.129 --> 00:26:16.130
subtitle of that
chapter is "Beyond the girls and the guys."

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.710
But womaninity, I like to define womaninity
as um-

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:29.240
womaninity is to masculinity as Ms. is to
mister. Now all of you just kind of take the

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.540
word Ms. for
granted, but I remember very well when we

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.870
only had a choice of Miss or Misses. And-and
really it

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.929
defined a women immediately in terms of her
relationship to a man. It wasn't about just

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:47.080
you're a male
or a female as a man is just a mister. I mean

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.040
there is nothing about being married or single,
you know

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:59.299
or what? And so, the word Ms. came into usage,
and I know plenty of women my age who were

00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:06.730
mocked in law schools, publically mocked in
their- in classrooms if they wanted to use

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:11.380
Ms. instead of
Miss to be identified. Uh so that was not

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.759
an easy thing, but now it's just common. But
it's very

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:24.471
important because it just basically defines
you as a female. And so there is no word that

00:27:24.471 --> 00:27:28.230
is parallel to
masculinity, because femininity, when you

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.669
look that up in the dictionary it's really
all about the very

00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:38.309
softest parts of women. And it even says it's
the opposite of masculinity. So, if we think

00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:41.740
of masculine
meaning a man is strong, courageous; well

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.210
what's the opposite of that? Weak and fearful?
Femininity

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:55.049
does not work in terms of defining the qualities
of a fully evolved woman. And that's why I

00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:58.690
came up
with womaninity, because I'm basically saying

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:04.590
that, you know, it's really time. When I started
learning

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.140
to lead and those kinds of things, pretty
much my only role models were men. There really

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.059
were not a
lot of women that I could look to, to pattern

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:16.700
myself after to see what worked. And a lot
of women my

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.539
age, you know, we made a lot of mistakes.
And we found out, you are- you're never going

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.379
to be able
to lead the way a man does. Because we're

00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:29.169
not men, and so if you try to do that your
really going to be

00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:35.259
criticized for it. It's not going to work.
And so we're really just developing this whole

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:40.269
enough examples
for us to look at. Uh okay, well how does

00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:46.779
a woman, a fully evolved woman lead? And a
big piece of

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:52.190
that is being very, very comfortable in your
own- relaxed in your own skin, but also really

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:57.710
tapping into
the natural innate strengths of our gender.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.110
And you know, we know, the two genders have
very

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.499
different, real strengths that we're learning
about our brains and differences between us

00:29:06.499 --> 00:29:11.039
now. And so
that's what "Womaninity" is all about.

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:15.679
And then of course the Epilogue is really
just a call to action. It's just you know,

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:20.590
I really am
encouraging, trying to teach, pass along what

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:25.990
I've learned from my research experience,
and then

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:34.179
daring. I'm daring women to lead. So that's
my book.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:37.120
So, I'd love any of your thoughts. I'd love
to have a conversation or any questions?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:44.059
&gt;&gt;female #2: Are there any themes? You said
you talked to all these really powerful, successful

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:48.210
women.
Were there any commonalities between them?

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:53.549
You know, something that sort of, that they
all

00:29:53.549 --> 00:30:00.009
seemed to have the same mindset or...
&gt;&gt;Ann: Yea, absolutely. And that was why when

00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:02.360
you do 100 hours of transcripts and you start
looking

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.210
for themes. And that was how I, you know,
I finally came up with these seven practices,

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.269
because that
was really built on these themes. And I mean

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:17.840
and I actually started out with a list that
I also sent out to

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.740
several 100 women of just bullet points of
what I thought were qualities that maybe were

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.159
leadership
qualities. And I said, "Hey! Prioritize these,

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.850
what's missing from the list? Add things to
the list. Take

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.700
things off." And so all the women I interviewed
filled those out for me. But also, I had a

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.460
couple of
hundred more that also filled those out for

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.909
me. And then I just started cutting them up.
And seeing

00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:49.500
how, which ones came up over and over and
over again. And I'd say, in answer to that

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.010
question, Lilly,
a couple of really most important things.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:31:01.499
The biggest piece is confidence. I mean confidence,
confidence, confidence. It all comes down

00:31:01.499 --> 00:31:07.529
to that and the faster we can get girls to
develop confidence at an early age and then

00:31:07.529 --> 00:31:11.080
get them to keep
it through those really tough adolescent years

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.820
where girls tend to like loose it completely.
[laughter]

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.919
You're laughing because you remember maybe,
right?

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:22.139
[laughter]
Yea, uh- anything we can do to, that's that

00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:27.580
piece about taking women, usually about 10
years longer than men to figure out truly

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.759
how good they are.
Um, and that's cultural. It's cultural muck

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:36.730
that, uh, women have to fight their way through.
And so

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:44.940
confidence is huge and another piece and so
confidence is related to courage. It's related

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:50.059
to raising
your voice. It's related to drinking at dangerous

00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:53.360
waters. It's related to how you handle setbacks.
It's

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.999
related to every single one of these. Confidence,
that's almost like the clay, you know, the

00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:03.119
building
material that you need. You can, it's the

00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:09.893
fuel; I mean to say confidence is the fuel.
It's one of the most important ones.

00:32:09.893 --> 00:32:17.259
The other thing that came up as a theme over
and over again was this whole issue of women

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:21.309
not
supporting other women, and women undermining

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:27.739
other women. And every single woman I
interviewed said something along these lines.

00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:34.830
Oh, that's huge. That's huge. And in my speaking
that

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:40.989
I've done so far about this book, the most
questions that I get are about that, are about

00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:45.200
that. And I
like to say uh- I use a great Madeline Albright

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.159
quote in here that-at beginning one of the
chapters that

00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:52.999
says, "There's a special place in hell for
women who don't support other women."

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:53.999
[laughter]
I-I-I-I believe that now.

00:32:53.999 --> 00:33:00.499
[laughter]
An-and I-I, you know, I mean I pretty much

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:03.580
divide women into two categories and I make
a decision

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:09.690
pretty quickly about it. When I meet somebody
I'm thinking, okay are you a women who supports

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.259
and
aligns with other women, or are you a woman

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:16.169
who separates yourself from and undermines
other

00:33:16.169 --> 00:33:22.820
women? If you are in that second group, I
have no time for you. I have no time for you.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.940
I don't care
what your job is. I don't care how much money

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.649
you have. You know, I don't trust you, and
I'm not

00:33:28.649 --> 00:33:31.619
going to put any energy into sharing my network
with you. I'm certainly not going to follow

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:34.720
you as a
leader etcetera, etcetera.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:42.379
And I want to make this clear for maybe men
who are watching this, you know, of what I'm

00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:46.279
not saying.
Because somebody might say, well, gee, men

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:50.850
don't support one another. Well, yes they
do. And I

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:59.470
think that the language is different. Because
men understand very ear, no matter how competitive

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:06.669
they are with one another, men understand
very well that they need to align with one

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:09.649
another and
help one another. And what do you think the

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:12.550
good 'ole boy's network is all about anyway?
You know,

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.950
what do you think the Optimist and the Rotary
and the Lions and the Elks that women had

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:21.159
to sue in
order to get their way into those organizations

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:28.520
were all about? They're about men coming together
and-and helping one another and their networks.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.609
Why is it that Augusta National Golf course,
where

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:40.231
no women are allowed to join and it's so prestigious
for CEOs to be members of that club. They

00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:44.839
really
don't get to the club that much to play golf

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:47.750
there. It's about the network. It's about
them being part of

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:56.809
a network and having access to other very
powerful men. So, men absolutely do this,

00:34:56.809 --> 00:35:01.080
and women
have not learned how to do this yet. And it's

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.290
very, very important, because I like to say
to women you

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:09.089
know what? You're never going to be one of
the guys. You are never going to be one of

00:35:09.089 --> 00:35:12.970
the guys. And
you know, you need to get along well with

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.750
men, work well with men, support men, all
those kinds of

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.750
things, but you're still never going to be
one of the guys.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:28.750
And so, your only natural other big group
for those kind of alliances is other women.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:34.170
And women are starting to realize this and
there are starting to be networks of very

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:39.630
powerful women, who are at the top now. Who
have made a tremendous amount of money and

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:47.410
are starting to align together to help younger
women to get equity capital, to younger women

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:53.210
starting businesses, and things like that.
So, there are some things like this going

00:35:53.210 --> 00:36:02.859
on, but it's really important for women to
stop undermining each other andstart understanding

00:36:02.859 --> 00:36:09.470
that the only way we are going to make big
changes is if we recognize our

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.299
collective power.
And you know, other groups do this, and as

00:36:13.299 --> 00:36:15.840
I said men have always done this in the professional
world.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.170
Through all of history, men have done this,
but on top of that, I mean, you see Hispanic

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.099
organizations
joining together, you see African-American

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:30.520
organizations joining together, you see Muslim
organizations joining, you see many examples

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:37.210
of this. But women still, I mean, when we
begin to get it

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:45.320
in terms of how much influence we can have
collectively if we start thinking about that.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.610
Um- we're gonna-we're gonna just leap frog
ahead.
