STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.650
It's good to have you here.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.370
I see some familiar faces
and some less familiar faces.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.520
So that's fantastic.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.570
So what I wanted to
do is prepare to talk.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.195
And within the talk,
I have some images,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.380
a few videos to look
at, and there's also

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.110
a audience
participation component,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.000
because that's just how I roll.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.030
We have to practice
what we're up to.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:37.410
So this segment, this talk, is
one that is looking at pedagogy

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.060
as not simply pedagogical
strategies in general

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.520
but to look more at the
ways that I translate

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840
this idea of pedagogy through
lenses or filters of disruption

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.730
or of criticality.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.370
And so part of the work
that I do professionally

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.050
is prepare teachers
of art for K12.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.420
But I also work with
graduate students

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.670
as they conduct their
research, I also

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.690
do my own research
in scholarly kinds

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.280
of moves about the ways in which
visual imagery, visual art,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.250
visual cultural production,
functions, as modes or spaces

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.170
for teaching and learning.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.890
Jasper Johns, a
pop artist, someone

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.420
who's been relegated
into that space

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.724
by some critics and
historians, this

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.140
is something--
this is a statement

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.089
he made about his art practice.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:34.380
Like, how do you make your art?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.940
What's your approach?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.580
Take an objective,
do something to it,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.420
and I do something else to it.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.330
Really?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.920
Well, yeah, I mean, that
seems really simplified.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.170
But for me, that's a really
interesting and quite powerful

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.770
methodology or method to use.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.410
You take something, and then
that thing is not just--

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.972
it's not finished.

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.680
It's not done being
whatever it could be.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.710
And then, do something to it.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.190
OK, but then, keep it going.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.210
Do something else do it.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.870
So for me, the doing can
happen in a number of ways.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.120
You can alter it, you can
modify it, you can throw it.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.139
You can add something to it.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.430
You can take something away.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.030
But we can also, as
viewers or people

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.610
who are engaging with that
object, we might ask questions.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
So the asking questions
is a form of doing.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
And so for me, Johns's
quotation is nice, for me,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.600
as a bridge from a more
modernist mindset or approach

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.100
where it's about
the object and it's

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.759
about the making, the
process of making to--

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.300
some books might
talk about the slide

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.630
into postmodernism
or other post spaces,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.110
where we move beyond
objectness or materialness

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.760
to other realms that have
more conceptual content

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.180
and interest.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.460
That notion of asking
questions or take an object,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.543
doing something to it,
doing something else to it,

00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:54.780
you could engage
learners like that.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.576
That's one way to
engage learners.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.950
So if we think
about learners, we

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.420
should also think
about curriculum.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.960
Now, this is an image--

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.930
this is not one that
I drew, but it's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.990
a cartoon, a single cartoon
panel from Non Sequitur.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.640
And I use this image when
I teach curriculum classes.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.447
So on the right, we
have this larger fish

00:03:16.447 --> 00:03:18.780
with kind of sharp teeth, and
there's stuff falling down

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.020
from the fish's mouth, and then
there are these three smaller

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.987
fish, and then there's
another fish that's

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:27.570
kind of medium sized, and that
one actually knows how to talk,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.580
which I think is an
interesting thing.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.960
So we're able to
know what fish say.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.360
The medium-sized fish says,
"No, we can't swim any faster.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.440
The school curriculum is
geared for the slower swimmers.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.650
So the 10 of you have to wait
for the others to catch up."

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.860
I don't know about you, I
only see four other fish.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.050
I only see four other fish.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.520
I do see one fish.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.770
It looks like little fish
bits that are falling

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.530
from this larger fish's mouth.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.690
So where is the curriculum?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.580
Here, is the curriculum
this larger fish

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.530
with the sharp teeth?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.520
Is the curriculum the swimming?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.230
Is the curriculum
the water itself?

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.530
This cartoon allows us to have
multiple entry points to ask

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.720
where the curriculum resides.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.880
And if we think about
that word "curriculum,"

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.590
it is derived from a Latin
word, currere. and that's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.720
the infinitive "to run" So
"curriculum" is "to run."

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.620
It's the running of a
course, rather than a noun.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.500
We think about it in
those terms, right?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.052
Curriculum theorists did
work in the '70s and '80s

00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:43.760
to reconceptualize
curriculum, but didn't

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.390
focus on this idea of
curriculum as a verb "to run."

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.240
So the running or, in this
case, the swimming of the course

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.210
is the curriculum--
so how they swim.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.800
I'm assuming the medium-sized
fish is the teacher

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.030
and could be, could also
be the school principal

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.250
or whoever is in charge there.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.830
But the middle
three are probably--

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.370
or this is supposed to
be maybe the students who

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.680
seem to know how to
swim the course the way

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.970
that it was designed.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.150
Well, this could be
one of the learners,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.800
too, swimming adequately.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.260
But sometimes when I have used
this image with my students

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.000
in curriculum courses, they
talk about how this larger fish,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.846
they often call
it the barracuda--

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:30.970
see, that's the curriculum.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.370
The curriculum eats
up the swimmers

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.040
who don't swim in
predetermined ways.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.780
Oh, OK, so here, a
curriculum is a noun

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.580
and an adversarial thing.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.160
How depressing is that to
be a teacher or a learner

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.940
to think the curriculum's
after you; you better stay

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.115
in front of it?

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.490
But if we think
of the curriculum

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.860
as a verb in the ways
in which we swim,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.250
maybe some swimmers swim higher
in the water, some swim lower,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.360
some swim sideways, some
swim faster and slower.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.910
How might the curriculum
allow for multiple swimmers

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.490
rather than a predetermined
and singular notion

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.890
of what a learner could be.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.845
But that's if we privilege
the idea of learning.

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.150
If we think about teaching,
we can just deliver.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.400
I mean, there are notions
of teaching and curriculum

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.710
that, from the early 1900s and
late 1800s that would proclaim

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.534
that learners are empty
vessels, and the teacher

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:30.450
has all the knowledge.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.790
We just fill you
up with knowledge.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.560
And that says, well,
you're a learner.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.330
You don't bring anything
to the classroom.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.330
But that's not the case.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.000
You swim the way you swim.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.360
Bring that to the classroom.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.500
So this idea of shifting from
teaching to learning privileges

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.540
or allows more attention to what
learners bring to those spaces.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.820
Well, another
standardized approach

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.600
that was very popular
100 years ago and still

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.160
somehow is popular within
some circles in art teaching

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.410
and education are
the elements of art

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.687
and the principles of design.

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:05.770
Some people call them the
elements and principles.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.500
But it's the elements of art
and principles of design.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.760
And certainly, these
are ways to say, look,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.720
these are the things that are
going on in visual imagery

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.780
or material culture.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.690
But they weren't intended
to be the limitations.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.000
They were intended to be
ways to gain access to what

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.470
we're seeing in front of us.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.340
Misinterpretation of
that, quite often,

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.679
studio teachers, art
teachers, other folks

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.220
will think that
these are the limits.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.844
And if we only talk about line,
shape, color, texture, pattern,

00:07:33.844 --> 00:07:38.532
rhythm, then we've
covered the curriculum.

00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:39.990
We've taught what
we need to teach.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.910
Well, that's an
interesting approach

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.540
if you want to avoid
content, if you

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.790
want to avoid
concepts, and ideas,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.600
and social issues--
if you want to avoid

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.411
lived experiences in the
lives of other people.

00:07:55.411 --> 00:07:57.660
And certainly when you're
looking at works of art that

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.320
are representative or
reflections of lived

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.450
experiences to omit interest in
what we're seeing and what is

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.110
being represented by simply
limiting it to a formalist--

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.750
and this is formalized notions--

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.720
then, we're missing part
of the conversation.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.200
So a number of years
ago, Olivia Gude,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.360
who is a scholar at School of
the Art Institute in Chicago.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.270
She said, look, we're not
in this modernist notion,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.770
and there are
different ways that we

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.250
can mobilize art practices.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.850
And she constructed this
set of postmodern principles

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.919
by looking at the work
that her students were

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:44.159
making during weekend art
classes in the Spiral Workshop.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.250
And she said, you know,
there's other principles,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.650
the elements of art and
principles of design,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.270
those seven--

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.910
group of seven elements and
group of seven principles

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.970
were guiding and have done
some work in art curriculum.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.760
But she said, as I look at the
work my students are making

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.730
based on the
assignments that we're

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.990
up to in the Spiral curriculum,
that are focused on themes,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.260
focused on social issues,
focused on concepts,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.330
focused on lived experiences,
she said of all of these works,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.862
these seven principles
seem to emerge,

00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:24.070
not that the elements of
art and principles of design

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.611
aren't there.

00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:28.600
Because I kind of dare you to
point to something in the world

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.530
that you can't talk
about in terms of line,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.080
or shape, or texture, right?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.240
So she's saying
that from looking

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.210
at the students' work generated
from a thematic approach

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.480
about concepts and lived
experiences in the world--

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.060
text and image is a
postmodern principle.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.070
Hybridity, this idea of things
kind of overlapping and merging

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.202
together, gazing, the
way in which one looks,

00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:54.910
and the perspective
from which one looks,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.070
and how one is looked at.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.770
Representing-- not just
to represent something

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.560
but how one's identity
gets represented

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.870
or how one represents oneself.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.150
Appropriation-- borrowing
from one context or another;

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.130
juxtaposition, the
critique of two objects

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.840
or two images in
relationship to each other.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.320
Recontextualization,
similar to appropriation,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.060
but taking something
out of one context,

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.740
putting it in a
new context, now it

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.720
speaks differently about
this other context.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.970
And layering, this idea of
how narratives or layers can

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.320
be read through each other
for multiple meanings.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.950
And I love what she
says, which is also

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.350
the pull-out quotation
from this article,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.370
"An infinite amount of time is
wasted in misdirected effort

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.770
because tradition
has a strong hold."

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.200
I mean, there are other
things that we can be doing,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.780
but, because we're
regimented in tradition,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.790
we just can't get there.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.130
All right, so let's engage
some learners like this.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.500
How about being some learners?

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.220
Good?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.450
All right, I have--

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.020
we have large paper.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.910
These are essentially
jumbo-sized Post-it notes.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.140
And we have markers.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.900
We have markers of
different colors.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.390
Most of them are
also gigantic sizes.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.120
It's like this larger cartoon
version of Post-it notes

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.560
and little markers.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.840
And what I would
like you to do is,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.460
we're going to use this approach
where we're going to do--

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.280
it's derived from
think, pair, share--

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.800
this approach of
learning, where I

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.810
want you to think on
your own, and then you're

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.364
going to find someone else to
pair with, and connect with,

00:11:28.364 --> 00:11:30.780
and then you're going to share
your ideas with each other,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.340
then we'll share with the group.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.680
So what I'd like
you to do right now

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.420
is, if you have something to
write with, that's great--

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.010
I don't think we brought
any normal-sized paper,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.205
but I'll give you two
minutes to do this first part

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.080
to think on your own.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.974
What I would like you
to do is choose one--

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.640
I'm not going to
decide for you, but I'd

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.540
like you to choose on your
own, one of these tasks,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.040
one of these
statements, and I want

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.517
you to come up with a list.

00:12:01.517 --> 00:12:03.100
So if you choose the
first one, you're

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.260
going to come up with a
list of 10 important women

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.060
in the history of the world.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.820
Don't show anybody.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.820
Keep it to yourself for now.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.520
Or you could choose
the second one.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.270
You can make a list
of 10 important events

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.830
in the history of the world.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.590
Or you can make a list of
10 important human creations

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.775
in the history of the world.

00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:22.260
Does that make sense?

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.040
Two minutes, go for it, and
then we'll come back together.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.250
The activity that
we are doing is one

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.370
that I use in a curriculum
development class and also

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.950
curriculum theory class,
usually near the beginning

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.760
of the semester to underscore
this idea that curriculum

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.490
development, curriculum
design, curriculum,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.110
as a general practice,
is a political act,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.270
and it's based in values.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.210
It's based in experiences.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.760
Imagine a textbook company
approached you and says,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.010
oh, you could get this contract
for a textbook, a history book.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.980
We only have enough
money for 10 chapters.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.660
So if you had 10 weeks to
teach a course, what 10 topics

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.860
would you teach?

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.260
You've got to decide
what doesn't get taught.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.052
Deciding what is not
in the curriculum

00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:10.260
is part of the political act.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.690
It's part of the
decision-making.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.120
So these three prompts
are ones that I've

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.010
used for years, and
years, and years

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.240
to do exactly what we did.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.510
You did it in like 15 minutes.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.070
I typically spend 15 minutes
having the students generate

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.780
the ideas, then we
spend 45 minutes

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.494
critiquing and interpreting.

00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:28.410
We're not going to spend
45 minutes critiquing

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.300
and interpreting, but I'll lead
you through some of the things

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.440
that I like to do.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.029
Which prompt was this one?

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:35.480
AUDIENCE: It's events?

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.280
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
This is events?

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.135
This one?

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.065
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:40.070
AUDIENCE: Creations.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.090
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Creations?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.690
What was this one?

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.170
AUDIENCE: Creations.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.378
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Creations.

00:13:43.378 --> 00:13:44.170
AUDIENCE: Women.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.050
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Women.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.883
AUDIENCE: Creations.

00:13:45.883 --> 00:13:48.190
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Creations.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.860
Now, notice the
prompts are-- we'll

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.380
talk about how I worded the
prompts in a little bit.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.550
I find it interesting-- this
is just the way I'm reading

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.630
your lists--

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:03.960
one, two, three, four of
the five lists use numbers.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.700
My assumption is that the one
entry next to the number one

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.660
is the most important,
only because it's listed--

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.240
I'm just kind of culturally--

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.910
you know in that habit.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.340
When I see a one, I think
of that being first.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.430
Usually, first is most important
unless you're David Letterman;

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.770
you're reading your
top-10 lists backwards.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.680
If you had a last-minute email
from the publisher, [GASP]

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.150
we just got some more money.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.140
We could add another
chapter to your textbook.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.860
But you've got to tell us by the
end of the business day today.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.190
Could you come up
with your number 11?

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.140
Right?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.200
Or, oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.870
Our budget has been slashed.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.410
We have to cut two chapters.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.240
Which two are the
least important.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.260
These are questions that
curriculum designers,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.900
curriculum developers
make all the time.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.370
Teachers, how much
time do we have

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.203
in the semester or the
school year to teach?

00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.190
Oh, we only got so far.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.640
We've got to hurry up and rush
because this is more important.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.515
And somebody else told
us this was important,

00:15:10.515 --> 00:15:11.924
so we've got to teach--

00:15:11.924 --> 00:15:13.090
well, I'm not teaching that.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.100
That seems less important.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.090
These are political decisions.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:23.680
But what is in is only there
because it wasn't left out.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.780
A critical pedagogy
or pedagogy that I

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.350
like to enact and encourage
my students to use

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.120
is one that asks these
kinds of questions.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.887
It's constantly in
this frame of asking.

00:15:32.887 --> 00:15:35.470
Even when we have our list, even
when we have our decision of,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.227
what seems to be important--

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:43.250
well, why is this on the list?

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.080
And where else does
this allow us to go?

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.280
If we take Toni Morrison,
what can we do with her work?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.860
Where does her work allow us
to go, following Jasper Johns?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.780
And then, where does
that allow us to go?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.370
Take Toni Morrison,
not an object--

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.630
but we can think
it in those ways--

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:05.740
take this entry, do something
to it, do something else to it.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.860
The word "most" doesn't appear
in any of those prompts.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.249
Did you pick up on that?

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.540
Why do you think I didn't
put the word "most" in there?

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.100
AUDIENCE: Too much pressure.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.210
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Too much pressure?

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.710
On me?

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.317
I could've easily written--

00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:20.650
I'm fine with four-letter words.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.210
I can just-- so, too
much pressure for whom?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.330
AUDIENCE: For us,
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:28.840
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Oh.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.030
AUDIENCE: Even though I think
we still tried to do that,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.490
it didn't feel--

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.420
it felt, like, OK, what
are 10 important events you

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.070
can come up with.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.820
AUDIENCE: And it's subjective.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.630
What's most important
to me is probably not

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.628
what's most important to you, or
her, or whoever's sitting here.

00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:49.002
STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK.

00:16:49.002 --> 00:16:51.520
AUDIENCE: "Most" might have
got in the way of the word

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.150
"important."

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.480
Because if you don't have
the "most" there, you think,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.285
what is important,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:57.285 --> 00:16:59.660
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So it's
kind of a pedagogical strategy

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.900
to take some stress
away, to allow entry,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.869
to remove some of the
complications embedded

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.339
in just working out the
different values ahead of time

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:08.839
anyway.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.730
I mean, certainly, those
are important conversations.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.355
Not the stress.

00:17:11.355 --> 00:17:13.430
I don't like to induce
stress in students.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.819
But to make an activity
or allow an activity

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.460
to have points of
entry for people

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.060
where they feel like they can
be part of that work is crucial.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.890
AUDIENCE: I also think that
now, that all the lists are

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.160
done, that because the
word "most" is not there,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.670
it's not a final list.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.010
So I can look at
somebody else's list

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.720
and say, OK, that is
also important, as

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.330
opposed to a final list
of the most important.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.621
So it allows for changing
after it's done up there.

00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:46.870
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Absolutely.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.130
So it's not fixed.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.570
Absolutely.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.840
But that notion of curriculum,
for a lot of people--

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.800
it's fixed.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.390
It's done.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.800
It's a noun.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.640
It's not a running.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.660
It's not a continuation.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.550
It's not a springboard
and a prompt.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.350
You're exactly right.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.012
It's a point of
continuous learning.

00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:03.720
Yeah, good stuff.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.590
All right, so let's
slide back up here.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.080
Wow, this is about 20 years ago.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.740
And I was working with
hypertext software, story space.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.940
So you kind of see that
map in the upper left.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.350
And my idea was, I go
to the barber shop,

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.960
and I get my haircut.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.880
But I learn a lot of
stuff in that barber shop.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.316
I think this barber shop
might be a curriculum.

00:18:31.316 --> 00:18:33.720
It might be an
educational space.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.700
No, it's a hypertext.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.610
There's a bunch of moving parts
and different relation-- maybe

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.945
it's all of those things.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:44.490
So I started to overlap those
different thoughts into a piece

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.290
called "Pat's Barbershop."

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.900
One day I asked the gathering
of barbers and clients,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.670
what can someone learn in here?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.890
Meaning, what can someone
learn in this barber shop?

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.410
And this barber shop is
in Norfolk, Virginia,

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.160
predominately African-American
segment of Norfolk.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.510
This was when I was on faculty
at Old Dominion University.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.417
So I asked Pat, the
owner and lead barber,

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:06.750
what can somebody learn in here?

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.166
And according to
Pat, people learn

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:10.020
a lot about life,
education, business,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.640
the street, the whole nine.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.560
Someone else noted with a smirk,
they learn what a gram is.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.700
He was talking about
illicit substances.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.460
How much you can get
for a stolen TV--

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.260
"and they can learn
that crack is good.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.330
We love crackheads."

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.862
What he meant was--

00:19:28.862 --> 00:19:30.820
the first part he was
actually being sarcastic.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.420
But the second part, he
was being more supportive.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.450
In a matter-of-fact
tone, one of the barbers

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.900
commented, If you could put
a camera in here for a week,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.790
you could make a movie.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.280
At one point, Pat himself
responded to my question

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.980
in a melodic chant, "OJ did it!

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.280
OJ did it!--" a reference to a
scene in the movie Barbershop

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.230
and the famous court trial.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.480
Later, in a more serious
tone, Pat proudly

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.200
stated, "Younger
teenagers, learn from me.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.540
Don't sell drugs, be successful,
keep a straight head."

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:12.140
Pat admitted that, in his place,
you learn about everyday life.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.987
And this project
went on for years.

00:20:17.987 --> 00:20:19.320
And they'd call me "Professor"--

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.534
"Hey, Professor, guess what?"

00:20:20.534 --> 00:20:22.950
And they would start to tell
me what they learned recently

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.100
until I'd get new lessons.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.350
And so this article is
filled with different ways

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.490
to think about that
barbershop as a hypertext.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.370
Looking at other
subsequent work, not only

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.190
am I artist in residence
here at MIT this year,

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.080
but I'm also an
artist in residence

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.820
at a local elementary
school back where I live.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.200
I've been working with first
graders and third graders.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.825
So you know what I
did a few weeks ago?

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:51.250
I talked to third graders
about epidemiology,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.092
which is what you do, right?

00:20:53.092 --> 00:20:55.274
I showed them this map.

00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:56.940
My intention wasn't
to talk specifically

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.830
about epidemiology.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.750
My intention was
to talk about how

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.800
the visual
representation of ideas

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.075
or how the visual
representation of data

00:21:06.075 --> 00:21:08.010
and the visual
representation of information

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.940
might allow us access to ways
of knowing and understanding

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.540
that we wouldn't have without
those visual representations.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.360
So here, we have a
segment of London.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.585
And you see a bunch
of dots there.

00:21:20.585 --> 00:21:23.220
And those dots,
essentially, are the places

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.440
where John Snow,
in the late 1800s,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.260
identified people who
had died from cholera.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.840
And his theory, which was
different than local theory

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.390
and the common theory
at that point--

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.140
his theory was, people were
getting cholera from water.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.280
Everybody else, said, no!

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.840
It's in the air.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.190
Or, it's divine intervention.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.481
Or, something else is going on.

00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:48.980
John, you don't know what
you're talking about.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.964
So I told the kids this.

00:21:51.964 --> 00:21:53.130
I didn't tell them this yet.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.790
I said, here's a map.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.550
What do you see?

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.590
Oh, it's a map.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.109
OK.

00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:57.150
And what else do you see?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.110
Well, I see a bunch of dots.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.160
What do you think
those dots are?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.035
Those are the people.

00:22:00.035 --> 00:22:01.111
That's where they live.

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.860
Or, maybe that's where
something happened.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.930
Why are there more dots
here and not over there?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.430
I don't know.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.120
And they said, oh,
wait, there's some X's.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.020
What do you think those X's are?

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.920
And they had all these ideas.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.730
Well, you don't see the X's?

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.630
Here are the X's.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.972
The X's are here.

00:22:10.972 --> 00:22:11.930
Oh, OK, that's helpful.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.330
Thanks.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.210
So what's going on?

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.710
Tell me about the relationship
between the X's and the dots.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.300
Oh, well, most of the dots are
in the middle, and most of them

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.860
are on that green
dot in the center.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.250
I said, oh, you know what?

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.040
That's what John
Snow thought, too.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.480
Guess what he figured out?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.940
That's where the people
were getting sick.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.940
That's where the people
were dying, because they

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.270
were drinking the water.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.530
And it was because he was able
to visually represent the data,

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.474
he could get to
this observation.

00:22:39.474 --> 00:22:40.890
They thought that
was pretty cool.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.740
Then, I told them,
so now, here's

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.952
a new word-- epidemiology.

00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:49.410
A bunch of eight
and nine-year-olds

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.370
saying, "epidemiology."

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.790
It was great.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.590
But they start to understand
how visual representation

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.650
of information allows access
to ideas in different ways.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.700
And I said, if you like this
map, what about this one?

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.115
Other people thought that
that map was interesting, too.

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:07.490
How many different
ways could you

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.090
represent data
visually using a map?

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.910
Other people thought John
Snow's idea was really cool.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.860
Oh, and then as soon
as I showed this, oh!

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.550
That's Google Maps!

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.250
Eight and nine-year-olds
know about Google Maps?

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.683
Yeah.

00:23:22.683 --> 00:23:23.650
Hmm.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.450
So now, how does
Google Maps play

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.140
into how we might teach
in elementary school

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.030
about space, about
visual representation?

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.160
Just taking an object,
and doing something to it,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.110
and doing something else to it?

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.000
I do something similar with
my preservice teachers.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.680
As they're preparing
to become teachers

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.254
and preparing to go out into
classrooms to do their student

00:23:46.254 --> 00:23:47.670
teaching, when
they're just trying

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.770
to figure out how
learning and teaching

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.300
happens in educational
spaces, one

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.260
of the tasks I give
them is, all right,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.870
go ahead and do your
next observation.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.703
What I want you to do
is, when you sit down,

00:23:56.703 --> 00:24:00.270
I want you to draw a map of the
classroom on a piece of paper

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.750
and take with you
a marker that you

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.902
know will bleed if you leave it
too long on the piece of paper.

00:24:06.902 --> 00:24:08.360
And what I want
you to do is I want

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.400
you to make a note of
where all of the furniture

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.540
is in the room--

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.650
entry points, exit points--

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.150
I want you to indicate where
the students are when you enter

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.830
the room and indicate
where the teacher is

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.850
by putting your marker down.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.530
And the entire time
that you're there,

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.810
you move your marker
wherever the teacher moves.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.020
And when the teacher stops,
you stop your marker.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.510
When the teacher starts
moving, you move the marker.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.831
So if the teacher
stops, the marker stops.

00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:32.830
If the marker stops, the
marker starts to bleed.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.020
It starts to, over time,
take up more and more space.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.790
And then, I collect these
maps, and we look at them.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.970
We start talking about the
relationship between where

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.404
the teacher is in
the room, where

00:24:44.404 --> 00:24:46.820
the learners are in the room,
how the content is conveyed.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.250
We talk about, what were
the kids doing over here?

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.580
If they're sitting over here,
what were the kids doing?

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.430
Because it looks
like the teacher

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.780
was over here most of the time.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.530
Were they talking?

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.730
Were they engaged?

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.581
Were they moving
around the room?

00:24:58.581 --> 00:24:59.830
I'll show you some other maps.

00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:05.450
This person didn't use a marker,
so they just kind of kept

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.990
scribbling and overlapping.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.500
This is curious, isn't it?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.260
This teacher is either
exhausted, or on Rollerblades,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.040
or something.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.960
The teacher's all over the
place, maybe not in a bad way.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.284
Certainly, not giving a lecture
like I'm doing right now.

00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:23.950
How do you know?

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.740
Well, look at the map!

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.990
Well, where was the teacher?

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.591
The teacher was,
essentially, everywhere,

00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:31.090
interacting with
different students,

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.520
moving to one station,
moving to another station.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.590
The teacher filled
that space physically.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.950
So in the conversations
that would

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.504
have to be generated
later would be,

00:25:41.504 --> 00:25:43.670
so then, what was happening
among the learners, too?

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.503
What relationship does
this teacher movement

00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:47.915
have to do with the ways in
which students are learning?

00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:49.040
Whoa, look at that teacher!

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.540
What might we learn about
the practice of teaching

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.805
and the practice of learning
by visualizing movement?

00:25:57.805 --> 00:25:59.680
You could try to do it
with all the students,

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.500
but I don't know if
you have enough fingers

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.770
to move all the
kids around, right?

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.990
Interpretation--
the construction

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:14.150
of meaning or the attending to
the construction of meanings

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.345
by talking about and making
sense of works of art.

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:18.720
Ooh, do you know about America
Rock and Schoolhouse Rock?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.590
When I was a kid, these shows
would come on Saturday morning

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.830
cartoons between the cartoon--

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.460
two or three-minute
videos, Schoolhouse Rock

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.510
and America Rock.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.380
America Rock was a
way for us to learn

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.720
about the history of
the United States--

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.850
or "a" history of
the United States.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.850

of the episodes--

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.680
"No More Kings," "The
Founding of America,"

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.720
"Fireworks," "The
Declaration of Independence,"

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.250
"The Preamble of
the Constitution."

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.990
I know the entire
preamble because I

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.090
watched Schoolhouse Rock--

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.630
"We, the people, in order to
form a more perfect union--"

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.130
The one at the top is
from "No More Kings."

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.252

in the middle.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:05.910
No?

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.610
The one on the bottom--

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.520

word "manifest destiny"--

00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:17.350
or the term "manifest destiny."

00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:38.002
The pilgrins sailed
the sea to find a place

00:27:38.002 --> 00:27:41.358
to call their own in
their ship Mayflower.

00:27:41.358 --> 00:27:43.838
They hoped to find
a better home.

00:27:43.838 --> 00:27:46.814
They finally knocked
on Plymouth Rock

00:27:46.814 --> 00:27:49.294
and someone said, "We're there."

00:27:49.294 --> 00:27:54.270
It may not look like home, but
at this point, I don't care.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.571
Oh, they were missing
Mother England.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.150
They swore their loyalty
until the very end.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.620
Anything you say, King.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.872
It's OK, King.

00:28:05.872 --> 00:28:08.706
You know, it's kind
of scary on your own.

Could you help us run

00:28:17.398 --> 00:28:19.858
They planted corn, you know.

00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:22.318
They built their
houses one by one.

00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:26.746
And bit by bit, they worked
until the colonies were done.

00:28:26.746 --> 00:28:31.994
They looked around, yeah, up and
down, and someone said, Hurray!

00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:36.206
If the king could only see us
now, he would be proud of us

00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:37.620
today!

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.480
They knew that now they'd
run their own land.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.630
But George III still vowed
he'd rule until the end.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.180
Anything I say,
do it my way now.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.870
Anything I say, do it my way.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.406
Don't you get to feeling
independent because I'm

00:28:54.406 --> 00:28:57.660
going to force you to obey!

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.060
He taxed their property.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.710
He didn't give them any choice.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:07.414
And back in England, he
didn't give them any voice.

00:29:07.414 --> 00:29:09.680
That's called taxation
without representation,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.350
and it's not fair.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.805
But when the colonies
complained, the king said,

00:29:15.805 --> 00:29:17.290
I don't care.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:25.323
He even has the nerve
to tax our cup of tea.

00:29:25.323 --> 00:29:30.040
To put it kindly, King,
we really don't agree.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.249
Going to show you how we feel.

00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:39.920

of tea in history!

They wanted no more
Mother England.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.805
They knew the time had come
for them to take command.

It's very clear
you're being unfair,

you say, we won't obey.

based from this

What else did you learn?

Pilgrims and the colonists
didn't pay any attention

STEPHEN CARPENTER: Oh, what
we didn't-- tell me something.

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:02.600
AUDIENCE: All the
things that we didn't

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:09.020
learn that this video wildly
misrepresented and erased

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:14.370
a crucial part of
history before and after.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.370
And even in the
implications of "freedom,"

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.070
it was freedom for white males.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.280
But it paints a very
nice, easy picture

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.960
of what history was
that is not true,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.195
and it has repercussions now
because of a false history.

00:31:31.195 --> 00:31:32.570
STEPHEN CARPENTER
: Well, I mean,

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.210
they only had three minutes.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.250
I mean, you only had 10 slots.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.564
If you had 11 slots, that--

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:40.730
they only had three minutes.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.230
How can they put
all that stuff in--

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.980
I'm being, you know.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.490
So if you're an art teacher,
let's say you're assigned to

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.970
or you're teaching
interdisciplinary unit,

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.590
working with the
history teacher,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.390
you could justify
showing this video--

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.220
I mean, illustration,
video production

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.230
can be taught through
the art classroom.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.020
The history teacher
can pull the--

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.760
there's history being taught.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.940
I could justify following a
prescribed curriculum that

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.770
says, history teacher
and art teacher

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.710
will work collaboratively
to teach together.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.596
Yeah, OK, we're watching
some Schoolhouse Rock,

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:26.490
and we're going to
interpret through--

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.130
remember those
pedagogical lenses that--

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.430
well, you were applying many
of them in your reading.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.990
And we were applying
many of them

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.160
in our reading of that list.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.040
So as an art teacher
or just a teacher who

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.370
likes to cause trouble, or
ask questions, or promote

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.930
critical thinking, we could
show these videos like this,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.990
or you could show any
visual culture example

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.454
in interpreting critique
through those different lenses.

00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:52.370
So I want to show you a
couple of assignments.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:57.160
This assignment is by another
colleague, Andres Hernandez,

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.980
who teaches at School of the
Art Institute in Chicago.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.090
And so this is a project
that he asked the students

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.470
to do where he uses this
quotation to talk about this

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.700
and to question this term,
"informal settlements."

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.950
Now, you think about refugees.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.830
You think about people
who have been displaced.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.550
And to think about
the housing that they

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.110
have constructed for themselves
is informal-- really?

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.630
It's as formal as
it's going to get

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.921
for those folks in that moment.

00:33:19.921 --> 00:33:23.050
I mean, the terminology
itself is problematic.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.442
And so he's thinking
about these--

00:33:25.442 --> 00:33:27.150
if you think about
these kinds of places,

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.580
it says, in fewer words, the
city produced by the people.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.270
So inspired by the notion of,
a city produced by people,

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.280
he tells the students who are
learning to be art teachers--

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.412
and we have these open spaces at
Vermont College of Fine Arts--

00:33:41.412 --> 00:33:42.870
you're going to
take on this space,

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.834
and you're going to build
a shelter out of cardboard,

00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:48.000
and it has to have-- and
there are certain criteria.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.780
You have to have a certain
number of people in it.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.154
And by doing that,
at the bottom,

00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:53.630
you see the purpose
of this assignment

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.010
is that it's this
intuitive building using

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.020
limited materials and
is focused on a 1 to 1

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.210
scale or the scale of real life.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.220
So right there, because
it's not a model,

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.750
because it's scaled
at real life,

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.280
there's a way that
our bodies enter

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.369
into the reality and maybe into
the reality of other people.

00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:12.210
It says, "Further purposes
of this design brief

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.580
is a basic introduction
of site specificity

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.860
as well as full-scale
prototyping and sketch

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.480
modeling."

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.190
And then, at the
end, these models

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.139
can be used to design
to talk about principles

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.780
of structure, enclosure,
construction techniques.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.533
So these are elements
I would assume

00:34:26.533 --> 00:34:28.199
that are part of many
other disciplines,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.380
architecture, urban
planning, and so forth.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.170
But the idea is
that he's drawing

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.100
from a quotation from
a theoretical argument

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.138
focusing on a term and saying,
this term is problematic.

00:34:42.138 --> 00:34:43.679
Let's see what we
might learn and how

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.440
we might trouble this term
through the act of making

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.454
works of art.

00:34:47.454 --> 00:34:48.870
And then, those
works of art allow

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.570
us to gain literally
entry points into them,

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.270
but also entry into the
complications of what

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.100
those terms mean.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.650
Here's another assignment
Andres provides the students.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.070
Find a building and
engage with the spaces.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.347
And then, document it
through photography.

00:35:05.347 --> 00:35:07.680
So what do you learn about
the physicality of a building

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.330
by becoming part
of that building,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.270
by becoming part of
the negative spaces?

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:13.590
You could write about it.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.410
You could measure it--

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.075
tape measures.

00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:17.700
Or, your body could
try to fit in there

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.210
and try to understand
what that space is about.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.742
I know from teaching drawing,
one technique we can do,

00:35:24.742 --> 00:35:26.450
if we put a chair, or
a series of chairs,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.290
or still life in the
middle of the room,

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.502
we all had our drawing paper.

00:35:30.502 --> 00:35:31.960
We could start
drawing what we see.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.860
And that would get us so far.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.180
But one strategy an art teacher
will always do or often do

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.400
is say, I want you to
draw what's not there.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.290
I want you to draw
the negative space.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.500
And when you draw the negative
spaces between the chair,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.200
the spaces between the bars, and
the spaces between the handles

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.190
and the rungs--

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.380
by drawing and rendering
those negative spaces

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:55.120
as accurately as possible, you
render the positive spaces.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.280
So what do we learn by
studying what is not

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.750
there or the neglected spaces?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:04.010
We learn more about the presence
of the dominant structure.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.110
So there are a number
of books about pedagogy

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.850
and about translating art
practice and pedagogical

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.400
engagements in
public spaces, right?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.310
So I'll just conclude
here for some questions.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.602
You know, you can engage
learners like this--

00:36:22.602 --> 00:36:23.810
or you could do boring stuff.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:25.890
It's up to you.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.120
All right, thanks.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.970
[APPLAUSE]
