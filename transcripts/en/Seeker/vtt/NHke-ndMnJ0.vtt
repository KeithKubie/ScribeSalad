00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.650
Female ejaculation!

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.330
One of the great mysteries of life is about
to get science’d!

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.990
Hi there, I’m Julia here for DNews.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.550
The very existence of female ejacultion was
up for debate for a really long time, even

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.380
though descriptions of it date back for thousands
of years.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
Ancient Taoist text from the 4th century,
describes the stages of arousal in a woman,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.540
the last saying that when a woman is satisfied
“the gentitals transmit fluid”.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.760
Aristotle even wrote about too, and a recent
study backed up these ancient texts.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.829
While it can be embarrassing for some women,
it’s perfectly natural.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.500
Most women who ejaculate do so through G spot
orgasm, some release a little bit of fluid

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.530
through the urethra that’s kind of milky
white in appearance.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.570
Others report expelling a lot of fluid, so
much so that it’s equivalent to the amount

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.890
released when urinating.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.670
The study from the Journal of Sexual Medicine
sheds some light on the phenomenon known as

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.750
“squirting” or in some cases “gushing”.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.329
While previous studies suggest that the fluid
released is similar to urine, they failed

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.930
to find where it comes from.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
In this recent study, each of the 7 participants
gave a urine sample and three separate

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.220
ultrasounds were performed.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.420
The first confirmed their bladders were empty.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.350
The second, performed when they were close
to climax after stimulating themselves through

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.979
masturbation or with a partner, showed significant
refilling of the bladder.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.080
After climax and ejaculation the ultrasound
showed the bladder was indeed empty, identifying

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.650
it as the source of the fluid.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.540
To figure what was in the fluid, chemical
analysis showed two things: Two women showed

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.420
no difference between their urine and their
“squirted” fluid, but the other five showed

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020
the presence of prostatic-specific antigen.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.380
PSA, as the name suggests is an enzyme secreted
by the prostate gland.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.009
The enzyme liquefies semen which allows sperm
to swim freely.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.070
As this and other studies show, women can
secrete it too, except from the skene gland

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.360
which is similar to the male prostate.This
gland varies in shape and size from woman

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.360
to woman.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.509
It’s actually so similar some researchers
are moving away from the term Skene gland

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.750
and calling it simply the female prostate.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.290
One researcher, Florian Wimpissinger says
that all women have the ability to ejaculate

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.740
and most actually do.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.819
It’s just that sometimes the PSA type fluid
flows back into the bladder after orgasm and

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.860
isn’t released through the urethra.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.140
The reason for the difference between women
ejaculating and not might be due to the natural

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.040
variation in the female prostate.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.870
However while it is in most cases, mostly
urine, it’s nothing to be grossed out by.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.450
It’s more dilute than usual urine, since
the bladder refills quickly during sex, there’s

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.900
less waste, so it reportedly doesn’t taste
or smell bad.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700
So ladies, don’t be embarrassed!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.730
It’s perfectly natural and more common than
you think.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.560
So does that explain away the mystery?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.040
Any other weird questions you have about the
human body?
