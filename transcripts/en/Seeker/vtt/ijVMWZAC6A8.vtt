00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.040
Think about the Fresh Prince theme song.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.280
That should fill you with glee or
likely you're dead inside.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.920
That feeling is nostalgia, and while it feels
good, it doesn’t always lead to making good decisions.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840
So, how does nostalgia permeate the brain?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.060
And what exactly does it do our decision-making? Hit me with that theme song man!

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.520
I knew you were going to say that so I got one. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.540
If you know me you know that I love the 90s, especially all the jams; 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.360
Michael Jackson’s Jam, Def Jam, NBA Jam, Jock Jams, Space Jam, wow we had a lot of jams back then. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.680
And me loving the 90s makes me see the world
differently than say, someone who loves the 1950s.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.680
Nostalgia makes you look at the world through
“rose-colored glasses” and we have an

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.710
emotional connection to memories like when
we hear No Scrubs in the club, or someone

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.980
else hears Bruce Springsteen on the AM radio.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.120
These emotions come from the brain, and you
know how this goes. I'm going to do some science, you'll ingest it, we'll have fun.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.280
One study out of Japan defined nostalgia as
“experiencing predominantly positive emotions

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700
when remembering autobiographical events.”

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Autobiographies are our stories about us;
our first date with Tevin Campbell, or when

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.670
I realized that having fun isn’t hard when
you have a library card.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.130
Nostalgia is our individual memories of what
happened within those autobiographies and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.939
are affected by the positive emotions we associate
with them, the rose tinted history goggles.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.259
Exposure to conditions inspiring nostalgic
feelings activate part of the brain associated

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.030
with three things; memory, emotion, and reward.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.740
The amygdala, known to modulate emotional
responses, works in tandem with the hippocampus,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.270
responsible for memory, to activate parts
of the brain linked to reward like the ventral

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.810
striatum and the substantia nigra, among other
regions.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.540
So amygdala and hippocampus, who’s the boss?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.140
It's Judith Light. Look it up, that's a reference.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.800
&nbsp;The amygdala and the hippocampus interact
with each other to encode our memories and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.009
research suggests that they may actually govern
two different memory encoding mechanisms,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.670
but they interact when emotion is involved.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.450
Think about a memory that brings you joy.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.770
You’re getting that warm, positive feeling
all over, right?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.439
That’s dopamine.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.969
Positive emotions have been linked to stronger
detail oriented memories but research also

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.670
suggests that memories deteriorate over time,
and both positive and negative emotions can

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.520
have an effect on how we remember incidents,
which is part of why eyewitness testimony

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.619
can be faulty in the courtroom.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.520
So hold on to those good times but they may
not be 100% reliable in a court of law.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.520
A 2015 study cited the positive effects of
nostalgia as a “stabilizing force” allowing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.920
us to push forward with a sense of personal
continuity; a wonderful way to track our own

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.940
growth over time through anecdotes and we
already know that nostalgia makes us feel a euphoric feeling.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.680
This all sounds good, but while we use information
from our past to dictate our futures, it’s

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.740
important not to let nostalgia cloud that
future.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.200
Research shows that people tend to favor positive
memories over negative ones; we want to remember

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.730
fun memories over wack ones.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.730
On the NPR podcast Hidden Brain, with my main
man Shankar Vedantam, he chatted with psychologist

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.880
Clay Routledge who discussed the danger of
allowing nostalgia to govern future decisions.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.599
As negative memories start to fade, positive
ones rise and bias us towards ignoring the

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.189
complexities of different situations and lean away from
putting ourselves in other people’s shoes

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.430
to look at an issue, event, and situation
and it might be because we’re lowkey drunk

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.299
on nostalgia.

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.659
Some people want to bring America back to
a “golden age” in their opinion, but it

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.860
wasn’t golden for everyone.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.820
For example, the ‘50s gave us American Bandstand,
diners, and Pez which, objectively, are cool things.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.560
But on the other hand, Black teens weren’t
initially allowed in the audience of American

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.980
Bandstand aka #White Soul Train, and Black
people couldn’t hit up diners because of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.360
Jim Crow and #Segregation, and, well, anyone
could have Pez but they taste like powdered doo-doo.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.900
#Powdered doo-doo.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.580
Here come the Pez heads in the comments. You don't like Pez you just hate me.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.540
Not everyone has the same “good old days.”

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.609
If the people in power run the country based
on their idea of the “good old days,”

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.790
it’s very possible that a) they’ll omit
other people’s narratives if it doesn’t

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.230
align with their agenda, b) they’re trying
to make the present like their past which

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.600
is the opposite of how time works, and c)
it’s nostalgia for them, not for the good

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.620
of the whole system.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.960
So, politically, historical nostalgia
isn’t a platform to rally behind.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.040
Listen, I’m trying to drink a Surge or a Crystal Pepsi
while watching Moesha on UPN as Summertime

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.880
by DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince is on
my Sony Walkman.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.740
Nostalgia can help bring about positive moods and
helps people cope with depression, but our

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.240
individual or collective nostalgia shouldn’t
govern everyone else’s futures; 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.660
the past is the past for a reason.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.910
When it comes to emotions, nostalgia is pretty
one-note, and in an ever-changing, multicultural,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.340
social landscape, maybe we shouldn’t let
past Passions define the next Days of Our Lives.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.040
References.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.960
Nostalgia plays such a huge role in how we
think about things in the present, but what

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.160
if the future could influence the past?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.970
Yeah, sit down that’s a hard one.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.120
I’m not about to go all John Conner on you,
it’s called quantum retrocausality and you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.199
can find out about it here.
