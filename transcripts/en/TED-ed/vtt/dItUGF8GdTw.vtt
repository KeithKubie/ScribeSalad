00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.224
Every day, a sea of decisions 
stretches before us.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:17.059
Some are small and unimportant,

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.599
but others have a larger impact 
on our lives.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.304
For example, which politician
should I vote for?

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.493
Should I try the latest diet craze?

00:00:24.493 --> 00:00:27.416
Or will email make me a millionaire?

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.127
We're bombarded with so many decisions

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:33.705
that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.757
But there are many ways 
to improve our chances,

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:40.581
and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.511
This is a way of approaching a question

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.512
that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.916
reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.374
and make the best decision.

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.192
If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is.

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:58.812
Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right,

00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:00.961
a person who uses critical thinking

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.278
subjects all available options to scrutiny
and skepticism.

00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:06.911
Using the tools at their disposal,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.903
they'll eliminate everything but the most
useful and reliable information.

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:15.253
There are many different ways
of approaching critical thinking,

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.346
but here's one five-step process

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:21.120
that may help you solve 
any number of problems.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.906
One: formulate your question.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:26.456
In other words, 
know what you're looking for.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:29.377
This isn't always as straightforward 
as it sounds.

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:33.055
For example, if you're deciding
whether to try out the newest diet craze,

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:37.008
your reasons for doing so may be obscured
by other factors,

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.802
like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks.

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:42.575
But if you approach the situation

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:46.869
with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting,

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.213
whether that's weight loss,

00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:49.466
better nutrition,

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.975
or having more energy,

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:54.584
that'll equip you to sift through 
this information critically,

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:55.999
find what you're looking for,

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.577
and decide whether the new fad
really suits your needs.

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:03.943
Two: gather your information.

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:05.344
There's lots of it out there,

00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:09.099
so having a clear idea of your question
will help you determine what's relevant.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.288
If you're trying to decide on a diet
to improve your nutrition,

00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:14.637
you may ask an expert for their advice,

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:16.761
or seek other people's testimonies.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.695
Information gathering helps you
weigh different options,

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:23.325
moving you closer to a decision
that meets your goal.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:25.974
Three: apply the information,

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:29.066
something you do 
by asking critical questions.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.849
Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?"

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.461
"What assumptions exist?"

00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.581
"Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?"

00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:41.680
For example, in an email that promises
you millions,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.918
you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?"

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.211
"Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?"

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:54.193
"Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?"

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:56.711
Four: consider the implications.

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.609
Imagine it's election time,

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.826
and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.911
to make it cheaper for drivers
to fill up on gas.

00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:06.875
At first glance, that seems great.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.775
But what about the long-term 
environmental effects?

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.581
If gasoline use is less 
restricted by cost,

00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.286
this could also cause a huge
surge in air pollution,

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:20.600
an unintended consequence 
that's important to think about.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.750
Five: explore other points of view.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.610
Ask yourself why so many people are drawn

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.503
to the policies of 
the opposing political candidate.

00:03:29.503 --> 00:03:32.465
Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says,

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.909
exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.118
might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others.

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.866
This will allow you 
to explore alternatives,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.373
evaluate your own choices,

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:48.997
and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions.

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.716
This five-step process is just one tool,

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.421
and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives.

00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:00.180
But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.499
Critical thinking can give us the tools
to sift through a sea of information

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.360
and find what we're looking for.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.838
And if enough of us use it,

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:11.242
it has the power to make the world
a more reasonable place.
