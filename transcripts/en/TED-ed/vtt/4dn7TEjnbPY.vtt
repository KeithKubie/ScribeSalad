00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:09.393
"War and Peace,"

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:10.393
a tome,

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:11.593
a slog,

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:14.923
the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed
because if you fall asleep,

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:17.953
it could give you a concussion, right?

00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:19.492
Only partly.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:21.703
"War and Peace" is a long book, sure,

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:24.734
but it's also a thrilling examination
of history,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:30.082
populated with some of the deepest, most
realistic characters you'll find anywhere.

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:35.023
And if its length intimidates you,
just image how poor Tolstoy felt.

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:39.412
In 1863, he set out to write a short novel
about a political dissident

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:42.213
returning from exile in Siberia.

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:45.807
Five years later, he had produced
a 1,200 page epic

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:47.064
featuring love stories,

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:47.995
battlefields,

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:48.944
bankruptcies,

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:49.933
firing squads,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.006
religious visions,

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:52.332
the burning of Moscow,

00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:54.895
and a semi-domesticated bear,

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.425
but no exile and no political dissidents.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:58.995
Here's how it happened.

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:00.806
Tolstoy, a volcanic soul,

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:05.624
was born to a famously eccentric 
aristocratic family in 1828.

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.203
By the time he was 30, he had already
dropped out of Kazan University,

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.184
gambled away the family fortune,

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:12.254
joined the army,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:13.195
written memoirs,

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:17.144
and rejected the literary establishment
to travel Europe.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:20.825
He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,
his ancestral mansion,

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.734
to write about the return 
of the Decembrists,

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:30.554
a band of well-born revolutionaries
pardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile.

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:31.715
But, Tolstoy thought,

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.896
how could he tell the story 
of the Decembrists return from exile

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:37.485
without telling the story of 1825,

00:01:37.485 --> 00:01:41.966
when they revolted against 
the conservative Tsar Nicholas I?

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.876
And how could he do that without telling
the story of 1812,

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.367
when Napoleon's disastrous 
invasion of Russia

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:52.245
helped trigger the authoritarianism
the Decembrists were rebelling against?

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:56.239
And how could he tell the story of 1812
without talking about 1805,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.086
when the Russians first learned of
the threat Napoleon posed

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:03.006
after their defeat at 
the Battle of Austerlitz?

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.647
So Tolstoy began writing,

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.416
both about the big events of history

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:08.917
and the small lives 
that inhabit those events.

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:11.867
He focused on aristocrats,
the class he knew best.

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:13.506
The book only occasionally touches

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:17.167
on the lives of the vast majority 
of the Russian population,

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:18.797
who were peasants,
or even serfs,

00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:23.287
farmers bound to serve the owners
of the land on which they lived.

00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:27.057
"War and Peace" opens on the eve
of war between France and Russia.

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:31.001
Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret
about the looming violence,

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.980
but then change the topic to those things
aristocrats always seem to care about:

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.761
money,

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:36.512
sex,

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:37.752
and death.

00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:39.242
This first scene is indicative

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.567
of the way the book bounces 
between the political and personal

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:44.809
over an ever-widening canvas.

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.360
There are no main characters
in "War and Peace."

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.438
Instead, readers enter
a vast interlocking web

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:52.908
of relationships and questions.

00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:55.199
Will the hapless 
and illegitimate son of a count

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.268
marry a beautiful but conniving princess?

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:01.409
Will his only friend survive
the battlefields of Austria?

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.618
And what about that nice young girl
falling in love with both men at once?

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:10.519
Real historical figures mix and mingle
with all these fictional folk,

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.616
Napoleon appears several times,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:17.449
and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors
plays a background part.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.498
But while the characters 
and their psychologies are gripping,

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:22.990
Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt 
the narrative

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.990
to pose insightful 
questions about history.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.438
Why do wars start?

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.520
What are good battlefield tactics?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.189
Do nations rise and fall on the actions
of so-called great men like Napoleon,

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.829
or are there larger cultural and economic
forces at play?

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.940
These extended digressions are part 
of what make "War and Peace"

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.999
so panoramic in scope.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.861
But for some 19th century critics,

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:50.071
this meant "War and Peace" barely felt
like a novel at all.

00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:54.799
It was a "large, loose, baggy monster,"
in the words of Henry James.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.891
Tolstoy, in fact, agreed.

00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.862
To him, novels were 
a western European form.

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:05.030
Russian writers had to write differently
because Russian people lived differently.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.101
"What is 'War and Peace'?" he asked.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.281
"It is not a novel.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.152
Still less an epic poem.

00:04:10.152 --> 00:04:12.492
Still less a historical chronicle.

00:04:12.492 --> 00:04:16.651
'War and Peace' is what the author wanted
and was able to express

00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:19.700
in the form in which it was expressed."

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.121
It is, in other words, the sum total
of Tolstoy's imaginative powers,

00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:26.231
and nothing less.

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.257
By the time "War and Peace" ends,

00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:32.080
Tolstoy has brought his characters
to the year 1820,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.362
36 years before the events he originally
hoped to write about.

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.532
In trying to understand his own times,

00:04:39.532 --> 00:04:43.982
he had become immersed in the years
piled up behind him.

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:47.742
The result is a grand interrogation
into history,

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:48.571
culture,

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:49.671
philosophy,

00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:50.862
psychology,

00:04:50.862 --> 00:04:53.212
and the human response to war.
