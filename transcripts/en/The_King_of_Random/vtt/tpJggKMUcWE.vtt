00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop not too long ago

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.940
We showed you an easy way to make fire snakes

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.899
Using some sugar, some baking soda, and just a little bit of alcohol as a fuel. well in that video a ton of people

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.690
Commented saying that they wanted to see what happened if we took the burned black fire snake and put in liquid nitrogen

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.060
Or in a vacuum chamber so today, We're gonna try both, for the first step of course.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.160
We need to make our fire snakes, so I've got some of our powdered sugar and baking soda mixed up here

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.740
Let's add a little bit of alcohol on top of our sand pour on some piles and light them off

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.810
There we have it some fire snakes

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.030
And now let's test out see what happens if we put one of these in a vacuum chamber and what happens if we put one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.080
In some liquid nitrogen, let's do the vacuum chamber first

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280
These are so lightweight.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.320
They are mostly air and that's the kind of thing that usually reacts on a vacuum chamber

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.540
But I don't know if we have any closed cells all the air might just escape right out of it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.800
Let's find out all right here. We go fire snakes in a vacuum chamber three, two, one

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900
Some vapor coming off of it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.399
Hmm other than that little bit of vapor

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.300
I'm not seeing any change or even movement

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.359
We have a pretty complete vacuum already

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.479
But

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.178
Not a lot has happened well. Let's let some pressure back in

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.578
Feels exactly the same still lightweight very crumbly

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.950
Basically turns to dust immediately

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.619
Really, not a lot of change, so I guess it's a very open celled structure so all of the air

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.200
That's inside is able to just get sucked out, and then you just have a sort of structure full of vacuum

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.789
But not air. Oh, well all right. We've tried our fire snake in the vacuum chamber

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.400
Let's see what happens if we dip our fire snake into some liquid, nitrogen

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.800
To try it's so lightweight

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.780
Just kind of float on top of maybe not looks like it's kind of absorbing it and sinking in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990
Like halfway sunk in that's something

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.249
But do you think it's sort of soaking in some of the liquid nitrogen so as a test

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.780
I'm gonna try taking it, out putting on the table, and then just smashing it right away

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.079
It might just kind of spray out some liquid nitrogen. Let's try it

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.590
Heh!

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.840
Well it did kind of spray everywhere the the fire stink itself has so little cohesion

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.639
It just kind of turns to dust when you smoosh it

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:56.299
I think the liquid nitrogen in there gave it a little added mass and it just popped everywhere. It's just gone immediately

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.659
I'm going to try that again. This is definitely heavier. It has the weight of liquid nitrogen and it starts freezing my glove

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.659
Squish!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.279
Hey, you actually squeeze liquid nitrogen out of it like a sponge

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.989
So yeah it goes fast. It just explodes everywhere you go a little slower, and it squeezes it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.650
It's like a sponge

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.570
Splat. Splat, splat, splat.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.538
Still got all of that nitrogen inside it

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.758
See what happens if I pour a little bit of the liquid nitrogen

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:50.429
Right on to it

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.039
It just soaks it up

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.148
Which is interesting most stuff that we pour liquid nitrogen on to it?

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:02.669
Just has the Leidenfrost effect and it skitters across it and doesn't really get absorbed but this stuff

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.669
It really just absorbs it like a sponge

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:12.629
Make sure it's getting soaked and then I'm just gonna smash it. 3 2 1

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.600
And it just turns to dust, it's gone

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.899
Well there you have it some fire snakes in a vacuum chamber

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.679
Which really didn't do too much and in some liquid nitrogen, which didn't make them any more fragile, but they did absorb the liquid

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.130
Nitrogen, which is something we haven't seen very much most materials

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.439
Don't absorb the liquid nitrogen they just sort of either float on top of it or the leident frost effect makes it so the liquid

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.850
Nitrogen doesn't soak into them

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.109
But this stuff really soaked it in and we got some cool effects and smashed it in slow motion

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.150
So it's pretty fun if you have any cool ideas of things you want to see us try let us know down in the comments

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.810
Especially if it involves combining other projects. We've already done

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.089
Thanks for joining us for this video today and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.300
See you there

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.239
Not a lot has happened except for the fact that it now has no air resistance as it tumbles around inside so it moves faster
