00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, we timed a camel and got the distance d.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Maybe not the most accurate of the odometers, but, hey.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We'll talk about error later, and we'll go with this for now.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The distance he measured was 5,000 stadia--we see that strange unit popping up again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now we just have to get Î±, which will require trigonometry--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the study of triangles, specifically right triangles.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, before we get jumping into the study of right triangles,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
let's just quickly show where they're going to show up in this problem.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I mentioned before that if someone were standing here--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm going to represent someone standing by vertical black line--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
he would cast a shadow like this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You see--straight line, right angle--90-degree angle--straight line,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we can imagine the sun's ray

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
completing the triangle.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, hidden in this right triangle are the mysteries of the circumference of the earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's figure out what's going on inside a right triangle.
