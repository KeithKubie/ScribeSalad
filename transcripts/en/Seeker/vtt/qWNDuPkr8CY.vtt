00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.100
In the midst of the debate on gun violence,
gun rights and gun control; the largest group

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:13.710
of victims is being overlooked.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.499
Sixty-four percent of gun victims aren't at
schools, or on rampages.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.409
Instead, a study in 2012 found most gun violence
victims, are the same one who pulls the trigger.

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:28.089
Almost two-thirds of all gun deaths in the
U.S. are from suicides; according to this

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.520
study in the Annual Review of Public Health,
and of those, most are white males.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.220
Homicide rates get a lot of media coverage,
but due to the stigma around it suicide does

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.220
not.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.600
According to the CDC, in 1997, suicide was
the eighth leading cause of the death in the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.150
United States overall.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.460
And now, according to this new study, white
males are eight times more likely to kill

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.930
themselves with a gun than be killed by someone
using a gun.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.980
Surprisingly, the data shows white people
commit 70 percent of ALL suicides; far more

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.800
than Hispanics or African-Americans.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.460
Suicide is among the top ten causes of death
for Latino males, but isn't in the top ten

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.009
for black men or for women of any race; and
most of the time, those suicides are with

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.069
a firearm.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.649
Why someone would choose suicide is usually
heavily connected with their overall mental

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:17.649
health.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.359
95 percent of all those who take their own
lives have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder,

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.170
according to Columbia University Doctor Victoria
Arango, and, she says, more than half of suicide

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.329
victims are clinically depressed.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.810
Which means, most of these white men fall
into this category.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.259
You might think "they're chock full of white
male privilege! what do they have to be depressed

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.259
about?!"

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
A study in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic
Health Disparities, found white men do have

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.289
fewer life stressors; they lack the social
support structure to properly deal with the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.600
stress they do have.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.060
And the long-term mishandling of stress can
lead to depression.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.700
If it does, men are less likely to pursue
therapy, and will often live with depression

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.499
having never been diagnosed.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.590
This research shows white men are more prone
to depression stemming from stressful life

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.229
events than black men or all women.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.550
Although more research is needed on why that
is.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.330
In a 1995 study in Progress in Brain Research,
looked at the brains of those who committed

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.610
suicide and compared them to brains of depressed
people who hadn't.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.570
Even though both brains had lower levels of
serotonin activity, those depressed people

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.290
who'd contemplated suicide had different orbital
cortices than depressed people who hadn't.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.990
Markedly in areas connected to executive function,
decision-making and behavioral inhibitions.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.391
The researchers said most don't think of suicide
at all, while others think of it first, because

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.890
suicide victims often have trouble controlling
impulses.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.050
Which brings us back to firearms.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.590
Firearms facilitate impulsive actions.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
Papers in the journals Crisis and Suicide
and Life-Threatening Behavior found suicides

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.210
are commonly impulse driven -- not elaborately
planned like in some television or film.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.310
In fact according to their findings, 25 percent
of suicide attempters said they deliberated

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.790
for less than five minutes; in fact most (75
percent) debated less than an hour -- and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.840
only 13 percent thought about it for more
than a day.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.550
Because guns are point and click, it stands
to reason when depressed men, making an impulsive

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.780
action like suicide, they will reach for the
easiest method to carry it out.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.970
The Harvard Health Policy Review reviewed
academic literature connecting suicide and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.441
access to firearms; and found having a gun
slightly increases suicide risks and the journal

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:37.070
Trauma found rates of suicide in states with
the most gun ownership had twice the rate

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.360
of gun-involved suicide as the states with
the least gun ownership.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.010
More guns means more gun-involved suicide,
by a lot.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.320
On top of that, according to a Pew Research
Center study, men own three times the number

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.100
of guns, and white men own more than double
the number of blacks and three times more

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.120
than hispanics.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.560
It would seem, the reason white men are eight
times more likely to commit suicide with a

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.700
gun is because they're depressed, have no
way to deal with it, have a gun in their home

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.780
and decided to do it in only a few minutes.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.690
Study after study shows reducing access to
guns saves lives and reduces suicide rates,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.440
and this is why.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.820
If you need help call the National Suicide
Prevention Lifeline at 1 (800) 273-8255; and

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.060
reach out to friends, family.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.220
