00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, to see how this plays out,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
first I'm going to show you what the JavaScript actually does.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here I've typed it out.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here's our webpage with embedded JavaScript in it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We declare the function mymin of a and b.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If a is less than b, return a. Otherwise return b.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We declare the function square to take x and return x squared.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then we called document.write of mymin of the square of -2 and the square of 3.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, -2 times -2 is 4.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
4 is smaller than 9, so we expect 4 to be returned,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and 4 is returned.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How happy are we? So happy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All right, now we're going to get this same thing, a 4, in Python.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
All right, and now we're back at our Python interpreter,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and I'm going to type out the same code starting here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Note again that in Python, instead of the opening and closing curly braces,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we have tabbing and colons.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We also don't necessarily need to terminate our statements with semicolons.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The Python equivalent of document.write is print, and we print out the 4.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Exactly what we wanted to see.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's actually go try something out.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's go put in a bunch of extra gratuitous semicolons in Python

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to make it look a little bit more like JavaScript.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What do we think will happen?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In fact, nothing special happens.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Python is totally fine with you terminating statements with semicolons if you would like.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You just don't have to.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If you want to get in the habit of it in order to make it easier to transition

00:01:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
between Python and JavaScript, no problem.
