boot camp but it was enough for what we

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:16.470
boot camp but it was enough for what we
 

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.440
boot camp but it was enough for what we
had to do and i think the really

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.450
had to do and i think the really
 

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.970

sort of suspense thriller but it makes
sense chronologically and you don't

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760
sense chronologically and you don't
 

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.220
sense chronologically and you don't
really know who lives and who dies until

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.230
