00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm sitting here with Jacques, one of our lead front end engineers.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.080
Do you like tofu?

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; I do, well, well prepared tofu.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.220
&gt;&gt; Well prepared?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.960
What does that mean to you?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.160
&gt;&gt; There's a whole spectrum of, of, sort of, the preparations of to, of tofu.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.400
And, I-

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.750
&gt;&gt; What about like, a hunk of tofu from Costco or something?

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.240
&gt;&gt; Just a raw hunk of, of tofu.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Probably not the most delicious.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.380
Why?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.520
&gt;&gt; It ha, it, there are so many things you could do with it that would

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.680
add additional flavors to your, to your tofu.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's a saying that I heard, well actually that I made it up.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.700
It's called be tofu.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.740
And to me it applies as well to code.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.560
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.352
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:50.650
&gt;&gt; All right, so here is what I mean by that, tofu to me is pretty bland,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.000
it's fairly uninteresting, it doesn't really have a flavor of it's own.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
It does, but not really, so if I get dropped into a code base.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.140
What I want to do as a programmer is I want to be tofu.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.510
I want to look around me and just absorb and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.330
seep in the flavors around me, or the culture.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.960
Right?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.850
The way that the people wrote the code?

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.000
I want to write mine just like that for consistency.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.320
If they use jQuery, I'm going to use jQuery.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920
If they're not using jQuery, I'm not going to use jQuery.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.410
If they don't put semicolons, well,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.305
I'll be really unhappy about it, but I won't do that too.

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:28.580
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; note, always use semicolons.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.540
&gt;&gt; Always &gt;&gt; Can you tell me an example of maybe of when that

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.270
may have happened to you?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; When you dropped into a codebase and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.090
it wasn't exactly the way you would have written it?

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.700
But-

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.250
When I first joined Udacity, it was on launch weekend.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.200
And there was already some code going, and once the code is rolling,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.460
especially when you're trying to get stuff done on a deadline and there's not

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.170
really a, a good place to say hey, we might be able to do this better.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.505
Sticking with that culture means that at least your code is consistent.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:02.740
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.190
&gt;&gt; And what that means is that once you get the accent of the code down.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.300
And you will from working in it.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.850
You know, from, from experiencing it and, and coding around in it.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.580
It's much easier to understand the code base as a whole.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460
That consistency is very important.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.430
&gt;&gt; So, it's basically really important to have your one code base have

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.210
one single accent for consistency.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.020
Because when you start working with the code.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.570
If you have to shift your mental model about how this is written,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.970
every time you open up a file, or within a file, say.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.380
&gt;&gt; Mm, from line to line?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.760
&gt;&gt; It's really hard.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.890
And so that's why having that, that consistency will at least let you,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
once you know what the, sort of the local dialect is.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.930
You, you can speak in that, you can write in that,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.650
you can read in that consistently.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.570
And you don't have to spend all of the overhead shifting your mental

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.610
model around about how this code is written, you know what this means.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.870
&gt;&gt; So it seems like this is being polite to other coders that come along.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely and to yourself.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.770
&gt;&gt; To yourself?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.180
&gt;&gt; It's going, future you is going to come back to this code and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.660
go, why are there, why do half of these lines have semicolons?

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.890
&gt;&gt; So you want future you to not hate past you.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is currently present you.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.345
&gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. &gt;&gt; And

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.638
that's like, a huge part of being a good engineer.

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:28.800
&gt;&gt; Mm. &gt;&gt; Is not getting future you angry at present you.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.870
It's really hard, you don't always do it, but that's absolutely the goal.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.760
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.480
So consistency within a code base even if it's not

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.840
necessarily your specific style, it's really important.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.410
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.640
Thanks, Josh, for sitting down with me.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.980
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.900
Remember kids, always use tabs.
