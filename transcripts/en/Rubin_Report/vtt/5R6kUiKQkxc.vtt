[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.330
<v 1>joining me today as a writer and columnist at quill that magazine as well as a</v>

3
00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:12.980
philosophy major at Columbia University common use.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.480
Thanks for having me on dude.

5
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:19.460
I had to change my shirt because your shirt looked so pressed and starched and

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.383
professional.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.230
<v 2>It's ironic because I normally dress like a complete slob.</v>

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.040
I wear the same black hoodie every single day.
Yeah.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.230
But I thought Ruben report you have to bring a game.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
<v 1>Let's do it.
I should've worn a tie,
but here we are.
Alright.</v>

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.240
There's a lot of reasons that I want to talk to you.
Uh,
you were Sorta,

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.711
I think put on,

13
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:42.711
put on my map and put on sort of the IDW map and the map of all of the people

14
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:47.430
that care about the issues that we talk about here,
uh,
about,

15
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:50.460
what was it about five or six months ago,
something like that.

16
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.130
Something like that.
Your piece,
I want to get the exact title right,

17
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.410
was the high price of stale grievances.
And that was in [inaudible].
And you know,

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.220
I just had Claire on the show last week.

19
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.830
So we're going to talk about a lot of things you've been writing about.

20
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.880
I want to talk a little bit about what it's like to be a student at,
uh,

21
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.910
at a university these days,
especially on the,

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.630
that leans pretty far left and all sorts of stuff.
First,
just uh,

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.010
tell me a little bit about yourself,
where you're from,
how you grew up.
Well,

24
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.853
that kind of stuff

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.510
<v 2>from Montclair,
New Jersey,
uh,
which is just 30 minutes outside New York City.</v>

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.030
Nice suburb.
Um,
uh,
you know,

27
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:28.031
I had a pretty typical middle upper middle class upbringing and a great parents.

28
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.810
Um,
and uh,
out of,

29
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.520
out of high school I was going to music school actually I was dead set on being

30
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.090
a jazz musician and I still play drums,
Josh trombone.
Nice.

31
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.990
But along the line I ended up shifting paths and uh,

32
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.070
going into philosophy and enrolling at Columbia where I have two more years.

33
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.770
How do you go from jazz to philosophy?
There's probably some through line there,

34
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:55.790
right?
I don't know that there is honestly.
I think,

35
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.820
I think I just loved both of them and realized at a certain point that just

36
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:06.590
going to school for music was limiting.
Um,
so yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.000
<v 1>So you said a middle class or upper middle class.
Did you have,</v>

38
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.450
did your family have any particular political beliefs where you guys,
politico,

39
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.520
<v 2>how many of that?
My,
my mother was nearly a Marxist.
She,
um,</v>

40
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.691
she,

41
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:23.620
I remember her talking to me about Marx and Durkheim when I was three and four

42
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:27.790
years old.
She,
she came from the South Bronx,
immigrant,

43
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:29.080
Puerto Rican family,
very,

44
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:34.081
very poor in the 70s when the South Bronx was the picture of crime and uh,

45
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.940
just decay.
And she,
she was very smart woman,

46
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:43.330
ended up getting a,
trying to get an anthropology degree,

47
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:48.240
but she passed away of cancer while,
while she was getting it.
But no,
she,

48
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.074
she,
I was,

49
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.120
I was exposed to two Marx and Durkheim and uh,

50
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.870
some other,
other Marxists thinkers when I was,
I could've told you their names.

51
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:02.200
When was five years old.
Wow.
My Dad is a bit of a libertarian,

52
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.740
but I got less of his,
his,
he was working much at the time.
So yeah.
So that,

53
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:10.870
that's a real mixed,
yeah.
Household of the politics though,

54
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.530
did you sort of lean one way or the other?
Yeah,

55
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.730
I always leaned heavily left if I,
if I leaned anywhere at all.

56
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.510
Yeah.
I mean as early,
Eh,
my,

57
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
the beginning of my political identity was definitely anchored around identity

58
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.630
politics and especially black identity politics.
Uh,
you know,

59
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.270
I was 24,
it was at 2013,

60
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.300
2014 when black lives matter started cropping up.

61
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.830
I was at that point very much enthusiastic about that movement.

62
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:46.090
I was posting on Facebook,
having seen a police shooting,

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.320
uh,
to the effect that this is,

64
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:52.150
this is proof that the system is rigged against black people so that,

65
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
that's more or less what I was politically as of maybe five years ago.

66
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.470
So yeah,
that was very much in my upbringing.
It was in the water,

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.300
uh,
in my,
in my social environment and intellectual environment growing up.

68
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.340
How much of that is part of the whole thing of just being around a certain set

69
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.900
of young people that believe a certain thing so that you all sorta believe it

70
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:20.770
together,
whether it's ultimately true or not.
Yeah,
I think,

71
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.680
I think we're social animals and,

72
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:27.681
and we're heavily incentivized psychologically to not break ranks with the norms

73
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.490
of our social group.
So if,
if,

74
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520
if those norms are that you have to believe in the god Vishnu Shiva,

75
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.910
than most people are going to,
uh,
grow up believing those things.

76
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.130
And it takes a kind of a rare personality to,
to be a contrarian in that context.

77
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.630
And if the norms are you have to believe in,
in,
in systemic racism,

78
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.710
you have to believe that America is a unique evil,

79
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.170
then people will grow up believing those things.
And likewise,
if the norm is,

80
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.090
uh,
you know,
uh,
um,

81
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.510
abortion is murder and there is only one God and it's the Christian God and

82
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.140
homosexuality is a sin than most people in that context,
we'll,

83
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:14.350
we'll end up believing those things.
So,
yeah,
I mean my,

84
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.460
as far as my upbringing,

85
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:20.461
I think I can remember meeting precisely one Republican and he was my fifth

86
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:26.551
grade history teacher and he was such a good history teacher that,

87
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.170
you know,

88
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.180
in this public school that it kind of made up for the fact that he was a

89
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:34.810
republican because all the parents who want their kids to get ahead wanted them

90
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:39.370
in his class right now.
So you know,
there's something there there.
Yeah.
Yes,
yes.

91
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.850
But I guess,
yeah,
long story short,
it was very much of an echo,

92
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.900
very much an echo chamber.
Very ideologically siloed.
Yeah.
Okay.

93
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:50.800
So so far your story I think sounds pretty consistent with a lot of what's going

94
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.130
on with,
with young people.
How old are you now?
2122 okay.

95
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.190
So you said in 2013 so only about five years ago.
He's like,
you're 17

96
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 1>you're sort of in this thing,
this is the beginning of black lives matter.</v>

97
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.690
When did you start realizing that perhaps it wasn't as much of a positive as it

98
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.740
had sort of been laid out to be?

99
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.710
<v 2>Well,
I think it's,</v>

100
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.880
it's hard to reconstruct one's own narrative after the fact,

101
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:20.470
but I remember one thing being significant,
which was when,

102
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.200
uh,
Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson.

103
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.590
I remember being in my first year of college taking,

104
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:31.591
taking a class at Julliard and we were talking about this killing and it was

105
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:35.500
just obvious from the point of view of most in the class,

106
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:36.610
including the professor,

107
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that this was just another in a long line of examples of black men being

108
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:48.440
brutalized in a country that fundamentally does not want them to succeed,

109
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.870
to succeed.
And I don't know what like what it was.

110
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.730
It may have been because I had a roommate who was from,

111
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.940
from Arizona,

112
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:02.941
from a very different kind of political climate who was skeptical of this and I

113
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:07.240
didn't even know how one could be skeptical of this.

114
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:09.280
It was so jarring to meet a person.

115
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:14.281
I liked that or many people I liked that were skeptical of the things I took for

116
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:14.960
granted.

117
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Were you guys able to get into it?</v>

118
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.430
Because that's always one of the big problems here is that people can't do this

119
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:20.540
stuff with their friends anymore.

120
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.750
<v 2>The thing is,</v>

121
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.380
I think we were such good friends at that point for a political reasons that,

122
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.520
you know,
no amount of politics was gonna was gonna destroy that.

123
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.550
But I think I just spent one night reading the complete testimony from,

124
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.390
from uh,
from Michael Brown's friend and from the police officer.

125
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.010
And I came away thinking,
well,
if the police officer's telling the truth,

126
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:46.920
then that was a justified shooting.
If his friend is telling the truth,

127
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.650
then it was unjustified.
But the,

128
00:07:49.651 --> 00:07:53.370
I don't know who's telling the truth and no one in my class knew either.

129
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.400
But everyone had the same opinion.
So that,

130
00:07:56.401 --> 00:07:58.290
I mean I remember that being significant.

131
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.330
<v 1>I remember,
remember speaking up about that,</v>

132
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.150
like when was the moment that you were kind of going all right,

133
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.270
I got to say something about this?
I'm not sure.

134
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.730
<v 2>I'm not sure that I spoke up about it.</v>

135
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:10.640
I'm not sure I would've had the confidence to speak up about it.

136
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.460
<v 1>Yeah.
Were there a couple of other things after that?
Cause I,</v>

137
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:19.461
I find it to be one of these things that once you see this thing for what it is

138
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.210
that then it sort of happens very quickly.

139
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.270
I think a lot of people that watch this show,

140
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.580
I've acknowledged that because I think it's a lot of former former lefties or

141
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:29.570
whatever you want to call it,

142
00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:33.290
that kind of see one moment like you just laid out and then they start looking

143
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.080
at other things and going,
wait a minute.
Maybe that's not how it is.

144
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:39.650
Maybe that person's not racist just because I disagree with them on this or

145
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.220
whatever the case.
I guess I can,
I can put it to two

146
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.420
<v 2>quick moments.
One was,
uh,
once I,
once I arrived at Columbia,</v>

147
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.120
I heard of this Guy John mcwhorter,
who I,
I,

148
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.810
I had no reason to believe anything about at the time,

149
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.410
but I just went,
I don't know,
a whim.

150
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.460
I went to the library and just search his name and pick the first book I could

151
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.530
find.
And it was called authentically black.

152
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.280
And it's a series of essays he wrote in the early two thousands about the fact

153
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:13.440
that it's viewed as authentically black to con constantly pointing the finger at

154
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:16.620
white people for any given problem in the black community.

155
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.490
Whether or not the evidence bears that out and uh,

156
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.770
because it's viewed as authentically black,

157
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.770
there's this incredible taboo on anyone who thinks differently.

158
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.230
And I was reading,
I was reading these essays and I remember thinking,
Oh my God,

159
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.460
this is,
this is right.
And I've never heard a black person say this out loud,

160
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.930
but it's,
it's obviously right.
And I didn't know you could say that.

161
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.530
I remember that that moment being significant,
but still the,
I mean,

162
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.210
these subjects are so hard to talk about.
I,

163
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.211
I do remember doing at some point doing MDM may and this is where most people

164
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:57.330
have their break.
Yes.
Um,

165
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.940
I guess this maybe makes the,
the,

166
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.320
the red pill analogy a little bit too literal.
There you go.

167
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.030
But I do remember,
I mean,
because you know,

168
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.720
I don't,

169
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.150
I don't enjoy being the black person at odds with most black people around me

170
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:20.151
are getting accused as I sometimes do of being self hating or an uncle Tom.

171
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:21.980
Like I don't enjoy that.
That's,

172
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:25.560
that's very much a cost of what I'm doing psychologically.

173
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.240
But I remembered,

174
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.300
remember doing Mtma and I was talking to a black friend of mine about race

175
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.410
issues and you know,
if you've ever done MTMA you know,

176
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:42.240
just puts you in this totally clear head space where you love everyone around

177
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:44.550
you so much and you love yourself.

178
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.480
And I remember we were talking about race issues and I was articulating more of

179
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:55.370
the kind of points of view that I articulate now.
And I,

180
00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.650
it felt so silly that I had ever had a hang up talking about these things in any

181
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:04.830
other context.
And you know,
after that I just,

182
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.760
I felt like,

183
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.370
like there's no reason I can't try to approximate that more and more often.

184
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.670
Of course it's,
it's much harder when you're sober.
But the analogy though,

185
00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:20.460
or the metaphor of the red build really has some value here.

186
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:22.860
How did that conversation end up?
I mean,

187
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.910
the MTMA laced conversation bubble.
I feel like base all,

188
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.860
all MTMA laced conversations go well.
Yeah.
I mean something has to be,

189
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.570
yeah,
it is.
I just,
yeah,
I think,

190
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:41.571
I think if we add more and more enter conversations with a mindset of the person

191
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:47.220
I'm talking to has reasons to believe what they believe and they're coming from

192
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:51.180
a good place,
then a lot of conversations can go well.
That said,

193
00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:54.880
I've had a lot of conversations with people since then that have gone extremely

194
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.990
well.
Sorry.
Extremely poorly.
Yeah.
And um,

195
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.550
have ended quite bitterly.

196
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.051
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

197
00:12:01.051 --> 00:12:03.960
And I want to get to some of that and some of the things that people call you

198
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:06.260
and all that,
so,
okay.
So you have these,
you know,

199
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:10.200
a couple of successive moments of,
of waking up.
Um,

200
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.620
when did you finally start talking about this stuff?

201
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.420
<v 2>You know,
I think,
um,
I,</v>

202
00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:20.720
I talked about it here and there with friends and family,
but,

203
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.150
and I had been trying to write about it a bit for the school newspaper and just

204
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:29.750
writing on my own,
but not publishing over the past year.

205
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.170
But I think what,
what,

206
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.310
what did it was when Kanye tweeted,
uh,
I liked the way,

207
00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:41.750
I love the way Candace own thinks when he tweeted that something about that

208
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:46.751
moment was so inspiring to me to see someone who nobody on earth would question

209
00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:49.820
their quote blackness.

210
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.930
Because in many ways Kanye is viewed as,

211
00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:58.730
as the picture of blackness.
However one cashes out that term,
um,

212
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.590
to just to see him break ranks,
to see him break,
break the taboo,

213
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.370
even though he did it in a way that,
you know,

214
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:11.150
even though he's not an intellectual,
he said crazy things about slavery that,

215
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.780
that aren't true and endorse someone who I don't,

216
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.560
I don't see myself as having very much in common with namely,
namely Candace.

217
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.190
It just,
the fact that he was willing to break the taboo at all,

218
00:13:22.191 --> 00:13:27.191
someone of his platform was so inspiring to me that that's when I started

219
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.290
writing for Colette.
Yeah.
So what was,

220
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:33.630
was this the first piece you put out for court?
I think that was the very first,

221
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.850
very first piece.
Okay.
So the title of the piece,
as I said,

222
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.450
was high price of steel.
Yeah.
This one was different.
This one was,
um,
uh,

223
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.270
this one was about Kanye and Candice.
This was right.
Right.

224
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.510
So this one got more traction.
The one you're,
uh,
sorry.

225
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.190
<v 1>Okay.
So I think this is,
so I don't think I was,</v>

226
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.360
you were on my radar from that one,
although that probably that whole thing,

227
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.620
the whole kidney thing just sort of broke in such a crazy way though.

228
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.710
There were so many pieces written.
Um,
okay.
So let's back up then.

229
00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:04.180
So then when you write this piece about Kanye,
Candace,
now,
you know,

230
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:07.920
Kansas is a friend of mine.
She's been on the show.
Uh,
I like her.

231
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.330
She has some tactics that are,
that are not my thing,
but that's her thing.

232
00:14:12.331 --> 00:14:15.390
And I can disagree with people and all that.
Um,

233
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.700
your basic feeling though,
this was a net good no matter what.
Um,

234
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.390
are there risks though in,
uh,
you know,

235
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.710
taking somebody like a Kanye and having that be the moment that wakes up people

236
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:31.470
because you don't know where he's ever going to go with things or it's just the

237
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:32.670
action itself enough?

238
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.580
<v 2>Yeah,
I guess time will tell.</v>

239
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:38.750
I think it is inconvenient that Kanye,

240
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.050
I love his music and,
and I've been a fan for a long time,

241
00:14:42.051 --> 00:14:46.460
but he clearly has some narcissistic elements to his personality.

242
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.510
Uh,
he,

243
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.510
he's clearly not someone who deeply the subjects that,

244
00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:54.530
that he sometimes talks about.

245
00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.020
So he kind of took a very blunt sledge hammer to a taboo,
which I appreciated.

246
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:01.820
But there are,
there are serious downsides to that.

247
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:06.050
Namely when he says that slavery was slavery was a choice,

248
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.880
something that ignorant seems to discredit his taking the sledge hammer to the

249
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:14.660
taboo when I do think they're separable in principal.
I also think

250
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.460
<v 1>when he said,
you're talking about when he said that on TMZ,
right?
Yes.</v>

251
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.790
And his counter argument to that was that he means that it's,

252
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.630
it was sort of a mindset I think was his counter.

253
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.290
<v 2>Right?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
So just that,</v>

254
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.820
that sound byte reads so awfully because it seems so uninformed regardless of

255
00:15:30.821 --> 00:15:34.240
what his,
his intent was there that it can,

256
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.270
it can seem to discredit that he did a good thing on the net on net balance.

257
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.330
And you know,
I also,
I,
you know,
I have,

258
00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:46.260
I have reservations about cat cat as owners as well.
I've,

259
00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:50.740
I've seen her a reason in ways that I think don't make much sense,

260
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.760
although I have some points of agreement with there too.
But like I said,

261
00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:55.710
I think I,

262
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.720
I think there's a taboo that is incredibly strong right there.

263
00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.880
There are lots of black people who agree with some version of,

264
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:09.881
of my takes on race and are absolutely mortified to say so because there's this

265
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:11.550
massive taboo.

266
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.600
<v 1>Yeah.
And that's also why,
for again,
whatever my disagreements are with Candace,</v>

267
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.430
it's like I see her as someone that's trying so desperately to break something,

268
00:16:20.431 --> 00:16:22.110
the very thing that you're talking about.

269
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.030
So it's like if she's using tactics that maybe I wouldn't use or you know,

270
00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:31.620
tweets in a in a more hostile way at people or whatever that I wouldn't do.

271
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:35.550
It's like I don't know that I am the one that should be telling you how to

272
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:39.030
behave in that regard.
Does that make sense to you?

273
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.601
<v 2>Not so much.</v>

274
00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:45.601
Only because I feel like there are a lot of people who might like what Candace

275
00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:50.980
says on race for example,
so someone can just says,
you know,
to go,

276
00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:55.660
it goes to a college and says and sees all of all of these black students

277
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.030
reminding her of the history of Jim Crow,

278
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.330
which they didn't even experience and using that as as as a rhetorical weapon.

279
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:07.450
And Candace says,
listen,
you were born in 1990 right,

280
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.490
I completely agree with that.
That is,

281
00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:11.560
that is a message that needs to be hammered home,

282
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:16.120
which is that histories in the past and we have to be getting past history.

283
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.920
But you know,
when she says that you're on the democratic plantation,

284
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.660
I think that is a kind of exaggeration that is not useful because people with a

285
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:27.310
different set of intellectual priors,

286
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:32.230
we'll just hear that and be immediately closed off to,
to whatever else she says.

287
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.480
And you know,
I've also heard her just reason in ways on,

288
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.340
on Joe Rogan for example,
when he pressed her on climate change,

289
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:45.450
kind of appealing to a sort of feeling over facts kind of way of thinking,

290
00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:51.090
which is actually quite characteristic of,
of far left.
But you know,
she,

291
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:55.230
I think she also gets treated unfairly and she gets assumed to be a sellout.

292
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.650
Um,
which I think is,
is,
is,
is ridiculous,

293
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:01.620
ridiculous assumption to make about people in general unless they make it

294
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.770
absolutely clear that they are.
So,
you know,
she's,

295
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.560
she's someone I would be happy to talk to at some point,
but

296
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.740
<v 1>I'm happy to set that up if you'd like to make it happen.
Okay.</v>

297
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:12.060
So you write this piece now,

298
00:18:12.061 --> 00:18:14.340
this is the first public piece that you've written about this stuff.

299
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.980
Did you have any idea what kind of reaction you were in store for?

300
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.480
<v 2>No,
no.
Walk me through that moment.
Um,
yeah,</v>

301
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:28.481
I think it got retweeted by Christina Hoff Summers and Jordan Peterson and Sam

302
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.280
Harris and,
and some other people and it really,
really blew up.
And uh,

303
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.540
yeah,
I that was psychologically distressing because,

304
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.790
you know,
I'm a normal person,

305
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:45.791
so when I go from having 50 Twitter followers to 10,000 in a week or something

306
00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:50.930
like that,
that is a pretty life deranging moment.

307
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.310
And uh,
it was,
it was just kind of physical stress,

308
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:59.300
a low level physical stress all day and not sleeping as much,
but you,
you get,

309
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.040
I think you get,
you'd be surprised what you can get used to.
Um,
so

310
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.110
<v 1>we were you shocked were you were getting defense from and where you were</v>

311
00:19:08.111 --> 00:19:12.280
getting outrage from or I assume you expected it at least at some level.

312
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.430
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
I don't think I was shocked by that.
I mean,</v>

313
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:19.431
I knew at this point I knew at this point exactly who would be very pissed off

314
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:25.350
by,
by my,
my opinions.
And at this point I had resigned myself to,

315
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.820
to be to those people being pissed off at me.
And No,
I'm not,
I mean,

316
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:33.000
I'm not surprised that they're quote IDW types,
uh,

317
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.410
liked my work because I like a lot of their work.
Um,
so no,

318
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.480
I guess that wasn't,
that wasn't so surprising.

319
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.360
<v 1>Yeah.
So when you then wrote the piece,
the high price of state,</v>

320
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.940
the high price of steel grievances,
uh,

321
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.180
which was also in quilt that you started with a quote from felonious monk that I

322
00:19:49.181 --> 00:19:51.760
thought was,
was sort of worth diving into here.

323
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.760
They tried to get me to hate white people,

324
00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:57.310
but someone would always come along and spoil it.

325
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.740
There's something about that quote that strikes me as so relevant to what's

326
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:07.741
going on right now that we are not looking at people as individuals and that

327
00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:08.890
every time you do,

328
00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:13.600
you will be pleasantly surprised because most people are not walking around in

329
00:20:13.601 --> 00:20:15.310
this state of hate.

330
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.460
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I think it's striking.
I mean,
I,
and I,
I,
I,</v>

331
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.620
I,
um,
juxtapose that quote with another from the New York Times,

332
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:28.700
from a New York Times op Ed published last year,
uh,

333
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.710
which argued that black children should be taught to fear white children based

334
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:38.070
on the history of racism in this country.
Uh,
and the quote was,

335
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.940
as against our Gazi national hopes,
I will teach my boys,

336
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:46.230
my black boys to have profound doubts that friendship with white people as

337
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:50.800
possible.
Right?
So that got published in The New York Times in 2017.

338
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.000
Uh,
you know,
Sarah Jon got hired,
uh,
having,

339
00:20:55.001 --> 00:21:00.001
having written incredibly nasty tweets about white people in 2018 by the New

340
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.040
York Times,
right?
It's,
it's,

341
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.980
it's disturbing to me that you can't,

342
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.110
you can't really find at this point on the left,
even on the mainstream left,

343
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:16.770
just the simple articulation that a person's race does not matter to their moral

344
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:24.190
worthiness to their intellectual worthiness.
It is,
it is an irrelevant character.

345
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:27.760
You can't find the language of,
of,

346
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.790
of appeals to colorblind humanity virtually anywhere on the left at this point.

347
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.850
Um,
that,
that is disturbing to me.

348
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.510
<v 1>How shocking is it to you?
Because I think people are still kind of shocked,</v>

349
00:21:41.511 --> 00:21:41.661
you know,

350
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:45.860
I've been banging this drum for quite some time and I think I see people waking

351
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:49.550
up to it now and I'm like,
man,
how didn't you see this?
You know,
these,

352
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.360
these last couple of years because it's so obvious to me that we've gotten here.

353
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.120
Yeah,
yeah,

354
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.700
<v 2>no,
it,
it is shy.
Me.
I do remember growing up,
you know,
in the,</v>

355
00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:00.000
in the public school system,

356
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.620
in my town we would have Martin Luther King Day assemblies is very diverse town,

357
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.150
maybe 25 30% black and 60% white.
And we would,

358
00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:11.550
we would get the,
you know,
the,

359
00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:16.551
I have a dream's style ethic around what it means to be a human and how

360
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:20.580
important or unimportant one skin color is.

361
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.860
And it seemed like such a,

362
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.810
it seems like there's such a good argument to me and it is the best argument

363
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.530
with regard to people's,
you know,
the,
the assumed,

364
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.533
I guess

365
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.540
w w w what I mean to say here is that I've been in spaces at Columbia for

366
00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:43.230
example,
or conversations where my being black,

367
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.410
it was obvious to me that there was an assumption of,

368
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.040
of moral worthiness or have a kind of heightened moral knowledge than I would

369
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:56.970
have as a black person that a white person wouldn't have.

370
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.970
And you know,
I think,
I think I,

371
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.910
I'm not the first to make this analogy of course,

372
00:23:02.911 --> 00:23:07.650
but the real religious analogy and the analogy to original sin is pretty apt.

373
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.250
Um,
because it,
I mean the,
the way though,

374
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.710
this has a lot to do with black history also because the way I,
the way I see it,

375
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.760
they're kind of two ways to study history.
There's the conventional way,
which is,

376
00:23:20.761 --> 00:23:22.190
you know,
you study World War One,

377
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.520
you study the causes and consequences read different takes on,
on,

378
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.270
on the significance.
And once you've studied,
all you need to know,

379
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.220
you move on to the next topic.

380
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.350
But then there's a religious way of studying history,
which is,

381
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.270
it's not enough to know the facts.
We have to go somewhere on Sunday,
every,

382
00:23:42.271 --> 00:23:44.490
you know,
every single week and learn,

383
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:49.240
talk about same stories over and over again.
So this is,
you know,
it's,

384
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.820
it's the difference between how an atheist learns about the life of Jesus and

385
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:56.570
how a Christian learns about the life of Jesus Jesus and relearn it every week

386
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:59.060
for the rest of their life.
In my view,

387
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.360
how we're looking at the history of race relations in this country,

388
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.380
the history of racism,

389
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.060
we are more and more putting it in the religious category of history of where,

390
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:09.400
you know,

391
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.400
I can read a piece about the history of lynching in the New York Times almost,

392
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.890
you know,
once every two or three months.
Right.
Let me,

393
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.860
lynching is a decades old crime at this point.
And Avi,
I mean,
Jesus,

394
00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:27.320
Great.
Obviously it was a,
a heinous staying on,
on this country's legacy,

395
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.371
you know?

396
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:33.260
But then the number of deaths that that is is the highest amount quoted in New

397
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.950
York Times with regard to how many black people were lynched in this country is

398
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:39.920
around 4,000.
Right.
Every single year.

399
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:44.480
Twice that many black people die of homicide.
And I,

400
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.590
you just don't even hear about that in the New York Times.

401
00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:49.240
So what do you make of the fact then?

402
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.440
So this is something that like a Sean Hannity,
he'll talk about he'll,

403
00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:54.840
he'll say that exactly.
Yeah.
And now if you say,

404
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.400
and then people will say that somehow that makes him racist cause he's been

405
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.190
focusing on black on black crime or something like that.

406
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.950
So how do we have that conversation then?

407
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:06.680
Because I think partly what's happening is the outreach,
you know,

408
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:10.300
someone mentions it,
he happens to be someone obviously on the right.
Uh,

409
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.710
I don't know what his intentions are.
I don't know the guy,
but he's,

410
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.660
he's at least talking about it.
What you just said,

411
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:18.530
people aren't talking about it.
Yes.
But then pays a heavy price to talk about it.

412
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.130
That then has the chill effect that it's like people are like,
all right,

413
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.540
I'm not going to talk about it.

414
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:28.541
So we can look at the crime statistics in Chicago every week and you should care

415
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.360
about these statistics where there's people who are white or black or whatever,

416
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.220
but people are just like,
I don't want to touch it because,
yeah,

417
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.960
I don't want these labels.
Yeah,
it is.
It is decidedly.
I mean,

418
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:42.380
this is one of the reasons why,
you know,
I'm,

419
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:47.410
I don't see myself as a natural ally to a Candace Owens for example,

420
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:52.460
because there are so many other things that she says that,

421
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.280
uh,
you know,
that,
that I don't agree with.

422
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.540
And I guess it's the Sean Hannity problem too,

423
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:04.160
because if you can't criticize a Sean Hannity or Candice Owens for all of the

424
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:08.690
things that they're saying that are know on unjustified by the evidence,

425
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.980
you know,
it's cat is Kate Candice's case.
It might be climate change or,

426
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.330
or whatever it is,
um,
for Sean Hannity could be other things.
Uh,

427
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.490
then I guess you just have to be able to,

428
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.680
to make these subtle distinctions.

429
00:26:24.681 --> 00:26:27.230
But at the end of the day,

430
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:32.231
homicide is the leading cause of death for young black men aged 15 to 34

431
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.710
according to the CDC.

432
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.250
It is not the leading cause of homicide for any other race or,

433
00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:40.250
or age group.
Um,

434
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.460
can we talk about that?
That,
I mean the,
is it the case that we're,

435
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:51.750
we're,
we're so close to white people turning the hoses on us again

436
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.960
to the Sean Hannity and,
and they're supposedly deplorable,

437
00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.610
um,
you know,

438
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.940
followers that that were just so the threat of white supremacy is so ever

439
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:10.791
present of resurgent white supremacy that we can't talk about the leading cause

440
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:15.060
of death among young black men,
that,
that,

441
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.990
that is not sustainable.
Amy,

442
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.260
the fundamental problem I see with how the left in general thinks about race is

443
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:27.261
that the concerns about race and racism are totally unattached to the degree to

444
00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:34.380
which black people are suffering on any given issue.
Right?

445
00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:37.590
So we're talking about the leading cause of death for young black men.

446
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.210
And I never read about this in the New York Times and I,
and I know that I won't.

447
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.230
Right?
So this is,
this is a problem that is central.
It is.

448
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.540
It is bigger than the problem of police violence.

449
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.490
It is bigger than you know than the problem of microaggressions that is bigger

450
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:58.491
than the problems of of systemic bias and yet there is,

451
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:04.551
there's virtually no concern for this on the left because the way I see many

452
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:10.251
progressives think about race issues is a perpetrator side concern,

453
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:14.970
which is if the perpetrators of the problem are white that it's worth talking

454
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:18.960
about.
If the perpetrators of the problem happened to be black and it's not,

455
00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:19.561
we're talking about,

456
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:23.520
the problem with that is that it's untethered to any concern for the level of

457
00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:25.530
suffering on this side.
On the victim side.

458
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:31.090
<v 1>Do you think it's a fair estimation to see this is the new racism in a weird way</v>

459
00:28:31.281 --> 00:28:33.770
like it's almost uncomfortable to say it,

460
00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:36.860
but I had a an educator in the UK here in the summer,

461
00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:40.850
Katherine verbal sing and that's basically what she said that these people are

462
00:28:40.851 --> 00:28:41.860
now the racists,

463
00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.850
that the racist ideas of the day are actually coming out of the left.
Now.

464
00:28:46.851 --> 00:28:49.700
I don't want to use the same tactics.
Right.
I don't want to sit here and be like,

465
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:51.710
they're all racist and blah,
blah,
blah,

466
00:28:51.711 --> 00:28:53.660
because we know that that doesn't really get us anywhere.
Yeah.

467
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.090
The general idea of that,
do you think that that's a fair way to frame things?

468
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.650
<v 2>I,
I wouldn't frame it.</v>

469
00:29:00.651 --> 00:29:05.270
I mean the way I would frame it is that there is a kind of racism on the left

470
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.660
and it's the kind of racism where the New York Times higher,

471
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.700
higher is a writer who says that,

472
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.870
who celebrates the idea that white people stop breathing.
Right.

473
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.430
And doesn't apologize for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No concern with how that,

474
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.120
how that's going to translate to,
you know,

475
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.240
white people in this country who have vastly less privileged than,
you know,

476
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.130
the tech writer at the New York Times.

477
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.550
<v 1>And what about that statement that they issued defending her?
Yeah,</v>

478
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.000
you saw that where it said something about the hate she gets as a young Asian

479
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:35.870
woman and it's like

480
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.880
<v 2>what?</v>

481
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.880
That that's now a new thing that you get to be racist because you've gotten

482
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.230
trolled online.
Well.
Yeah,
I mean that,

483
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:47.680
so coming back to the question that is that that is,

484
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.170
I'm happy to call that a kind of racism for sure.

485
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.090
It's the only reason I would say there I wouldn't go as far as to say they are

486
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:58.990
the new racist is because there are still racist on the other side and I fully

487
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:03.730
expect there to always be some amount of racist in society and some amount of

488
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:08.560
racist incidents like the way this is another problem with the way many on the

489
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:10.680
left think about race is that they,

490
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.110
they tend to view the problem of racism.

491
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.020
Kind of like we view the problem with smallpox,

492
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:22.110
which is to say something that can be fully eradicated down to the very last

493
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:23.140
person who has it.

494
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.120
And then we can put a date on the time when smallpox is no longer a problem

495
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.190
forever.
Whereas I,

496
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.220
and I would argue anyone who's really thinking rationally about this problem

497
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.450
should view racism as more,
more like a problem like murder,
right?

498
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.410
Like the murder rate in New York City used to be 10 times higher than it was

499
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.520
today.
Just 20 years ago it was,
it was absolute carnage.

500
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.640
So that the,
the rate is,
it's come down tenfold.

501
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.700
New York is notoriously safe at this point is something like 200 murders,

502
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.720
two or 300 murders last year.
Right.

503
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.070
What would it take to get the murder rate down to zero to the point where there

504
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:06.730
was not a single murder in New York City,
you'd probably murder everybody.
Yes,

505
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.890
you have to get me.

506
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.850
Do you have to embrace a totally totalitarian vibe from the top down?

507
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.390
It could be done,
but it would not be worth what it took to get there.

508
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:20.500
You'd hit diminishing returns.
So I view the problem of reducing racism,

509
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:24.400
reducing racist incidents against black people as a problem,

510
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.270
like homicide rather than smallpox,

511
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.100
which is to say you can certainly reduce it and we have massively,

512
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.120
but there was a point at which in a country of 350 million,

513
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.190
there will always be enough people who are racist to,

514
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.760
to justify a certain amount of racist incidents and to fight it beyond that

515
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.340
endlessly you hit diminishing returns.

516
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.160
<v 1>Yeah.
And also that it's depressing and it kind of sucks,</v>

517
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:54.050
but people can be racist.
Like privately,
you can be racist,

518
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.120
know you can't discriminate against people and there's all sorts of reasons that

519
00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:04.280
you can't bring that into public life,
but in your own mind,

520
00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:07.820
in your own home,
you can be,
I would prefer people not be,

521
00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.930
but that they're trying to eradicate like something that's actually just part of

522
00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:13.220
the mind.
Yeah.
You want to,

523
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.000
you want to educate people enough so that they hopefully won't hold those views,

524
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.540
but that is the diminishing returns because you're literally going to be in

525
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:22.030
people's houses at that,

526
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.370
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
it's a,
it's a question of not.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

527
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.640
I guess there's a question of what your view of human nature is.

528
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:34.641
This comes down to very fundamental pillars of one's a political ideology,

529
00:32:35.101 --> 00:32:40.010
which is do you have a kind of Utopian view of human nature where there's

530
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:42.500
nothing tragic about us,
nothing flawed about us,

531
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:47.210
and all of the flaws come from bad ideas and the culture and humans are

532
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:52.211
naturally poised to be just perfectly selfless until we get ruined by society.

533
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.660
I see that,
that,
I think there's no reason to believe that at this point,
right?

534
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.690
Like chimpanzees and murder and like there were animals in the animal kingdom.

535
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:07.091
It's not to say that where our human nature is fundamentally evil either it's,

536
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:11.330
it's clearly there's a,
there's a wide range of potential there,
but there's no,

537
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:15.230
no reason to assume that we're evolved to be not racists or that were evolved to

538
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:17.360
be,
um,
you know,

539
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:22.361
woke perfectly woke or that it's possible to get to a point where everyone in

540
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:28.301
society has been fully purged of every ounce of evil in their heart.

541
00:33:29.061 --> 00:33:33.950
I mean,
that is such a utopian outlook.
And like I said,

542
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.190
the,
the,
to the extent that you're fixated on that goal,

543
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:40.220
to the exclusion of the costs of your fixation,

544
00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.230
once you hit diminishing returns,

545
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.980
you will be finding a fight that is a net bad for society.
