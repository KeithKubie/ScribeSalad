00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.739
- [Voiceover] Let's now see
if we can balance a chemical

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.000
equation with slightly
more complex molecules.

00:00:07.243 --> 00:00:10.044
So, here we have a chemical equation,

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.428
describing a chemical reaction.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.029
This is actually a combustion reaction.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.256
You have some ethylene right over here,

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:20.089
in the presence of oxygen,
and you need to get a

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.643
little bit of energy to get
this going, but then you're

00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:24.315
going to have this reaction
that's actually going to

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.845
release energy as well, but
we're not accounting for

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:28.787
the energy, at least the
way we've written it.

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:32.154
Right over here, you have
some ethylene, and this little

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:35.126
g in parentheses, says
it's in the gas form

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:39.498
or gaseous form, so
gaseous ethylene plus some

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.879
dioxygen molecule, which is
the most prevalent form of

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.600
oxygen molecule that you
would find in the atmosphere.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.411
And so, that's also in the gas form.

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.754
Put them together, you end
up with some carbon dioxide

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:55.610
gas and some liquid water.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.629
This is the classic combustion reaction.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.160
But now let's think about,
how do we balance this thing?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.157
Let's make sure we have the same number

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:07.104
of each atom on both sides.

00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:09.519
And when you see something
more complicated like this,

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.445
where, you know, here I have
an oxygen and two different

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:17.215
molecules over here, and a
lot of these molecules have

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.049
multiple elements in it.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.187
It might be very daunting.

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.278
Where do I start?

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.661
And this is where the
art of balancing chemical

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.122
equations starts to come into play.

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.444
The general idea is,

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:30.828
Try to balance the...

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.599
try to balance the
molecules that have multiple

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.476
elements in them first, and leave the...

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:40.462
molecules that only have one
element in them for last.

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:43.039
And the idea there is,
is that these are harder.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.851
They're going to have all
sorts of implications,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:46.592
and then, at the end of
the day, you can just set

00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:50.887
a number here for the number of dioxygens.

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:54.779
If you saved, say the ethylene for last,

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.728
then every time, and you're
trying to balance the carbons,

00:01:57.728 --> 00:01:59.647
you try to change the number
of carbons, you're going to

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:00.613
change the number of hydrogens,

00:02:00.613 --> 00:02:01.913
which is going to change the...

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.112
You're going to have to balance
over and over, and you're

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:05.712
going to go into this really
really really confusing circle.

00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:08.336
So, the best thing to do, try to balance

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.981
the complex molecules first, and then

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.023
save the single element
molecules for last.

00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:16.857
So let's do that.

00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:19.644
So, let's start with the carbons.

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:22.639
So, over here, I have two carbons.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.725
Over here, I only have one carbon.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:28.420
I only have one carbon.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.558
So, it seems like the best
way to balance it is, I should

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:35.456
have two molecules of carbon dioxide,

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.464
and I haven't even thought
about the oxygens yet.

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:39.855
By putting that two there,
that's going to change the

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:42.154
number of oxygens I have
on the righthand side.

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:44.499
But at least it balances my carbons.

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.332
I now have two carbons
on the lefthand side,

00:02:47.332 --> 00:02:49.886
and I have two carbons
on the righthand side.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.208
Iâ€™m no longer magically destroying

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:55.296
a carbon atom, all right.

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:57.780
Now, let's move on to the
hydrogens, and remember,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.450
what I said is, let's wait
to do the oxygens last,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.864
because we have a molecule

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:06.232
that only contains oxygen right over here,

00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:08.298
so we'll save oxygen for last.

00:03:08.298 --> 00:03:11.804
So, let's do hydrogen next.

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:15.241
So, hydrogen, right over
here, we have four hydrogens.

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:18.761
And on the righthand side,
we have two hydrogens.

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.492
So, it seems like the easiest
thing to do to balance

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.254
the hydrogens is to have two
of these water molecules.

00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:27.520
Now I have four hydrogens here,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.655
and I have four hydrogens there.

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:33.023
Now, let's do the oxygen.

00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:34.788
Now, let's do the oxygen.

00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.854
I've balanced the carbons
and the hydrogens.

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:38.633
And the reason why oxygen's
going to be interesting,

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:41.466
I can just count the amount
of oxygen I now have here,

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:45.660
after changing the amount
of molecules I have.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.182
And then I can adjust this
accordingly, because this is

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:50.272
only going to affect the number of oxygens

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.338
that I have on the lefthand side.

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:54.939
Right now, on the lefthand
side, I have two oxygens,

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.911
and on the righthand
side, let me count this,

00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:00.200
I have two O two's, really.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.940
So, this is going to be four oxygens here,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.216
and then I have, each of
these water molecules has

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.421
one oxygen, but I have
two water molecules,

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:11.485
so this is going to be two
oxygens, two oxygens here.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:15.609
So, on the righthand side, I
have four plus two oxygens.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.620
So, I have six oxygens
on the righthand side.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.919
I need six oxygens on the lefthand side.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.962
I need this number to be six.

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.193
So, how do I do that?

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:24.795
Well, I just need three
of these molecules.

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:27.395
If I have three molecules,
each of them have two oxygens,

00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:29.833
I'm going to have a total of six oxygens.

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:31.946
And just like that, we have balanced this

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:36.084
combustion reaction,
this chemical equation.
