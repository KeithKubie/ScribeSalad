00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.800
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: This is -- we're all
familiar, it's wonderful of course.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.310
Thank you all, for being here
in the middle of the day.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.310
Especially those of you who
are not Library employees,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.130
a good many of you here, so
that's really great to see.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.210
My name is Nicholas Brown,
I'm a music specialist

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.950
in the music division,
where I'm on the team

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.900
with the concert outlets
programing the concert series,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.560
and the various public
programs that we do around that.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.330
One of my great pleasures of
working here is to engage in one

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.960
of my other passions, which
is musicological research,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.930
and today I'm very
excited to share some

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.520
of the results with that with you.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.470
This is a topic that I've been
looking into for many years,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.950
even back when I was
coming to the Library

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.290
to do research, as a student.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.010
So, the tittle of the talk is
Hindemith's Musical Responses

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550
to World War One, before we get
started I just want to give a shot

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.610 position:56%
out to the interpreter program's
office, because this lecture is part

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.640
of the programing for two
World War One's exhibits

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.570
that the library has going on.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.290 position:56%
One of them is open right now, and
the other one opens on April fourth,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.120
they are -- exhibits are title
World War One, American Artist View

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.370
of the Great War, and the second
one is Echoes of the Great War,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.970
American Experiences
of World War One.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.270
So, check that out.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600 position:56%
You're all invited to take your
phones out and live Tweet this talk.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.430
You can also take pictures of
the collection items or put them

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.410
up on Instagram or whatever
else you would like.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.790
Please tag the library when
you do that, @librarycongress

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.180
and you're also invited to use
the Hashtag World War One; WW1,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.470
and my personal handle
is there for Twitter,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.130 position:56%
if you would like to tag me as well.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.790 position:56%
Great. So, this is a quote by one of
Hindemith's principal biographers,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.280 position:56%
and you can read it, but I will read
it as well, "He was never a patriot,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.790
yet he was deeply attached
to his German roots.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940
And the true test came
when his country was taken

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.800
over by totalitarian regime".

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.940
So, that kind of introduces
this biograph on there,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.570 position:56%
that's going on in Hindemith's life.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.810
So, he grew up and came of age
in the World War One period,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.250
and then had significant conflict

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.080
with the regime during
the Nazi period,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.420
which then drove his departure
from Germany, eventually went

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.840
to Switzerland, came to U.S
and made his way back later on.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.970
But, the purpose of this talk is
to very much take a close dive,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.430 position:56%
just on the World War One period,
and the years immediately following,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.490
where Germany and Hindemith
were very much trying

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.970
to put things back together.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.270
Because, Germany of course,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.250
was a mess several years
there, after the war.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.000
And so, this is a wonderful
picture of Hindemith in uniform,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.750
in World War One, with his bio,
that's from 1918, I couldn't come

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.310 position:56%
up with a clever enough bio joke, so
you're allowed to put your own in,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.560
and there's a space there for that.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.760
So, while you're checking out
Hindemith, I'll just give you a bit

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.800
of an overview of his
biography, for those of you

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.430
who aren't so familiar with him.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.320 position:56%
And then, after that, we're going to
shed some light on some of his role

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.800 position:56%
in World War One, and some of the
music he composed during the period.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.400
And we'll also do a
close reading of one

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.430
of his World War One
ear response works,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.170
and then we'll discuss Hindemith's
relationship to the Library,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.550
because that's the only reason
I'm allowed to talk about him,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.430
because he had a relationship,
and we have collections

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.570
that are related to Hindemith.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.620
So, there's Hindemith in a string
[inaudible] I'll get to this

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.780 position:56%
on the narrative, so just peruse
that, while I give you some tidbits.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.660
So, Hindemith was born in Hanau,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.090
Germany near Frankfurt,
on November 16, 1898.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.980
He died also, in Frankfurt in 1963.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.710
He was the oldest of three
siblings; learned the violin first,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.560 position:56%
then he started studying composition

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.980
at the Hoch's Konservatorium
[phonetic] in Frankfurt.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.330
One of his teachers
was Arnold Mendelssohn,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.660
who was the great nephew of Felix.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.680
He was also the same
teacher of Adorno,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.680
which I find very interesting.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.100
Hindemith didn't stick with the
violin, and he later switched

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.210
over to viola, and became
a composer of course,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.210 position:56%
he was a significant music theorist,
an educator, and a conductor.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.930
He also published several
theoretical treatises

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.820
and some pedagogical texts as well.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
So, getting into the
World War One time frame,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.620
that was a very brief overview of
his biography, go read something,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.610
you don't want to hear me
ramble about that all day.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.010
So, World War One.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:57.130
Hindemith's father; Robert Rudolf
Emil Hindemith, was born in 1870 --

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.640 position:56%
was one of the driving forces behind
Hindemith becoming a musician.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.440
He was a musician, he forced
his children to pretty much get

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.420
in the track to become musicians.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.680
He was very active in getting
Hindemith opportunities

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.690
with teachers, putting him into
conservatories with scholarships,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.440
and even opening the door for jobs.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.610
Just about the time of 1914,
the relationship soured,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.500
I haven't gotten in enough
depth in the German text,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.660
to see exactly why that was.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.250
It seems like Hindemith, probably
didn't talk too much about it.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.680
But, right about the time
that it became strange,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.370
Hindemith's father went to fight
in World War One, since 1914,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.740
and he was killed within
that first year of conflict.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.980
So, that left Hindemith's
mother without the income

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.140
for the household, and
Hindemith had to quickly adapt

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.110
to become the principal
bread winner for the family.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.340
He joined the Frankfurt opera
orchestra in 1914, he was promoted

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.280
to Deputy Leader, Deputy
Concert Master later that year,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.280
and he became the Concert
Master in 1917.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.820
Hindemith was very evolved
in chamber music playing,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.380
notably joining the
Rebner String Quartet,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.500
from 1915 as the second violinist,
and later in 1923, was the switch

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.450
to viola that we mentioned earlier.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.360
So, Hindemith was busy working in
Frankfurt, he was a freelancer,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.030
he also had these permanent gigs,
where he was relatively well paid,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.620
compared to a lot of other people.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.870
And he kind of got away with not
having been conscripted initially,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.600
because there was a draft.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.110
One of the biographers goes
in depth into something

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.790
that really puts the effect of
World War One into perspective; so,

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.320
Hindemith, on the outside of
the war, had a lot of German,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.140
nationalist kind of concepts.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.450
Not super nationalist, not super
imperialist like other folks.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.050
But, you can see his
attitude towards the war,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.830
and towards his own
government positions evolved

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.430
over the course of the war.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.970
So, on September 23rd,
1914; Hindemith said, quote,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.330
"Everyone is glad that the
French are getting a good blow,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.020
and if one goes into town
towards noon, or in the evening;

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.740
there's a crowd such as one
seldom notices in peaceful times,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.030
in the entire empire
there's the great optimism

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.850
that Germany will win, and when
you see all the happy soldiers

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.630
that are still here,
and the enthusiasm,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.890
you know this cannot be otherwise.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.440
Everyone is delighted to go
into the field, and when you see

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.340
that everyone is happy to grab
a weapon, and no one wants

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.700
to stay behind, even
enemies will have to admit

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.290
that the German people are fighting
for a just cause, and have not,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.750
as the French, Russian and
English live factories,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.320
wished to propagate gun to
war, just for rowdiness.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.790
Don't think that what I'm
writing is an exaggeration.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.290
The numbers are set too low,
the people are set in a state

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.830
of enormous enthusiasm", obviously,
that didn't last for most people,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.860
and the central powers
there just given the scale

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.450
of destruction and death.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.290
Hindemith was initially
called up for service in 1915,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.770
but he was rejected and he wrote of
this to some friends, "They haven't

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.730
yet taken me up into the ranks
of the defenders of our country,

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.110
and I'm not angry about it.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.010
I was examined twice,
but was rejected due

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.720
to general physical
weakness and heart defects.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.660
There will probably be more
examinations coming up,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.420
and I have no hope of
coming back again."

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.450
So, that's within a year,
he's from September 14,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.830
to September 15 his attitude
just switched, and maybe,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.700
there was out of context going
on, but that's what we have

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.590 position:56%
in some correspondence to go off of.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.980
So, he was eventually
conscripted, and in August of 1917,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.440
and throughout these first
few years of the war,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.960
he was just in Frankfurt
working, basically.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.710
And his training period
started on August 1917,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.990
and then in January 1918, he was
sent close to the front in Alsace,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.150
with a regime, and eventually on
to Flanders, on the summer of 1918.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.240
One of the things that shows
Hindemith's entrepreneurial skill,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.730
or persuasive skills, is
that he lobbied the director

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:03.020
of the Frankfurt Opera Theater, to
keep him on salary in his position,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.370
while he was off fighting.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.380
So, nowadays if you're in
the military and you work

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.970 position:56%
for the government, you have 15 days

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.460
of military leave a year,
which is very generous.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.600
So, basically getting paid
leave time, be in service,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.330
but it expires at a certain point.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.150
Hindemith actually
negotiated to get 70%

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.580
of his salary paid while
he was away and not working

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.130
for the Opera Orchestra,
which is pretty cool.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.300
And his boss there, was generous
and didn't seem to put up much

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.040
of a fight about that,
given that the --

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.310
he very much asked for empathy,
because of his mother situation

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.480
and not having a father anymore.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.420
So, in the war, Hindemith was
assigned to the regimental band,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.890
this is a good place for
professional musicians

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.760
to go during sort of
total war situations,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.610
it's the same in the American
military in World War One,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.550
World War Two; folks
like Glenn Miller,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.430
serving Elvis during his
little PR service, right?

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.700
And Hindemith, because
it was basically a brass

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.500
and percussion sort of -- Drum
and Bugle Corp kind of ensemble,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.760
he played bass drum, there
was not an opportunity

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.560
for him to play the violin.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.420
That is initial entry
to the regimental band.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.040
He kind of seems to have
appreciated that he was

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.900
in a cushy service job basically,
and he wrote to some friends in May

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.150
of 1918, quote, "I can hardly
imagine most musicians as soldiers;

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.950
Bach as a staff Sargent,
that would still be OK,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.220 position:56%
but Beethoven practicing rightful
drum, Mozart throwing hand grenades,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.150
or standing guard in
front of a barracks.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.520
Shubert as an Air Force Lieutenant,
and Mendelssohn as an NCO

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:50.780
at a vehicle fleet convoy that
is inconceivable", end quote.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.720 position:56%
So, Hindemith did have down time, in
which to compose, and very quickly

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.830
after he got tired of
playing bass drum alone,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.410 position:56%
he joined in a string quartet with
some others in the military service,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.480
and that became a big
part of his duties,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.900
was to play string
quartet repertoire

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.640
for the commanding officer, who
was a very sort of well read,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.410
learned type of guy who
enjoyed this classical music.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.810
And that was a really
good opportunity

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.790
for Hindemith to take advantage of.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.940
So, they were mostly
back from the frontlines,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.030
as a result of his entertainment
role, and ceremonial role,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:34.040
and eventually, they did get sent
in to sort of guards situations,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.990
which I'll get into a second,
but one of the evenings or days,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.920
where he was performing
for the commanding officer

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.730 position:56%
in the string quartet, they happened

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.450
to be performing Debussy's
[phonetic] Quartet,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.180
and while they were
performing they got word

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.550
that Debussy had passed away.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.180
This was in 1918, March 25th
was when he passed away.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:59.580
Hindemith is -- one of his most
well-known quotes is the following,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.010
quote, "We did not
play to the end --

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.420
this is referring to that
performance of the Debussy --

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.550
it was as if our playing had been
robbed of the breath of life,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.670
that we realized for the first
time that music is more than style,

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.810
technique and the expression
of powerful feelings;

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.900
music reached out beyond
political boundaries,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.410
national hatred and
the horse of war.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.040
On no other occasion have I seen

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.530
so clearly what direction
music must take".

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.510
So, that definitely shows us,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.260
I think that Hindemith was a
very enlightened individual,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.060
he was thinking about
what he was experiencing,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.440
and this kind of discourse
on the role of music

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.200
in these conflict situations
plays an interesting role

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.550
in the rest of his life.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.630
And this is very much the
formative period with this --

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.000
because he got into conflicts of
course, with the Nazis later on,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.500
in terms of his positions, and
the conservatory, and advocating

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.840
for composers who were being pushed

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.800
out for political or
religious reasons.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.880 position:56%
This is the foundation of Hindemith,
as the sort of noble, intellectual,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.580
standing up for what's
right through his music.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.950
He wasn't a radical with
it, at all, it's more --

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.230
it fits into this concept
of expressionism,

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:20.690 position:56%
where he was using the music to give
a very individualized accounting

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.250
of emotions and personal responses,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.840
especially through the text based
works, the vocal chamber music,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.250
which we're going to
get into in depth.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.090
One other joke that he made
about the bass drum in his time

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.950
of service, was, "I was assured

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.680
that this instrument had never been
before treated so rhythmically;

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.260
service is not so hard, I have
a lot of free time and can work

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.010
in what I want", end quote.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:54.880
So, later in the war, on
May of 1918, in Flanders,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.950
where he was stationed, he writes
about his experiences of being,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.250
really on the frontlines,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.380
rather than several
kilometers back before, right?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.400
If you're playing as
a string quartet,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.080
while people are dying it's not --

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.700
you're probably not
on the frontlines.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.910
So, he writes about being closer
to the combat situation, quote,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.770
"Towards the evening, eight
bombs were thrown near the town,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.160
one hit the ammunition convoy
that [inaudible] 10 minutes away

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.020
from us, a horrible sight.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.740
Blood, bodies full of holes,
brains, a torn off horse's head,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.780
splintered bones, dreadful; how
mean and indifferent one becomes.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.940
I don't think I could've eaten
or worked in peace before,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.240
since such a sight -- excuse me --
after seeing such a sight, and now,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.250
one sits at home again;
writing, chatting in a good mood,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.950
not thinking about how soon
the bell could toll for us.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.580 position:56%
It's gradually becoming creepy here,
we're going to withdraw unharmed".

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.190
There's a lot of different
emotions going on, right?

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.680
He's going from being at a
pretty protected situation,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.070
to being more towards the combat
experience, seeing what's going on,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.390
and I think a lot of the sort of --

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.970
the concepts that he is reflecting
on, on that statement in terms

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.020
of experiencing and
witnessing visually, the gore

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.630
and the death come through in a
lot of the text that he selected

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.750
for his musical compositions.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.380
When he heard of the end of
the war, in November 1918,

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.090
he described the experience
of hearing the news as,

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.050
"An event that I should never
forget, for the rest of my life",

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.200
and after that point he went back
to Frankfurt to continue composing,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.970
and he took back his position
in the Upper Orchestra.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.240
This is another interesting
quote that --

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.990 position:56%
a musicologist wrote about Hindemith
in 1929, biograph [inaudible]

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.590
and music and letters, and reads
the mentality of Hindemith,

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.920 position:56%
as definitely of the present and not
of the past, he follows the events

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.670
and happenings of the
world about him,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.750
and makes use of contemporary
methods of thought and expression,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.060
but never drifts into mere
mouth pieces for his generation.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.970 position:56%
His personal equation is too strong.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.950
This is a scan of Hindemith's
military passport from 1918

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.910
that the Hindemith
Foundation has digitized,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.210
so it's pretty interesting.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.930
This is that quote
regarding the Debussy --

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.270
So, to describe his
compositional output,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.880
during and around World War One,
there were kind of three groups

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.090 position:56%
that I'm referring to the pieces as.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.450
The first group is vocal chamber
music, which might be voice

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.170
and piano, or voice and chamber
ensemble, multiple instruments.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.010
There's also instrumental music

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.000
that didn't have a specific
program associated with it,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.830
which he had several of; one of
these, is the Andante et Scherzo

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.580
for clarinets, horn and piano,
from 1914, that's his opus one.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.730
That manuscript is lost, there are
three of his works from this period

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.820
that -- which are lost within this
instrumental chamber category.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.990
He composed his first two
string quartets during the war,

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.320
first one in 1915, and
the second one in 1918

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.880
that was one was fully
composed while he was

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.910
out in service in Flanders.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.380
He also composed this
piano quintet in 1917,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.610
a sonata for flute clarinet,
bass clarinet, horn, bassoon

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.370
and string quintet in 1917.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:41.180
Three pieces for cello and piano in
1917, sonata for violin; opus 11-6,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.140
a couple sonatas for violin and
a handful of solo piano works.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.340
Of the orchestral works,
this is very much the least

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.380
of his focus I think,
in this period.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.550
The first orchestra work during
the World War One period,

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:00.390
was the cello concerto in E flat,
opus three, completed in 1915-1916,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.800
a Lustige Sinfoniatta, for small
orchestra opus four, and then,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.650
in the '1920s was really when he
delve into the common music series,

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.950
which I just sort of --

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.740
chamber orchestra or large
chamber ensemble size works.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.450
Which kind of served, I suppose the
more text specific book of works,

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.680
and then his sort of
trying to think of things,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.600
maybe more in the abstract
or be more objective.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.380
There's a lot about
Hindemith that's conflicting,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.690
in terms of what he's trying to do.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.070
So, at the same time, he had
this really kind of dark,

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.560
grim vocal works that were setting
the text of Rocca [phonetic],

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.340
and [inaudible] who we'll get to.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:42.890
He's also trying out instrumental
music that doesn't seem necessarily

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:48.120
to be saying as much, and there
might be reasons for that,

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.360
which we'll get into in a moment.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.120
He also sets interestingly --

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.010
this was the one exception
to this non-cross

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.570
over business between genres.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.280
So, Whitman poetry throughout his
life, and the revolutionary hymn

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.120
which he used, he also
used the same musical theme

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.520
from that vocal setting in
the string quartet, opus 16,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.760
which is interesting I think.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.920
The Rilke poetry that he go into,

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.200
different from the expressionist
folks like [inaudible]

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.600 position:56%
in that it was seeking to go more
after this new objectivity movement,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.020
rather than the expressionist
movement.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.740
So, we have this juxtaposition
of let's look inward,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.240
let's tell our personal experience,
or let's convey the experience

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.880
of a figure in the text, to this
quote and quote, objective music

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.130
that seems to ignore what's
actually going on in society.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.010
And maybe, he's making a
commentary that some parts

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.260
of society ignore what's
actually going on, regardless --

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.320
maybe because their
position in society.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.970
And then, others being much
more directly affected.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.480
One of the great quotes from the
phrasure by [inaudible] from music

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.850
and letters, was that
Hindemith sought to bring art

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.790
down to the level of life and to
raise life to the level of art.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.910
So, there's this constant struggle

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.220
between where the music is being
positioned, in terms of relevance

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.600
for himself, and also
for his audiences.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.110
The specific works that
we're going to get into,

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.930
from the expressionist
period, represent response

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.770
to what encyclopedia
pretend to call the chaos

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.970
and suffering of modern life.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.040
There's a lot of references to
colors, and the texts, which may

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.750
or may not have relevance
to text painting.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.860
But, I think in one of the
songs that we're going to hear,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.780
there's this reference to
the color red, over and over,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.030
throughout the movement, says this
woman becomes completely sucked

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.220
in to the morbidity of
the situation in Germany.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.610
And the red is representing this
figure that's almost like death,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.600
the grim reaper coming in the form

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.150
of a little boy, which
is kind of creepy.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.730
The new objectivity works, are
very much the transition away

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.980
from this expressionist
work that he did.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.030
So, very much from the string
quartets from the '1920s,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:22.300
and then first common music
opus 24 in 1922, and you'll see

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.820
in this sequencing of the
pieces that we're looking at,

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.090
some of the expressionist
stuff was overlapping

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.680
with this new objectivity business.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.870
So, that's that sort of cross
currents happening simultaneously.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.240
Some of the concepts
that Hindemith addresses

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.570
in the World War One text
settings, come up again and again,

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.120
in some of his more famous
works, from later in his career,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.090
including Mathis der
Maler, which tells the story

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.700
of Matthias Grünewald, the
painter, and the Harmonie der Welt,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.920
which tells the story about Kepler.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.170 position:56%
Both of those operas deal with the
conflict of the individual identity,

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.840 position:56%
and the sort of situation of social
upheaval, regardless of the context.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.440
So, I think, Hindemith
throughout his career,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.090
even though he didn't spend all of
his time focusing on social issues

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.110
in his music, there's definitely
this thing about him that sticks

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:20.280 position:56%
to that topic, whether it's specific
to World War One experiences,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.850
whether is revisiting
historical figures,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.660
and seeing how history
repeats itself unfortunately.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.460
And the two figures
that we've chosen

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.320
for those opera settings
were described

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.990
as his two heroes in history.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.950
So, that definitely -- I
think shows that he's thinking

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.150
about these issues
on a long-term basis.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.290
The particular use of the vocal
music, to get across some kind

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.000
of social commentary, is
result of Hindemith's thinking

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.230
that the voice was,
quote, "The most natural

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.580
of music utterances" end quote.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.370
So, there was a definite sense
that he can do something more

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.310
with the vocal music, that he
can with the instrumental music.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.390
OK, do you want to listen to music?

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.700
Yes, great.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.910
Before we do that, this is the
Opera House Orchestra in 1920,

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.810
and I believe this is Hindemith,
right here, where the cursor is,

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.460
just right there, I wonder
if you can see him, but --

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.940
It's just some of the selected
World War One era works,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.120
if you were here early,
the first piece

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.800
that we were playing
was Melancholie opus 13,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.970
and that piece was
dedicated specifically

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.270
to Hindemith's friend Karl Köhler,
who was in service with him

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.750
and was killed in 1918, you
also heard after Melancholie,

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:51.770
[inaudible], which is the setting
for soprano in eight instruments.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:56.780
This uses a text by pod
-- more mid-19th century.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.780
And the first one is in a character
Die Junge Magd, which we're going

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:07.920 position:56%
to listen a lot to, and [inaudible]
kind of veers off into the absurdus,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.060 position:56%
which is really interesting I think.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:17.610
And it gets into talking about
a tree frog, having a mustache,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.270
wild boars, oxes wearing
hats, goose --

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.910
geese on stilts, talking
about that being peculiar sort

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:34.940
of demonic dances, drafts wearing
ties, and flying elephants,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.640
there are references to crocodiles
in the Nile, etcetera, etcetera.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.610
It's kind of -- I'll
place them for you.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.890
It's -- if we want to connect
this work, to World War One,

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.970
my suggestion would be
to think of it as sort

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.510
of representing the craziness
of what was going on.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:25:58.040
[ Music ]

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.860
So, he clearly had a lot
of time on its hands,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.950
while serving in World War One.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:13.150
I think that piece goes to
show that Hindemith's own sort

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.870
of personal emotional
state, was stable enough

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.860
to experience happy things,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.850
and to convey happy emotions while
he could also convey really sort

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.470 position:56%
of depressing, solemn, deathly kinds

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.940
of feelings, as we
will get into now.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.190
So, hold on, for some of that.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.340
The piece that I'd like
to focus on mostly today,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.750
is called the Junge Magd,
it's opus 23 number two,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.270
it lasts about seven minutes
long, and it is comprised --

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:48.050
it consists of six poems,
that ends by Georg Trakl.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.690
Trakl was an Austrian gentleman; he
was born in 1887, and died in 1914,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.690
he served in World War One for
a period as a medical officer,

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.220
dealing with dispensing medication
to people who were injured.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.290
And he kind of had a
history of depression,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.230
and he killed himself unfortunately
in 1914, because he couldn't cope

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.140
with what he was witnessing.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.790
So, that kind of gives a tragic
spin to his poetry, unsurprising,

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.530
and these poems tell the story of
an anonymous young maid who was

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.980
at parallel with the world
filled with destruction, war,

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.880
totalitarian rule -- getting
there -- and also despair.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.560
The poetry is definitely written
in the expressionist movement,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.950
and with here, constructing imagery
and poetic devices that combines

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.290
with text painting and a
haunting musical soundscape,

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.990
to bring the life of sorrows, of
a generation of young Europeans,

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.590
and more broadly Germans
-- excuse me --

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.940 position:56%
Germans, and more broadly Europeans.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.930 position:56%
There is this specific device that
Hindemith uses in each of the songs,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.600
and it's sort of a
cyclical structure,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.940
so the musical material is kind
of revolving around of itself,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.770
and even though he'll have separate
subject figures at certain points,

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.490
one will start, the
second one will start,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.790
then they'll overlap a little bit,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.100
and come back to the
beginning point,

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.990
almost consistently
throughout, which is getting

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:18.490
to that cyclical history,
kind of commentary.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.070
So, you all have a handout,
hopefully, which has some

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.950
of the pages from the Junge
Magd, just to give you a sense.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.660
The basic narrative arch is that
we start out with the maiden,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.620
kind of getting by in life,
dealing with whatever is going on,

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.160
and then she falls apart from
song to song, and by the end,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.610
death has taken her away.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:45.510
Can we kind of see the collapse
-- or hear the collapse.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:56.040
[ Music ]

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.840
Should be the first
page of your handout.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:16.450
[ Music ]

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.510
Translation if up here
if you'd like to see it.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:58.200
[ Music ]

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.280
Right, so I gave you a taste of --
from my listening to this piece,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.790
I hear this movement as
the woman kind of surviving

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.400
and not really recognizing
what's going on,

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.830
outside of her existence
for the sake of coping.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:19.240
There's a lot -- a lot of kind of
interesting things that he does

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.070
with text painting; which we're
not going to get to all of them,

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.810 position:56%
unfortunately, just because of time.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:30.080 position:56%
But, there are moments where he will
insert fluttering figures for --

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.380
for example, in the second verse,

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.090
you see here in the
beeches jackdaws flutter,

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:40.490
and he constructs visualizations
of oral depictions

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.230
of her shadow happening,
or her hair fluttering,

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.320
and rat screaming in
the art, etcetera.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.520
But, what I think it's really
cool about this repertoire

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.320
from Hindemith, is that it is
so gorgeous, in terms of --

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.920
for me at least, the mood
of the music, the writing,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.720
the lyrical writing is
incredible for the voices,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.870
and from my own experience of
people interacting with Hindemith,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.280
I think this period gets
ignored a little bit for a lot

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.830
of his later work, and there are a
lot of things about his later work,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.920
that I think he doesn't
necessarily do in this era.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.670
He's much more concise in here,
it is not about the viola;

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.460
no offense to the viola players.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.620
But, anyways.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.890 position:56%
Then, this is the third verse of the
first piece, "And enticed by decay,

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:26.610
she lowers her inflamed eye
lids, parts grass, indicate bond,

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.190
and bends down to her feet."

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:38.080
In the second song, we get into
the woman being a bit lonely,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.650
she is working in her chamber
whether that's cleaning,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.120
or spinning or something like that.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.470
She's alone, that's the
point of the history.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.380
And the text from [inaudible]
reads, "Silently solemnly,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.140
she works on the chamber, and
the yard lies long desolate.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.420
In the elder tress by the chamber,
a blackbird flutes pitifully.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.220
Silver-ly her image in the
mirror looks at her strangely

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.630
in the twilight-glow, and
dusks sickly in the mirror,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.350 position:56%
and she shutters before its purity".

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.160 position:56%
So, I think the woman is recognizing
there's a change happening

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.870
within herself that is
starting to be apparent.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.420
"Dream like a farm-boy sings in
the dark, and she stares shaken

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.340
with pain, redness stickles through
the dark, suddenly at the gate,

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.770
the south wind shakes", this is
the first instance in the cycle,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:31.720
where you hear the reference to the
color red, and also, the farm-boy,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.380
maybe representing innocence of
young people going to have to war,

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.200
but in fact, while they seem
so familiar and charming,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.800
they are killing each
other, which is depressing,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.500
and they'll probably come for her.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:49.370
In the -- in that same song,
Hindemith uses a rhythmic motive,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.920
to depict the shaking, and he does
that throughout all of the songs,

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.410
any descriptive word or additive,
or whatever he's doing --

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.210
there is a motive that can
be associated with that.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.950
And so, shaking comes back
a lot through the songs;

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.680
he doesn't necessarily
use the same figure,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.410
but he uses something
that's very obvious

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.700
to the listener that
can be identified.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.000
All right.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.030
The third piece in the cycle,
which you have the first page of,

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.210
start off with the clarinet.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.510
Let's get that up for you.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.640
So, in the text here, which
I'll plug in a second,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.300 position:56%
it describes the woman having
fever's dreams, and there's all kind

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.750 position:56%
of stuff going on outside, that sort
of the background to her experience.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:51.510
And grudgingly the
morning comes back.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:34:32.140
[ Music ]

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.440
This is the second verse text now.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.470
You can kind of hear this
representation of exhaustion,

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.510
where it's just like a gas
up there, it's healing.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:35:00.610
[ Music ]

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.520
There in the world Earth,
it's sudden a darker,

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.260
more grounded, rich kind of sound.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.560
OK, great.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:23.240
On the fourth song, this
is now the woman woken

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.600
up from whatever the situation was,
or her body sort of being there,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:32.630 position:56%
reacting to the feverish
experience, and what is coming next.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:38.530
Lengthily sprawled out
on the bed -- oh, no.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.630
I spoiled the story, sorry.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.710
The hammer clinging is now, right?

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.920
So, this smithy or smith claims
that he hanged up his hammer,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.200
and she scurries past
the gate, "In red glow,

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.380
the farm-boy swings the hammer, and
death like, she looks over there,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.230
as in the dream, she's struck
by his laughter, and she tumbles

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.650
into the smithies smile, childly
cringing before his laughter,

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.770
like the hammer hard and course.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.660
Brightly in the room, sparks spray,

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.360
and with helpless gestures she
snatches after the wild sparks,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.440
and falls daze to the earth."

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.800
So, there's something about
the boy, and this kind of red

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.100
and fire imagery that
is pulling her forward,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.900
perhaps not on her own will,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.140
which probably quite
obviously represents death.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.760
And this is kind of the harshest
songs that ends in the cycle.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.300
I'll give you a taste of it.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.100
Loop.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:37:19.040
[ Music ]

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.110
So, there's' a big
transition incoming --

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.410
this transition is kind of back

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.510
to the dream state,
a recollection of it.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:38.040
[ Music ]

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:44.120
The rhythm is almost that
corner sort of craze laughter,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.920
or nervous laughter I think.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:38:11.040
[ Music ]

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.510 position:56%
This is now third verse, coming back
to the opening figure of the hammer.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:39:28.130
[ Music ]

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.680
That's another word that
ends with the word Earth,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.510
and the descent in
pitch, which is --

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.140
I'll get that, yes.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.240
So, the fifth song, which I'm not
going to play any off, gets into --

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.050
this is the imagery of her being
in the bed, "Lengthily sprawled

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.240
out on the bed, she wakes
filled with sweet trembling,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.320
and she sees her soil bed,
hidden by a golden light.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.530
Mignonettes there at the window,
and the blueish brightness of sky,

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.900
sometimes the wind carries to the
window a bell's hesitant tinkling.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.260
Shadows glide over the
pillow, noon strides lowly,

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.740
and she breaths heavily
on the pillow,

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.780
and her mouth is like a wound".

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:15.410 position:56%
Then in the last song, number six,
"in the evening bloody lemons float,

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.960
clouds over silent forests that
are wrapped in black linens,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.490 position:56%
sparrows buzz in the fields, and she
lies completely white in darkness,

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:27.700
under the foot, a cueing wasp
away, like a carrion in bush,

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.710
in darkness flies world
around her mouth."

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:37.440
Kind of dark stuff happening at
the same time as sort of reference

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.390
of her being white, which yes, it's
her being dead probably, or ill,

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.740
but at the same time, white is
representing pure things, right?

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.630
So, there's this juxtaposition
of the light and the darkness,

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:56.870
with the golden light that it's
mentioned in the previous one.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.790
And the carrion refers to
kind of carcasses stuff,

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.720
which is unpleasant, so if
you imagine that swirling

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.090
around someone's mouth, "And
dream like in the brown hamlet,

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:12.030
a sound of dance and fiddle
echoes, floats are continents

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.410
through the hamlet, blows
her hair in their branches."

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:20.970
We'll have you just
listen to this last song.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.790
Too perky.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.030
Thinking the good ones represent
sort of the innocence and purity,

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.690
which I'm actually happy about.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:54.510
History not so much, and
there, the strings are muted.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:45:37.210
[ Music ]

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.080
So, kind of an interesting ending.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:44.710
The use of the lower range of
the clarinet, and then the cello

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:48.030
at the end, I think it's going back
to this figure that he was using

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.020
in other songs, where it's
the Earth and everything going

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.930 position:56%
down at the bottom, and this perhaps
it's her returning to the Earth,

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:58.700
or going somewhere else
after the death experience.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.980
The little -- turned
at happy at the end,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.780
I think it's probably
indicative of hopefulness,

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.920
and a sense that the
despair can be overcome,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.280
which is certainly something
that Hindemith had to face,

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.890
on its own personal level,
in a very significant way,

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.930
to lead up to World War Two.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.350
But, how do we connect all
of this to the library?

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.430
This definitely gives
you a sense of what kind

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.260
of things were happening
creatively in music

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.740
with Europeans composers
during World War One,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.980
and in the period right after it,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.750
it was not something
they could really ignore,

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.260
even if they were trying to.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.330
Just in terms of the text they
were choosing to work with,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.400
and in terms of what was
going on in their own lives.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.110
If your father just died in
combat, you'd be in a strange --

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.300
I'm sure that's going to have some
kind of effect in your psyche.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:52.510
And then, his own service, and
the evolution of its beliefs

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.480
about the war, and German
positioning, politically.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:04.020
So, Hindemith came to know,
"This is college, yes."

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.740
This is the best time to Tweet
about the Library, right?

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.770
So, Miss Cullage [phonetic] and
Hindemith first became acquainted

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.590
through correspondence, and
through Hindemith submission

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:18.220
for a commission competition
that she used to run

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.960
at the Berkshire Festival
that she created -- this is --

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.790
contemporary to her having started
the series here in the library,

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.700
and this is referring to
the '1930s specifically.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.470
Hindemith, made his USA debut
performing his own repertoire,

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.570
with some ensembles
here at the Library,

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.270
doing the eight Cullage Festival
in 1937, right next door,

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.200
and we have -- oh, I
stopped to put it out --

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.010
the design program from that
concert, which is really cool,

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.610
so I'll put that up in a second.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.900
And then, the relationship
continued as you can see in some

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.970
of the correspondence over here,
and Hindemith was commissioned

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.040
by Miss Cullage on several
occasions, both by her privately,

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.630
and by the foundation that
was already at the Library.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.990
And the significant one that the
Library commission was his Ballet

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:08.020
Hérodiade, which was performed
on the same performance

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.860
as [foreign language] when it
debut in 1944, so it's pretty cool.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.520
This is the new review of some the
treasures related to Hindemith,

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.130
that are here and most of
them are on view for you.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.150
And the Cullage Foundation
Commissions

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.850
and Scores included Canona Tray
[phonetic], which is a gift score

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:30.810
to Miss Cullage, the ballet
commission Hérodiade from '44.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:37.260
Quasi-piano concerto worked
all concert music for piano,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.960
[foreign language] which
was the personal commission

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.750
that Miss Cullage paid for.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:47.310
And then, a gift of a set
of songs, to all texts,

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:48.930
which are here in the bottom left.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:53.020
The other archive that has
a lot of Hindemith's stuff,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.220
is the Moldenar Archives [phonetic]
I haven't gotten enough in depth,

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.250
to know if Hindemith was
selling stuff to the Moldenars

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:03.490
of if he was gifting it
to them for other reasons,

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.540 position:56%
but there are some things over there
that are as mundane as envelopes,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.890
in which Hindemith sent
goodies to the Moldenars,

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.970
which I find interesting, because
there are old stamps on there,

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:20.080
and German look posts down
below, as well as some telegrams,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.280
and a little gift compositions
that he made for Miss Cullage

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.310
on her birthday; there's one in
a box, that's literally composed

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.420
on the box, and there's
another one which is

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.250
in a piece paper, which
is kind of cool.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:37.900
Published edition of [foreign
language] which we heard,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:43.300
and there's a series of letters
between Hindemith and Miss Cullage,

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.410
about the 1930 commission
for that piano work,

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:48.460
starting from the telegrams
in the left,

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.810
were he is offered the
commission and he accepts,

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:55.620
and going on the exchange of money,
there is the deposit check for some

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.460
of the funds there,
which is kind of cool.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.380
And then, in the second table
there's correspondence relating

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.080
to the ballet commission,

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.360
and the library's correspondence
with him about that.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.120
This is just a small sampling of
the correspondence that exists.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.070
So, there's a lot of interesting
stuff to delve into there.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.840
So, in summary, we had a little
exploration of Hindemith,

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.380
as a World War One musical figure.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.850
We looked at some of its works
on a broad scope, and then,

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:26.150 position:56%
we looked at a couple of them,
especially the Junge Magd in detail.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:29.100
My hope for you is that
this is picked some interest

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.060
in the World War One period,
and also in the musicians

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.090
and the artists that were
interacting with the time.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.820
And hopefully, make
you even more eager

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.290
to go see the new exhibit
that's opening in April.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.010
Now, granted that the exhibits

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.890
that the library is doing are
slanted towards the American

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.350
participation in the war.

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:48.740
I think with figures like
Hindemith, who became so integral

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.500 position:56%
to American musical life in the
20th century, because he lived there

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.670
and taught here, and
because he had a relationship

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.280
with the Library, I think.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.980
If he used this to think about
the World War I involvement

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.400
of the United States
as more than just

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.200
when the troops went over there.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.270
And that is that.

of the Library of Congress.
