00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.880
Handsome Jack is buying
a pony made of diamonds.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.870
The price of the
pony is P dollars.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.410
And Jack also has to pay
a 25% diamond pony tax.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.650
Match the expressions to their
meaning for Handsome Jack.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.050
And they say
multiple expressions

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.520
may fit the same description.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.570
So in this bucket, we have
the price of the diamond

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.659
pony before tax.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.200
Well, they already tell us that
the price of the diamond pony

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.680
is P dollars.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.689
So that's P right over here.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.990
Now over here, they say the
amount of tax Handsome Jack

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.030
pays.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.940
Well, he pays a 25%
diamond pony tax.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.880
So whatever the price is,
he's going to pay 25% of that.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.380
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.120
he's going to pay 25% is
the same thing as 0.25.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.010
So 0.25 times P is
the amount of tax

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.550
he's going to pay on
this diamond pony.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.570
Now, they say Handsome
Jack's total bill

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.260
for the diamond pony.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.459
Well, he's going to pay P for
the pony plus 0.25P in taxes.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.290
So that is this one
right over here.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.750
P for the pony plus
0.25P for the taxes.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.690
So that's that one over there.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.240
But if we look at this, you
could view this literally as 1P

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.720
plus 0.25P's.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.480
Well, that's the
same thing as 1.25P.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.680
So that's the same thing
as this right over here.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.610
So it's 1.25P.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.410
And these other three
don't seem to fit

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.640
in any of these categories.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.050
So I'm going to put
it into the not used.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.920
We're required to
categorize everything.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420
So let me put this
in the not used.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.280
It's falling off the
screen, I realize.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.030
Let me put this in the not used.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.010
And then let me put
this in the not used.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.070
Let's check our answer.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.930
We got it right.
