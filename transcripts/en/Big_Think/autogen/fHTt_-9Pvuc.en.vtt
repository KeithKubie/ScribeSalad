involved one of the big challenges in
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760
involved one of the big challenges in
providing services is that most schools

providing services is that most schools

it's very very rare for colleges to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
it's very very rare for colleges to
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.260
it's very very rare for colleges to
charge for the mental health services of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
charge for the mental health services of
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760

course students and their parents would
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.700
course students and their parents would
say they're charging plenty already

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710
say they're charging plenty already
 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.490

but services are usually provided

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
but services are usually provided
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830
but services are usually provided
without extra cost to the students and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
without extra cost to the students and
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.590
without extra cost to the students and
that creates a real challenge for the

that creates a real challenge for the
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140
that creates a real challenge for the
schools to balance the cost and benefit

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
schools to balance the cost and benefit

teens often haven't had the greatest
 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.410
teens often haven't had the greatest
experiences because they've often

need treatment into the system is often

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
need treatment into the system is often
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880
need treatment into the system is often
a very very significant challenge and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
a very very significant challenge and
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.920
a very very significant challenge and
then it's a challenge for the system to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
then it's a challenge for the system to
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469
then it's a challenge for the system to
have the resources the personnel the the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
have the resources the personnel the the
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.780

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.640
the one thing we do know is that college

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650
the one thing we do know is that college
 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770
the one thing we do know is that college
students drink more alcohol than their

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780
students drink more alcohol than their
 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.450

non college attending 18 to 25 year old

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460
non college attending 18 to 25 year old
 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.210
non college attending 18 to 25 year old
cohort so clearly we know that college

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
cohort so clearly we know that college
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.610
cohort so clearly we know that college
is a risk factor for increase in alcohol

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
is a risk factor for increase in alcohol
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.310
is a risk factor for increase in alcohol
use and there are a series of problems

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320
use and there are a series of problems
 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.490
use and there are a series of problems
that are coincident with that and that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
that are coincident with that and that
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.650
that are coincident with that and that
does present a serious concern we know

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660
does present a serious concern we know
 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.260
does present a serious concern we know
about a third of college students will

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
about a third of college students will
 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.810
about a third of college students will
report an alcohol binge every two weeks

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
report an alcohol binge every two weeks
 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.840
report an alcohol binge every two weeks
or so so that's a really significant

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
or so so that's a really significant
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.550
or so so that's a really significant
number and we know that there there are

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
number and we know that there there are
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.890
number and we know that there there are
a lot of negative consequences

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
a lot of negative consequences
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.950
a lot of negative consequences
associated with especially the the high

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960
associated with especially the the high
 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.140
associated with especially the the high
intensity drinking that sometimes goes

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
intensity drinking that sometimes goes
 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.930
intensity drinking that sometimes goes
on we know that their fights that occur

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
on we know that their fights that occur
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.370
on we know that their fights that occur
obviously car accidents that occur and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
obviously car accidents that occur and
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.840
obviously car accidents that occur and
unfortunately there's been tremendous

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
unfortunately there's been tremendous
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.180
unfortunately there's been tremendous
concern recently about the increasing
