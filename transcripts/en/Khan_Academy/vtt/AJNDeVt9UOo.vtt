00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.820
A local hospital is holding
a raffle as a fundraiser.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.390
The individual cost of
participating in the raffle

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.810
is given by the following
expression-- 5t plus 3,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.610
or 5 times t plus 3,
where t represents

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.320
the number of tickets
someone purchases.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.330
Evaluate the expression when t
is equal to 1, t is equal to 8,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.790
and t is equal to 10.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.620
So let's first
take the situation

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.530
where t is equal to 1.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.360
Then this expression
right over here

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.750
becomes-- and I'll use that
same color-- becomes 5 times 1.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
5 times 1 plus 3.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
5 times 1 plus 3, and we know
from order of operations,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.640
you do the multiplication
before you do the addition.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
So this will be 5
times 1 is 5 plus 3,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.300
and then this is
clearly equal to 8.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.360
Now let's do it when
t is equal to 8.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.300
So when t is equal to 8,
this expression becomes--

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:16.990
and I'll do the same colors
again-- 5 times 8 plus 3.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.690
Same color of green.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.650
And once again, 5 times 8 is
40, and then we have the plus 3,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.730
there so this is equal to 43.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.270
And so we have the
last situation,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.900
with t is equal to 10.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.440
I'll do that in blue.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.660
So we have 5 times 10.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.670
So 5t is 5 times 10.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.330
Instead of a t, put a 10 there.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.249
5 times 10 plus 3.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.040
That's a slightly
different shade of green,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.248
but I think you get the idea.

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:52.970
5 times 10 is 50.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.310
We do 50, and then we're going
to have to add 3 to that,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.400
and that is equal to 53.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.190
And we're done.
