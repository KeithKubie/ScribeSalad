00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:01.644
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.644 --> 00:00:03.563
I'd like to bring up the
idea of the difference

00:00:03.563 --> 00:00:07.245
between a common and a proper noun.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.740
So the difference between a common

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.878
and a proper noun is simply

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:12.056
the difference between
something with a name

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:15.111
and a more generic version of that thing.

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:17.549
I'll give you a couple of
examples right off the bat.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:21.090
So speaking generally, I am from a city.

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:26.468
The specific city that
I'm from is Chicago.

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.953
I could talk about a frog generally,

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:33.885
but if I were speaking of a specific frog,

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.720
I would say Kermit.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.665
The difference between a
common and a proper noun

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.770
is merely the difference
between a general thing,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.967
so this side is more general,

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.031
and a specific thing.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.649
It's a continuum.

00:00:55.663 --> 00:01:00.637
So if you are speaking
of, let's see, a river,

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.859
any old river, that's a common noun,

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.639
but if you're talking
about a specific river,

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:07.420
and it's a named river here,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.202
that would be the Nile, say.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:13.783
You could talk about a mountain,

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.186
and that would be a common noun,

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:18.755
because there are many mountains,

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:20.717
but if you wanted to talk
about a specific mountain,

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:22.695
say Mount Kilimanjaro,

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:26.649
in Tanzania,

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:28.995
that's a proper noun.

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:31.410
So here are the properties
of proper nouns.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.463
Proper nouns are always capitalized.

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:41.099
And that means that instead of using

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.850
a little letter A like that,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.519
you would instead use a
big letter A like that.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:48.691
Common nouns are only capitalized

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.039
if you find them at the
beginning of sentences.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.962
So you might say,

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:04.818
"Mountains are my favorite."

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.881
But you would also say, "Kilimanjaro

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.945
"is my favorite

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:22.929
"mountain."

00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:31.550
And that is a lowercase,
non-capitalized M,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.810
as opposed to this one,
which is uppercase.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.700
So that's the difference between common

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.847
and proper nouns.

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:39.205
If you're talking about something general,

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.382
it's a common noun.

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:42.012
If you're talking about
something specific,

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:43.461
it's a proper noun,

00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:44.819
and the difference between them is

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.137
that you capitalize a proper noun.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:49.845
You can learn anything.

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:50.970
David out.
