00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.899
Modern computing is riddled with stories of
gender bias, boys toys and even wartime successes

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.710
for the likes of men… but what about women?*
Without Lady Ada

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:17.590
Hey computer-lovers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.199
We live in a world where we interact with
computers all.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.199
the.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.199
time.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710
And I’m not just talking about your smart
phone... computer systems are in everything;

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.250
cars, air conditioners, washing machines.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
But without the mathematical curiosity of
this woman and a chance encounter she had

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.730
at a party, we might not be here now.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.629
This is Augusta Ada Byron, the Countess of
Lovelace -- but most just call her Ada Lovelace.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.649
She was one of the first computer programmers,
but was born in 1815; wayyy before computers

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.280
as we know them were invented.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.200
At the time, during the Industrial Revolution,
new inventions were happening left and right,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.969
but they were usually used for one thing.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.680
Sewing machines, sewed.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.540
Steam engines powered a factory.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.519
But with one mathematical invention, and a
single academic paper, Lovelace cemented herself

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.490
in the history of computer programming.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.440
Ada's mother encouraged her to study mathematics
as a child, hoping to drive her away from

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.640
the unpredictable poetic ambitions of her
father, the English romantic poet Lord Byron.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.560
She merged her creative and analytical ambitions
designing boats and flying machines.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.570
But it wasn’t until she met Charles Babbage
a professor of mathematics at Cambridge that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.390
she began to express her mathematical intellect.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.980
Babbage had an idea for a calculating machine,
called the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.480
Analytical Engine, Lovelace's interest was
piqued, and the two started a correspondence.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.520
The thing is, Lovelace had no real training
as a mathematician.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.990
So by corresponding with Babbage and other
mathematicians, she hoped to learn as much

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.990
as she could.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.550
Eventually, an Italian engineer,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.360
Luigi Federico Menabrea wrote a paper on Babbage's
analytical engine in French.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.190
Lovelace knew French, so spent months translating,
and notating Menabrea's paper.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.750
In the end, her notes were three times longer
than the actual work, and she understood the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.690
workings and possibilities of the Analytical
Engine better than Babbage, it's inventor!

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.479
What's more, within her super-detailed 'Notes'
she created a way for the Engine to calculate

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.399
Bernoulli numbers… in steps.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.820
I know that doesn't seem like much, but that
was the invention of the first computer program!

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.220
And even before the digital computer we know
today was invented, Lovelace understood its

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.870
power, and limitations, writing, “[The Analytical
Engine] can do whatever we know how to order

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.870
it to perform.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.390
It can follow analysis; but it has no power
of anticipating any analytical relations or

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.350
truths."

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.290
Lovelace pushed the idea of the Engine's abilities
beyond simple number-crunching and into actual

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.290
"computing!"

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.290
This was the 19th-century, though.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.810
Another mathematician wrote a series of letters
to Lovelace's mother, expressing concern that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.590
women, because they weren't as physically
strong, shouldn't exert themselves so heavily

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.840
in the area of scholarly application.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.510
He was obviously very wrong about the physiology
of men, women and their ability to study math,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.610
but, ironically, Lovelace did die of cancer
at age 36.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.720
Regardless of some criticism, because of Lovelace's
translation and 'Notes' on the Analytical

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.100
Engine, and her correspondence with other
mathematicians, people began to think of these

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.740
machines as more than just a hulk of single
function engineering.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.880
Even though she was never formally trained,
other mathematicians of the day thought highly

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.590
of Lovelace's work, and her 'Notes' and the
translated paper was published in Taylor's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.980
Scientific Memoirs with only her initials
"A.A.L.".

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.900
Over the next 100 years, Babbage's name wore
on, but Lovelace's was relatively obscure…

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.440
until the 1940s.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.740
Today, computer programs are running everywhere
we look, and some of them can even be written

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.250
in a programming language called 'Ada.'

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.890
Lovelace was the first realize that a computer,
a machine, a series of switches... could do

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.430
something way more complicated than any one
thing.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.400
With the brain of both an artist and a mathematician,
Ada Lovelace showed us all what a computer

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:14.130
could be.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.989
Any other scientists, engineers, researchers
or people we should profile?
