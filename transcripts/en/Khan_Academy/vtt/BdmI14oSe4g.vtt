00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.350
I tried recording this possible
solution to the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.330
bailout video just now, but
apparently the sound went bad

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.050
so I just restarted my computer,
so hopefully I won't

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.030
turn into slow motion
man again.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.300
Well, anyway, the whole
discussion so far has been

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.070
focused on how did the credit
crisis get started, and why

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.920
the card bailout proposal,
one, is wrong from just a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.100
moral hazard and fairness point
of view, and why it

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.330
probably won't work even
to begin with.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.100
So, you know, why
even go into it?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.210
And some of you all said, well,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.330
what could be a solution?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.160
And I've argued a little bit
in the wealth destruction

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700
video that you really can't
legislate against reality.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.960
That you kind of have to
let things correct.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170
You cannot create wealth
just by passing bills.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.320
All you can kind of do
is shuffle around

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.600
who takes the losses.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.810
But in one of the videos, I
argued that if the government

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.380
was serious about helping Main
Street, about loans to Main

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.290
Street, why don't they lend
directly to Main Street?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.580
And I kind of said it a little
bit flippantly that if that

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.040
was their intention, that's what
they should do with the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.300
$700 billion.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.575
And I got an email from a friend
from business school, a

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:08.990
very intelligent fellow who I
respect very much, and he has

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.980
a solution that I think
is essentially that.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.200
Loan directly to Main Street.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.190
Don't bail out these people
who have already acted

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.430
extremely irresponsibly and
essentially write them checks

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.940
from American taxpayers.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.330
And his suggestion is, instead
of buying worthless assets,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.460
why not create new banks fully
capitalized by the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.770
government-- but you might not
even have to capitalize them--

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.000
and let those banks lend
directly to Main Street?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.540
And he makes a very
interesting point.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.160
He says -- let me make sure that
I can fit all of this.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.561
And I don't know if
you can read it.

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.290
I want this to all fit.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.070
But he makes the interesting
point.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.610
$700 billion of capital -- this
is his email that he sent

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.130
to me -- with $700 billion of
equity, this is more book

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.160
equity, and therefore more
lending power, than Bank of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.150
America, J.P.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.140
Morgan, Citigroup, Washington
Mutual, Wachovia, Goldman

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.490
Sachs, and Morgan Stanley
combined.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.500
So combine these institutions,
which are really the pillars

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.770
of our financial system,
they represent $619

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.900
billion of book equity.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.290
And remember, this is
their book equity.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.740
This is what they say is the
book value of their assets.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.100
But we've already learned that
they're probably being

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.490
overstated, and that's why we
have to go and buy them at

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.160
prices more than what
they're worth.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.240
But this -- just to get an idea
how large of a dollar

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.200
amount this is -- this $700
billion is more than what

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.230
these banks say they're worth.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.150
It's probably several
multiples of what

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.040
they really are worth.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.390
Some of these banks probably
aren't worth anything.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390
And as it points out, the new
bank would have no prior

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.870
committed loans, so the
incremental amount of lending

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.250
available would be
much larger.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.040
Which means you are not lending
into a black hole.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
When you lend money or you
essentially give money to one

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.420
of these banks that have
all of these other bad

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.090
liabilities, your money's
essentially just being poured

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.050
into a black hole and there's no
assurance that that bank is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.010
going to go and then lend that
money to other people, and go

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.830
to main street.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.660
But if you inject it into
a bank with a completely

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.570
pristine balance sheet, a new
bank -- you could call it you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.610
know the Bank of Washington,
the Bank of Jefferson.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.690
And I would actually recommend
having multiple banks, just so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.050
you have competition and you
don't have that too big to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.360
fail problem.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.070
But these banks, they would have
pristine balance sheets,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.320
and they would go out and make
loans, and they would go out

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.880
and make loans wherever
it is most prudent.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.790
And he says, you know, this
accomplishes the goal of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.580
injecting lending capital into
the system without creating

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.100
the moral hazard problem, and at
the end of a few years, the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.910
government will probably be able
to IPO sell the bank for

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.530
more than one times book value,
which will include the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.070
original $700 billion,
generating a substantial

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.070
profit to the taxpayer.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.820
Exactly.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.920
In fact, they could either do
that, the government could own

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.880
it and then try to IPO it in
five years or so, like Todd

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.940
suggests, or another option is
maybe each of these banks--

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.180
maybe the bank takes $700
billion and creates 10 banks

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.420
that each have $70 billion in
initial equity capital.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.850
And maybe the government issues
300 million shares of

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.450
each of those banks, and every
American man, woman, and child

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.040
gets one share of each
of those banks.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.220
I think that would have a very
powerful political statement.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.890
And it actually would
make economic sense.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.700
All of a sudden you would have
the American people are now

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.650
the owners of the banking
system, instead of this

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.850
concentrated wealth that's
really formed over the past

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.150
150 years in the old
banking system.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.820
And then, you know, he
goes on to point

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.230
out some other things.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.510
Sure, the more current banks
would fail probably quicker,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.860
and we all know that's
a good thing.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.980
What happened in Japan?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.740
What happened in Japan is we
kept infusing capital into--

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.390
well, we didn't, the Japanese
government kept infusing-- or

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.730
either did it themselves or
coaxed other people to infuse

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.140
capital into banks that were
essentially zombie banks, that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.270
were insolvent, and
just slowed down.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.900
It slowed down the downfall, and
essentially led to their

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.480
lost decade.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.580
So he says, you know, more banks
would fail, but many of

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.550
them probably would be deserve
to fail, and the financial

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.400
system would be preserved.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.810
I agree with him completely.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.240
If the new bank wants to
lend new money to new

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.910
borrowers, it can.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.380
Or if it thinks it will make
more money buying up old

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.000
loans, like the CDOs or the
residential mortgage backed

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.850
securities, at a deep discount,
it can do this too.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.670
But it will be making a clear
economic profit decision.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.290
And I'd add-- just so that we
make sure that the management

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.700
of these new entities, so that
they are aligned with

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.000
profit-making as opposed to
bailing out their own previous

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.190
past bad decisions, or bailing
out the people who they used

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.300
to work with-- I would
try to not put these

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.290
banks in New York.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.620
Maybe you put them in Detroit
and New Orleans and Stockton,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.580
California, which is the
foreclosure capital of the

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.830
world, of the country.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.510
Put them in places that are
separate from Wall Street.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.800
Hire very intelligent people
who have some distance from

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.020
what has happened the last five,
six years in Michigan.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.200
And I'll tell you, there are
tons and tons of very

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.040
competent, very intelligent
managers who understand these

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.000
issues deeply in this country.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.380
Unfortunately, a lot of
them haven't been

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.420
heads of banks lately.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.550
And they would be happy to work
for something less than

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.910
$20 million a year.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.240
In fact, I think many of
them would do it out

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.940
of patriotic duty.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.900
But you could pay them $100
thousand a year, and then you

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.660
could say, you know what?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.420
You, as the new employees of
these new American banks that

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.090
are owned by the American
people-- and they can be

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.150
traded on an exchange, so it's
essentially immediately

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.520
privatized.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.755
It's never owned by
the government.

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:28.730
It's immediately owned by the
private sector, by the

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.690
American people, not
by the government.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.510
When I say American people,
it's literally owned by

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.190
private individuals, not
by the government.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.290
But you can actually create an
incentive structure, that

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.230
whatever the equity value of
your company is five years

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.090
out, you all, as the employees,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.970
share 1% of the benefit.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.560
And that's actually a huge
number, that actually

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.280
might be too much.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.000
But you'll be able to hire
excellent managers, especially

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.720
considering how many people
are getting laid off right

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.750
now, very intelligent people
because of bad, risky

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.130
decisions made by others.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.440
But then he finishes up, I
recognize this will be less

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.450
politically popular among
banking lobbyists, but see it

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.050
as a much better way to, one,
protect the financial system--

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.240
I agree with him completely--
two, minimize the risk,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.120
maximize the reward to
the U.S. government.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.000
And he welcomes any comments,
criticisms. And I think it's

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.450
interesting, he started off
the idea, he says, "The

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.060
problem is this sort of plan
would be political suicide,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.370
with key financial donors to
political campaigns." And

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.270
that's true.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.860
Unfortunately-- I think this
is a good idea, but I think

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.130
the current old banking system
has a much more receptive ear

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.470
of our government unfortunately,
than I, or

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.940
Todd, or frankly the American
people seem to have right now.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.600
But anyway, I was kind of
parsing Todd's email.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.950
Let me actually draw out a plan
of what this would be.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:01.170
So you take $700 billion-- and
let me write that out-- 700,

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.840
that's thousand, that's million,
that's billion.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.830
You take that $700 billion,
and you-- I don't know, I

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.340
think the more banks
the better.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.370
You want competition.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.960
You don't want to have this
too big to fail problem.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.720
So you take that $700 billion,
and the first time I recorded

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.340
this video, I said you
put it in 10 banks.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.340
But, I don't know, let's put it
in-- let's see, 700 divided

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.800
by 10 banks would be
$70 billion each.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.390
If you do what?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.049
If you do 70 banks, you would
have $10 billion each.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.090
So let's do that.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.120
Put it in 70 different banks.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.370
70 different banks.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.049
Or maybe do it in 50 different
banks, one bank for each state

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.070
of the country.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.000
70 different banks.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.440
I mean, that sounds crazy, but
when you think about what the

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.670
government was originally--

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.020
Actually, let's do 50 banks.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.310
I like the sound of that.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.660
One bank in every
state, right?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.180
And they're not all concentrated
in New York, and

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.740
they're not, you know, so
you get fresh thought,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.780
fresh blood in them.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.760
And they might actually hire
people that are getting laid

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.680
off in the manufacturing sector
or the real estate

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.030
sector or whatever.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.410
You take 50 different banks.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.970
You capitalize them
each with what?

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:19.990
50 goes into 700 billion
14 times?

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.240
Right.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.220
14, let's see, 15 -- right,
goes in 14 times.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.450
So you capitalize them each
with $14 billion, so their

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.920
balance sheets are going
to look like this.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.500
Equity-- this is each bank-- $14
billion of initial equity.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.200
And they're going to have
300 million shares,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.480
one for every American.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.210
And if they don't like
the holding shares,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.210
they can sell them.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.100
They'll all IPO on
the exchanges.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.780
And then these will be member
banks of the Fed.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.550
And so they'll be regulated,
but they can

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.350
lever up 10 to one.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.330
So they can, let's say with $14
billion of assets, each of

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.060
these banks can control $100--
with $14 billion of equity,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.560
each of these banks can control

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.790
$140 billion of assets.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.200
Which, essentially, that's $140
billion that they can

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.250
lend out to the world.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.800
If they see good returns, good
economic investment in Main

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.220
Street, they'll do it there.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.080
If they think that some of the
existing banks are actually

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.780
good credit risks, that they
could lend maybe to J.P.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.630
Morgan, or Bank of America,
they'll do it.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.330
Maybe they won't do it at 6%
like the Fed wants them to, or

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.440
at 2%, or whatever, they'll say
that's a little risky, or

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.875
maybe I'll do it
at 10% or 12%.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:34.110
And this is another side note
I'd like to say, it seems like

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.640
the Fed is getting frustrated
that it wants to dictate that

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.850
banks have to lend to each
other at 2%, but they're

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.010
willing to only lend to
each other at 6%.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.340
And so it's losing control over
that notion of what banks

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.390
lend to each other at.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.950
6% is still low.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.370
If I have to lend money to
someone who could go under

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.930
next week, I want at
least 12% or 15%.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.090
And I don't think that's
a crazy interest rate.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.330
That's what people were paying
in the early '80s, and they

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.680
weren't talking about financial

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.460
Armageddon back then.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.845
But anyway, each of these banks
would have $140 billion

00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:06.170
in assets, and then-- I don't
know, how much in liability?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.790
Let's see, 140 minus 14 is $124
billion in liabilities.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.600
And they would be very
easy to borrow money.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.770
These banks would have an easy
time borrowing money from a

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.940
bunch of different people.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.740
And why is that?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.850
Well, one, they have completely

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.820
pristine balance sheets.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.570
No one worries about what kind
of stinky things they have on

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.500
this side, because it's
all new investments.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.100
And then if the government
really wants to make sure that

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.460
these banks get off the ground
running, they can make them a

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.770
temporary government
back stop on it.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.440
So essentially, they could
be government-sponsored

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.580
enterprises, but not
indefinitely.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.490
We don't want a Fanny Mae,
Freddie Mac again.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.560
You could say five year
government back stop.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.840
Which essentially says, if you
lend to these banks over the

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.000
next five years, anyone lending
to these banks over

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.540
the next five years, if for
whatever reason these banks

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.760
were to go under you
will be made whole.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.910
So there's literally no risk to
investing in these banks.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:08.470
And frankly, frankly, if just
this five year government back

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.240
stop on these banks, I think
will encourage people to

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.280
invest equity in these banks,
and the government might not

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.470
even have to put these $14
billion in each bank.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.710
But anyway, I've run
out of time.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.980
I'll continue this in
the next video.
