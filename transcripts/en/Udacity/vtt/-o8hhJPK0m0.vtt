00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
Hi, I'm Markus Philips.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.440
I'm the Dean and Co-Founder of Hack Reactor an immersion school for

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.820
software engineering in San Francisco.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.440
We developed an outcome driven and

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.130
data driven approach to education called Rapid Iteration Teaching.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.310
I like to think of myself as the educational equivalent of Brad Pitt in

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.019
Money Ball, but it may be more accurate to compare me to Joanna Hill.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.780
Before founding Hack Reactor, I led technical training initiatives at Twitter,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.950
worked on their back-end anti-spam systems and led the front-end framework team.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.320
I left Twitter at the end of 2012 to start Hack Reactor and the rest is history.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.620
Every second counts during an immersive program and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.400
our team has put a ton of thought into the materials that you'll be seeing here.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.330
This course covers the first four days of Hack Reactors 12 week curriculum.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.330
So you'll be getting a taste of the hyper fast learning that leads our students

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.830
to a 99% placement rate.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.860
I consider these lessons the most important fundamental material you can

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.550
have under your belt, before moving towards employment in any JavaScript stack.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.530
So whether you're new to JavaScript programming or

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.880
you've already found it confusing for years.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.730
Together, we're going to find out just how clear and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.510
easy it can be when you approach it the right way.
