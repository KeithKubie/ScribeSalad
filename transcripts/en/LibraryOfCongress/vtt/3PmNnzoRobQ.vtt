&gt;&gt; From Library of
Congress in Washington, DC

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Good
Morning, and thank you very much,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.100
and my thanks to the Library
of Congress and co chair

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.110
of this festival David Rubenstien.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.580
I'm Mike Oreskes from
NPR news and I'm going

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.130
to be your interviewer
today, because we're really,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.480
it's a very special day, because we
have Edwidge Danticat, the memoirs,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.980
novelists, chronicler
of the diaspora,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.040
and author of young
adult novels as well.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.360
And in a second, I'm going to go
sit down, and we're going to talk,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.090
but I do have to get a couple
of things out of the way.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.560
First, silence your cell
phones, if you want to Tweet,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.910
if you want to Snapchat,
that's okay,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.640
but you got to silence
your cell phone.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.280
Second, out of quick survey,
how many teenage girls

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.290
or younger girls are here
in the room today, please?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.420
Stand up, we need to see you.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.640
That's good, good we
want to see you.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.640
Thank you.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080
Now, how many of you teenage
girls are younger think

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
that teenage girls are the most
important people in the world?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.230
Okay, we're going to come back
to that subject in a moment,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.750
but first, let me come over here.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.530 position:56%
As you can see, I'm in radio and
we're very good with the technology.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.550
Welcome, welcome to the National
Book Festival, it's wonderful

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.700
to have you here, it's
wonderful to be with you.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.770
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Thank
you, it's nice to be here.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.360
Can you here me?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.200
Oh, great, thank you.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Now, I'm
a journalist, so of course,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.570
I don't really prepare a lot,
and I've perhaps ten minutes

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.780
of questions for our conversation.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.800
So, this will end very
early, without you.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.020
There are microphones on both sides
here, I can almost see this one,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.320
I can clearly see that one.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.710
We don't have to stand on
ceremony, we only have a half hour,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.440
so if you have a question,
or something interesting

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.460
or provocative you'd like us to
talk about, head to that microphone

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.630
and we'll come to you, soon.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.910 position:56%
Not, you know, we don't have to
wait until the bitter end of things.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.120
But let me start, your latest,
you latest novel, Entwine,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.390
which could also be read, I
guess, as Entwin if you, sort of,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.460
cover up the E. It's about two
teenage girls, teenage twins,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.060
tell us about Isabella
and Gabrielle.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.650
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: So, I started
writing Entwine when I was close

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.380
to my teenage years myself, I
started it in graduate school

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.900
and I always thought I would
write young adult's books,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.160
and I've always been fascinated by
twins, by the mythology of twins,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.790
by actually twins,
how they function.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.160
So, and then I put it away, and
then I wrote Breath Eyes Memory,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.880
which is my first novel,
which is an adult novel,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.690
but features a young girl as
she starts at twelve and goes

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.650
through her mid twenties
in that book.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.050
And so a couple of years ago,
my mom was sick, and I just,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.390
for some reason came
back to Entwine.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.000
And it's about, you know,
being connected to somebody

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100
in this case a sister
and then having

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.250
that relationship possibly go away.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.910
So I was going through that
period of time in my life,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.550
it felt like a good time to go
back to Jiselle and Isabelle.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: So how
differently did the work seem to you

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.040
from when you started it,
to when you finished it?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.900
That was what, ten,
fifteen years almost?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.850
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah, it felt,
it felt very different, I think,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.700
for every writer you get,
the more you write, you know,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.860
it gets a little bit, you get
a little bit more mature at it.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.670
Things that seem, kind of, more
overwhelming, especially dealing

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.390
with issues like grief
when your young,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.690
you have a very different
perspective.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.600
Since then, I have
become a parent myself,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.290
and my brothers had teenage
children, who I could consult

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.160
and also have two brothers
who teach high school.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.260
So I had, sort of, access to, to
different people I could tap in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.750
and also now different layers of
experiences, not just from writing,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.000
but about life experiences
to draw from.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.970
So it felt very different even
though, I think, having started it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.030
when closer to being a teenager
myself was very helpful.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: And,
you did have a pair of twins

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.860
who you were also able
to consult for this book?

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.160
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
Yeah, I had a couple of,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.740
my brother has younger twins,
and then I, I have friend,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.330
a good friend who had
teenage twin daughters.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.870
And it's very hard because fat
elements to the book to then to,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.270
you know, to confront them with
the subject matter, but I also,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.980 position:56%
you know, I spent a lot of time
observing them and how they function

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.350
and I borrowed a lot of
things from them, for example,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.450
when we would all, I would often
go out to dinner with them,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.170
or I would be over to their house
[inaudible] parents, always,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.610
the twins, in my life, the
parents would always split them

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.790
because they, if the two of
them were sitting together,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.250
they would never, everybody else
at the table would disappear.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.370
So the parents would make sure
they were sitting at opposite ends.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.360 position:56%
Things like that, just sort of like,
how subtle things in the family

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: In fact sharing
that thought about the twins,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.490
for example, being at the
opposite ends of the table,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.120
comes up towards the
very end of the book

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.420
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: almost
heart wrenching scene.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.020
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah,
it's in the book because,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.740
it's the little things like that
I try to, by observing, sort of,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.780 position:56%
how the rest of the family, how the
twins fit in and also with, I think,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.390
in Haiti and other places
in the African [inaudible]

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.120
where twins have a very, and
in African cultures as well,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.580
twins have a very special
place in the culture

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.660
and they're certain
rituals that are done.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.170
If one twin is no longer living
and how that, that the spirit

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.920
of that twin is carried on
and how they were maimed.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.340
So I also wanted to incorporate
all of that, the spiritual elements

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.560
of being twins in the book.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: I guess we
should explain for those of you

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.640
who haven't yet had a
chance to read the book,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.360
this book really occurs
inside the mind

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.500
and literally inside the
body of one of the two twins.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.470
So, you've taken all this
material that you've learned

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.850
from however you've done the
research and you've created what,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.390
at least what you believe
it would feel

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.370
like to be inside one
of these twins.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah, and, and
using the idea of twinning but also,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.980
I think, the place I was
in my life with my mother,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.070
transferring that also to what
it would be like to be very close

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.160
to anybody that you
loved very deeply,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.070
that you felt was slipping away.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.130
So the book really is from the
perspective of one of the twins

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.930
and she's also trying very
hard to recreate, to keep,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.970
to keep another twin with
her in a very strong way, so,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.680
it's like one story but it
tells both of their stories.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.780
And the way that, I think
when we have a deep,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.170
also when you have
a deep friendship,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.220 position:56%
or when we have a very deep
relationship with someone, you know,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.060
it's said about twins, but it also
can be said about other people.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.920
They're like, oh they finish
each others sentences,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.820
when you have a very good friend

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.920
or someone will say something
has happened to someone

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.300 position:56%
and I have a feeling, I can feel it.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.010
Of course with twins, especially
identical twins, that's a stronger,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.520
you know, connection but it's
also a connection, I think,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.450
we have very much like
parents and children have,

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.180
people who've been together
for a long time have and wanted

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.450
to also explore those branches

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.650
of what a really deep loving
relationship is like even

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.080
if you're a teenager,
even if you're having,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.140
especially since you haven't
had other ones that are

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.000
as deep in your life yet.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Now,
speaking of which, as we said,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.680
young girls figure,
and quite a number

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.840
of you are booked in
one way or another.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.200
It's just Claire of the Sea Light,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.870
one of your earlier
novels, wonderful book.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.480
Who's that on the cover?

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.540
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
That's my daughter Mira,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.730
she's seven in that cover,
so we, when the book was

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:12.930
about to come the ninth, 2013,
and the publisher sent us a mock

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.290
up cover, and I have a friend who
said, well why don't you just,

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.470
it was a photographer
friend at the Miami Herald,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:24.280
and [inaudible] he said, why
don't you put Mira on the cover,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.440
I said well because
I don't recover it.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.750
And he said well we can,
let's photograph her,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.860
and you have to go either
at dawn at 5am, or like,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.250
or at 6pm to get the right
light and we chose 6pm.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.200
And he had her running
around and we sent

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.770
that to the publisher
and they loved it.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.770
But I always say to people,
like, the only disadvantage

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.210
of having your daughter
on the cover is that,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.830
if there's ever a remainder
copy, like if you walk

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.000
in to a random book
store, I have to buy it.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.190
I can never leave that book like
for a dollar, with a dollar sticker

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.710
on it, anywhere, you know, so,
we have a lot of copies that way,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.750
because I'm like, that's Mira, I
can't leave her here in the used,

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.480
like, bin, or the library
recycle bin, I have to get her,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.710
I have to take her from this place.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Is
there a moment, like,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.350
maybe when she's twenty one,
when you'll turn that over to her

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.820
and tell her she has to
buy her own remainder copy?

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.580
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
I think its funny,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:29.540 position:56%
like because when the book came out
she said, if you're in a book cover,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.840
does that mean you're famous?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.990
And I said, in a certain way.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.680
And she said, does
that mean I can hang

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.900
out with Lebron James
and president Obama?

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.340
So I think she'll be picking
up her own copy [inaudible].

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Well they'll
be along in just a few minutes.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.380
So first of all, a reminder,
microphones here, would really love

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.320
to hear your thoughts
about the work.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.990
But I did say I wanted to talk
a little bit about young girls,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.100
because I think, in a way, it
brings together two threads,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.720
two very important
threads in your work.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.890
Obviously, you're very well known
for your chronicling of Haiti

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.870
and what went on, one of the
poorest countries in the world,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.300
certainly one of the poorer
countries in the Americas.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.300
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Poor in
money, but rich in culture.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Yes.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.900
Thank you for that.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.200
That is sort of where I'm going,
which is that you also write a lot

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.910
about young teenagers and girls.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.000
And I think a lot of people
who look at development

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.570
in the world today actually
have come to the conclusion

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.810
that the most important
people in the world,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.010
right now, are teenage girls.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:35.360
That the difference between a
world of development and progress,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.510
and a world of continuing
poverty is really about bringing

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.970
up these girls, about their
education, about their development,

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.320
about their independence.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.020
And, in a sense, those
are sort of two threads

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.790
that we see coming
together a little bit.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.920
And I wondered if you could
talk a little bit about the way

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.340
in which Haiti and your insights
about Haiti sort of moved

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.390
from foreground to
background in your work.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.270
In some cases, like in
this book, it's present,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.870
but perhaps not the driving
element, or maybe it is.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.550
In some others, it's
clearly the core of the work.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.430
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Well,
it's interesting that you said,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.800
because a couple of years
ago, right before Claire

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.980 position:56%
of the Sea Light came out, I worked
on a documentary called Girl Rising,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.160
about 9 young girls from different
countries around the world,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.540
and there was one young
girl from Haiti.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Wadley.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.880
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: And how
after the earthquake, Wadley, yes,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.910
and who was trying very hard after
the earthquake to get an education.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.580
And there were other girls
from Egypt, from Afghanistan,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.410
and that's one of the things
that you said that was concluded,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.580
was the reason for
making the documentary,

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.940
that once you educate young women.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.260 position:56%
You know, there are a lot of trouble
with boys, also, in these countries.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.320
But once, one of the, the education
of women was always lagging behind,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.050
because if people had to choose
between educating their daughters

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.990
and their sons, they would put that
investment into their sons instead

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.140
of their daughters, because
they needed to stay at home

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.880
to take care of other siblings.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.170
So that, for me, consolidated
that very much like the importance

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.600
of educating young girls.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.980
And so working with the book and
with Wadley on the documentary

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.050 position:56%
at the same time was very important.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:26.910
I think girlhood, especially black
girlhood, wether it's in the US

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:33.870 position:56%
or it's in places around the world,
is so often misunderstood, you know?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:40.140
And often a lot of our children
don't get like a long moment

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.580
of innocence, you know,
in the developing world.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.180
Like you can have a 7 year old
taking care of a baby in the house

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.580
and working in the market.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.380
So that moment is so quick
that one of the things, like,

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.080
obviously the girls that are
entwined are a lot more privileged

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.860
or sort of first generation,
second generation at this point,

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.920
and their childhood is
very different than Claire,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.410
in Claire of the Sea Light.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.360
But that's something that's always
fascinated me, because I came here

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.500
as a young girl, at 12, that the
idea of exploring girlhood and all

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.120
of it's layers and all of it's
challenges, whether you're having,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.490
whether they're privileged
like the twins in the book,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.370
or less privileged, struggling
like Claire in the book,

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.280
whose father is basically
deciding, because her mother died

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.490
in childbirth, her father is
deciding whether he should keep her

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.070
or give her away to somebody
else, which is a very tough choice

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.180
that a lot of parents have
to make around the world,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.830 position:56%
especially with their girl children.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Yeah, and
in Claire of the Sea Light,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.670
she actually, which by the
way, is her name, her actual.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.970
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.270
Claire. Yeah.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Yeah.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.710
You see her, actually, at the
age of 7 actually playing,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.780
wrestling with her own father's
decisions and sort of trying

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.940
to think it through as if
she were an adult herself,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.240
or at least trying to be.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah, which
is, I mean, we explored a little bit

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:01.550 position:56%
of that in Girl Rising, and but it's
such a reality for so many families

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.480
who have to make this choice
whether, if I keep you with me,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.560
there's a struggle, but if I
maybe put you in another family,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.950
or give you to someone who's
better off, maybe they'll send you

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.890
to school, maybe, I mean,
usually it turns out badly,

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.560
where the child works like,
you know, like an adult

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.000
and doesn't get what's promised.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.920
But that's the choice that Claire's
father is wrestling with and hoping

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.690
for a better outcome,
because he's a fisherman

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.690
and he's thinking what if I die?

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.990
And she's everything I have.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.400
And he wants to, it's a
very big personal sacrifice,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.960
but it's very familiar in
places like where we come from.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: And a very
moving book, I have to say.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.560
Do I have question over here?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.860
Please.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.660
&gt;&gt; Hello, can you hear me?

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.960
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yes.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.260
Hi.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.560
&gt;&gt; Hi. It's such a
pleasure to meet you.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.860
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Thank you.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.890
&gt;&gt; And my question is,
I am a pursuing author.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.190
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
Just say you're a writer.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:01.720
&gt;&gt; Well, and I haven't quite gotten
started, but I am in the process

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.720 position:56%
but I have been doodling in my book.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.210
And I do want to cater
to the demographics

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.630
that you're catering to,
which are the teenage girls,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.040
and then just teenagers in general.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.220
Because like you said, we
have issues on both sides.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.350
But, however, I'm trying
to find out,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.780
where is a good place
for me to start?

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.210
Because I'm noticing that
I have a lot of good ideas,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.780
but they're dealing with
kids and their parents,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.050
issues in the household,
because they bring them to school

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.510
and then the teacher has to kind
of like peel the layers back,

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.460
and then we can go to the lesson.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:43.030 position:56%
So I'm looking for some kind of tip,
one for new writers, and then, too,

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.610
how long do you think
a book should be?

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.360
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Well, I
think, I think you should star

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.170
by owning it, right, like
if you want to be a writer.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.390
And the great thing about writing
is that it's like I've worked

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.630
in film making, if you have to
make a scene, you have to have

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.240
like all of these people.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.720
The writing, you just need your
pen and paper to begin, right?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.720
That's one of the advantages of it.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.960
And then, in terms of just
choosing your subject.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.230
What you feel like your
most passionate about.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.760
Because often we can be in
a book for, you know, for,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.690
some people can write a
book in a couple of months,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.720
but it can take you years.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.380 position:56%
So you may as well love the
subject, it may as well be something

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.350
that you are passionate
about, you know,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.320
that haunts you, that
you can't forget.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.970
Like something that you're going
to look forward to working on.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.760
And if that, the subjects you
mentioned, if those are the things

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.470
that bother you, like you
want to get out of you,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.860
I would do those subjects.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.550
And how long a book
can be, it all depends.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.210
You know? Like Their
Eyes Were Watching God,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.740
Zora Neale Hurston's book,
it's a relatively short book,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.520
but it has so much in it.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.570
You know? So I always think like,
a book will be how long it wants

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.730 position:56%
to be, like how long it needs to be.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.040 position:56%
So you write, whether you're an
outliner, or whether you're a person

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.490
who just writes, and then
see where it leads you.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.820
But don't worry so much
about the length, you know.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.000
You worry about the content

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.580
and the book will be
however long it needs to be.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: When you, when
you're writing, she used the word,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.930
the phrase cater to the audience.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.280
Who do you think about
when you're writing?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.850
Do you think about a specific
reader, groups of readers?

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.170
No readers at all?

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.610
The story?

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.050
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: I think of
the girl I was when I was 15.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.460
And what I was looking
for, what I wanted to read.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.990
You know, there's a very
famous Toni Morrison quote,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.330
like if there's a book you
want to read, you write it.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.220
So that's what I always
try to do with each book,

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.780
like I write a book
that I want to read.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: I've tried
that, it hasn't come out yet.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.440
So I want to ask you about that 15
year old girl, but before we do,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.330
let's take another
question over here.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.630
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.930
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Hello.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for being here.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.800
I'm married into a Haitian
family, and I love your books.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.060
[ Speaks in foreign language ]

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.530
And I just wanted to ask,
you write both non fiction,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.190
as well as fiction, and how
is your process different

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.610
between the two genres?

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.080
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Okay, so
between non fiction and fiction,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.450
I feel like non fiction is more,
for me it's a more urgent process.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.860
So I wrote a memoir called
brother I'm dying, after my uncle,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.530
who died in immigration
custody in 2004.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.250
So I, people will say well, why
didn't you write that as fiction?

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.310
I felt like there was, I had such
an urgent need to tell that story,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.740
that to me that's how it came out.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.790 position:56%
My next book will be a kind of
memoir craft book by Gray Wolf Press

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.830
on my mother's, it's sort of how
writers have written about death,

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.520
but also includes some
personal reflections.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.910
And so that also came out
of like my urgent grieving.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.180
Right? So I feel like with non
fiction it's to me, more immediate,

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.870
because the story already exists

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.620
and what you're putting
together is the structure, right?

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.920
You're choosing the structure.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.220
How do I tell the story?

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.470
Because the piece is already there,
the story's already happened,

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.910
so with the non fiction
it's the how.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.110
But with the fiction it's
out of whole cloth, right,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.870
you're inventing something.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.840
And that takes me a little longer.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.010 position:56%
To live with the subject, to, for
the people to show themselves to me,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.540
as Alice Walker says at the
end of the Color Purple,

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.840
she thinks the character's
[inaudible].

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:30.040
So I feel like with fiction it's a
longer, sort of midwifing process.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.290
And, but with fiction I usually
end up writing my non fiction

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.560
because it feels urgent, like
I have to get it out sooner.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes:
Although one of the things

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.140
that I think is fascinating,
if I can share a little story

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.550
from when we said hello
just before, you said,

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.560
so how do I get the
news guy [inaudible].

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.270
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
That's kind of the news.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: One thing that
I find remarkable in your work,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.560
though, is how, whether
it's fiction or non fiction,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.010
it's used very significant
to the news.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.900
Maybe not as, I mean, you're
right, the difference of immediacy,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.880
but so many of your characters
are living in the events

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.760
that world is going
through right now.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.060
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: And
that seems important.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.660
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: And
that's part of the haunting

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.370 position:56%
like when I was starting write about
what haunts you, because, to me,

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.050
if something is just like I can't
forget it and it's also a way

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.360
of engaging in the world.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.780
And, in nonfiction, the
turnaround is quicker especially

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.220
with the essays and the offense
if you're reacting to something.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: You're often
described as the chronicler

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.440
or memoirist of the
Haitian diaspora.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.960 position:56%
One of the things about the world
right now is that we're, in a sense,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.230
living in an era of Diasporas
whether Syrians or most of Africa

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:41.570
or Haiti or Mexico, Latin
America, there are people

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.160
in motion all over the world.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.590
Do, and of course, immigration
has become a huge subject

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.330
in the presidential debate here in
the United States and in Europe.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.730 position:56%
What is it that you would want all
of us to understand about migration,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:01.130
immigration, diaspora, that might
help people grasp this here a

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.430
little better.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.490
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, we
have right now the most,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.820
the largest population
of people in motion.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.180 position:56%
That's, since they've been counting,
something like 65 million people

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.210
in motion around the
world right now.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.750
And, half of them are children.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.090
And, I think, what we need
to remember is that each

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.800
of these people is an individual.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.720
And, like, nobody leaves,
nobody would put themselves

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.850
or their small child
on a boat knowing

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.680
that they might die
unless they were urged to,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.050
or travel across all these
countries or on a train.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.370
Small children, we had one summer

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.260
where all these small
children were coming.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.840
And recently, just very recently,
the Obama Administration decided

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.140
to start deportation
back to Haiti again

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.380 position:56%
in the middle of a Cholera epidemic.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.730
I think, when we hear these,
we hear blocks of numbers.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.790
You hear 65 million people.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.090
But, I think it's important

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.240
to imagine that's 65 million
individuals, each of them a story.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.850
You know, they're more
than refugees,

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.550
they're more than migrants,
they're people.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.390
And, I think sometimes, when you
talk about these boarders and walls

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.700
and so much forth, it sounds
like a plague, like we forget

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.070
that we're talking about lives,
people who are just like,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.490
just like each of us individually.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Do
I have another question?

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.700
Over here I think.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.020
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.840
You mentioned earlier that black
girlhood is often misunderstood,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.060
which I think is so true.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.200
What are messages that you
hope to convey to your readers

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.470
about black girlhood, regardless
of the origins of the young women?

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.130
But, what are some important
things that you hope to communicate

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.000
and some misunderstandings you hope
to address about black girlhood?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Well, I think,
one of the things, we're lucky to be

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.500
in this space and time too where
we've had wonderful authors

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.570
like Jacqueline Woodson who,
her, especially her new book,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.500 position:56%
Another Brooklyn, like all her work,
but her new book Another Brooklyn

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.660
that talks about, in part, of that.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.550
But, in my time, we had, basically
we had Maya Angelou I Know Why the

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.350
Caged Bird Sings, and we had the
[inaudible] books, that's who,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.040
you know, I had a few
books like that.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.250 position:56%
But now, there are a lot more books.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.340 position:56%
What I want and would love people to
understand is the many layers of it,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.540
you know, the many
layers of black girlhood.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.980
Because, often, I think,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.470 position:56%
in the general cultures portray this
sort of, like mini women, you know,

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.500
it's sort of the, and the whole
oversexualization [assumed

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.320
spelling], you know either
like whatever they, you know,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.940
is projected on black women

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.610
in general is transferred
to black girls.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.260
And so, I think, again, we're
lucky to have these authors

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.870
that write all these layers.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.340
But, I think it's important.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.920
What I try to do in my work and I
feel it's part of a course to add

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.210
to like that there are many ways

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.880
to be a black girl
especially in this era.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.140 position:56%
You know, black girl's code, black
girl's scientists, black girls rule,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.900
black girls rock, black girls
mad, black girl magic, you know.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.880
And, the fact that we even need
something like that shows sort

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.760
of how misinterpreted
black girls are.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.400
And, as a mother of two
black girls, you know, I,

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.240
it's I'm even more invested in
that perception of showing us

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.270
as many layers in many
different ways.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: I'm
going to come back then

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.780
to the question of
you as a teenager.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.320
You arrived in America when
you were 12, the United States.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.030
And, at that point you spoke
very little if any English.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.330
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Yeah.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:34.950
And so, English is really
your third language.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.610 position:56%
And yet you write mostly in English.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.910
Is that right?

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.210
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: so, Samuel
Becket once explained that he wrote

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.420 position:56%
in French much of his work
including Waiting for Godot and some

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.550
of his other work because
it gave him better control

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.860
and distance from his work.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.530
What's the reason you have
chosen to write in English?

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.620
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Well, I write
in English because I came at 12

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.660
and it's just kind of
flowed into English.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.520
I think, maybe if I were older

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.870
when I got here it would've
been a more difficult choice.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.700 position:56%
But it's, I always said to people if
I, I think if we're going to a place

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.860
where they speak Spanish,
I'd be writing in Spanish.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.720
It's just kind of, and, but I,

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.660
I did find that when I
started writing initially

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.000
that English was kind of like
a way to, when I would write

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.200 position:56%
in my diary I would write in English
so my parents couldn't read it.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.730
So, it was also, like even
they wouldn't understand also.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.250
So it was a, it was a layer
removed sort of like my own space.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.870
It was a protective space.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.070
So it also did serve
that purpose, you know.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Well
similar to Becket in ways.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.950
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Exactly yeah.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: French
was his third language.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.770
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Yeah.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.870
And I've been reading, I just
was recently reading [inaudible]

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.830
who wrote, she wrote
a book in Italian

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.080
about her discovery of Italians.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.550
And, it's really, I think writers
always want to reinvent themselves

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.030
in some way, right, if
you I think for me that's

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.210
where coughing genres come
in like going from the adult

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.500
to picture book, like you feel
like you want to be refreshed.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.520
Right? And, language
is certainly one way.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.790
And it becomes, I'm a little bit
relieved all the time I see my

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.220
relatives they'll be a year
before like my relatives

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.520
in Haiti will read the book.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.870
So, I always feel like okay
they're like it'll be a year less

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.420
but they'll be mad if I
said something that they.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.980
So, there's a kind of also
freedom in other languages

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.260
that I think like, especially

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.800
in [inaudible] book she describes
very beautifully about stepping

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.170
over boundaries that you
think you already have

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.150
and whether they're
linguistic boundaries

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.760
or they're genres boundaries,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.090
but it just offers this
kind of freedom to it.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Do your
relatives get mad very often?

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.350
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Not very
often, but they always say

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.440
like why did you make me look
like that, you know, in this book.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.370
And I, I'm always saying
it's not you.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.670
And they never believe me.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes:
Let's come over here,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.700
good to have a question
on this side.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.010
&gt;&gt; Good morning

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.310
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Good morning.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.610
&gt;&gt; How are you?

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Fine thank you.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.840
&gt;&gt; Good. When my daughter
was in high school,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.150
she had to do a book
report on Haiti And,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.260
because I helped her
proofread it I got a basic.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Just proofread?

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.150
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, well I got
a basic understanding

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.910
or an education on Haiti.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.590
And, a lot of times, when
we don't live other places,

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.000
we're just concerned
about where we are.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.480
One of the things that I
found a lot of interest

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.460
in was Haiti is a predominantly
black country.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.100
But, they have a color issue.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.990
So, you know, they go by the
whites, light skin, dark skin.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:42.320
Had you ever thought about
doing a book about that issue?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.620
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Well, I mean,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.410
color is certainly
not unique to Haiti.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:52.770 position:56%
It's a, so, if you imagine, see like
in Brazil and Haiti and other places

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.300
where we had colonialism

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.570
and in Hattie we had the
French as the Colonial power.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.900
And there was, there was a
chart, there was something

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.690
like 300 racial categories,
right, that was just like,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.730
so they were saying if you were a
mulatto, had a kid with an accent,

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.260
like the whole, I mean it
was like an insane chart of,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.210
and then of course, the higher,
the lighter you were on that,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.580
in that chart, the more privileges
you had, because you know,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.670
some of the children of the,

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:32.470
of the owners of the enslaved
people would then send their kids

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.770
to friends, and then there's
a very interesting case.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.670
There's a novel that's about to
come out by Marie Vieux-Chauvet,

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:43.480
it's republished, called Dance on
the Volcano where she talks about,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.190
for example, these women, like
in the cap, and in the south,

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.920
they weren't allowed to wear their
jewelry, like their diamonds,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.800
they were like the
mistresses of these rich guys

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.660
and they gave them jewels, and
they weren't allowed to wear them

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.210
on their, so they would
wear these loop earrings,

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.060
or they would wear their
diamonds on their toes.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.030
You know, they would find
ways to like define the thing.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:10.350
So I think, just as it is in this
country, color is, I mean, it's so,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.700
it's part of, it's a part of
white supremacy that's very hard

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.570
to extract.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:22.210 position:56%
So I, I feel like, I mean it's not a
story that I want to concentrate on,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.390
because I don't think
it's unique to us.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.510
I mean, maybe in part of it,
sort of it's allowed with power,

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.010
it's allowed with money from
the whole colonial period.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.140
And so it's something
that is definitely one

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.230
of the ills we suffered from.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.150
But I think it's also
buffered in a place like Haiti,

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.080
by the fact that you have
a majority black population

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.570
and you have dark skin
presidents and you have, you know,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.140
you've seen all these variations.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.460
But if I, wherever it's written,
if I, I would love to read a book

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.270
on it, whether it's about
the US or about Brazil,

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.530 position:56%
but that gives me more than we know.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.880
You know? And for me, like, I
don't feel like I have that passion

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.730
for the subject that would
open a new page on it.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Well, believe
it or not, the time has roared by.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.700
We've used up all our time,
and even a little bit more.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.000
I do want to let everybody to know

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.050
that Edwidge Danticat
will be downstairs

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.590
in a half our in room, okay, well.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.220
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Table 16.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Oreskes: Table 16.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.070
If you'd like a book signing.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.200
And, I think, on behalf of
everybody here, including myself,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.100
thank you so much for doing
this, it was wonderful.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.400
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat: Thank you.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.810
Thank you all for coming.
