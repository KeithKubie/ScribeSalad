Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty this week and joining me today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, as well as a professor of economics at George Mason. Don Boudreaux, welcome to the Rubin report. Happy to be here. I am glad you are here. I saw you speak about a year ago in Dallas. I want to get the exact title of the speech right. Uh, it was called, can we bring sound economic thinking to Washington? That's a tough task. That was a year ago and, uh, I don't think there's much sound economic thinking or sound thinking in Washington. Forget economics for a second. These things don't seem to go together these days. Uh, Washington seems to repel sound thinking. It's, it's, uh, it's a, it attracts on sound thinking. Yeah. Well, you think it was always that way or are we in unique times, but we're definitely in unique talents, unique times.

Speaker 2:          00:53          So I was born in 1958, so I came of age right when Ronald Reagan. Right. You know, at the end of the Carter administration, when even Carter's pushing for deregulation, at least accepting deregulation taxes were being cut airline to being deregulated surface transportation is being deregulated. Reagan gets elected in 1980. Milton Friedman has as popular show on PBS called free to choose. Uh, you know, Thomas, I'll learn about Thomas soul. Everything seems very, oh, this world's fine. Yeah. And so in my life, in my life, uh, there was a period in the past when I was thinking was more sound, I could quibble with it. Yeah. But compared to today, it was, it was outstanding because it's definitely, it's definitely declined. Yeah. It's hard to imagine even that around the time of Jimmy Carter that deregulation, I mean that, that Democrats could have had anything to do with that.

Speaker 2:          01:48          And yet the Ted Kennedy was a major force behind airline deregulation. So there was, there was something, I'm not sure what it was exactly. It was something in the air, uh, starting in the late seventies. And so, you know, I was a young man then I just took it for granted. Oh Wow. All right. This is fine. You know, we're, we're winning. It culminates in 1989 with the collapse of the, of the, of the Iron Curtain in 1991, the collapse of Soviet Union. And then here we are, 2018 and a lot of nonsense is back on the front burner. Nonsense is back. So let's jump back though to the seventies for a second because I watched an interview with you this morning. Something happened to you I believe in 1977 that that woke you up. And I think it sort of is a nice entry into everything else that, you know, I know said, yeah, I just the most important day.

Speaker 2:          02:35          What happened to you in 1977 you can come up with a couple of options. Yeah, no, I know it was, the date was, was, was, was was January 24th, 1977. I remember there was a, um, I was in college. I went to please my mother. My plan was to drink beer, chase girls. I did a lot of the former, I wasn't successful at the ladder, but I was going, I was going to drop out of college and work at the ship yard where my parents worked. So I needed a class to fit my schedule. I needed a Monday, Wednesday, Friday class. I take this class called economics, didn't know what it was, took it and uh, uh, I had a great teacher and so she drew supply and demand curves on the board and she said, look what happens when the government prevents the price of something from rising to its market level.

Speaker 2:          03:16          It creates a shortage. She says, you remember the gasoline shortages of 1973 or so? Yeah, I was in those and I just thought the beauty of this economic explanation for the gasoline shortage was so spectacular. I wanted to learn more about the subject. And so in very short order, I just fell in love with economics. I'm still in love with it to this day. Yeah. So tell me what happened after that. So now you have your spark and what sort of, what academic proceeds did you have that got you to where you are in a very lucky, again, she was a really good teacher and it wasn't a famous economist at all. She was a very good teacher. She took a great interest in her students. She taught economics as if it was something relevant to the real world rather than just a mathematical, a puzzle.

Speaker 2:          03:58          Uh, and there was another guy at my, I want to put, it's called Nicholls State University and Tibideau Louisiana that says it's a very small school. But I had another professor there who was into Milton Friedman into higher, uh, into Ludwig von Mises into James Buchanan, who later became my colleague at George Mason. So I would go to his office, his name is bill field, and he would give me these books. And so I remember just just tearing through these books and it just made so much sense to me. I realized in reading these books that all my life, I didn't give much thought to politics, not much conscious thought, uh, but all my life, uh, I think somewhere deep inside of me was a classical liberal or libertarian, someone who believed that is basically impolite to button to other people's business. Uh, and, and, and, and, and not only in polite, I mean it's, it's downright, it's downright offensive to do so.

Speaker 2:          04:49          Yeah. You just said to him may buzz phrases. So classical, liberal and Libertarian. Now one of the questions I get most because I define, I say that I am a classical liberal if I need, if I need a label on it, that's what I am. And people will always say to me, because I talk about many of the things that you teach about, about free markets and all that stuff, and I believe that freedom is the best way for humans to flourish. People will say, Dave, you're really a libertarian. You're just holding onto this definition of liberalism from 18, whatever. Do you see a meaningful, how would you define each one and do you see a meaningful distinction? I don't see much of a distinction. Depends on who you talk to. Some people see, see distinctions. I think where they both have in common. It may be distinctions at the margin.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Libertarians maybe tend to be a little bit more radical. Uh, uh, but, uh, uh, a what distinguishes classical liberals and Libertarians as I'd have broadly from almost any other political group, a is the consistent, uh, uh, believe that any exercise of power by the state must meet a huge burden of proof. Uh, the, the, the, the burden of proof is not upon the individual to make the case for his or her freedom. It's upon the state to make the case, to Intro, to override that freedom. I believe in libertarian classical liberals as I think of them believe that that burden is a real one and it's a heavy one. Sometimes it can be met, but too often the reverse is in place. People believe that you have to, that the burden is on those of us who, who defend freedom to make the case for freedom.

Speaker 2:          06:23          And I think it's backwards. So basically you view it as sort of a bottom up way of looking at things, right? It's about the individual first. And the government is not giving you your freedom. It can take it away. However, by instituting all sorts of policies. Yeah. I, I'm in this case, I am, uh, I think John Locke was right and John Locke wasn't the only person, but John Locke most famously, you know, made the argument in the, in, in the second treatise on government that, um, uh, you know, human beings have rights and human beings delegate to the government, uh, powers that you, that, that those who do the delegation believe are appropriate for the government to defend those rights. Um, know we, we can quibble about how historically accurate that is, but I like, I, I think that perspective is philosophically correct. Uh, no government gives me or you rights governments are excellent at offending rights and taking them away.

Speaker 2:          07:22          Uh, but, but just because government is to protect her of rights doesn't mean he gives us rice just because farmers, uh, because we couldn't live without farmers if no one grew food. And, and, and, and did ranching, we would all starve. That doesn't mean that we owe our lives to farmers. Uh, one of the great things about the society that we live in is that it's a, it was bit higher called the great society to be distinguished from Lyndon Johnson's great society. And that is, it is a society of many, many individuals each specialized in doing various things. We're all coordinated by the price system and by the rule of law. Uh, and so each of us makes a contribution to the welfare of others, but no one of us is utterly essential. And that's, uh, that's, that's uh, it's a really good system, I believe.

Speaker 2:          08:08          Yeah. So I want to talk more about hiking a little bit because you do run the cafe high tech blog. Uh, you mentioned the burden of proof that the government has to meet to say when it's right to actually infringe on some of your rights or basically do things. Yeah. So this is where I would say the, the classical liberal and the libertarian position is there a little bit different. I see some utility for the state and although I'd usually want it done at the, at the state level, not the federal level. And Libertarians, it's sort of hard to pin on when it's enough. And you alluded to that when you talk to libertarians, how do you get to a place where, where it's not, you know, I always make the joke, it's like w eventually you'll just be in mad max or, or the true anarcho capitalists, which I enjoy talking to, but I view it as more of an intellectual exercise than a practical.

Speaker 2:          08:52          Yeah. I mean, I, I'm very sympathetic to anarchical philosophically I'm, yeah, but I'm not, I'm not a, uh, uh, a blow things up kind of guy and I'm way too much of a hierarchy and to understand that you just can't, uh, uh, replace social institutions, wholesale society has to evolve to wherever it's going to be from being a realist. I mean, you couldn't blow it up. I fit well, yes you could, but, but, but history has a lot of really telling examples about attempts to blow up society's wholesale. And those examples, I've never turned out well in practice. Uh, let, let me say among the people who will call themselves classical liberals, right? None of them are ever at a w whatever, express any sympathy for Anaco capitalism among libertarians. Some of them will say, oh no, I, I, I believe there's a role for the government.

Speaker 2:          09:42          But you do it. If people who classify themselves as Libertarians who say at least, at least in principle, I believe that it's society could exist without any formal institution of monopolized coercion. And I, I am in that ladder ladder. Yeah. I might be the one classical liberal who will do it or it, that maybe by that definition I'm a little more libertarian. But again, these things all, yeah. You know, it's really sort of the narcissism of small differences that's exactly in this little place. All right. So what are some of the basic principles? You're a professor. What are the basic principles that people should know about economics? I know I'm giving you a wide one there, but for someone watching this, that, that's waiting for their 19, 77 moment. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, in no particular order, number one, scarcity is unavoidable. We live in a world of scarce resources, which means that if you use some resources to do this good thing, you take resources away from the ability to do other good things in both good things.

Speaker 2:          10:38          But we have to choose, do we want to do this good thing or do we want to do that? Good thing. Second thing to note in order to make that decision, uh, we want the people involved who are going to be affected both by the loss of that which is not done. And by the benefit of that which is done to express their opinions. Honestly, how, how valuable is this thing that we propose to do and how valuable is this thing that we propose to give up in order to do this first thing? And then to do that, we, you, you need people on the ground who are actually affected by these decisions to have a, a meaningful say. You don't want a third party looking down, making declarations. Oh, I think you should have that. And I think you should not have had that.

Speaker 2:          11:18          So any social mechanism that gives each of us as much of a say as possible in, uh, how we use resources and, and, and make the evaluations about what w what will happen if we use resources in this way and what will give up if we use resources in this way that that's important. Unintended consequences is another important concept. You know, Adam Smith in the wealth of nations, which is rightly considered to be the start starting point of modern scientific economics. He, he famously talked about the invisible hand and this is a, this is this sort of, uh, an unintended consequences kind of explanations, not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner. But from their regard to their own interests, uh, they, they don't dislike you. They value as a customer, but they are doing their jobs not primarily to help you.

Speaker 2:          12:14          They're doing their jobs to help themselves and you are buying from them, not primarily to help them but primarily to help you and your family. And in that way, everyone's either, so this is a good unintended consequence, but you have, you have bad unintended consequences as well. One of my favorite examples of a bad unintended consequences of the minimum wage raise the minimum wage. It looks like you helping low skill workers and you might have some of them, but in fact you're putting other low skill workers out of jobs and you're keeping them out of the job market for longer. And so economists, I think what makes a good economist, which distinguishes a good economy is from a bad economist or a non economist is, is a consistency and asking questions, always asking as compared to what, as compared to what, where did that come from?

Speaker 2:          12:56          How are we going to pay for that? What did this cost, uh, uh, what will be the longterm consequences down the road beyond the immediate ones that, that everyone can see. So it's just a, it's just a consistency and asking those questions. You know, it's funny, as you're answering the question, it keeps making me think, well, this shows you why politics is so screwed up because they get up, they're all politicians on either side and they either say $15 minimum wage, Bernie or Trump, I'm going to cut taxes on you. Or they, you know, they love their bumper stickers stuff, but nobody's ever said unintended consequences in a presidential debate. So how frustrating must that be as an economist listening to people who are not economists, who really aren't experts in much of anything. I don't know that Bernie has ever created a business or made anyone make a dollar off, am not aware of it overnight.

Speaker 2:          13:45          But that must be incredibly frustrating to hear. Non Pros talk about the things that you're a pro at. It is David and, and you know, it's especially frustrating about it. It's not rocket science. I mean, I, I, I love economics. I love my profession and I really admire the best among my professional colleagues, Milton Freeman High Tech. Uh, but it's not rocket science. It's just this consistency of always understanding that there are consequences beyond the immediate, uh, that, that there's always a cost to something, uh, that no matter how beneficial something is, it has to be weighed against that cost. So these simple, uh, the simple understanding and the consistency in applying that understanding, it's not difficult, but so few people do it. So it is, it is frustrating. Um, you know, years ago I stopped, I joke that I stopped watching the evening. People my age used to watch the evening.

Speaker 2:          14:45          Even the news, right. I remember it. I have some recollection again, I had to stop watching the news have always, always threatened. Throw my shoes. Yeah. Through the, through the screen. Because you know, the, the reporters, they would very, very much like the politicians. They would report on the immediate effect, Oh, the minimum wage is going arise that that means that workers will get a raise of, you know, whatever the amount is as well. Well, no, it does it, it means that for some workers, but it means also other workers are going to lose their jobs. Some jobs, the nature of those jobs are going to change. Employers aren't just going to sit back and say, oh well we've got to pay higher minimum wages, so let's just pay higher than minimum wage. Where's that money coming from? Where are those resources coming from? They have to come from somewhere.

Speaker 2:          15:22          Yeah. So basically your argument would be that the government's only role in the economy is to make sure we're not killing each other. They're pretty much right. Like it really it's a total laissez faire at if, yes, I am a very laissez faire guy. If, if property rights are well defined and secure, and there's a strong case that government plays a role of Ken play a role in helping to define and certainly helping to secure property rights. So that's where you're going. Contract rights. Right? So that's where you're not in anarcho capitalists. Right? Well, I'm going, I'm close to being here. I mean, I, I'm, I'm willing, I'm willing to admit that grudgingly giving that to the governor. I'm willing. Yes. I'm willing to admit that anarcho capitalism, you know, might not be, uh, uh, ultimately a defensible position. I am not willing to admit that free markets are an indefensible position.

Speaker 2:          16:15          However, property rights come to be, however, they are defined, however, they are enforced when you have secure private property rights and freedom of contract, which includes importantly the freedom to say no. All right, I the freedom to not contract. Uh, then people are led to pursue their people in pursuing their own interest, are obliged to help others out. And that's how this great society that we live in and it is great, uh, uh, continues to grow and become more prosperous. Yeah. So I mentioned to you right before we started that, you know, I've had a political awakening of sorts and I always say to people, I didn't really move, but the left went so bananas. I ended up being friends with all these Libertarians and conservatives and whatever, whatever it is, even for the differences we may have. But one place I have shifted is that I am much more where you are economically now.

Speaker 2:          17:07          And partly that's because I now run my own business and have employees and have to deal with that. And I just wrote to obscene Lehigh checks for taxes for the year. I mean, we are in California. You don't want to know him like that one. It wasn't the federal loans even worse than it's like you're, the more successful I get, the harder I work, the more they want to take from you. And I tweeted something about that on tax day and a lot of people were angry at me and said, well it's, it's, this is the price to pay for success. Would you rather be poor? And I didn't want to go on a major tweetstorm and you wisely or not on Twitter, but could you, could you give me something that, if I ever get in that fight again, I can say to people why that's not the right way to think.

Speaker 2:          17:45          So let, let, let, let me start off though with just asking you, have you heard the story about George Mcgovern when he retired from politics? He a big snow please. So George Mcgovern, when he retired from politics, I think I have the details right. He certainly had the, the major part of it, right? He started the B and B, uh, you know, in, in, in his home state. You already like where this is going. Yeah. And uh, and then he encounters all these regulations, you know, labor regulations, safety regulations. Uh, and he admits, I can't remember now to whom he admitted as a long time ago. Yeah. He admits, he says, you don't have to spend all my, I'm not quoting him, I'm going from memory. So I spent all my life pushing for these things. I was, I wasn't sufficiently attentive to the downside of, of, of, of these taxes and these regulations.

Speaker 2:          18:31          Yeah. And so it's easy to, you know, to sit here in Sacramento to sit in Washington DC to sit in some, you know, local government, uh, office building and tell other people how to live and to tell other people how much money they have to give to you. And you can be well intentioned in the best sense of the term, but you are not those other people. And those other people are bearing consequences and they know of things that you don't understand. And so on, on the, on the, on the, on the tax thing. Uh, I like what, uh, uh, my friend Ed Crane said about, uh, the famous quotation that is above the door of the IRS building in Washington. It's a quotation from justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, I think there's an exact quotation. Taxation is the price you pay for civilization. And at crane says, no, that's wrong.

Speaker 2:          19:21          Taxation is the price we pay for being insufficiently civil law. Right? That's a civilization is, is when we cooperate peacefully to help each other. And so even if we, granted there is some role for government and once you're granted some role for government, it's hard. It's very difficult to not see that there's some appropriate level of taxation to fund that role for government. Uh, Ho Ho were much that may be true that we need, that it represents a failure of us as a society to become fully civilized. We've somehow not managed to figure out how to cooperate peacefully and voluntarily in those matters in ways that we have managed to discover how to cooperate peacefully in voluntarily and doing what we're doing here today and going to the supermarket and the supermarket dealing with the various, uh, uh, suppliers that, that it has. None of that is, is funded with taxation.

Speaker 2:          20:09          So all funded with voluntary voluntary payments. That is civilization. So I liked the notion that, uh, uh, taxation is, uh, it's a, it's sort of a measure of how little we are civilized or how far we have to go to be completely civilized to make sure we're not killing each other to make sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, all right. I want to get back to a couple of things you said there. So first, okay. I know the, I know that the minimum wage is a, is a big one for you. And even just this morning, I write another story about how Bernie wants this $15 minimum wage. The anecdote that I keep using or anecdote that I keep using is that I keep trying, I'm traveling all over the country right now and in almost every airport you go to fast food places and they don't have people anymore.

Speaker 2:          20:48          They have I iPads. Yes. Now perhaps if you could pay people less, people would have jobs. It wouldn't be the greatest job in the world, but it would be the way it's always worked. Now we are literally replacing people with robots that may be inevitable no matter what. But to say that you have to pay people again, even from my own business here, I get people offering to work for me for free all the time. I want to pay people appropriately and we do pay all our people. Um, but the idea that the government would force me to pay someone x amount, it seems completely bananas. So the minimum wage, uh, puts low many low skill workers out of jobs. If, if a teenager is not worth $7 and 25 cents per hour, employers who are not in the charity business are not going to hire that teenager at that price.

Speaker 2:          21:36          That teenager will go without a job or go without a job in the, in the above ground economy, make find a job, paying more in the underground economy, which is a different set of problems. Uh, and so that is the major unintended consequence of the minimum wage. There are others, but that's the big one. Um, and if, uh, you know what, people like Bernie Sanders, I mean, because I speak to proponents of the minimum wage all the time, uh, most of them, uh, do, they just stopped the analysis at the surface. Oh, wouldn't it be better to be paid $15 an hour and said simple? Of course. So this is, they don't want to get to the unintended consequences part, I think, because I think because most of them believe that they just have this image of employers as being a really rich, uh, highly profitable operations.

Speaker 2:          22:28          And so if you raise the minimum wage, oh, sure. It has a cost, but cost that's going to be born exclusively by employers. But it's a fact. Most low skilled workers work in highly competitive industries. They work in food retail, they, they work at lawn care. They, they, they, they work in, in, in, in supermarkets, restaurants. These are highly competitive industries. So there's no big profit margin there. So when you raise the minimum wage, it's not coming out of the profits of the employers. It has to come out of some change in the way the employers do their business. There's nothing wrong with automation of course. Yeah. But there's a, there's a proper amount of automation and if you raise the minimum wage, you get too much automation, uh, because you put a and too few human workers. And here, here's, I just want to make this clear.

Speaker 2:          23:14          Here's another unintended consequences of the minimum wage. And not only does it deny income to those workers who will lose their jobs worse in most cases, it denies those workers. W what's even more valuable, namely the opportunity to get that first piece of job experience. And so the 16 year old who otherwise would have gotten the job without the minimum wage becomes a 17 year old or 18 year old who's still a never employed person. Whereas otherwise they would have had job experience. And so it, it, it, it swells artificially swells the ranks of, of, of, uh, unskilled workers. Would there be a direct correlation then that once you have this whole set of people at this imaginary $15 minimum wage, they are also going to raise prices on basic things, right? I mean is, is there a direct correlation that no mean prices may rise a little bit cause you get it, you know, the economy's a little bit less efficient so you get a little bit less output, but the price increases aren't, aren't the, the major problem.

Speaker 2:          24:10          The major problem is employers will find ways to satisfy their customers, uh, at slightly higher cost to the employers, but at huge costs to those workers who, who lose their jobs. So when you've talked to kind of missed on the left that disagree with you on this and I, I get what you're saying that they're not taking that next step. I'm sure there's someone out there that has made a sound argument that you just disagree with you lay out. So there is one sound argument, one sound, theoretically one theoretically coherent argument for the minimum wage to measure that one. And that is if employers have what's called monopsony power vent, which I'm going to need to define that one. Yes. Monopsony power is, it's like monopoly power, except so monopolist is the only seller. A monopsony. It's is the only buyer. Okay? So if you're the only buyer of low skill workers in the market, right?

Speaker 2:          25:02          But you as an employer, you then can, and it can be easily shown, you can keep wages lower than they would otherwise be too low. And given that you, it can be then shown that if the government comes in and sets a minimum wage, right, then the, uh, the employer will in fact pay the higher minimum wage and no employees will be harmed. But it's a very, very, uh, strict criteria for this are very, very strict. And the idea that that Walmart and Mcdonald's and Burger King and KFC and all the mom and pop restaurants and, and, and made services and lawn care services that we have throughout the United States, the idea that any one of these is a month alone monopoly buyer of low skill workers is just absurd.
