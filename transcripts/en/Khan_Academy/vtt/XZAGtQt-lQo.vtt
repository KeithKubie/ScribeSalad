00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:03.162
- [Instructor] We are
told that a zookeeper

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:05.204
took a random sample of 30 days

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.077
and observed how much food an elephant ate

00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.751
on each of those days.

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.584
The sample mean was 350 kilograms,

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:17.085
and the sample standard
deviation was 25 kilograms.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.753
The resulting 90% confidence interval

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:25.654
for the mean amount of
food was from 341 kilograms

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:27.071
to 359 kilograms.

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:30.396
Which of the following statements

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:35.344
is a correct interpretation
of the 90% confidence level?

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:36.572
So like always, pause this video

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:39.077
and see if you can
answer this on your own.

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:40.758
So before we even look at these choices,

00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:42.729
let's just make sure we're
reading the statement

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.572
or interpreting the statement correctly.

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:47.458
A zookeeper is trying to figure out

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:50.286
what the true expected amount

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:52.400
of food an elephant would eat on a day.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.773
You could view that as
the mean amount of food

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.395
that an elephant would eat on a day.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:57.655
If you view it as the number,

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:59.688
all the possible days as the population,

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:01.472
you could view this as the population mean

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:03.986
for mean amount of food per day.

00:01:03.986 --> 00:01:05.717
Now, the zookeeper doesn't know that,

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.035
and so instead they're
trying to estimate it

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.942
by sampling 30 days.

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:11.769
So let's think about it this way.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:12.602
If I...

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.121
So let's say that this is
the true population mean,

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.282
the true mean amount of food

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.203
that an elephant will eat in a day.

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:24.240
What the zookeeper can try to do is,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.285
well, they take a sample.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.646
In this case, they took
a sample of 30 days.

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:30.426
And they calculated a sample statistic,

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.872
in this case, the sample
mean of 350 kilograms.

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:34.910
I don't know if it's actually

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.808
to the right of the true parameter,

00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:39.442
but just for visualization
purposes let's say it is.

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:42.474
So let's say sample mean, and
this is their first sample,

00:01:42.474 --> 00:01:44.224
it was 350 kilograms.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.001
And then using the sample,

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:51.712
they were able to construct
a confidence interval

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:53.879
from 341 to 359 kilograms.

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:58.101
And so the confidence interval,
I'll draw it like this.

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:02.582
We actually aren't sure
if it actually overlaps

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:05.365
with the true mean like I'm drawing here,

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.167
but just for the sake of
visualization purposes,

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.221
let's say that this one happened to.

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.891
The whole point of a 90% confidence level

00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:13.760
is if I kept doing this,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.959
so this is our first sample

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.878
and the associated interval
with that first sample.

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:20.794
And then if I did another sample,

00:02:20.794 --> 00:02:23.736
let's say this is the
mean of that next sample,

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:25.486
so that's sample mean two,

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:27.856
and I have an associated
confidence interval.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.692
And that interval,

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:31.323
not only the start and
end points will change,

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.228
but the actual width of
the interval might change

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:36.716
depending on what my sample looks like.

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:39.263
What a 90% confidence level means,

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:40.935
that if I keep doing this,

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:44.165
that 90% of my confidence intervals

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.962
should overlap with the true parameter,

00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:49.360
with the true population mean.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.874
So, now, with that out of the way,

00:02:50.874 --> 00:02:52.905
let's see which of these
choices are consistent

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.822
with that interpretation.

00:02:54.822 --> 00:02:57.868
Choice A, the elephant
ate between 341 kilograms

00:02:57.868 --> 00:03:01.880
and 359 kilograms on
90% of all of the days.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.523
No, that is definitely
not what is going on here.

00:03:05.523 --> 00:03:06.805
We're not talking about what's happening

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:11.222
on 90% of the days, so
let's rule this choice out.

00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:15.071
There is a 0.9 probability
that the true mean amount

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.738
of food is between 341 kilograms

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:20.472
and 359 kilograms.

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:25.417
So this one is interesting,
and it is a tempting choice,

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:28.194
because when we do this one sample,

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:31.038
you can kind of say, all right,

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:33.475
if I did a bunch of these samples,

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:37.356
90% of them, if we have
a 90% confidence interval

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:42.062
or 90% confidence level, should
overlap with this true mean,

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:43.946
with the population parameter.

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.803
The reason why this is a
little bit uncomfortable

00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:48.771
is it makes the true mean

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:50.690
sound almost like a random variable,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.033
that it could kind of jump around,

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.172
and it's the true mean that kind of

00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:55.702
is either gonna jump into this interval

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.097
or not jump into this interval,

00:03:57.097 --> 00:04:00.353
so it causes a little bit of unease.

00:04:00.353 --> 00:04:02.384
So I'm just gonna put
a question mark here.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:03.808
In repeated sampling,

00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:05.717
okay, I like the way
that this is starting.

00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:08.902
In repeated sampling, this
method produces intervals.

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:09.892
Yep, that's what it does.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.849
Every time you sample,
you produce an interval.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.590
That capture the population
mean in about 90% of samples.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.096
Yeah, that's exactly
what we're talking about.

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:19.346
If we just kept doing this,

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:24.045
if we have well-constructed
90% confidence intervals,

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:25.778
that if we kept doing this,

00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:29.662
90% of these constructed sampled intervals

00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:32.495
should overlap with the true mean.

00:04:33.527 --> 00:04:35.094
So I like this choice.

00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:37.348
But let's just read
choice D to rule it out.

00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:41.978
In repeated sampling, this
method produces a sample mean

00:04:41.978 --> 00:04:45.166
between 341 kilograms and 359 kilograms

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.628
in about 90% of samples.

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:51.722
No, the confidence interval
does not put a constraint on

00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.062
that 90% of the time you
will have a sample mean

00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:55.301
between these values.

00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.720
It is not trying to do that.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.887
It is definitely choice C.
