00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.190
If an adopted individual wanted to find his or her parents,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.200
they might choose to look by signing up for a genome

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.940
service that will get their genome's information and compare it to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.350
everyone else's genome in the system to see if there's a match.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.370
For example, you'd imagine we might just take some of the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.790
sequence from the adopted person and compare it letter for letter, to

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.790
a sequence from a random person. We could even do the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.560
comparisons with a lot of random people. But there are three billion

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.000
base pairs in every genome. Six billion once you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.290
count both copies of all your chromosomes from each parent.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.810
So doing a letter by letter comparison of the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.510
whole thing would take such a long time and a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.630
lot of computational power. Instead, the general technique used

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.000
for comparisons is similar to that used to match DNA

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.280
at crime scenes, or even in paternity tests. It involves

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.000
the general statistical process known as sampling. Sampling is concerned

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.070
with the selection of a subset of individuals

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.210
from within a population. To estimate characteristics about the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.260
whole population. In this case instead of looking

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.570
at all three billion letters in the human genome,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.110
we'll select a random subset of letters, let's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.020
say a million from one genome and compare the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.570
same subset from one genome to another. So

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.070
if we do this random sampling. What do you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.640
think are two advantages of random sampling compared to total

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.160
genome sequencing? Make sure you check two of the answers.
