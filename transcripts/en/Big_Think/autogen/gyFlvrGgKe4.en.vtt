I'm gonna ask you a question what would

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
I'm gonna ask you a question what would
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.740
I'm gonna ask you a question what would
happen if the earth was a cube or if it

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
happen if the earth was a cube or if it
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.710
happen if the earth was a cube or if it
wasn't but what what happened if it was

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
wasn't but what what happened if it was
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.080
wasn't but what what happened if it was
what the gravity we wear or the same

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090
what the gravity we wear or the same
 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.170
what the gravity we wear or the same
thank you for answering my question that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
thank you for answering my question that
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.220
thank you for answering my question that
is a great question

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
is a great question
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.080
is a great question
and I can give you a real science answer

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090
and I can give you a real science answer
 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.810
and I can give you a real science answer
the earth is not a cube because it has

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
the earth is not a cube because it has
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.510
the earth is not a cube because it has
enough stuff it has enough rocks and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
enough stuff it has enough rocks and
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.520
enough stuff it has enough rocks and
metals and water and lava and everything

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530
metals and water and lava and everything
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.569
metals and water and lava and everything
that all pull on each other equally and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579
that all pull on each other equally and
 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.340
that all pull on each other equally and
this every time you do that you get a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
this every time you do that you get a
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.939
this every time you do that you get a
ball you get a sphere in other words if

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
ball you get a sphere in other words if
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.790
ball you get a sphere in other words if
you made a cubical earth and it was

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
you made a cubical earth and it was
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.910
you made a cubical earth and it was
orbiting the Sun and so on after a few

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
orbiting the Sun and so on after a few
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.229
orbiting the Sun and so on after a few
years

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239
years
 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.030
years
pick a number a few million years it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
pick a number a few million years it
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.719
pick a number a few million years it
would squish itself into a ball and so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
would squish itself into a ball and so
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.590
would squish itself into a ball and so
when we study asteroids we go out there

apparently right there at the having

just enough stuff to make it into a ball

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
just enough stuff to make it into a ball
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.840
just enough stuff to make it into a ball
it's cool so it's because everything's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
it's cool so it's because everything's
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330
it's cool so it's because everything's
pushing and the same thing in the same

pushing and the same thing in the same
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520
pushing and the same thing in the same
direction all the time on everything

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
direction all the time on everything
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.999

else it resolves itself or it ends up as

a ball try this get some marbles and a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
a ball try this get some marbles and a
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.839
a ball try this get some marbles and a
big rubber band and put the marble on a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
big rubber band and put the marble on a
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940
big rubber band and put the marble on a
tabletop put the marbles in the rubber

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
tabletop put the marbles in the rubber
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.790
tabletop put the marbles in the rubber
band and just kind of wiggle it around

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
band and just kind of wiggle it around
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.190
band and just kind of wiggle it around
you'll see it'll become a circle it will

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
you'll see it'll become a circle it will
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.050
you'll see it'll become a circle it will
not if you try to make it into a square

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
not if you try to make it into a square
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.020
not if you try to make it into a square
the rubber band will blink will burn

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
the rubber band will blink will burn
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.690
the rubber band will blink will burn
slowly bring it all back into a circle

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
slowly bring it all back into a circle
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.260
slowly bring it all back into a circle
and so a planet becoming a ball is like

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270
and so a planet becoming a ball is like
 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.090
and so a planet becoming a ball is like
the rubber band and the marbles but all

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
the rubber band and the marbles but all
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.240
the rubber band and the marbles but all
in three dimensions instead of two in a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250
in three dimensions instead of two in a
 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.910
in three dimensions instead of two in a
ball instead of just a circle a circle

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
ball instead of just a circle a circle
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.820
ball instead of just a circle a circle
rotated through a circle it's a cool

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830
rotated through a circle it's a cool
 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.700
rotated through a circle it's a cool
question so the reason planets are

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
question so the reason planets are
 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.740
question so the reason planets are
spheres or balls is because they have

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
spheres or balls is because they have
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.320
spheres or balls is because they have
enough gravity pulling all in this

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
enough gravity pulling all in this
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960
enough gravity pulling all in this
pulling all the stuff together at the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
pulling all the stuff together at the
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.930
pulling all the stuff together at the
same time that there you end up with no

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
same time that there you end up with no
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.860
same time that there you end up with no
sharp edges no irregular bumps three

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
sharp edges no irregular bumps three
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240
sharp edges no irregular bumps three
it's cool

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
it's cool
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830
it's cool
except us in outer space there's no

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
except us in outer space there's no
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710

sound it just goes
