00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.430
STEVE MOULD: I'm talking about
an insect called a cicada.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.020
They're in the news at the
moment in America.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.450
They are a small
flying insect.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.500
And the reason they're in the
news at the moment is because

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.390
they spend a huge amount of
their lives underground.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.780
And very occasionally, they come
out in a big swarm for

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.440
the three F's-- feeding,
fighting, and mating.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.870
And in America, this particular
cicada, it's called

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.290
a periodical cicada.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.790
And this one comes out
every 17 years.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.630
The reason I want to talk
about it is because it

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.980
illustrates an interesting way
that nature does maths,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.610
because if you want to do maths,
if you want to solve a

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.140
problem in mathematics, what you
do is you start with all

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500
the facts that you
already know.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.670
You combine those facts together
using mathematical

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.830
logic to create some new fact
that you didn't know before.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.697
So that's how you would prove
something in mathematics, how

00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:56.260
you would solve a problem.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.740
This is not what
they look like.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.470
But let's have a go.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.670
OK, so there's kind of--

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.750
imagine you've got
a lovely wing.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.959
There you go.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.240
It's mostly wing.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.690
Big buggly red eyes.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.320
Maybe there's an antenna kind of
going on, legs coming out,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340
something like that.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.993
BRADY HARAN: That's real?

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:17.436
Are you serious?

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:17.880
STEVE MOULD: Yeah.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.020
I mean, look, it's as close
as we're going to get.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.800
I know it looks like kind of
a weird cow or something.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.240
This illustrates the way
that nature does maths.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.690
It's basically, instead of
having this logical,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.550
methodical process, you just
sort of have a guess.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.540
And you see if your
answer's correct.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.480
You test it.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.630
And if it's not correct, then
you try a new answer and see

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.095
if that gets you any closer, and
you keep trying and trying

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:43.830
and trying.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.140
So it's a process of
trial and error.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.670
And this is genuinely a way that
you can solve problems in

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.550
mathematics.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.490
I think that the best example
of trial and error that the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.860
world has ever seen
is evolution,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.000
sort of natural selection.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.450
So how has this happened
with the cicada?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.840
Well, the first thing to know
about the cicada is that it

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.800
has a really interesting method
of protecting itself

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.840
against predators.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.949
And that is something called
predator satiation, which is

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.440
basically where you make
yourself so numerous that your

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.130
predator is literally full.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.610
It's too full, can't
eat anymore.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.300
And that's how you survive.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.020
But you sort of think, well,
how can that work?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.170
Surely if you satiate your
predator, then your predator

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.190
is just going to come back
stronger in the next

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.660
generation and eat
even more of you.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.270
That can only work for the
predator if the predator can

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.650
make its life cycle the
same as yours, so it's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.570
in step with you.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.180
So it's eating when you're
out and about doing

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.380
your thing as well.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.130
And so the next thing the cicada
does is to make its

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.130
life cycle really,
really long, too

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.990
long for the predator.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.730
For some reason, predators can't
have this really long

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.450
life cycle.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.860
So that's why the cicada has
this really long life cycle.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.280
It's to kind of get out of
step with the predator.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.150
So let's look at that
on the number line.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.650
1, 2, 3, 4--

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.830
15, 16, 17.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.570
So let's write those out.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.250
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4--

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.560
15, 16, 17.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.260
So this particular cicada that's
in the news comes out

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.510
every 17 years.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.150
There's another one that comes
out every 13 years.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.620
Is that important?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.340
Could it be some other thing?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.410
So for example, what if
the cicada chose a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.390
12-year life cycle?

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.610
The predator, that's too
long for the predator.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.010
It can't wait 12 years.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.640
But the predator still
has a trick.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.370
So maybe the predator has a
6-year life cycle instead.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.560
So the predator comes
out after 6 years.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.130
There's a predator comes
out there, and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.290
there are no cicadas.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.000
But the next generation of the
predator, that's at 12 years.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.790
And suddenly, there are loads
of cicadas there.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.960
And so every other generation
of the predator is able to

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.050
feed on cicadas.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.040
And that gives them advantage,
and they will grow, and they

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.450
will flourish.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.840
Or if 6 years is too long,
how about a 4-year cycle?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.840
So we go 4 years, no cicadas.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.870
8 years, no cicadas.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.010
12 years, cicadas.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.440
If 4 is too long, you could even
have a 3-year life cycle.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.149
So the first 3 years,
no cicadas.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.865
The second 3 years,
no cicadas.

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:21.029
The third 3 years, no cicadas.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.130
The fourth lot of 3 years,
that's 12 years, cicadas.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.540
Even 2 years, that will
work as well.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.440
So if you're a cicada and you
choose a 12-year life cycle,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.700
that's a terrible decision,
because 12 has all these

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.610
things that you can
divide it into.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.950
So 12 is divisible by 6,
divisible by 4, divisible by

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.920
3, and divisible by 2.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.630
So if you're a cicada, you need
to choose a life cycle

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.940
which is not divisible
by anything.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.850
So Brady, what's a
number that's not

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.662
divisible by anything?

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:49.654
BRADY HARAN: I'm no expert.

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:51.440
But I would reckon you're
heading here

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.220
towards prime numbers?

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.650
STEVE MOULD: Prime numbers.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.110
Exactly.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.020
So that is why the cicada has
chosen a 13-year life cycle

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.040
and a 17-year life cycle.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.650
It's the solution to a
mathematical problem.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.440
And it's the discovery of prime

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.510
numbers by natural selection.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.200
Absolutely amazing.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.420
Yeah.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.450
So a cicada lives
for 17 years.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.870
But 16 of those years are spent
underground in a sort of

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.410
larval state.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.970
And then they come out in a big
swarm in the 17th year.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.390
BRADY HARAN: 13 and 17 years
seems like a long time.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.210
There are a lot of prime numbers
lower than that.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.520
STEVE MOULD: Well,
yes, there are.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.950
But I suppose the issue with
smaller numbers is that just

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.010
maybe the predator could
stretch to having a

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.440
life cycle that long.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.100
And so they can get
into step with it.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.720
The great thing is, by the way,
if you've got, say, a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.170
13-year life cycle and your
predator has a 4-year life

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.180
cycle, how often will the
predator and the prey meet?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.060
Well, it's 4 times 13,
or 4 times 17.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.760
So you have to multiply the two
numbers together, and it

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.100
becomes this enormous thing.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.380
And that's the genius.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.940
If there was some common factor
to these two, then you

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.380
wouldn't have to multiply
them together to find

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.900
out when they meet.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.100
It would be a much
smaller number.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.760
The predator is a wasp.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.650
It's called the cicada-killing
wasp.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.030
I don't know where they got
that name from, but

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.050
those guys are crazy.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.690
Yeah, the wasp is great.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.550
It basically kills the
cicada with a sting.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.540
And then it plants an egg inside
the cicada's dead body,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.040
which then feeds on it from the
inside and then releases a

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.050
wasp at the end of this.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.770
Great way to go.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.650
But yeah, I love the idea of
satiating your predator.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.820
You really don't want to be in
the vanguard of the cicada

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.310
group when that's your policy.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.990
You have to go really far down
this approximation route

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.840
before you get close to the
golden ratio, much more so

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.960
than pi or whatever.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.180
So the golden ratio is the
most irrational number.
