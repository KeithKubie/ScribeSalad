Nursing can be surprising in the fact that
you don't realize how much of a person's life,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:24.716
psycho-social, nutrition, everything ties
into their health status and nursing is really

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:29.346
about taking everything that's about that
person's life and putting it into care.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:35.006
I chose the University of Arizona's College of
Nursing because of it's hands on curriculum.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:40.186
Within the skills lab, we're really
able to simulate a real life experience

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:45.876
so we have mannequins with computers,
we can actually set vital signs,

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:52.256
we can set heart sounds, lung sounds,
bodily functions, communication,

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:59.336
and it really provides a very real life
experience for the students as much as possible.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:05.596
In a simulation setting when students encounter
a situation that's stressful and high pressure,

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.026
occasionally people do freeze up.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:09.146
That's okay.

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:10.346
That's alright.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:12.176
That's part of the learning experience.

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:18.076
Our students are able to go right next door
to the University of Arizona medical center

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:25.596
and they're a part of the research and the
medical care provided at this excellent center.

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:34.226
We offer them a multitude of different areas
of care from the pediatrics to the adults

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:41.006
to neuro-patients to oncology patients and I
think the more opportunities they have to care

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.116
for different kind of patients the more
of a well rounded nurse they will be.

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:49.026
The skills are a vital portion
of what the students need

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.206
to learn as they go through the courses.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:55.416
He's one of those teachers that if you don't
understand something he can retell it 50

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.986
different ways until you get it.

00:01:57.196 --> 00:02:00.426
There are other aspects of
nursing that they gain.

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:05.186
It's becoming confident and
proud of what you're doing.

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:08.426
Becoming a nurse is extremely
a prideful profession.

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:13.646
We're trusted by all and the
students need to learn this.

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:16.366
I think they learn it through
example, it's not something

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.526
that I can take to a classroom and teach you.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:24.986
I look at it as we're caring for a person
as opposed to we are caring for a diagnosis.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:32.256
I'm actually an honors student, working on an
honor's thesis and so I've been able to go out

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:36.486
and interact with nurses in the field
I'm looking at which is school nursing

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:41.096
and teem pregnancy prevention so
they've set up opportunities for me

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:46.296
but I wouldn't have been able to get myself
if it hadn't been for the help of the faculty.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:50.266
I'm gonna go and present my
research to the Western Institute

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.626
of Nursing which it's incredible.

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:55.606
I never thought I'd be able to do that.

00:02:56.206 --> 00:03:01.416
I just feel so empowered and
able to make people feel better,

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:05.966
it touches your heart every time they say, you
know the nurses are what makes the difference

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:10.826
in my treatment and you know that the way
you care for someone has a direct impact

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:17.336
on their recovery or if they're
terminal, making the end of life

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.206
as comfortable for them as possible.

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:25.596
I feel confident that with the skills I
have and with the skills I'm going to get,

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:38.736
I will be the best nurse
I can be and the College

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:43.376
of Nursing has really prepared me for that.
