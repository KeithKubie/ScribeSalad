00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.889
Some are saying sitting is the new smoking.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.889
A little dramatic?

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:05.889
Yes.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:07.049
Kind of accurate?

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.750
Kind of yes.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.829
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.019
Is anyone else slightly terrified of losing
dependence when you get old?

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.300
It's sort of like an ongoing existential crisis
for me that's destroying my youthful years.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.490
Of course, declining health in old age is
a good incentive to stay healthy, physically

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.630
and emotionally.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.610
Which means eating right and getting moderate
exercise in every week.....right?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.610
WRONG.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.270
THAT'S STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.180
....At least according to a new study published
in the Journal of Physical Activity &amp; Health.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
The researchers at Harvard, Northwestern,
and the CDC found that while getting your

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.420
150 minutes a week of exercise IS important
for maintaining good health, it miiiiight

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.469
not provide the same kind of protection as,
say...getting off your butt and not sitting

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.469
so much.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.940
The scientists found that sedentary hours
were a better predictor than moderate exercise

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.530
when it comes to things like being able to
get around the house, being able to feed yourself,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.750
staying out of nursing homes and general independence
when you're old.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.690
For every hour of sitting, there was a 46%
decrease in the ability to perform everyday

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.410
tasks in those over 60.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.600
The researchers also found that those most
likely to be sitting too much were older,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.250
male, more educated but less wealthy, smokers,
and those who have a chronic illness.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.540
Their research attributes 5.3 million deaths
per year (worldwide)....to sitting.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.980
Other studies have found that for every hour
of TV watched when you're older than 25, 22

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.310
minutes are shaved off the lifespan.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
YIKES!

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.282
It's like a 21st century nightmare straight
out of Wall-E. Sitting is a obviously a huge

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:43.030
problem and it's not something we talk (or
think) about so much.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.360
At least not as much as diet and exercise.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.360
It seems that as we shift away from manual
labor types of jobs to computer-based desk

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.170
jobs, sitting is becoming harder and harder
to avoid.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.170
BUT!

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.170
There is hope yet!

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.100
The researchers say that gradually moving
toward standing more or getting more steps

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.320
into your day can have a dramatic effect.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.110
As little as an extra half hour per day of
not sitting can improve your long term health.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.739
I've started to notice standing desks or treadmill
desks getting more popular.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.299
It seems like we're just going to need to
adapt to stay healthy with this emerging 21st

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.890
century lifestyle.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.959
The researchers are now looking into the question
of "just how much sitting is *too much*?"

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.650
So folks, how much do YOU sit everyday?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.819
Tell us the number of hours down below or
on our Facebook page, we'll see if we can

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.159
get a DNews average.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.459
Thanks for joining me!

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.309
I'll cya next time.
