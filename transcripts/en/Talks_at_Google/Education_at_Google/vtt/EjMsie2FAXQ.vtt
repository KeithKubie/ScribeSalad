REBECCA MOORE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.400
Welcome to Academics at Google.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.650
My name's Rebecca Moore, and I'm
the lead for the Google Earth

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.550
Engine and Earth
Outreach projects.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.830
It's my great pleasure to
introduce Randy Sargent, whom

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.100
I've known since 2005
when we worked together

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.120
on publishing some innovative
layers in Google Earth, which

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.120
allowed people to fly in
seconds from outer space

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.250
to see the eyelashes on a camel.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.670
He's currently holding
dual appointments

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.950
on the faculty at
Carnegie Mellon University

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.150
and also here at Google.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.440
As a visiting scientist with
my Google Earth Engine team,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.830
Randy's helping to research and
develop time-lapse explorable

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.260
maps, including a recently
released time-lapse animation

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.380
of the entire earth from 1984
to 2012, which was mosaiced

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.300
for more than two million
Landsat satellite images.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.080
Earlier this year Timelapse
won the People's Choice Webby

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.090
for best use of moving
images and video on the web.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.610
As a senior system scientist
at CMU's Create Lab,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.230
Randy researches for
the Explorables Project,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.950
developing ways to interactively
explore and understand

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.610
large data sets and
complex systems, including

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.850
air and water quality and
employment in economic trends.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.870
Prior to CMU and Google, Randy
helped develop planetary Rover

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.460
software at NASA, and he
received his BS and MS

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.380
from MIT.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.800
So welcome, Randy.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:44.657
RANDY SARGENT:
Thank you, Rebecca.

00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:46.240
Thank you, Rebecca,
and thanks so much

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240
for everyone being here.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480
So most of what I'm
going to talk about

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.100
is the work of two different
teams-- the Earth Engine

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.100
team here at Google and
also the Explorables

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.840
team at Carnegie Melon
University's Create Lab.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.790
First I want to really
dig into Earth Engine

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.530
and get you motivated
about why it's so cool

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.055
and why it really
motivated those of us

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:26.140
at CMU to come here and
work on this project.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.190
Earth Engine in a
very, very short form

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.350
is what happens when you
take all of the images that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.660
come from the many dozens
of scientific spacecraft

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140
orbiting the planet
run by the US

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.950
government and
other governments,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.400
take the data out of
these sorts of archives,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420
and put them into this sort of
place, which is a Google data

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.450
center where we put all of
the image data co-located

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.350
with the CPU to actually
process that data.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.960
One of the earliest projects
but the Earth Engine team

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.250
undertook with the entire
corpus of Landsat images

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.850
that go back over 40
years now is can we

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.790
build cloud-free mosaics
of the entire planet?

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.250
Now cloud-free mosaics
in some places are easy,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.300
but this place in particular
is in the middle of Brazil.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.280
It's a very, very
rainy and cloudy place.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.550
Up until recently,
the best you could do

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.000
were pictures kind of like this.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.690
So now without the clouds.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.170
And here's all of South America.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.170
This is the best we could do
prior to the Earth Engine.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.380
This is painstakingly
mosaicing kind

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.395
of the best of all
the Landsat scenes.

00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:48.895
But with Earth
Engine what we can do

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.840
is statistically go through
entire stacks with Landsat

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.420
and find all the places
around the clouds.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.620
So we can kind of
combine different pieces

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.940
of different scenes together
and build a cloud-free mosaic

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.620
of all of South America
that looks like this.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.410
So one of the
first deliverables,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.220
if you will, from Earth Engine
was a new cloud-free base

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.611
map that you see today in Google
Maps and Google Earth both.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.810
What else can you do with
this entire petabyte scale

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.550
archive of remote
sensing data and images?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.410
What other sorts of
analysis can be performed?

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.140
One of the early successes is
this publication in science.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.810
And with it comes the
following data product, which

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:51.320
is a map of forest change
across the planet from 2000

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.660
into present day.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.940
And this is a map where
we can zoom in all the way

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.250
to 30 meters per pixel.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.120
So if we zoom in to the Amazon
rainforest, for example,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.610
we'll see a lot of these
red areas down below,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.240
which are places where the
forest has been going away.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.810
The bright green
areas are places

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.810
where the forest was there
both at the beginning

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.750
and also the end
of the sequence.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.490
And you'll see
some places in blue

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.980
where a forest
actually reappeared.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.650
We can go around the
entire planet this way.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.370
We can take a look at the
southeastern United States

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.300
where you see a lot red,
you see a lot of blue,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.920
and then you see-- so red
and blue are places where

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.070
the first has gone
and then come back.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.670
And purple actually
is places where

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.150
it's changed both directions.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.370
So these are places that
are heavily forested

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.980
but tend to go back
after cutting down.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.490
One of the really
important things

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.210
about taking this incredible
archive of imagery

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.980
and turning it into
this product is

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.000
we're turning data
into knowledge.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.580
We're taking this
stack of images

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.440
and be able to provide
analysis on top

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.800
to be able to say things like
the rate of deforestation

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.435
over these 12 years in
Brazil has been going down.

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:19.950
So it's been decelerating.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.304
Whereas in Indonesia,
the rate of deforestation

00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:24.220
has been accelerating.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.166
So let me jump in to what
it's like to actually write

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.415
some code inside Earth Engine.

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:34.730
And I want to show you just
a very short example which

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.140
is one of my favorites.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.194
You may recognize this
as lights at night,

00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:42.610
and if we go around
the planet you

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.954
can see yes, it looks
like lights at night.

00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:47.495
But if I bring it
up to layers, there

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:49.850
are actually two
different years here.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.820
So I can switch back and forth
between showing 1992 and 2012.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.650
We can zoom into Europe
here and see the difference.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.766
You can see that by in
large 2012 is brighter.

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:04.210
But let's do a little bit
of analysis on top of that.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.366
So let's switch.

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:08.220
Let's add some more code.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.590
This is the code
what it looks like.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.930
We're going to
basically instantiate

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.690
the collection of all of
the lights at night images.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.150
We're going to attach
some time stamps to them.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.830
Then we're going to
do a linear regression

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.485
across every pixel in the map.

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:27.110
So every pixel we're
going to look back

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.310
to 1992 and through present
day and make a linear fit.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.030
And then we're going to
go add that to the map

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.010
and visualize it.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.150
This is what we have.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.720
So let me try and
explain what it

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.972
is where we're looking at here.

00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:44.180
We're seeing lights at night.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.660
You can see where the lights
and where they're not.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.920
But the hue is now
encoding whether the lights

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.970
are increasing or decreasing.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.800
The red areas are
areas of increase,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.325
and you can see
a few places that

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:58.290
are very strong in the red.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.930
So up here we have
Poland, for example,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.270
or all of China,
the southern part

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.050
of India-- lots of
interesting places.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.240
Places of blue are places where
we're decreasing the lights.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.650
And perhaps we can zoom in
here to a really blue area.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.190
And if we turn it
of for a moment

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.690
and you look--
see here's Poland.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.930
Let's turn off and see
where we are on the map.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.180
It's this big, blue area that's
been in the news recently.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.480
So this is Ukraine.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.860
So Ukraine is in the middle of
Poland, Romania, and Russia,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.230
which are all showing
a lot of increase.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.809
This is right on the border.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.480
So lots of really interesting
things you can see in this map.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.210
I want to zoom into
the United States.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.780
And you'll see
places where there's

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.410
a lot of growth around
the urban areas.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.110
So for example, Dallas Fort
Worth area we see a lot of red

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.755
where the lights
have been increasing.

00:08:54.755 --> 00:08:58.105
We've been increasing
the urbanization--

00:08:58.105 --> 00:08:59.930
the urban footprint there.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.740
And in the Northeast, we
see a lot of bluer areas.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.850
And what's going on there?

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.090
Have we really been
losing population?

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.400
Only in a few places.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.440
For example, Pittsburgh lost
a little bit of population

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.890
during this time,
but not a whole lot.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.520
Turns out what we're
seeing here, by in large,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.670
is a side effect of energy
efficiency and reduction

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.030
of light pollution.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.030
So if you want to
illuminate your streets

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.450
and you're highways,
you want all the photons

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.400
to be going down and
not so much going up.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.650
So as we've been doing that
more and more efficiently,

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.410
you can see the
evidence from space.

00:09:36.037 --> 00:09:37.120
Let me switch gears a bit.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.530
So I talked about Earth
Engine and kind of what's cool

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.950
and how you can get involved
like very, very quickly

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.562
and do some interesting stuff.

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:46.020
I want to switch
gears and now talk

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.710
about kind of the
other team that's

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.050
come together in this project.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.220
So at the Carnegie Melon
Create Lab where I work,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.010
we do a lot of different
sorts of projects,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.690
mostly around empowerment
of public and communities,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.055
around technology, around
data, around understanding.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.406
Rebecca alluded to the
Explorables project.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.030
This is a project
that we're working on

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.810
to try to make especially
time series data,

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.650
whether it's perhaps time series
images of the planet or time

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.130
series other sorts
of things explorable

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.500
and more understandable.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.780
So when we got together
and combined Explorables

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.810
with what Earth Engine was
starting to put together,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.090
let me show you kind of
what came out of that.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.560
I'm going to zoom
out of this map

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.520
and make it full screen here.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.730
Do you remember that the
cloud-free mosaic that

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.225
was built out of all
the Landsat scenes?

00:10:44.225 --> 00:10:46.380
What we've done
here in Earth Engine

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.540
is build not one
cloud-free mosaic,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.570
but 29 cloud-free mosaics.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.590
So now we have an
animated map, if you will.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.510
We've taken the 29, and
we're playing through them

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.470
in a video.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.924
So where kind of a normal
Google Maps or Google Earth

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:03.340
you can zoom in
and see something,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.005
here we can zoom in
and see it change.

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:13.530
So let's zoom in, for
example, to Southwestern US.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.355
This is Las Vegas.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.590
So you see over
the 29 years here,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.485
Las Vegas is growing a lot.

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:27.325
And we can zoom in even
further and see kind

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:29.520
of in great detail
what's happening.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.740
We can see the suburbs forming
and expanding outwards.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.500
We can see how the runways
have to double up here

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.210
in the airport.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.620
We also have pan to the
east and look at Lake Mead.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.755
So this is the site
of the Hoover Dam.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:49.260
And at that same 29 years
when Las Vegas is growing,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.850
Lake Mead is shrinking.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.390
So you can see this thing
starts off as an island,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.845
and it's not an
island by the end.

00:11:56.845 --> 00:11:59.820
So you can see, in
several different ways,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.080
our footprint on the earth here.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.365
Let's move down to
South America where

00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:09.730
we were looking at some of
the deforestation analysis.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.680
Let's zoom in kind of as far
as Landsat will let us go.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.211
We're in the Brazilian
state of Rondonia.

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:20.330
And I'm going to slow down the
animation a little bit here.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.210
Let's go to super slow here.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.700
You'll see initially the
roads all start to be built.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700
And around the roads
there are these farms.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.620
And understand that from left to
right here, from east to west,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.680
we're talking about
maybe 50 kilometers.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.680
So these are big farms that are
being cut out of the forest,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.630
primarily for soybean
or for raising cattle.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.870
You can see a small
town is forming

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.240
in the middle of the image here.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.770
Let's zoom out a bit.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.572
So now we're seeing
maybe a quarter

00:12:54.572 --> 00:12:56.030
of the Brazilian
state of Rondonia.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.240
We're going to speed back up.

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:04.550
And you can see this
road stretch out

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:09.830
and how quickly this
entire area kind of fills.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.490
You can also see some
interesting shapes appear.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.000
So now we're looking at the
entire state of Rondonia.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.770
And you'll see these
funny little cutout areas.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.290
And we're going to get back
to these in a little while.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.210
But just keep in mind
that deforestation is not

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.176
happening everywhere, but it's
happening a lot of places.

00:13:27.176 --> 00:13:30.900
Let's zoom out even further.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.390
Now we can clearly
see the Amazon River.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.360
We can see a lot of
different things.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.980
But if you look along the
southern extent of the Amazon,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.285
you see it retreating.

00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:49.010
And the scale is--
first time I saw

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.150
this I was blown away,
because I didn't understand

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.166
that if you could look at
it from space like this,

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:57.540
you could still
see it happening.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.860
It's that big, what's going on.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.550
So I'm going to zoom
in to another spot.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:10.716
So now we're at the tributaries
to the Amazon in Bolivia.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:14.180
And we're right off of
the Andes Mountains.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.060
And here you see a different
sort of thing happening.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.860
Watch the rivers go.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.230
These are called meanders,
and the river is meandering.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.950
And what that means is that
as the sedimentation comes

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.240
from the Andes and
gets deposited,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.980
the river actually
changes its banks.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.800
It moves to different places.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.320
And you'll see in places
where the rivers loop back so

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.930
far that they meet
themselves and they end up

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.355
orphaning these little
ringed lakes that

00:14:42.355 --> 00:14:43.592
are called oxbow lakes.

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:45.300
And if we follow this,
we can follow this

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.402
all the way to the Amazon and
see this really impressive

00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:51.110
change happening.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.725
Moving a little bit to the west
here and to be east in Bolivia

00:15:02.725 --> 00:15:04.110
and you'll see another spot.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.800
And this is a spot where it's
really quite complicated what's

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.460
going on.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.010
So let me play it through
a few times faster

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.491
and then I'll slow
it down a bit.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.220
So you see a lot of
deforestation happening.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.451
You see a lot of forest
turning into farm.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.450
But this river is doing
something kind of crazy.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.870
You see, the river is actually
breaking free of its banks

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.460
and going a different
path, and then

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.275
you've got a third
path over here.

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:28.219
And if we slow it
down even further,

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.010
you'll see as it breaks
free of it's path--

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.520
I'm going to pull back in
time just a little bit--

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.720
so it breaks to its
new path, it actually

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.570
floods this entire area.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.310
So this area which had
been farming basically

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.059
got completely washed out.

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:43.350
So let's watch it again slowly.

00:15:46.535 --> 00:15:49.760
And this is one of the things
that rivers do in areas

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.610
where they're
depositing sedimentation

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.560
over a large area.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.160
So they evulse and they
switch between path and path,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.520
and they're basically
just dumping

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.455
sedimentation over this
entire area over time.

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:05.170
You see the same thing
like in river deltas.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:12.800
Let's look at some other things
that the water is doing here.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.240
So we're going to
get to Cape Cod.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.550
This is the south
end of Cape Cod.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.970
Let's speed it back up.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.220
What you see here is
the way that the beach

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.640
is changing over time.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.710
You'll see places where
things break through.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:37.730
You'll see places where
the beach has rebuilt.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.264
And you'll see that by in
large, most of the sand

00:16:40.264 --> 00:16:41.430
is moving towards the south.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.600
You can see similar
sorts of things

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.010
on the outer banks
of North Carolina.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.270
Let's go zoom in there.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.439
Let's move to Iran, where
we can see Lake Urmia.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:27.540
Lake Urmia is a very large
lake, but it's been shrinking.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.840
And most of the water that
has been historically going

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.140
into the lake is
now being diverted

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.720
into these agricultural areas.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.280
So you can see--
you know, first you

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.630
notice that the lake is
shrinking over these 29 years,

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.030
but you can see these
kind of green areas

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.280
around on each side, and that's
where the water has been going.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.210
Because the water's
been retreating,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.990
the water becomes
more salty, things

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.540
like fertilizer and
pesticide concentrate,

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.630
so it becomes less and
less good water for using.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.510
So you actually have,
in the tributaries,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.590
these sorts of dams being
built and new lakes being

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.150
formed to provide
more clean water.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.900
And of course that diverts even
more water from Lake Urmia.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.185
So Lake Urmia's days
are numbered I fear.

00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:23.600
Move over to Aral Sea.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.240
Aral Sea is the
same sort of thing

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.770
happening, but on a
much larger scale.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.492
Lake Urmia is much,
much larger-- I mean,

00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:32.607
Aral Sea is much
larger than Lake Urmia,

00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:33.940
but the same thing is happening.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.080
So we have-- we zoom out of it.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.620
We have these agricultural
areas where most of the water's

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.670
being diverted.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.750
Now let's zoom in on it to one
corner of the agriculture here.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.720
And this is a place
where you sort of reach

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.830
a peak of the irrigation.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.920
You can see, initially,
this wasn't farmed.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.130
It sort of, you
know, spread out.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.660
I'm going to slow
this down a bit.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.530
You see it turns green, but then
it turns gray towards the end.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.810
So this tried to maybe
overreach it a little bit here.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.900
Let's move to Saudi
Arabia, another place where

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.550
we're irrigating
in a very dry area.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.610
All the water for this
center pivot irrigation

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:27.080
is being taken from wells--
from water that was put there,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.920
you know, eons ago, so it's not
being replaced very quickly.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.200
So this can't last for long.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.910
You can see kind of how
crazy the extent of this is.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.275
Let's move from water to fire.

00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:51.275
Let's move to Australia.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.820
If you look closely
here you'll see

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.676
all these scars
appear from burns.

00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:07.300
And it's like the
areas actually become

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.320
lighter when the underlying
ground is shown after the burn.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.795
Let me slow this down a bit.

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:17.414
Now you can see for each one
of these fires kind of roughly

00:20:17.414 --> 00:20:19.580
where it started, what
direction the wind was going,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.870
and you can kind of see
the different paths here.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.210
Let's move to other disasters.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.815
Let's go to Mount Pinatubo.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.395
So this is the Caldera.

00:20:38.395 --> 00:20:42.100
And you can see-- and I'm going
to just grab the slider here

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.390
and move it all the
way back and hit play.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.610
And you'll see, as this
appears, all the rivers

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.825
of ash kind of going every
which way from Mount Pinatubo.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.210
Let's move to do glaciers.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.385
And we're going to go to Alaska
here to Mendenhall Glacier.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.670
However, over these
29 years, we can

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.300
see a lot of glacial
changes-- a lot

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.840
of evidence of climate change.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.300
So here, as we zoom
in, you can see

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.540
that the front
line of the glacier

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.030
retreating slowly
during the 29 years.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.340
Let me go back up here.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:35.810
Let's move to Columbia
Glacier, also in Alaska.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.090
Columbia Glacier has a
very impressive retreat.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.300
It retreated tens of kilometers,
starting from here then

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.630
all the way back.

00:21:50.923 --> 00:21:52.437
Now I'm going to
speed this back up.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:54.270
It's a little harder
to see when I speed up,

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.830
but I want to show you another
thing that's happening.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.740
So if we go to the glacial
tributaries, if you will,

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.470
these rivers of ice that are
emerging into Columbia Glacier,

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.480
watch closely and you will
see how the ice is moving.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.800
You'll see the motion
of these rivers

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.121
coming together and then
draining out into the sea.

00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:23.450
Let's move to another glacier
where that's even more obvious.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.775
This is Malaspina Glacier.

00:22:27.467 --> 00:22:29.300
There's not a lot of
retreat happening here,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.070
but you can see kind of how the
river-- how the ice is dumped

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.280
toward the top and then
moves slowly in these waves

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.635
out into the ocean.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.920
We started with
Las Vegas, but I'd

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.790
like to show you some
other cities now.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.380
This is Shanghai.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:00.930
And this area here is where
Shanghai Proper was in 1984.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.670
And you can see, as we
go through our 29 years,

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.724
that by the end, it's kind of
hard to tell where Shanghai

00:23:06.724 --> 00:23:07.890
ends and other things begin.

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:16.730
The size of what we're looking
at surely dwarfs Las Vegas.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:25.056
You can see incredible
amounts of land being added.

00:23:25.056 --> 00:23:26.760
You can zoom in here and watch.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.510
Let's move a bit south
to the Pearl River Delta.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.550
That's a sight of a lot of
electronics manufacture.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.690
And Hong Kong is
right about here.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.400
You can see over these 29 years,
we go from a lot of farmland

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.555
to huge urban expansion.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.955
Let's move to Dubai.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.030
Dubai is one of the
most impressive sites

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.400
of engineering new land.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.435
So we can look at the
islands being built here.

00:24:23.435 --> 00:24:26.780
Let's slow that one
down up too and zoom in.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.400
These are the Palm Islands.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.426
There are two sets.

00:24:31.426 --> 00:24:35.258
I'm going to hit pause and
just drag to the very end here.

00:24:35.258 --> 00:24:36.695
You can see both.

00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:42.060
Then let's look up
here to the north.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.310
These are the World Islands.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:50.050
If you look closely you can
see how they map to the world.

00:24:55.762 --> 00:24:58.080
I'm going to move
now to the place

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.610
where I grew up--
Dallas Fort Worth.

00:25:03.117 --> 00:25:08.860
And Dallas Fort Worth has an
incredible amount of sprawl.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.226
Sizewise, it's
growing quite rapidly,

00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:16.370
but it's not very
dense population-wise.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.030
So here we have
Dallas on the right

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.200
and Fort Worth on the left.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.480
And if we go up
north, you'll see

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.775
just incredible
suburbifications.

00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:28.600
Is that a word?

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.660
So let's pan to the west.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.930
And to the west here, if you
look really closely-- now we're

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.900
north of Fort Worth--
in the last roughly five

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.540
or six years of animation,
you see these kind

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.040
of funny little white dots.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.640
And I'm not sure
how many people are

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.290
able to see the white dots
from where you're sitting.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.740
Those white dots are fracking.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.890
So those are
actually paths where

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.990
we're doing hydraulic
fracturing looking for oil.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.490
This is the Barnett
Shale in Forth Worth.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.790
And it's both north and
south of Fort Worth.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.200
So if you look around, you'll
find this stuff pretty much

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.650
everywhere, including right
in the middle of urban areas.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.270
Let's move to Colorado.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.335
It's another site where there's
a lot of hydraulic fracturing

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:26.835
happening.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.670
So once again, you can
see the pads appear.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.320
Here we also have to build
the roads to get to the paths.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.820
Another type of resource
extraction in West Virginia

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.610
is mountaintop removal.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.530
So let's take a pan
over there and start

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.600
all the way zoomed in.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.240
So mountaintop removal is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.400
We're taking the
tops of mountains,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.100
removing them, putting them in
the valleys, and all the land

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.395
that were moving, we sift
through it for coal, basically.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.580
And you can see kind
of how devastating this

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.790
is to the area.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.820
It's also fairly unsafe in
terms of the water supply.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.520
And you've heard some
fairly high profile problems

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.440
with that.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.115
Now let me zoom out of it.

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:32.660
That thing we started
off is just there.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.830
And now we're seeing
kind of it's everywhere.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.390
I'll zoom out some more.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.980
You can see it's the expanse
of mountaintop removal.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.670
And we're not talking about
10 or even just 100 spots.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.140
Were talking about hundreds.

00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:50.800
Another type of resource
extraction-- this is also coal.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.187
This is open pit.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.900
You can see as we're digging
through, looking for coal,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.550
we're taking what
comes out and then

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.155
putting it where
the last bit was.

00:28:08.155 --> 00:28:10.950
So it kind of moves around
almost like a video game.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:22.250
Let's move to Alberta,
Canada, and look

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.440
at some of the things
happening around the tar sands.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.940
This is a huge facility.

00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:36.330
I do not know what all
the different pieces are.

00:28:47.715 --> 00:28:49.380
Now you're looking
at the tar sands,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.980
but if you look to
the east here you'll

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.760
see something that kind
of catches your eye.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.990
So this is logging.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:02.120
So we're cutting down
trees here for the wood.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.620
And if you look
closely, you'll see

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.950
that they get cut down twice--
once right at the beginning,

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.300
and once at the end.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.800
And if you watch
it, you'll actually

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.435
see that it's an
alternating pattern.

00:29:13.435 --> 00:29:16.164
So kind of the
evens were cut first

00:29:16.164 --> 00:29:17.330
and the odds were cut later.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.600
Let's look at another place
that's in active logging.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.770
This is in Washington state.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:40.520
We're seeing clear
cut in small patches.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.392
And then those slowly grow back
and then get clear cut again.

00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:47.780
So I said that we were going
to loop back to the Amazon

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.090
and look at some of the
patterns of deforestation there.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.340
So let's do that.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.530
Remember these
shapes-- especially

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.670
if we zoom into Rondonia here--
these funny little places where

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.210
people don't seem to
be cutting down trees.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.330
Let's turn on part
of the story here.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.390
This is the world database
of protected areas.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.170
And in green, we have kind
of every region that's

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.800
been recorded by Brazil
as a protected area.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.230
Now, different protected
areas are different.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.590
But this one in particular
belongs to a native people,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:24.200
the [INAUDIBLE], who Rebecca
and the Earth Outreach team

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.030
have worked with
personally in Brazil.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.670
You'll see that
this is territory

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.580
that belongs to them
that's been set aside

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.610
by the Brazilian government.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.290
It is illegal to
cut down trees here.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.900
But you can see
it happens anyway.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.320
You can see if we zoom in
people try to come in, sometimes

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.870
in the middle of the night, and
try to chop down some trees.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.760
My understanding is that
the peoples in this area

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.340
have moved most of their
population to the borders

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.012
to try and prevent that.

00:30:56.012 --> 00:30:58.460
And so they're trying to
police their own borders

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.860
and keep the illegal
loggers out right now.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.006
To me, this shows like
a very different story

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:08.380
than the kind of
depressing story

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.800
that I saw initially when I
first saw the deforestation.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.275
And you can also
start to see how

00:31:15.275 --> 00:31:16.832
it might be that
Brazil is trying

00:31:16.832 --> 00:31:18.600
to decelerate its deforestation.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.540
In places, we're
actually bumping right

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.090
into the areas that
have been set aside,

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:28.090
either for indigenous
peoples or for other reasons.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.050
Look around.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.260
Other spots, same story.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.740
Here we are in [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.760
In this area that
kind of sprouts out,

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.550
it almost like balloons
like an evil flower here.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.850
But it's basically steering
clear of these protected areas.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.650
And we have this database
now for the entire planet.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.730
So let's go take a
look at other spots.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:08.224
If we get to-- let's go
back to Washington state.

00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:12.960
We're going to look
at a reservation,

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.340
Native American reservation, in
Washington state-- the Quinault

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.030
Reservation.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:22.390
It's not protected nearly the
same way as the [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.970
You can't really
tell the difference.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.770
Let's move to another
spot in the US.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.130
There's a spot where
policy changed partway

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.820
through the animation.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.820
So look closely here.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.600
And at the beginning, you'll
see pretty much everything

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.565
is being deforested equally
between the left and the right.

00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:47.240
And towards the end,
you'll see a border appear.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.706
It's a little hard to see.

00:32:48.706 --> 00:32:51.205
But to the right is actually
the Clearwater National Forest.

00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:53.010
And by and large,
forests are not

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.284
protected from
being chopped down.

00:32:55.284 --> 00:32:57.200
Though, sometimes there
are different policies

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.315
inside the National
Forest than outside.

00:33:00.315 --> 00:33:01.315
Let's move to Indonesia.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.510
We're going to zoom in
to Tesso Nilo, which

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:19.091
was made somewhat famous by the
recent Showtime climate change

00:33:19.091 --> 00:33:19.590
series.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.850
This is the protected area.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.330
And you can't really
see the border at all.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.880
If we go to 2012,
you can't really

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.450
tell what's been protected
and what hasn't been.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
So that's the end
of the Landsat.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.500
Let me switch gears and move
to some other things here.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.640
One of the new areas
that we're pushing on

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.800
is what to do when you want to
visualize large amounts of data

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.350
that's not raster,
that's not image-based.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.040
And you'll see here we have
like maybe 3 million different

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.870
protected areas.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.142
But that's kind of small.

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:05.850
We're worried about,
like what about tens

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.170
of millions, hundreds of
millions, billions of things

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.320
which are not raster pixels?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.909
So you've probably
seen things that

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.870
look a little bit
like this up on top

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.050
or up on the bottom here.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:22.320
Or you've seen heat maps, which
are fairly low resolution.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.300
But I want to call your
attention back to the lights

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.761
at night.

00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:29.469
I want you to think
about lights at night

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.090
for a moment as
something different.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.010
So it is a raster product.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.980
It comes from a
raster satellite.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.040
But think about it not as
raster, but as a visualization.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.590
A really awesome visualization
of a billion light sources,

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.659
or billions of light sources.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.230
And I think you'll agree this
is superior to any of the three

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.050
things we just saw.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.850
So you're seeing an amazing
amount of expressivity.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.429
You're seeing quite clearly
where the cities are.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:59.942
You're seeing the
spider web of things

00:34:59.942 --> 00:35:02.150
that are joining the cities,
the interstate highways,

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.630
some things of that nature.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:08.940
You can even see like around
Chicago here, this funny area

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.690
where we start to color
out into Lake Michigan.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.960
So this is actually--
yeah, an optical effect

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.880
of normal camera systems.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.870
When the light gets
super-super bright,

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.130
the apparent image
starts to bleed outwards.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.500
And there a few different
mechanisms of that.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.170
The most common is simply that
when photons hit the lens,

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.420
they may or may not scatter.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.839
And you try and keep the
lens as clean as possible

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:38.380
to keep that from
happening too much.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.671
Though when you have a lot
of brightness in the middle,

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.520
you start to see that.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.150
So for normal people,
when they look at this,

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.066
they will tell you that that
pixel here right off of-- right

00:35:48.066 --> 00:35:51.880
in the middle of Chicago
is brighter than this pixel

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.380
down here.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.504
And it turns out it's not
actually true [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:54.504 --> 00:35:55.860
saturating the monitor.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.230
But you're inferring
from that because we're

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.560
talking the language of optics.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.810
Our eyes do the same thing.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.740
So we're kind of born
with this knowledge

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.796
that this must have
been brighter than this.

00:36:06.796 --> 00:36:08.670
Other things that you
can really express well

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.200
here are things that kind
of jump out as surprises.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.711
So if you look here, you can see
Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul.

00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:18.210
You have this weird
thing over here.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.865
And even if you didn't
know enough geography

00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:21.910
to know that there's
not really a city there,

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:22.946
it doesn't look right.

00:36:22.946 --> 00:36:24.820
It doesn't look the same
as the other cities.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.070
So you might think, well,
why don't we zoom in here?

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.870
And you look a little closer and
you say, what's going on here?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.880
You see all these strange
horizontal bands and you

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.610
wonder, what does that mean?

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.910
The first time I saw it, I
thought it was an artifact.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.701
I thought it was an
error of the satellite.

00:36:40.701 --> 00:36:42.065
We'll get back to that.

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.750
So I want to show you
the first visualization

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.144
we built kind of using
that as an inspiration.

00:36:58.144 --> 00:36:59.560
So I'm going to
stop the animation

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.865
and go straight to the end.

00:37:01.865 --> 00:37:07.030
And this is a visualization
of about 20 million

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:11.250
well pads from drilling
for oil and gas.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.250
This is in Pennsylvania.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.464
We can zoom out and take
a look at other places.

00:37:14.464 --> 00:37:16.630
And we're kind of doing the
same sort of trick where

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.130
if there are a lot
of them together,

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.490
we start to make them brighter.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.031
Then we start to
make them bleed out.

00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:23.300
So it kind of transitions
from individual points

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.460
you might see into a heat
map kind of on the fly,

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:27.980
if you will.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.350
As we zoom in here and
grab the animation slide,

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.280
and we go through just
the past few years,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.910
you'll see all the
fracking that's

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.450
happening in Pennsylvania.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.400
So these horizontal bands
over here are all fracking.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.000
We can go back to
Dallas, Fort Worth.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.050
And we can look at
what was going on

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.692
with all these strange
lights up in North Dakota.

00:37:58.692 --> 00:38:01.980
And it turns out, if you look
closely-- I'll switch to map.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.280
That's a little easier to see.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.655
Sure enough, all
these wells were

00:38:04.655 --> 00:38:06.737
being drilled in these
horizontal bands.

00:38:06.737 --> 00:38:07.820
Like, what's up with that?

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.160
So you zoom in a bit more, you
see these are all on the roads.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.242
And even in places where
you don't see the road,

00:38:13.242 --> 00:38:15.450
it's just because our maps'
not quite up to date yet.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.430
So these are also places
where we're fracking.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.200
North Dakota is
unusual because we're

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.104
fracking for oil
rather than gas.

00:38:26.104 --> 00:38:28.270
And we're just throwing
away the gas that comes out.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.990
So a third of the
carbon that comes out

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:37.250
of the ground from
North Dakota is burned.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.575
So it's being sent straight
into the atmosphere.

00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:43.515
Let's keep moving on.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.160
So what if we have
a lot of vector data

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.792
that we can animate?

00:38:50.792 --> 00:38:55.516
What we're looking at
here is fires from space.

00:38:55.516 --> 00:38:59.040
And you watch closely
and you'll see

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.730
different sorts of
things happening.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.730
You'll see if we
zoom in to Africa,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.570
you'll see that a
year's worth of fire

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.660
that we're cycling
through, you'll

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.887
see fires up here in
the North of the equator

00:39:10.887 --> 00:39:12.220
and to the South of the equator.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.430
Let's turn on satellite and you
can kind of see in the middle,

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.750
we have like this
really dense forest.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.340
But these are agricultural
areas up in the North

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.265
and up in the South.

00:39:21.265 --> 00:39:22.640
And this is a form
of agriculture

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.530
called swidden agriculture.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.760
So these are fires
being set by people.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.390
We can look over here
between India and Nepal

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.400
and see kind of
every year, it kind

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.724
of marches up from Southeast
Asia up here with the seasons.

00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:39.140
So you do this
kind of once a year

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.426
to prepare the ground for
the next year's growing.

00:39:43.426 --> 00:39:45.530
You can also see
other sorts of things.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.015
You can see things that are
not changing so much over time.

00:39:49.015 --> 00:39:51.372
You see these very bright areas.

00:39:51.372 --> 00:39:53.830
And you see that a lot of them
in the Middle East-- and you

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.830
can imagine what they are.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:02.260
So these are all
flaring from oil wells.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.110
So we can zoom in
here and actually

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.000
see on the satellite
kind of what

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.585
it must look like on the ground.

00:40:08.585 --> 00:40:10.270
And you can see
these things on fire.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.480
These are very dirty fires
in this particular spot.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.030
And once again, we have
this amazing flaring

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.339
happening in North Dakota.

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:22.880
We have it two other
places happening

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.046
in Texas, where there's
a lot of flaring.

00:40:26.046 --> 00:40:27.670
But curiously, there
isn't much flaring

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.250
around Dallas, Fort Worth.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:33.280
Because it's so close to people,
they actually spend the extra

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.741
to collect everything
and not burn it.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:46.110
What if we combine that
visualization of fires

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.810
with a satellite map that
also can animate over

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.570
the course of a year?

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:55.070
Let me show you the
same spot in Africa.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.730
So unlike the earlier
animation that we

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.780
saw was built from Landsat,
this is built from MODIS.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.430
And it's still a prototype
right now, but what we can see

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.480
is the seasonality of the brown
and the green in this area

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.360
and kind of how in phase
the fires are with it.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.266
We can do the same
thing up here.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.900
So with that, let me loop back
and get to my last slide here.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.540
So moving back to timelapse
and kind of the experience

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.900
we had putting this together
with the Earth Engine

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.880
team, the success we had
with "Time" magazine.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:51.870
It really brings home to
me the reasons we did this,

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.760
the reason we decided
to do this together,

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.900
and kind of all the amazing
things that kind of I

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.162
observed working with
the Earth Engine team.

00:42:01.162 --> 00:42:05.200
It is an incredible group of
really talented and capable

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.300
people.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.670
Couple that with Google's
infrastructure and ability

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:15.240
to scale computation and
ability to take the results

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.560
that we built and get
them out to the world.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.290
As Rebecca said, the
Landsat Timelapse project

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.670
won a Webby with
"Time" magazine.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.950
And we've had many millions
of people come visit.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.060
But I want you to kind
of really meditate

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.730
on some of these
numbers that I'm

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.310
showing you here
up on the slide.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.450
This is the amount
of computation

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:43.520
that we found lying around
to build those entire 29

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.870
mosaics and all the
videos around them.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.830
I think it wouldn't
surprise you to say

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.750
that I couldn't find
this lying around CMU.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:57.980
So I think it brought home kind
of in many different dimensions

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.930
why it was important to work
together and kind of how

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.950
blessed I feel to be
part of this effort.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.718
Thank you.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:11.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.390
Any questions?

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.445
Yes.

00:43:19.445 --> 00:43:21.762
AUDIENCE: So two million
hours of computation,

00:43:21.762 --> 00:43:24.860
is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.991
RANDY SARGENT: Yeah,
two million core hours.

00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:27.490
So yeah.

00:43:31.059 --> 00:43:31.725
Other questions?

00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:33.086
Jeff.

00:43:33.086 --> 00:43:35.742
AUDIENCE: It's nice to see--
it's kind of startling just

00:43:35.742 --> 00:43:38.564
to see what's happening
with the earth.

00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:41.750
It's nice to see the
optimistic of a tribe that

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.536
is out there protecting
their land or their forest.

00:43:45.536 --> 00:43:48.707
Do you expect to find
more things like that?

00:43:48.707 --> 00:43:49.540
RANDY SARGENT: Yeah.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.960
I mean, it's worth
actually spending

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.360
hours looking at Brazil.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.100
Brazil is doing a
really good job of this.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.724
And it really
becomes obvious why

00:43:58.724 --> 00:44:00.140
the deforestation
is slowing down.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.750
Because really, they're hitting
the wall in a lot of places.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.990
And that's not true
everywhere, but it

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:14.280
shows that when we decide to
set a policy for good reasons,

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.810
things can change.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.550
We have control.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.490
There's not this
inexorable progression

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.985
until all the trees are gone.

00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:27.250
AUDIENCE: Have you seen
instances of governments

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:32.045
actually use these really
powerful visualizations

00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:34.585
for actual policy making?

00:44:34.585 --> 00:44:36.710
RANDY SARGENT: The question
is, have we seen places

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.090
where the governments
are using this?

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.640
And it's starting to happen.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.760
I mean, we're starting to
see in places that people

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.340
are starting to
actually look at this.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.860
I know that here
in the US, this has

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.220
gone to congressional
subcommittees.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.110
And I think we're
going to see more

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:00.170
and more of that happening.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.389
Yes.

00:45:01.389 --> 00:45:02.930
AUDIENCE: Follow-up
to that question.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:03.430
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.960
RANDY SARGENT: So I think you're
asking kind of how many people

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.105
are looking at it, like
how is it being used?

00:45:22.105 --> 00:45:23.188
AUDIENCE: How [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.110
RANDY SARGENT: It's a
really good question.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.660
Earth Engine is a
complicated thing.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.150
So we've been focusing
on the timelapse

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.280
for the last little bit here.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.090
Earth Engine itself,
in terms of researchers

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.920
using the platform
to do analysis

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.950
based on kind of this incredible
archive of images connected

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.400
to all the
computation, the usage

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.790
looks a little bit like
a hockey stick right now.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.480
So we're seeing more
and more people.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.700
So you saw the initial
science publication

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.310
led by Matt Hanson
and a group of people

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.470
actually here at Google.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.120
You're seeing many,
many people kind

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.390
of following in those
sort of footprints.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.410
So you're seeing an explosion
of analytical results.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.860
And my hope, an explosion in
visual results as well, so

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.330
that we can reach out not
only to researchers but also

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:19.145
to policymakers and to
the public altogether.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.426
Yes.

00:46:23.426 --> 00:46:25.342
AUDIENCE: Are all the
web apps that you showed

00:46:25.342 --> 00:46:26.470
publicly accessible?

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:27.886
RANDY SARGENT:
Everything I showed

00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:31.180
you is publicly accessible,
with the exception of the World

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.240
Database of Protected Areas.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.154
Everything else I
showed you was public.

00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:39.745
AUDIENCE: Is that
connected somehow?

00:46:39.745 --> 00:46:41.870
RANDY SARGENT: We haven't
gotten to the point where

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.884
we have a public
version of that.

00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:47.746
AUDIENCE: When you were doing
math on the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:56.080
RANDY SARGENT: The math being
done kind of on the fly when

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.000
we were doing kind of
the linear regression

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.600
on the lights, that's being
done on the server side.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.450
So you can potentially have
very, very complicated--

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.680
that was accessing
maybe 30 images

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.840
over a sequence of years.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.040
Sometimes, you'll be
doing calculations

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.680
over maybe a stack of
500, or 1,000, or more.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.040
So it really needs to
happen in the cloud.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:23.104
And then, that computation is
basically being done on demand.

00:47:23.104 --> 00:47:24.770
So you don't do it
for the whole planet.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.240
You do it for the part that
you're looking at in the map.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.160
And as you zoom in, each tile
is being built on the fly.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.040
Another question?

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.487
AUDIENCE: Will you be
updating this data over time?

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:38.570
RANDY SARGENT: Will it be
updating data over time?

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:39.069
Yes.

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.600
Any more questions?

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.826
Thank you, everyone.

00:47:46.826 --> 00:47:47.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:48.851
RANDY SARGENT: Oh, sorry.

00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:49.778
Yes.

00:47:49.778 --> 00:47:52.730
AUDIENCE: Are you
planning in the future--

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:58.634
like the fracking
example, [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:58.634 --> 00:48:01.086
trying to esitmate what
the carbon footprint is

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:01.586
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.619
RANDY SARGENT: The
question is, what

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.160
are sort of value-added
products that

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.810
can be done on top
of the fracking data?

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.360
Like if we know where all
the wells are being drilled,

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.520
what can you compute from that?

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.150
And that's an area where
Earth Engine is now

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.650
branching out into.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.755
It's very, very strong in
the raster computation now.

00:48:25.755 --> 00:48:29.390
But Earth Engine is starting
to build analytical tools that

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.590
will answer exactly that.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.670
To be able to
answer things like,

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:37.220
what is the rate of change
of the drilling wells?

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.720
What sort of impact
might they have?

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.287
Let's intersect that with local
populations that are downwind

00:48:42.287 --> 00:48:43.370
and things of that nature.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.870
So those are the sorts of things
being added to Earth Engine

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.060
right now.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:48.960
Thanks.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.910
[APPLAUSE]
