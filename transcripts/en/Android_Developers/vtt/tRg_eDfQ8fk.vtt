00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.370
Hi, my name is
Lisa Wray, and I'm

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.410
a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.740
Today I'll show you how
to implement sliding tabs

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.770
like the ones you may have
seen in the Google Play Store.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.260
This is what we'll end up with.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.120
You can see the Tab Indicator
move smoothly from tab to tab,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.970
providing continuous touch
feedback as the user scrolls.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.480
The first step is the layout.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720
You need two things,
Tabs on the top

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.241
and a ViewPager on the bottom.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.490
Make sure to use the full
package name for the Sliding

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.290
Tab Layout because it's a Custom
View included in our project.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.090
Next, we'll follow a specific
order to set them up.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630
Find your ViewPager and set
it's Adapter and then second,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.690
set the ViewPager on
the Sliding Tab Layout.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.190
The last thing to
do is to implement

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.724
the Adapter for your ViewPager.

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:44.140
You can do whatever
you want here,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.590
just make sure to
override getPageTitle.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.580
The ViewPager calls this
method in the Adapter

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.750
to get the title that's
shown for each tab.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.860
Here, I'm generating it
based on item position.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:57.040
Let's look at
another example where

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.614
each tab is a different color.

00:00:58.614 --> 00:01:01.030
The tabs take care of blending
the colors together for you

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.990
as you transition from each tab.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.250
As you can see, the
Messages Tab is red,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.420
and the Photos Tab is
yellow, but the indicator,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.810
when it's halfway
between them, is orange.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500
To start this example, first I'm
initializing some simple data

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.459
from my Pager.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.000
This is just a list
of simple objects

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.040
to hold the String Title and
Indicator Color and its Divider

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.550
Color.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.890
Next, I'll set up the Views.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.260
This time I'm using a
Fragment State Pager Adapter.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.010
But you can use any
adaptor you'd normally

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.390
use with a ViewPager.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.380
Again, remember to
set the Adapter first

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.650
before you set the ViewPager
on the Sliding Tab Layout.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.270
Now I'm going to set a Tab
Colorizer on the Sliding Tab

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.980
Layout.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.271
It's going to use the Stored
Color in the list of items

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.880
I created and make that the
Indicator Color for the Tab.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.984
It does the same thing
for the Divider Color.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.650
The Divider Color
applies to the Divider

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.220
on the right side of the Tab.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.150
In our example, the
dividers are all gray,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.774
but they could even
be different colors

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.950
if you need a very
colorful Tab Layout.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.580
Be sure to check out the Sliding
Tabs Basic and Sliding Tabs

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.064
Color Samples for the full
working code of these samples.

00:01:57.064 --> 00:01:58.480
Which is linked
in the description

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.750
along with these slides.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.620
Thanks for watching.
