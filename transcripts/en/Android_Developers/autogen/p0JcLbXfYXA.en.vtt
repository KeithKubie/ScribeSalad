00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.072
 [Music playing] 

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:04.450
 I'm Joe Penny 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.110
 I am vice president of product engineering at Robinhood 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.200
 Robinhood is a sturdy provider of free stock trading 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.100
 All other stock trading services charge between $ 5 and $ 10 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.170
 We offer this service for free 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.870
 Today there are more than one million users to implement Robinhood 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.870
 We were able to grow with a very small team 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.670
 Android users love Robinhood 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 The user base has more than doubled 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.190
 Robinhood applied on 4.6 stars 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.986
 This is the highest rated stock trading broker in the Play Store 

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.050
 I'm Dan Hill 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.532
 I'm an Android developer at Robinhood 

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:36.740
 We're two people on the Android team 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.210
 We are proud of our ability to continue and work 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 Very quickly 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500
 Speed ​​and stability are available in Android Studios 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.560
 This allows us to continue for longer 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.190
 And away from administrative matters 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.795
 That is, the tool's quality scale is in the fact that it is invisible 

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:50.670
 They are uncomplicated 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.430
 It exists only 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.620
 And on demand 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 One of the things I prefer about Android Studios 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.994
 The shortcuts are available 

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.950
 There is a really wonderful shortcut 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.310
 An abbreviation was prepared to search for any abbreviation 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.030
 It will be displayed in conjunction with shortcuts on the keyboard 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.540
 Or you can use it to learn about 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.970
 Various shortcuts. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.240
 The new emulator is fast. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.870
 You can speed up hardware and use the GPU 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.929
 In your device in order to speed it up 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.450
 I like to brag about moving pictures 

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.110
 I feel happy when I swipe 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.510
 To the top, seeing the deal disappear metaphorically 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.314
 It is a strategic way to interact with stocks 

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:25.980
 These powerful tools provide 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.515
 Our very small team can make a big impact 

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.890
 While developing Android products 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.400
 We're always moving between files 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 We learn configuration files and different Java classes 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.530
 Android Studio also provides a satisfactory response 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 To keep pace with the speed we want
