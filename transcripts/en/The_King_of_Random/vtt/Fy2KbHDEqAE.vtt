3...2...1... Oh dear!!

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.669
hey guys. I'm Nate welcome back to the backyard today. We've got a fun experiment that we're going to try

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.679
Thanks to the suggestion of Youtube user Robert Vipperman!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.358
Robert wanted to know what would happen if we mixed molten salt with you to the liquid nitrogen or dry ice well today is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.830
Not the day for the liquid nitrogen test

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
But it is the day to see what happens if we pour molten salt onto dry ice well. We've got our foundry

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.590
We've got our salt

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.749
And we've got some dry ice let's try mixing them together

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.969
Now as a first step what we want to try and do is clean out our crucible all of the crucibles

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.049
We've got currently have a residue from other projects in them this one seems to have quite a bit of

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.370
aluminum built up on the sides

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.980
so we're gonna try and chip out what we can then fire up the foundry and see if we can melt out the rest and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
Shake it out. So we have on mostly clean crucible to melt our salt in

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.129
We do want a small reservoir in our dry ice to pour the salt into so it doesn't just scatter all over the place

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.720
So let's take our drill bit and try and carve a hole down into the ice just a little bit

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.840
Alex toasty see how well molten salt pours out of a crucible

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.879
Huh, well it's cooled down it certainly bubbled a good amount

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.430
But it didn't react horrendously violently at all at least not yet. I guess it's still possible to get there but

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.009
Even the salt, that's just on our pavers has cooled down to being solid

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.370
Just like our salt inside our dry ice has as well, let's see if we can tip that out

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.010
There you go a nice solid chunk of salt right there I

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.579
Think the salt and our crucible is still liquid try pouring a little bit more in

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.539
skimming some of this aluminum off the top just

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480
melting more aluminum

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
Goes

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.640
Oh

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.260
I

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Certainly wouldn't want to get that on me

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.269
But it's nowhere near the violent kind of reaction that we've seen in other people's channels where they pour salt into water

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.609
That is still squishy. It definitely hasn't cooled down all the way

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.160
Very hot also very hot still both very hot

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.919
All right now, I know this is probably filled

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.420
with aluminum

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.420
And some other trace metals

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.610
But I'm gonna lick it

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.719
Surprise of all surprises, it's salty

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.389
Alright, now. This is finally cold

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.089
Sounds a little less cold, but it's also a little bit thicker and it was poured second so that makes sense now

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.358
I'm gonna try and break a piece off of this dry ice

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:26.459
We're gonna see what happens if we drop this dry ice into some molten salt, I know

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220
three two one

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.780
Bubbling bubbling bubbling kind of not even a lot just a little bit of bubbling

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.279
The dry ice is disappearing a little bit faster than if you just left it out

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300
Not a lot o

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.270
One of our pucks broke in half

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.160
It's kind of cool, it's got a like a very smooth outside

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.489
But you can see that the crystalline structure has begun to form on the inside as a cool ball. Let's hit this with a hammer

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.109
Exploded now. It's rock salt

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.190
We've got two more experiments that we want to try and we've moved to the dome just in case things get out of hand which

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.290
I don't think will be a problem, but better safe than sorry, so let's melt up some more salt, and then try our next experiment

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.270
Because I'm not really sure how this is going to react when it's going down into the crucible

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.379
I have a plan for how to dip it in there and keep myself a little ways away

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.979
I'll take the dry ice and secure it in a pair of tongs

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.259
And then I'm gonna use this extended grabber thing to hold the tongs

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.030
away from myself

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.420
And I'll dip that down into the crucible

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.979
I don't really think it's going to explode because neither the dry ice nor the salt will vaporize

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.950
Rapidly the same way normal ice would but it is possible that some salt will cool down

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.710
Around the dry ice for Michelle

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.229
And then the expanding dry ice will cause that to break open so I do want to stay a little bit away

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.980
And that's why I'm not just gonna be dipping this directly down into the salt

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.490
Ready

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well it's certainly bubbling well

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.789
Quite a bit more of a reaction that I thought we would get actually

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.279
It's spilling all over our container

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:33.939
Starting to slow down

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.860
There it is

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.720
Now just floating on the top of the salt

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:02.368
My tongs have become salted together it was just so much salt that built up on the tips

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:08.099
It was in contact with the dry ice so I think it just made it cool down

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:11.219
It's like a salt weld

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:12.239
That was pretty fun

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:16.799
we got a lot more bubbling action than I really thought the last thing we want to try is to take our salt and

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:19.349
then pour it on to a container full of

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:24.958
Broken up dry ice so it's not just pouring it onto one flat piece of dry ice that has a whole board into it in

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.439
This case there's just going to be lots of pieces, and it's just going to flow all over all of it

00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:56.529
All right

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.060
All right here we go. I'll take the crucible. I'm just gonna pour it all over that dry ice

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.349
This could be exciting ready three two one

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.979
Hmm, I think I expected a little bit more of a reaction when that poured on

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.669
The salt poured all over chunks of dry ice

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.609
Didn't react a whole lot we got much more of a reaction when we put it into the solid piece of dry ice I found

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.130
a whole

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.219
Board down into it we got a lot of

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:45.159
Bubbling and popping and it did stay in that chunk and rice ended up casting that puck that was pretty neat

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:52.479
Molten salt versus dry ice the molten salt didn't react terribly violently, but it did bubble and splashed quite a bit

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.039
And it's just interesting to see salt as a liquid. It pours very smoothly

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.379
It's a pretty runny thin liquid - like it doesn't turn into a consistency like syrup or anything like that

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.100
It's almost as thin as water. It seems overall. This is pretty fun

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.170
