00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.479
So what have we learned so far from Crash
Course Big History?

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.600
Well, the universe is big, it's really big,
and it started from nothing.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.320
And now, a whole lot of nothing surrounds
tiny pockets of something, and one day the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.010
entire universe will return to almost nothing.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.560
Our universe may be one of many, just a tiny
hole in a block of Swiss cheese that forms

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.270
a multiverse with many other holes entirely
beyond our sight, with constants and dimensions,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.060
and physical laws stretching away from the mental
comprehension of humanity's most brilliant minds.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.480
But in our tiny cosmic bubble forming as if
by accident, the physical laws of the universe

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.800
and the unequal distribution of energy arrange
themselves in such a way that in the cosmic

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.520
blink of 13.8 billion years, in a still fairly
young cosmos, we have emerged.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.020
Us! with all of our fighting, and reproduction,
and consumption. We have been cobbled together

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.190
from the ashes of dead stars. We have been
forged on Earth, despite the chaos of a molten

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.589
planet bombarded from above by every rock
in the nearby solar system. And we have survived

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.980
and evolved by the slimmest of margins, our
existence perpetually balanced on the edge of a knife.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.340
I mean, a couple times already we've almost
gone extinct. Some of our obstacles have been

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.799
physical and some have been of our own making,
but from here, many transformations still await us.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.159
Now I guess from our perspective, some of
these transformations may be good. Some of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.549
them will definitely be bad, like, you know,
ceasing to exist. But really, it all depends

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.140
on your perspective. I mean, no outcome is
absolutely good or bad in the eyes of the universe.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.620
The universe is blind. The universe
doesn't see, it just is.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:41.620
Aah- I forgot the into. Hi. I'm John Green.
Welcome to Crash Course Big History. Today

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.700
we're talking about the deep future of life,
the universe, and everything.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.640
[Theme Music]

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.720
So today, we're talking about the future.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.320
Actually, we're talking about several
potential futures falling on a spectrum.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.120
First, there's the projected future. This
is the business as usual, where variables

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.009
on the Earth and the universe play out as
our current knowledge of them suggests they

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.080
will play out. I predict that the sun will rise tomorrow,
and that I will skip breakfast and go to work.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.900
Second, there's the probable future, where
our current knowledge illuminates several

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.150
possible futures that could happen, though
variables may play out in a different way

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.990
in the actual event. For instance, it could
happen that tomorrow morning I will find

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.439
time to eat breakfast, and I will discover
that it energizes me and improves my productivity,

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.359
and really is the most important meal of the
day. Unlikely, but it could happen according

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.269
to our current knowledge of how things work,
in this case, how things work in my kitchen.

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.420
Third is the possible future where we can
no longer bank on our current knowledge, but

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.159
rather must anticipate that future discoveries
may alter how we currently think events are

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.689
gonna play out. For instance, I may find a
pill that provides me with all the calories

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.530
and nutrients I need for the day, and I never
have to think about eating more food again.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.510
In terms of the universe, if we were to gain
knowledge of, like, what dark energy is, and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.420
how it works, we may alter the current narrative
of how it will continue to evolve.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.640
Fourth, the preposterous future of outlandish
predictions. 150 years ago the idea of flying

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.709
to the moon would have seemed preposterous,
but one way to test the limits of the possible

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.049
is by going beyond them into the impossible.
A lot of preposterousness is possible in the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.800
next 1,000 years, or 10,000, or 10 million,
or even 100 trillion years.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.480
So, what might happen in the next 1,000 years?
Well, last week we discussed how the next

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.780
century might be pretty rough for us, but
let's say that humanity gets through the 21st

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.740
century bottleneck and our collective learning
and complexity continues to grow.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.769
Well then maybe there could be another great
revolution, like another explosion of complexity

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.870
as we saw with the dawn of agriculture, or
the advent of industry. In the next 1,000

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.139
years we could master hydrogen fusion, the
same process that goes on in the sun. And

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.479
that would provide us with a tremendous amount of
energy, it would solve most of our energy problems.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.799
Another possible great revolution is known
as transhumanism, like your brain is sort

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.760
of a computer so imagine if you could upload
your consciousness to something plastic or

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.999
metal like an actual computer. You know, the
thing about human brains is that they kind

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.959
of rot, so never mind living seventy or eighty
years, try millions of years.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.450
Now, some say that both of these revolutions
might be possible within our lifetimes - or

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.449
at least within your lifetime - and they're actively
being pursued by scientists, but we've been

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.160
promised a lot of things about the future
over the years. I still don't have a jet-pack,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.180
I find that the wi-fi in airplanes is very
slow, and I'm not by nature a complainer,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.960
but my amazing virtual reality headset makes
me feel nauseated.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.060
But on the timescale of a thousand years,
those revolutions and many others that we

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.630
haven't thought of are perfectly possible
if human complexity continues to rise.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.949
Now, that's a big if, but let's get into bigger
ifs, like what about the next 250,000 years?

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.509
Well on that timescale, the possibility of
like, a supervolcano eruption like the one

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.340
at Mount Toba that killed almost all humans
on Earth becomes pretty likely. Then when

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.210
it comes to asteroids, so-called city-killers
hit on average every 100 years, although most

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.729
just land in the ocean, and ones big enough
to wipe out most species on Earth like in

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.669
the extinction of the dinosaurs can potentially
land every few hundred million years.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.259
Now it's possible that by this point we could've
colonized some of the moons and planets of

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.620
the Solar System.
It's also possible that we could have the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.440
technology to survive centuries long space
flights out of our Solar System.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.960
Especially if we can get some of that transhumanism
because it would remove the need to bring

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.460
along things like water and food, and also
we wouldn't have to be afraid of the immense

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.069
amounts of space radiation that destroy humans.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.400
Quick question, Stan. How is there not a band
called either "Space Radiation" or "The Transhumans?"

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.110
Okay, let's zoom out even further and talk
about millions of years.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.039
If Homo Sapiens hasn't been wiped out by some
disaster within the next several million years,

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.399
our species probably won't be around anyway
because we'll have evolved into something else.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.680
Like, seven million years is roughly the amount
of time since our species split from our common

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.979
ancestor with chimpanzees. And while we do
share 98.4% of our DNA with them, a lot of

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.909
evolutionary change can happen in a few million
years.

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.879
This is especially true when you consider
that the human capacity for genetic engineering

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.640
may have developed in a lot of scary and/or awesome
ways, further increasing the pace of change.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.940
And when it comes to moving outside of the
Solar System, a few million years is actually

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.800
a pretty long time, like, presuming that humanity
never finds a way to move faster than the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.180
speed of light, physicists estimate that on
the timescale of five to fifty million years,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.470
we could colonize almost every star system
in our galaxy.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.879
That shows you the precision of predictive
science, by the way, five million years to

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.470
fifty million years. It's only a 45 million
year difference.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.030
But here's a crazy thing to consider - if
we can't move faster than the speed of light,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.120
we will never get outside of the Milky Way
because the vast distances between star systems

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.889
also mean that human populations would be
separated by thousands of light years, and

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.389
when a species is separated into, you know,
different physical pockets of the universe,

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.680
it stops being the same species pretty quickly.
I mean, you put turtles on different islands

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.129
for a few thousand years and you get different
species. I don't think that we're gonna, like,

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.509
hold on to our shared humanity across hundreds
of thousands of light years. So imagine a

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.939
distant future where, like, each star system
is seeded by an ancestor and then a few million

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:09.520
years later, those cousins look profoundly
different from each other.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.640
Wait, like, as different as Americans look
from Canadians or more different?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.120
More different, apparently.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.700
How can you look more different than I do
from a Canadian?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.320
Another thing I'd like you to consider is
humanity's increasing ability to harness energy.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.860
From the fire storm of the Big Bang to the
first stars blinking into existence to life's

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.720
active harvesting of energy to the massive
increase of energy used in the industrial

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.580
revolution, more energy means higher complexity
and that's our overarching theme in Big History.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.180
So life on Earth has gotten pretty good at
harnessing the energy that's like, within

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.169
Earth and that comes to Earth from the Sun,
right?

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.740
But maybe a time could come when humanity
or something else like us in the universe

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.960
could harness the entire power of a different
planet or a chain of several planets or a galaxy.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.760
Then we could harness many orders of
magnitude more energy than we can now and

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.659
we know that is closely associated with rising
complexity.

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.550
But perhaps I've speculated too much. The
thing about futurism is that the further you

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.009
look ahead, the more certain things become
again. That's thanks to the beauty of physics,

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:15.589
so let's look again at the projected future
based on our current knowledge.

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:18.500
So, what will happen in the next billion years?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.060
In about a billion years, the Sun will have
begun to exhaust its fuel and will start to inflate.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.740
Its luminosity will increase and this
means plants on Earth over the following

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.720
years will find it harder and harder to do most forms of
photosynthesis and thus sustain complex life on Earth.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.280
The beginning of the end. What will happen
in the next three to five billion years?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.460
Now the story is starting to get even more tragic.
The Sun will get larger and larger until it

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.020
boils the surface of the Earth dry. Once we
get to a surface temperature greater than

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.420
100 degrees Celsius, we can be pretty sure
that that's it for life on Earth.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.740
So if anyone human or human-like is still
around, we'll have to leave our childhood

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.320
home and move into a dorm room somewhere else
in the galaxy. We won't even be able to come

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.200
back home for our moms to do our laundry.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.440
How about in the next 200 billion years?

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.090
As dark energy continues to accelerate the
expansion of the universe past the speed of

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.260
light, we will no longer get to see light
from other galaxies.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.850
If we were to lose the knowledge of the Big
Bang cosmology that we were taught at the

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.420
beginning of this series, our galaxy would
be all we'd see or be aware of.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.260
We'd revert to the idea that the universe
had no start date, is static and eternal.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.150
The Milky Way would be our entire universe.
That's why a number of scientists refer to

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.100
the current age where we can see the evidence
for the Big Bang and see other galaxies as "the

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.140
golden age of astronomy." But you know, a golden age
that lasts hundreds of billions of years is not so bad.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.640
What will happen in the next 100 trillion
years?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:45.000
The last, tiny, slow-burning star will have flickered
out and new ones will have ceased to form.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.200
No new heavy elements will form, all that will be left
is the residue of heavy elements from long since dead

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.660
stars, a cosmic graveyard where the remains of
dead stars and planets wander in the darkness.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.280
But let's not stop there, what about in the
next trillion trillion trillion years?

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.780
More accurately 10 to the 40 years. That's
a one with 40 zeros after it. This is an even

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.280
more incomprehensible stretch of time than a hundred
trillion years and even more incomprehensible

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.770
things will happen. The most likely scenario
is this: Matter will grow feeble and decay

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:21.270
into energy and remember, matter is loosely
speaking just a more congealed form of energy.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.800
Eventually, the universe will be an empty
orb of weak cosmic radiation, with the energy

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.380
spread out like too little butter spread over
too much bread.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.060
This, as far as we can tell, is the end of
complexity as we know it.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.350
And then, in the next trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.470
years or 10 to the 100, even black holes will
evaporate and the universe's grand narrative

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.590
will have more or less come to an end.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.140
After all those transformations into a great amount
of variety and networks of intricate complexity,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:59.460
all will pass away. All that will remain is a universe that
is very old and very tired. It is the specter of heat death.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.820
Okay, so for me, one of the most comforting
thoughts about all existence comes from science

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.840
- the idea from the first law of thermodynamics that
matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.740
The building blocks that make up our bodies
have been around since the beginning of the

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:20.040
universe, we have merely changed form and after
we die, our bodies will return to that inanimate

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.520
cosmos from which they sprang. And in that sense,
all life is connected and also, all life is kind of eternal.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.340
Now of course, there's still the fear of losing
your particular consciousness depending on

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.800
your worldview, like, I will cease to be John
Green. And from my perspective, that's not

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.150
ideal, but we're programmed to have that fear.
If we weren't afraid of ceasing to exist,

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.380
we wouldn't be a very good species. We would
have gone extinct ages ago and none of us

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.190
ever would have gotten to be. I don't think
that's either good or bad, it keeps our species

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.780
going and the universe looks on, free from
any mandate or obligations or programming

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.060
- completely free. And what a lot of us overlook
is that we are not just observers of the universe,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.000
we are the universe. We don't exist outside
of the universe, we are indivisible from it,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.140
we are made of the same stuff, and in all
of our transformations over billions of years

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:17.400
from star stuff to single cells to students,
to one degree or another, at every stage we've

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.730
shared in that freedom of transformation to
flow endlessly from one form to another.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.350
And maybe we won't survive as individuals, maybe
we won't survive as a species, but we will

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:32.770
continue into the deep future. We are a tiny
part of the universe, but we are part of it,

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:38.690
and from so simple a beginning in ways most
beautiful and most wonderful, we, the universe,

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:46.110
have been and are being evolved. That ability,
in fact necessity to change is your birthright

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.250
acquired at your original birth 13.8 billion
years ago and it can never be taken away,

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.000
it can never be destroyed.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.260
Thanks for watching Crash Course Big History
and as we say in my hometown:

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.820
don't forget to be awesome.
