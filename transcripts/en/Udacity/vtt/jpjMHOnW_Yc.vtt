00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
We don't want to solve for x or y in the second equation, since we would need to

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:08.100
move the terms around and divide by a coefficient in front of the variable. For

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.195
example, if we try to solve for x, we would have to subtract 3y from both sides

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.523
first, and then, divide every term by 5. That's kind of messy. A similar process

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:20.839
happens if we try and solve for y, so these two are out. If we try to solve for

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.241
x in this first equation we have to divide each term by 2, this would leave me

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:29.579
with x is equal to 2 minus 1 half y. Remember, there's a 1 as a coefficient in

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.824
front of the y, so this is really negative 1 half times y. I prefer to avoid

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:38.576
working with fraction in my substitution process, so this x isn't necessarily

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:42.846
the best choice. If I try and solve for y, I could add y to both sides, then,

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:47.193
rewriting my problem up here, I could subtract 2x from both sides and I would

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:51.607
get y is equal to negative 2x plus 4. Because I have integer coefficients like

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:55.980
negative 2 and 4, it's easier to work with this in a substitution. If you want

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.238
to solve for x and work with a fraction in your substitution, that's okay.

00:01:00.238 --> 00:01:03.443
Choose the method that you feel most comfortable doing.
