00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.850
SPEAKER: Thank you,
everyone, so much for coming

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.400
to today's FoodTalks
with Angélique.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.800
And we also have a professor
of gastronomy with us

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.659
today, Peter.

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.075
Angélique, do you want to tell
a little bit about yourself

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.960
and why you're here and
what you'll be doing?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.090
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Well, we
are coming both from Holland.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.150
We work often together,
gastronomy and all kinds

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.690
of flavors.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410
I learned in the
beginning from Peter

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.240
because he has a restaurant
named the De Echoput.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.410
It's difficult for you
to tell [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.242
PETER KLOSSE: Yes.

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.700
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.420
And so it started with all being
aware of all kinds of flavors.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.590
And that's why we worked already
a long time ago together.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.519
And now in Holland I'm one of
the two female master chefs

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.480
from about 150 master chefs.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.130
I think I'll go a little bit
over here because the sound is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.020
not so good.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.670
Can you hear me good like this?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.170
OK.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.070
Great.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.550
So in Holland, I'm one of
two female master chefs.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.540
That's quite unique.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.810
I hope in the
United States there

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.750
are lot more female chefs.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.390
But what I'm doing is the art
of creative thinking in flavor,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.730
in flavor matching and
flavor combinations.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.070
So I'll tell you a little story
about culinary creativity,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.370
and then I'm going to make
a flavor painting with about

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.160
20 components so you can
experience all kinds of flavor

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.900
pairings and flavor matches
which you might think,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.030
I couldn't imagine that
combination has whatever,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.299
made in heaven.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.340
So that's what I'm doing.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.940
Peter will explain why
some combinations have

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.960
a special effect in your mouth.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.240
But before we do
that, Peter wants

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.650
to tell a bit about
himself and then

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.332
we'll start with the
presentation afterwards.

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:21.040
PETER KLOSSE: OK.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.580
Thank you.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.750
She already mentioned a lot.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.610
I have my own hotel
and restaurant.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.130
I developed the
whole flavor theory.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.130
I think flavor is something
that is really tangible, that we

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.080
can measure.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.740
And I've got a PhD in
flavor classification.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.290
It's only classification
model on flavor in the world

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.200
and it really works.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.580
So we've found a way
to really describe

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.390
flavor in objective terms.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.440
So what Angélique is doing with
creativity actually is based

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.000
on a very factual thing, so
things that Googlers must like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.060
because there is a real
algorithm, there a real model,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.120
there is real objective
thinking behind it.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.880
So what she is doing is
showing a beautiful painting.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.630
She's going to create a
beautiful painting right here

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.840
and then in the meantime,
I will discuss a little bit

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.230
on the objective side of it.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.945
So these are the ground rules
of flavor composition here.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.610
So that's what we
want to show you.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.610
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.790
So first I'm going to start
with a little presentation

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.400
about creative thinking and not
about brainstorming, but about

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.770
dreamstorming.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.910
And then I'm going
to make the painting

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.820
and afterwards we'll do a little
bit of culinary mind mapping

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.590
so you'll be able to make
your own flavor combination

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.970
in a couple of minutes.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.760
So who loves to cook?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.440
OK.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.309
Well, I'm so happy.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.100
That's the reason why
you're here, I think.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.180
OK.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.390
Let's start.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.480
For me, the sky is the limit.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.300
And the story about
creative thinking

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.790
is very important before
you go into flavor mixing

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.840
because a lot of times we say,
OK, maybe it's not possible

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.290
or we see a lot of
issues on the roads,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.680
maybe it's too expensive, and
I think it takes too long time.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.310
And we have all kinds
of reasons to do

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.420
something don't let do that.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.970
So for me, the sky is the limit
and thinking is the creation

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.070
and doing this feeling and
then making is the learning.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.580
And I want to tell you a
little story about what

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.670
happened to me 14 years ago.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.570
I saw a hot air balloon
and I was in my car

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.310
and I was reading a
little bit and had

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.440
jazz music in the background.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.980
And I thought, hey, Eureka.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.860
The balloon is actually a hot
air oven, a very big hot air

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.540
oven.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.460
Do you have experience
in a hot air balloon?

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.160
Yes?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.660
OK.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.305
You have once been in a
hot air balloon, yeah?

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:08.260
Everybody almost.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.790
Oh, that sounds great.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.970
So imagine the balloon
is a hot air oven.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.600
So what will happen
when you put something

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.080
in it like a sea bass
or a half a chicken

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.610
or some mussels
or some paprikash?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.170
Will it be cooked?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.620
Well, I can say to myself
at the same moment,

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.540
no, it is too dangerous or maybe
somebody else did it already.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.780
But I stayed in my
dream and my fantasy

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.300
to think, oh, when
it's possible,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.070
then we can make a restaurant
with the most wonderful view

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.770
you can imagine around small
villages and small rivers.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.610
You go low and you go high so
you have the restaurants which

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.780
is wonderful.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.510
And so I keep on dreaming.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.720
And then I called a
guy from a company.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.510
I said, hey, can I
ask you something?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.340
Is it possible to go once
with you in the balloon

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.420
and put something in it?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.370
He was a little bit
quiet at that moment.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.550
You said, yes,
come to my company

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.000
and we'll go together in
the air and let's try it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.540
So I had small bags with
small chickens and a sea bass

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.720
and then they filled the
balloon with cold air

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.460
and then we walked
in the balloon

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.920
and put all the small bags
inside of the balloon.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.870
And then went go up and then
we say, do you smell already

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.410
something?

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.150
It's too big to smell something.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.240
And then afterwards,
the idea grows.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.140
That's what happened.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.710
You get used to the idea and
then the idea gets the normal

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.080
and then you want more.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.320
So I said, we can
go with one balloon,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.850
but what will happen when we
put three balloons together

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.730
and we have 50 persons
in three balloons

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.950
and we go up about one
and a half kilometers?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.040
I don't know how many
feet it is, but it's high.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.910
And we do a three-course
menu in the air.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.830
They say, it sounds wonderful.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.200
And then we get more
used to the idea

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.150
and then we say, we put two
chefs on the top of the balloon

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.850
and they go up
sailing on the outside

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.980
and give me the main course.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.950
Yes, that would be wonderful.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.690
So we are all so excited.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.480
We are really excited, saying,
whoa, that would be wonderful.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.150
And then we jumped
out of the balloon

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.610
to make the desert in the meadow
before the balloons are landed.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.310
Sounds wonderful, eh?

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.650
Do you think it' real?

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.540
Do you think it happened?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.220
That's a good attitude.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.606
That's great.

00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:03.710
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.210
Yeah.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.020
So for me, a brainstorm is
not anymore a brainstorm.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.160
For me, it's a dreamstorm.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.390
It's like a hypercreativity.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.360
And you have to be sometimes
hypercreative to be different

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.780
or to reach some things you
never thought you could reach.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:33.640
And now Lucas is going to
show the movie of the three

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.520
balloons connected
with 50 persons

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.409
one and a half kilometers high.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.549
A three-course menu
in an hour and a half.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:48.730
So that's me a
little bit younger.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.420
OK.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.117
So these are the two
chefs who are going

00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:53.200
on the top of the balloon.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.970
It was the biggest balloon
in Europe at that time,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.195
for 24 persons.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.650
Three balloons
connected and we go up.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.020
This is a very short movie.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.300
And this is about one and
a half kilometers high.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.500
He's on top of the balloon.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.250
And the temperature
in the balloon

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.460
is about 90 degrees Celsius.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.850
So you need a converter
to put it in--

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.750
OK.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.970
So you can measure two chefs
on the top of the balloon.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.910
When the balloon is
already half filled,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.770
they go up and on the top
there's a small opening.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.970
They can check how my food is.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.120
And this is the system from one
balloon to the other balloon.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.270
So we had one kitchen balloon
and two restaurant balloons.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.090
In one kitchen balloon,
everything was cooked

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.960
and then it goes down
with a pulley system.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.580
And then it goes to
the other balloons

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.140
where there was a chef to
prepare it for the guests.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.385
So here is the three-course
menu for 50 persons.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.970
And then he had to move
on the top of the balloon

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.800
because it was very hot.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.230
Because he were
standing still, it was--

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.470
so he had to move around.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.770
So this is the first dish.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:31.475
This is a Dorada with
vinaigrette and cucumber.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.510
It's wonderful.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.420
It was so high.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.535
And now he's going up
sailing with the main course

00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:46.160
on the outside.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.400
And they say, oh my god, it
was so hot upstairs there.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.184
It was so warm.

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:00.880
There goes the second guy.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.060
And then after the
main course, it

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.600
was chicken stuffed with duck.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.260
And we served it
with some mushrooms

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.960
and some green asparagus.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.770
So then they disconnected
the three balloons

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.500
and you see each
balloon is going.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.240
And then they jump out
to prepare the dessert.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.620
OK.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.690
Thank you, Lucas.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:48.190
OK.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:55.070
For me, this is the example
of believing in every idea you

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.080
have, in every dream.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.050
And go on and take action
because when I said that idea,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:09.260
ah, it might be too dangerous
or I called an insurance company

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.720
and they said, oh, you
have to insure yourself.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.470
Well, what will happen when
the balloon will crash?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.080
So it's not necessary
to insure yourself.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.330
But for the other guests also.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:28.830
OK.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.700
So this is me in my kitchen.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.220
This is my view from the
kitchen with a lobster salad.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.750
Nice view.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.100
This is the kitchen.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.700
It looks as if the
balloon is in the Alps,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.726
but this is actually a picture
made from another balloon.

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:52.130
It was in Austria, and we
made a trip of four hours.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:13:00.030
And I made 12 dishes
above the Alps.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.300
It was very exciting.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.300
This is above the clouds.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.020
So the sun is shining
above the clouds

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.520
and then you go
through the clouds

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.070
and then it's very quiet.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.650
And then you eat
your lobster there.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:25.470
So for me, everything I do
is coming right at my heart,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.570
and I believed in that
already a long time ago.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.390
I was a chef with a Michelin
star in the restaurant

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.830
and then I thought, OK, do I
want to do this my whole life?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.040
Oh, yes, maybe, but not
only in a restaurant.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.000
So my dream was to
tell more about flavors

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.630
and to travel and
to do crazy things

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.350
and to give experience to
people, but not an experience

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.670
because it's like marketing,
but experience which is real,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.900
an authentic experience.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:04.590
And for me, experience
is economy, but only when

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.010
it's a meaningful experience.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:19.120
So these are the most mentioned
idea killers like it might work

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.080
in other places, but not here.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:30.370
And this is the worst one,
since when are you the expert?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.030
When you say that to someone,
they say, oh, next time I

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.085
don't want to mention my idea.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.550
You are familiar with this,
with the idea killers?

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.750
And the opposite of the idea
killers are the idea boosters--

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:52.590
just do it and go experiment.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.060
So don't shoot.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.080
You don't have a
license to kill ideas.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.920
Years.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.210
This is my message
always in the kitchen.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.330
So you have to try
a lot of things.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.970
Also, everybody has a flavor
reference and a flavor memory

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.050
from your childhood, from
the soup your grandma made

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.960
or the stew.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.450
And when you love food,
it's in your memory.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:24.430
And therefore, it's important
to try a lot of things

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.930
so you can make it even better.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.150
Well, now it's about temptation.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:41.160
And I want to tell you about a
carrot, just a simple carrot.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.290
And if I looked at a
carrot, I think, oh, you're

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.040
just a carrot.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.190
You see the rabbit.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.250
He's laughing at the
carrot because we're always

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.520
using the carrot as a
salad or in soup or stew,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.930
as we do in Holland.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:04.020
But the challenge is to make
a carrot a golden carrot,

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.120
like gold, to give
it much more value.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:14.760
And when I was a chef
in the restaurants

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:21.240
and I had to make a new menu
card, it was until one, two,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.130
three o'clock in the night and
I was thinking, I have a dish.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:34.310
But sometimes I missed that one
little accent which a dish can

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.870
make very special, timeless.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.450
So sometimes you're
in a restaurant

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.340
and you say, oh,
this is very nice.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.080
And another time, you
say, this is one of them,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.605
you will never
forget the flavor.

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.742
Have you had that experience?

00:16:46.742 --> 00:16:48.450
Sometimes it's OK and
the other time, you

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.700
say, oh, I wish I could
go back to that restaurant

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.100
and experience it again.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.600
That's what I mean.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.380
As a chef, I think
it's important

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.579
that you create dishes
that guests will remember

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.680
and they will come back for.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.210
So I was always thinking,
thinking, thinking.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.450
Sometimes you have
it in a split second.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:21.310
You say, OK, I missed
maybe a little bit of lemon

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:28.420
or maybe a little star anise or
maybe some seaweed, whatever.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.100
But when you make
a transference--

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.507
when you say, I'm
missing something

00:17:41.507 --> 00:17:43.090
and you make inspiration
transference,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.670
films a whole world of
possibilities and flavors

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.470
is opened.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.040
One logical thing is
most people can only

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.560
remember certain things
from the short memory.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:03.930
So when I say to you, carrots,
just think of a carrot.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.660
Which are the best flavor
friends of a carrot?

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.900
Just name some.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:12.980
What do you eat--

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.230
ginger, thank you.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.935
Come on.

00:18:16.935 --> 00:18:17.850
Lemon, thank you.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:21.900
Cinnamon.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.550
Yes great.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.070
It's a great match,
cinnamon and carrots.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.650
Garlic.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.450
Yeah, Yeah.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.320
OK.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.170
We are already here with
about 30 and four things.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:33.670
OK.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.820
Cumin.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.350
What did you say?

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.891
almonds.

00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:41.390
Yeah.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.770
Laurel.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.360
Great.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.840
You prepared.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.500
AUDIENCE: Mint.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.250
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Mint, yes.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.230
So you know what
is happening now?

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.870
You have to think, oh,
and just the things

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.560
we know that match with the
carrots are in the front

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.740
because maybe you just tasted
or you had just a salad with it.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.540
But then you have
to search for more.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.420
And that's a good thing to
know in creativity, that you

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.025
can just remember seven things.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.020
So when you say, where is
the inspiration coming from,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.260
it's for chefs, from memories,
from dishes you already ate

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.230
or from your family
or our restaurants

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.810
or a market, cookbooks,
magazines, internet,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.610
television.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.280
But for a chef,
it's very important

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.280
to let you get
inspired by the season.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.230
Take the best characteristics
of a wonderful carrot.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.190
I go in my mind
traveling to the sea.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.790
I think, oh, what can the
sea offer me in this season?

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.130
Maybe a nice squid or
maybe some anchovies.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.550
So I'm looking for flavors which
I think, oh, the carrot will

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.330
be happy from that.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.620
So if you are a carrot,
what makes you happy?

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.290
That's the way a chef thinks.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:22.110
I'm traveling in my mind
to a land or to fashion.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:28.330
Fashion is a big inspiration
for matching flavors and colors.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.420
So later on, I will
make the carrot

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.690
with a very concentrated
tomato puree

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.010
and then you see that
colors can be inspired.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:45.130
Just look around you
at fashion or art.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.000
It's not only the colors
in art, but it's also

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.810
when you look at this painting,
what will this painting tell

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.770
you?

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.880
You see a lot of depth,
you see a lot of colors.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.390
There All warm colors
and cold colors.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.860
And then if you take a look
for a couple of minutes,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.600
then you get some emotion and
when you trust on that emotion,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.680
you can use it in your
flavor composition.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.030
Well, so now again,
you love to cook.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.316
And then we think
again of the carrots,

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:24.440
what can I do with carrots?

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.640
These are preparations.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.920
These are all kinds of
things I cannot remember.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.340
As a chef, I can also
remember seven, maybe 10.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.800
But when I say, oh, hey, it's
a good idea to braise a carrot

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.692
or to ferment it or to put it
on a barbecue or I marinate it

00:21:46.692 --> 00:21:48.970
or I deep fry it or
make it in a papillote--

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.020
in a foil with some garlic
and oil and rosemary--

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.880
or I inject it.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.050
Oh, yeah, of course you
know you can inject carrots.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:04.020
So when I have like a
needle, I can put it

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.301
in and [SPEAKING DUTCH]?

00:22:08.301 --> 00:22:09.612
PETER KLOSSE: Siphon.

00:22:09.612 --> 00:22:10.695
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:13.740
And then get all flavors
to inject it and then

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.670
put it in the oven.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.600
And then all the aromas are
going between the carrot.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.400
Or I can smoke it.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.380
So there's a lot
more possible when

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.990
you make inspiration visible.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.650
And these are just word clouds.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.310
You know word clouds
from the internet.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:40.880
For me, a word cloud is a lot
of inspiration for techniques.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.030
These are preparations,
techniques.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.680
You can make a bavarois
or a cream from a carrot

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.845
or I could make an ice
cream or a soup or a syrup.

00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:54.160
I can make a spring
roll, en espuma, flan.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.991
There's so much that I can do
to give this carrot so much more

00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:00.490
value.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.810
Another thing is I can travel
in my mind to another culture.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.130
So this is Morocco.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:18.987
And when you travel and
you go to the markets--

00:23:18.987 --> 00:23:20.070
who's gone to the markets?

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.020
Everybody?

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.070
OK.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.860
And then you see all the
flavors and the spices

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.800
and the herbs and the
fruits and the veggies.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.020
And then when you
close your eyes

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:35.540
and you go with the carrots, you
go to the market in Marrakesh

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.210
and you say, OK, so
star anise and the lemon

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.370
and the sort of grapefruits
and the oranges.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.190
I see so many things.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.020
That's what you can do
in your imagination.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.840
But sometimes we say, oh,
that's a little bit crazy

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.590
and we laugh about it.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:58.190
But this really brings you a lot
of ideas to travel in your mind

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.170
to countries where
you've been, countries

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.600
which you have inspired.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.990
Like when we think
of a carrot and we

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.140
want to combine it with
Chinese ingredients, what

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.020
do you think of?

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.480
Chinese kitchen.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.930
Soy sauce, oyster sauce,
rice wine, rice vinegar.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.860
More Chinese.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.690
Chinese.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.884
You're from China?

00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:27.800
AUDIENCE: No, I'm not.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.091
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Oh, sorry.

00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:30.320
AUDIENCE: But garlic?

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.030
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Garlic.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.529
Yeah.

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:32.240
Yeah.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.161
Chinese kitchen.

00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:35.660
come on.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.220
Join in.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.164
Join in.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.300
Cinnamon also.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:45.800
Yeah.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.238
Anise, yeah.

00:24:52.238 --> 00:24:53.200
Yeah.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.620
Well.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.510
We go on.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.790
Now we go to Italy.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.210
Who has been in Italy?

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.950
OK, great.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.250
So when we think of a carrot
in an Italian kitchen,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.320
where do you think of?

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.560
Italian kitchen maybe close
by in your flavor memory.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.960
Italian kitchen, come on.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.990
Red wine.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.660
Red, red wine.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.350
Red wine.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.010
Think of basil, tomatoes.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.150
Yes?

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.410
Olive oil.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.199
Come on. come on, you can do it.

00:25:30.199 --> 00:25:30.990
AUDIENCE: Parmesan.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.950
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Parmesan
cheese, prosciutto, porcini.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.641
Think of what fish you know the
Italian kitchen you have often

00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:38.140
on a pizza.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.380
Oregano, anchovies.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.430
So Parmesan, prosciutto,
anchovies, sardines.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.870
It's all Italian
kitchen, Italian cuisine.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.930
What will happen
when you tempt fate,

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.940
produce the carrots with all
of these different ingredients?

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.800
You get a different carrot.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.180
So that's a little
bit of my message.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:13.690
And for the painting, this
is the painting in my head.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.230
From all the traveling I
did from all the countries,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.690
I think, oh, I have the
carrot and the tomato

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.540
and I have the
ginger and seaweed.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.320
I have the [INAUDIBLE] spices,
saffron, I have fennel seeds,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.860
I have the dill, and I
have even the coffee beans.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.950
When you crush coffee beans,
you have a lot of flavor.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.110
Well, what will happen
when you make a carrot cake

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.688
and put some coffee flavorings?

00:26:38.688 --> 00:26:39.580
OK.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.840
So this has happened
in my head as a chef.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.300
And these are the
dishes then I have made.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:52.170
It's a yogurt ice cream
with roasted orange paprika

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:57.430
with mango and
chips of carrots--

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.480
chips of carrot not deep
fried, bits dried in the oven

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.710
at 70 degrees.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:10.000
This is the inspiration
from Marrakesh,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.860
carrot salad with lentils with
a reduction of orange juice

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.600
and ras el hanout.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.520
You know ras el hanout?

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.320
The best spice mix from
the spice men there.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.500
And some peas.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.109
SPEAKER: Chickpeas.

00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:31.650
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Chickpeas cream.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.580
Yeah, and some mint.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.200
So this is just a combination in
my inspiration from Marrakesh.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.700
OK.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:47.900
This is a ceviche with
quinoa, coriander.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.770
This is the Chinese inspiration.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:56.240
This is with tuna and a roll
with a very think carrot

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.820
with [INAUDIBLE], seaweed.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:04.910
And I made a dressing from
a reduction of orange juice.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.290
Tempura of carrots.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.540
This is very important.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:15.490
In this dish, you have from
one carrot four preparations.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.690
So the whole carrot
was in the oven

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:26.230
and then all the juices in
the carrot are caramelizing.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.900
And then I cut it and it
didn't touch any water

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.870
so it's full of flavor.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:40.000
Then I made around the carrots
a marinated carrots julienne.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.790
Then I made a mousseline
of the rest of the carrot

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.180
with some olive oil
and some lemon juice

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:51.210
because lemon is bringing all
the flavor more intensity, more

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.210
alive.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.530
And then a crunch.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.800
So when you think
of these flavors,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.685
you have sweet of the carrots,
you have the smooth mouth feel

00:29:00.685 --> 00:29:04.720
of the cream, you have the
balance of the sweet and sour

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:10.420
from the marinated carrots,
and you have crunch.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:16.810
So this is what you can do with
one ingredient, one veggie,

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.320
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.190
These are all veggies
marinated and rolled up.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.000
OK.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.550
Well, before I'm going
to make the painting,

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.180
this is a flavor graphic.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.295
You can make a flavor
graphic yourself.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:44.500
Think, oh, I use an
onion in this case.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.810
Oh, which spice do I
like or which spices

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:55.980
can I match with an onion and
what can I do with the onion?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.890
We cannot remember these,
so when you draw it and make

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:04.225
your own word cloud or mind
map, a whole worlds is going

00:30:04.225 --> 00:30:06.610
to open.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.230
OK.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.930
Sorry.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:08.790
Next one.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.400
Next one.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.280
Yeah.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.380
OK.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.474
This is the last thing before
I'm going to make the painting.

00:30:18.474 --> 00:30:20.140
When we talk about
the success factors--

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.460
and we'll ask Peter here--

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.040
stand here, it's a
little bit better.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.410
Peter will tell more
about the success factors

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.690
because it will
help you every time

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.690
when you go visit a
restaurant, eat a dish,

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.830
or you make your own dish.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:43.465
Because there are a couple of
not rules, but a couple of--

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:44.215
how do you say it?

00:30:44.215 --> 00:30:46.770
PETER KLOSSE: They are
rules, rules of composition.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.860
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Rules of composition.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.380
And when you hear this,
you will never forget it

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.270
because it will make every visit
to a restaurant and every dish

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:02.122
you make, it will
be made different.

00:31:02.122 --> 00:31:04.080
PETER KLOSSE: So the
thing Angélique is saying,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.220
you need imagination.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.280
With imagination, you got all
these wonderful combinations

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.150
of things.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.015
And then there is
also kind of a theory.

00:31:11.015 --> 00:31:14.320
So you need a kind of a theory
to bring it all together.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.230
And that's what
this slide shows us.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.530
For one is because
it's very special.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:24.660
Umami is, of course, called
one of the basic flavors.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.220
Umami is a very rich
family of four flavors.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.240
One of the culinary
success factors

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.410
is that umami should be there.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:40.390
So if a dish lacks umami,
there's something missing.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.820
This is what
Angélique is saying.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.620
So knowing about umami
is very important.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.830
This is the other
important side of it,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.320
knowing about what every
component does in a dish.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.930
So we think that flavor is
basically about mouth fell,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.920
and in mouth feel there
are three different forces.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.170
One force we call contracting.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.952
It has everything to do with
salt, with acidity, with sour,

00:32:06.952 --> 00:32:08.410
things that contract
in your mouth.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.980
That's why we chose
the word contracted.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:16.350
Another direction, another
force is called the coating.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.750
And this is about all the
fats and all the sugars

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.210
and everything that really
leaves a layer behind

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.380
in your mouth.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.920
And then there is another
vector, another force,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.870
that's called
drying or dry, which

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.246
is basically the crunch or
everything that has a texture--

00:32:31.246 --> 00:32:33.620
things that you can chew on,
things that you can bite on,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.750
things like that.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.500
So these are different
forces and this

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.100
is the basic composition
of every flavor

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.510
throughout the world.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:46.980
When I was in Beijing, I gave
a master class in Beijing

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.230
and then all these
Chinese people exactly

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.350
understood what I was
talking about within

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.140
their cultural frame of flavor.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.990
So it's very important,
I think, to realize

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.320
that flavor has a
real structure and I

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.290
call them vectors and these
are real vectors with forces

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.210
behind them.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.620
Of course, we don't have a
measure for these forces,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.060
that's what we need to develop.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.910
It would be wonderful
to have a scale,

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.720
but we don't have
these scales yet.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.110
But I think these scales
will be developed.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:20.580
Smart people at Google should
be able to do that for sure.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.470
But this could be the basis
of any algorithm or flavor.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.300
So now we are going
to go back to practice

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.280
in building the painting.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.330
So Angélique.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.745
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:34.370
PETER KLOSSE: So I
will tell every time

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.040
if it's coating, crunch,
or frying, or whatever.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.340
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Exactly.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.190
PETER KLOSSE: That's
what I will do.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.273
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:33:39.273 --> 00:33:44.560
So this is the pumpkin
and the sweet potato

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.620
in the oven with lot of
bay leaf and garlic--

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.060
roasting, roasting, roasting.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.770
Then I've pureed it.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:59.760
And it's not sweet,
but it's coating,

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.840
but it's full of flavor with
a little white wine vinegar

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.890
to lift it up.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.940
Excuse me.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.840
And this will be kind of
the basic for the paint.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.317
Oops.

00:34:25.317 --> 00:34:26.650
PETER KLOSSE: So coating, right?

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.889
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: I'm going
to ask some chefs to help me.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.100
PETER KLOSSE: You're going to
be able to taste everything.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.232
So you will see that there
is a bit of acidity in it,

00:34:36.232 --> 00:34:37.940
because otherwise it
would be too coated.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.810
So the acidity works as
a countervailing power

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.360
within the cooking,
so within the puree.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.314
That's what
composition is about.

00:34:49.314 --> 00:34:50.397
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:35:02.730
Yeah because some-- it's a
little bit thinner because I

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.210
made it this morning.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.370
So I'll do it a little
bit different now.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.880
If you'll stay here, we'll
give you some other--

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.000
so you put big dots.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.640
Take your time.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.770
Take a nice dot like
this and then up.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:26.520
Just on every plate some dots.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.751
OK?

00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:28.250
OK.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:39.320
Now, this is a curd
of kefir yogurt.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.500
I made a [INAUDIBLE]
with some miso.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.120
And miso is from soybean paste.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.530
PETER KLOSSE: Fermented.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.405
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Fermented soybean paste.

00:35:50.405 --> 00:35:55.370
And every Japanese
family has its own miso.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.360
So it's a little bit salty and
it's a very nice combination

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.360
together with the curds.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.266
Yeah, great.

00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:28.610
PETER KLOSSE: Again,
a coating substance.

00:36:31.697 --> 00:36:34.810
And if you taste it, you
will find the acidity.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.340
So that balance of why, a bit
of the richness of the coating.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.070
So it's the balance you
find within the substance.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.290
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: So just
put it like this, nice dots.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.790
Yes.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.531
And follow the line.

00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:56.030
Yeah?

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.860
And this is some cuds, too,
but it's mixed with saffron

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.367
to make it more [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:12.824 --> 00:37:16.050
I need a small [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.480
PETER KLOSSE: We did work
on culinary success factors.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.680
For instance, at Google
in London and Paris

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.270
and Zurich and Dublin, we
worked with Google chefs.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.990
We developed dishes based on
the culinary success factors.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.620
Then they were served at
Google offices for Googlers

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.320
and then we asked, which one
of the three alternatives

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.700
did you like best?

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.040
And every time, you
find that the ones that

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.900
have the culinary
success factors

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.160
are found to be without any
information just naturally

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.150
the best.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.560
It's very interesting
to have a re-evaluation

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.530
of these culinary
success factors.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.620
Presentation is a
very important one.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.980
So the way things
look, the presentation

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.830
of a dish, the name you give a
dish is all a part of flavor.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.130
It's often forgotten.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.440
People think that flavor is
sweet, sour, bitter, et cetera,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.900
but it's much, much, much more.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.706
You need to take everything into
account to really understand

00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:11.580
what flavor is about.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.020
So the name, presentation, color
is an important aspect of it.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.620
Balance is an important aspect,
smell is an important aspect,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:25.641
umami is one, and very
identifiable flavors as well.

00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:27.390
And then you need a
balance in mouth feel,

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.194
differences in mouth feel.

00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:30.360
We're going to work on that.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.420
These are all let's say
the coating substances.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.440
But you will find
that we need more

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.890
to make a nice balance
and a nice dish

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.145
or a canvas or a painting.

00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:46.020
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Then we have the tomato.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:55.020
And the tomato will mix
together with the sweetness

00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.220
of the sweet potato and pumpkin.

00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:05.450
PETER KLOSSE: Tomato is
a very special ingredient

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.440
because there are many
flavors within a tomato.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.590
If you have a say
early harvested

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.610
tomato or an unripe type, then
the acidity and the tartness

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.300
will be there.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.427
But when you have a very rich
tomato which is harvested late,

00:39:18.427 --> 00:39:20.760
then of course, it will be
much sweeter and much richer.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.060
So it's very important to
look at what type of tomato

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.131
you have for the effect
that you want to use.

00:39:25.131 --> 00:39:26.630
If you want to have
something sweet,

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.410
then you need a riper type
of tomato and a sweeter

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.930
one than if you just wanted
the tartness or the acidity.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.890
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.650
Then we have a very
wonderful ingredient

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.320
which you will smell.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.950
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:50.010
It's fermented spices and
veggies from the Indian kitchen

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.850
like fenugreek,
onion, garlic, curry

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.170
leaves and is very strong.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:02.250
So I heated it to 40
degrees Celsius, mixed it

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.790
with sunflower and olive oil.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:10.330
And it will be connecting
because it's not spicy,

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.950
but it's full of flavor.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.240
PETER KLOSSE: It is part
of the second factor

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.050
that I mentioned, the smell
of a dish is very important.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.650
By using an oil like this,
you have a very rich flavor

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.370
component and you will notice
that within seconds, everything

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.640
will smell like the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.795
It's an important aspect.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.310
I already have it in my nose.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.070
Then for the crunch--

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:48.700
a juicy crunch-- we use
the leaves of endive.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.160
And you can use it later
like a kind of a spoon

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.300
and then with the
endive you pick up

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.010
the cream like a crunch.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.830
We need a crunch, Peter.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.866
PETER KLOSSE: Also
this is a balance.

00:41:01.866 --> 00:41:03.490
The mouth feel needs
to be interesting.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.470
So you need crunchy,
you need bites,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.320
you need things that
crack, things that break.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.660
You need every kind of
crunch that your mouth

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.280
can make things interesting.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.920
If you only had the
creamy substances,

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.420
it will be kind of boring.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.620
So now we're going to add
different types of mouth feel.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.520
So here you have the
leaves that break and make

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.390
a high-pitched sound, which
is much more like crispy.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.400
There are going to be nuts,
there are going to be crisps.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.780
They're all
different mouth feels

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.369
that really help to make
a flavor in balance.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.150
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.461
Do you already smell that?

00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:49.960
OK.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:42:00.220
Let's say the oxygen is coming
a little bit to the flavors.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.150
PETER KLOSSE: Imagine that
this oil wouldn't be there.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.715
The dish would be less
interesting, right?

00:42:05.715 --> 00:42:07.288
It's the smell that does that.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.870
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.850
Now we have a green oil--

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.250
not just a green oil.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.660
It is made from flat
parsley and tarragon.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.130
Tarragon there's a
lot of anise flavor.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:30.020
And often, when you
make an herb oil,

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:36.260
it's going to [INAUDIBLE]
in some brown-green color.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:40.790
And we blanch it first
just in water without salt

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.970
and put it in, pull it
out at the same time,

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.200
make it cold very quickly.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.750
We squeeze out all
the water and then

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:53.800
we mix it with 40 degree Celsius
oil until it's like this.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:59.720
And it's the chlorophyll
which makes the oil much more

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:05.972
intense then when it's raw.

00:43:05.972 --> 00:43:07.620
OK.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.227
PETER KLOSSE: Look at what the
color does on the painting.

00:43:12.227 --> 00:43:13.310
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Oops.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.116
PETER KLOSSE: Part
of presentation.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:28.470
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: So when you
are going to eat this later on,

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.710
you have to mix a lot of things.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:37.320
But it will happen
at the same time

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:43.145
because everything
is going to connect.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.840
PETER KLOSSE: The tarragon and
the parsley are fresh flavors

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:00.770
and they are often
confounded with sour.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.060
It's very important to
distinguish freshness

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.140
from sourness.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.880
Freshness and sourness do
go together once in a while,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.680
but in an oil like this
it's just freshness

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.920
that you have
without the sourness.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.660
So that really does
influence the mouth feel

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.440
on the contracting
side that's the coating

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.901
but also gives freshness.

00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:18.900
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.680
So now, we were
talking about carrots.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.160
And this is the purple carrot.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:35.700
For me, this is an example
of how to seduce a carrots.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.690
Well, it's not that
difficult. You just

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:45.060
put it in the oven for a long
time with a lot of bay leaves.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.140
I think this carrot had
about six bay leaves crushed.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.510
So a lot of flavor can
come out of the bay leaf.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.040
A lot of garlic.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:58.770
Then we first blanch it so
that the plant cells can open

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:04.150
and then all the sweet
juices can caramelize.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:10.701
And it's in the oven
on 160 degrees Celsius.

00:45:10.701 --> 00:45:11.200
Sorry.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.680
Next time I will have it
with Fahrenheit in my head.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.200
And then roast, roast, roast.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:23.130
And it's going to
flavor like licorice.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.610
You know licorice?

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.170
In Holland we are
fond of licorice.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.670
So this carrot is
like licorice, just

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.580
the carrot with
three ingredients.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:39.930
And I did it with just
one orange carrot.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.630
And it's quite different.

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.590
It's more caramelized
and it's less

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.170
intensive than the purple one.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:54.540
So for every one I
have one piece, yes?

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.490
So if you like it, just
please take one piece.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:01.410
Otherwise, I don't
think we'll have enough.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.430
And we have a whole
carrot to combine it

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.830
with all the other
flavors on the dish.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:09.525
So it's nice to--

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.450
PETER KLOSSE: Have a
carrot and pass it through.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:17.533
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.970
PETER KLOSSE: I think one
of the things in gastronomy

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.670
that people forget a lot
is to cook vegetables.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.190
Vegetables, a lot of
times they are raw.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.560
And if you eat them
raw, they are raw.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.280
And there is a lot more flavor
to find in carrots or whatever

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.280
vegetable when you
add temperature.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.890
And often here as
well, when I'm here,

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:47.730
I'm often surprised at all the
things that are involved here--

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.300
kale and sprouts.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.369
And much of these things
are much, much better

00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:53.410
when they've been cooked.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:57.280
And then you can eat them,
of course, cold if you want.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.670
But cooking vegetables
at lower temperatures

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:04.540
and getting these flavors
out is a very important side

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:10.367
of the flavor story
of vegetables.

00:47:10.367 --> 00:47:11.950
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
This is a freshly

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:17.110
made tomato puree from
tomatoes with onions

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:22.480
and cooked to reduce all
the water until it's thick.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.980
And then we put
it in the blender

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.020
and then you have
your own fresh puree

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.270
from good ripened tomatoes.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:39.720
And this is the color blocking
that you see in fashion when

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:46.490
you have an orange shirt with
a red trouser and you go, whoa.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:49.000
So in flavor, it's the same.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.920
The carrot is very sweet and the
tomato is a little bit of acid

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.820
so it will give much
more life to all things.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.010
It's often when you miss
something in this, then

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:12.610
start with adding
a little bit maybe

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.885
some caper or a little
bit of sour tomato puree.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.330
PETER KLOSSE: Acidity
is often forgotten.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.780
Acidity is one of the most
forgotten parts of a dish,

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.130
including bitter.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.140
Bitter and acidity,
it is thought

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.480
that people don't like those
things and they're kept away.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.780
But for depth and for
having great dishes,

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:43.340
you need a good addition of some
acidity and some bitterness--

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.810
not too much, but a bit.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.790
It's like salt, it's good to
add a bit but not too much.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:50.620
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Let's do the olives.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.780
Fresh olives, dried olives.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.280
OK.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.685
We have kalamata
olives, fresh once.

00:48:58.685 --> 00:48:59.660
Do you know them?

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:08.190
When you chew, much more
flavors will come to you

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:11.070
when you are aware of
what you're eating.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:18.580
But then see the difference,
flavor the difference

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.356
of dried kalamata olives.

00:49:21.356 --> 00:49:23.430
We're putting both
on the painting

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.270
so we can experiment with what
is happening when you pull out

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.640
all the liquids.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.280
It's a very strange flavor.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.285
I don't think you've ever
flavored like this an olive.

00:49:35.285 --> 00:49:37.650
It's so intense.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.180
It's a little bit bitter--

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.195
just a little bit-- and
a little bit more salty.

00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:44.940
OK.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:53.230
What we will do is if you put
just a little bit, so here

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.420
and there.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.630
Yeah?

00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:00.260
And these ones we
put a little together

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.760
so it's in the same area
so you can taste both.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.510
OK.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.555
Let me see what I have.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.150
We do the same with the capers.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.480
We have the fresh capers,
you all know them?

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.340
And when you dry
the fresh capers

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:27.540
in the oven at 70
degrees Celsius,

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.520
so don't be in a hurry.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.280
The oven is doing the job.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.870
And you dry it, you get a
crunchy, acid ingredient.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.700
It's very nice.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.620
It's a very nice flavor.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.570
We put it next to
each other again

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.830
so you can flavor
the difference.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:49.960
Yeah.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.460
OK.

00:50:53.516 --> 00:50:55.140
PETER KLOSSE: Of
course, you understand

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.400
what you're doing with
drying things in the oven.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.030
You intensify flavors and
in intensifying flavors,

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.920
you're also changing flavors.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.450
So you're reducing the
sharpness of the raw caper.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.340
It has a very sharp acidity.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.220
And if you taste
the dried one, it's

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.390
much more on the salty side.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.080
So the whole
profile of the caper

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.299
is changing by, again,
adding temperature.

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:29.200
And if you think that's a lot of
work, let the oven do the work.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.897
You can do your own thing
while the oven is working.

00:51:31.897 --> 00:51:34.480
You don't have to stand next to
it, you don't have to help it,

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.520
you don't have to look at it.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.690
It just works by itself.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:40.800
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: OK.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.140
But we have more.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.730
Yeah.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.190
We have the furikake.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.015
It's from a Japanese kitchen.

00:51:50.015 --> 00:51:55.400
It's a topping
usually used for rice.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.710
And I made it myself.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:02.190
It's from seaweed, roasted
sesame seed-- white ones--

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:07.820
the black ones and wasabi
flavored ones with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:12.920
I heat it in the pan.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.460
Dried capers are also in it.

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:18.980
And it's a really
nice crunchy mix.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:29.380
I'm going to put it on the
side of the curd with the miso

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.060
because they're a
little bit friends.

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:38.250
And then you take a little
bit of endive with the miso

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:41.160
curd and then with
the furikake and you

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.518
have a wonderful combination.

00:53:16.477 --> 00:53:18.310
PETER KLOSSE: Leave
that to your assistants.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:18.730
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:19.760
OK.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.900
So we're almost there.

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.467
PETER KLOSSE: Nuts.

00:53:26.467 --> 00:53:27.800
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah, nuts.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.850
Something I will leave
here because it's getting

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:32.320
a little bit too busy on the--

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.660
first we do the crunch.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:44.030
We have a cracker I
made from tapioca flour

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:45.950
with saffron and water.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:50.090
Spread it out, dry it,
and then I deep fry it.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:54.410
And the crunch is
important in a dish.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:54:02.620
Without a crunch, a dish can
be very sometimes boring.

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.750
The crunch we put on
the saffron cream.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.811
Just put it down,
don't put it in.

00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:19.310
OK.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:25.070
And we have the same
with a seaweed cracker

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:30.020
also made from tapioca
and with crunched seaweed.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:40.780
We put it on the miso, not
everywhere but here and there.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.250
Then we have more.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:53.500
We have the walnuts,
just plain walnuts.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:58.830
It's a different crunch than
endive or than the saffron

00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.330
crackers.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.875
And I put that crunch
also with the curds.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.990
PETER KLOSSE: These
are all elements

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:34.130
that belong to the drying
components in the plate.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.620
But evidently, the nuts
are different in mouth

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:45.856
feel than the crispness of
the saffron and the seaweed.

00:55:45.856 --> 00:55:47.847
Then we have that one.

00:55:47.847 --> 00:55:49.930
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: This
is a very important one.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:53.030
You know the toastie?

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:54.760
You ever have a toastie?

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.850
You know the bread with
the cheese and the ham

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.900
and then the cheese is coming
on the outside of the bread?

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.430
You know that?

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:07.330
And then you get that smell
from the caramelized cheese?

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:17.830
Well, this is the crunchy part
of the sides of the toastie.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.000
Yes?

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.650
This is wonderful.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:22.650
You only need this
when you flavor it

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:27.220
with the sweet potato
and the tomato.

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.910
And then you have all
the Italian umami flavors

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:34.217
you can imagine.

00:56:34.217 --> 00:56:36.050
PETER KLOSSE: You can
imagine it's Parmesan,

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:40.240
but probably everybody
knows it's Parmesan.

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.340
Together with tomato, of
course, it's wonderful.

00:56:51.164 --> 00:56:53.330
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Just
a couple and then the rest

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:54.930
we'll do separate.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.990
Just a couple.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.790
Yeah.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:59.290
OK.

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:02.210
We're almost there.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.830
Let me see.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:07.010
We This is very rich.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.590
These are algae crackers--

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:18.320
not LG from the television,
but algae from the sea.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.460
Very thin very strong.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.960
Don't eat it at the
beginning because it

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.710
stays very long in your mouth.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.890
OK.

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:43.890
Can you put some?

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.620
Yeah.

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.120
OK.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.060
I see one thing as a chef
because there's a camera

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.430
and I have a very
awful dot here.

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:00.110
Yes, you see?

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:06.220
OK.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:09.760
Then we leave this a
little bit separate.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.170
I started with the
carrots and I will almost

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:15.910
end with the carrots.

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:21.190
But first when we
talk about no waste,

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:26.000
you can make powder from every
ingredient you can imagine.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.260
So when you have
leftover from veggies,

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.840
just dry them in the
oven and then put it

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.110
in like a coffee bean
machine, the small thing.

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.030
You know them here?

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:38.410
Very quick one?

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:39.160
Grinder Grinder.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.576
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK:
Grinder, yes.

00:58:40.576 --> 00:58:43.290
And then you can make
a wonderful powder.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:47.670
So I put some powder--

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:58.335
let's see [INAUDIBLE]----
just to finish.

00:59:05.629 --> 00:59:07.337
PETER KLOSSE: You end
up with green hair.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.650
ANGELIQUE SCHMEINCK: Yeah.

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:13.034
It's awesome, yeah?

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:16.700
OK.

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.470
Now I have filthy hands.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:30.350
And then we end where we
started, with the carrots.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:33.750
You see what's happening.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:36.170
The algae powder is
mixing with the carrots.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.020
Nice, eh?

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.150
Yeah.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.370
That's what's happening.

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:45.500
The carrot power
I made from when

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:51.050
you use the carrots in the
juicer, then in the container

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.960
the pulp that's remaining,
just grind the pulp.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.900
And you have a
wonderful kind of powder

00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:02.450
which you can use in a
patisserie or in a dough

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.860
or in dressings.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.220
OK.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.614
The other side.

01:00:15.614 --> 01:00:17.155
And it actually adds
a lot of flavor.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:23.910
OK.

01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:29.100
OK.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.600
OK.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.170
I forgot one thing.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.120
I have to sign.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.650
I have to sign it.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:37.550
I have to sign
the painting, yes?

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.515
So I say go on Google.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.110
So it's for you.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:47.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.180
I would like to invite you
to come around the painting

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.220
and just experience
all the combinations.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.180
So bon appetit.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.930
[APPLAUSE]
