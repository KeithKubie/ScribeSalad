Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. T. E. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. The podcasts podcast. Will we should just say as a sort of set the set the ground here, set the ground, does that table table, whatever, uh, that we are on the cusp of delivering five really fantastic shows right now. So we're busy, busy, busy, very busy. Which got us thinking about a conversation that I had a few years ago, which was conveniently, they're waiting with Malcolm Gladwell, the author of outliers and blink. I was over at the 92nd street y in New York City. Okay. Just pull it to your mouth there. The subject was how do you explain people of really unusual, exceptional talent? Like why are they so good here? What is the nature of being exceptional? Is this, you know, working hard or need ability? Is it an accident? And as we all know in America, there's a real hunt on from a very early age to find the gifted and talented children. And we have programs in our schools all over the country trying to identify exceptional kids. Malcolm Gladwell hates gifted and talented program.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Yeah, it's ridiculous. Why do you decide, so a gifted program says that we identify a child and call that child gifted because of their performance at the age of whatever, nine or 10 or 11 years old. Why do we care? Particularly how well a child performs at nine or 10 or 11 years old, they're nine or 10 or 11 there are good 25 years to making any kind of substantial contribution to the world. Why don't we wait? What's the hurry? And also how do you know? So like you know, so one child learns to read it for one child, learns to read it, two and a half. Right. So what, why does it matter? Are the things that are being read between two and a half and four of such incalculable?

Speaker 1:          01:57          No, no, no. [inaudible] normal parents response to, Oh, if he's reading it two and a half, think of the things he'll do. And it's just an extrapolation

Speaker 2:          02:06          like reading is reading. Once you can read, we're done. I mean, it's not like there's an, there's an infinite scale and so-and-so reads better and better and better. And I can say, we can say today of Gladwell that he reads so much better than Krulwich. And that this is like what separates the two of us. It's speeding. I mean like, well there is also among your, you use the phrase the Matthew effect. What does that Matthew fact is? I'm a phrase coined by Robert K Merton, the great genius sociologist of Columbia. He's the guy who says in the verse in Matthew which says that I'm to him who has much more will be given. Um, and he uses this to describe the Matthew FAQ, which is this notion that a small initial advantage, um, difference in a small initial difference in the performance of any two people will inevitably grow. Because the person who is a little bit ahead will get so many more advantages that they will end up being far ahead. So a good example, there's all kinds of great Matthew effects. So if you're born, if you're a young boy born in October, November, or December, who has designs on being a professional soccer or hockey player, um, the deck is stacked against you. There's not much you can do. You, you, um, you should probably give out

Speaker 3:          03:31          but not, but here's why we don't. Why exactly. Well, it's really an accident of birth thing. The month you were born in Malcolm, things might make a huge, huge difference in their life here. Here's his way of describing this. I'm going to read here a passage from his book outliers. On page 23 of your book. You do a play by play and every way to do this, we're at the Memorial Cup hockey championship and I want to read what you wrote. March 11 starts around one side of the Tigers Net, leaving the puck for his team. May January 4th, he passes it to January 22, flips it back to March 12th who shoots point blank at the Tigers goalie. April 27th, April 27th blocks to shot reed mounted by Vancouver's march 60 shoots medicine half defenseman, February 9th and February 14th dive to block the puck. January 10th looks on helplessly March 6th scores. Question is why did you choose this peculiar kind of nomenclature?

Speaker 2:          04:25          Because I wanted to make this point that all an extraordinary number of hockey players, um, and are born in the first three or four months of the year. 17 of the 25 players on the medicine hat team were born in those first few months. Why? Because, uh, uh, the eligibility cutoff date for four age class hockey in Canada in the world is January 1st and we start recruiting allstar squads in hockey and Canada when peep kids are nine and 10 years old. But of course when you're nine years old, the best one is the oldest one, right? So all you do is you choose the kids who are born closest to the cutoff date and then you give them special coaching and put them on all star squads until nine and extra games and extra practice until eight and nine years later. They really are the best.

Speaker 2:          05:14          And by the way, we see exactly the same effects in school systems, right? The kid, the, the, the relatively youngest kids in the class, um, a underperformed the relatively oldest, um, uh, kids and that underperformance last into the college years, the kid born, the youngest kid born the last, you know, three months of the youngest, three months of their age cohort in school or something like, I forget the exact number, nine or 10% less likely to go to college than those born in the are the, in the three oldest months and we can fix it really easily. You've got three classes in an elementary school, right? Typical elementary schools go up, divide them up by birthday, right?

Speaker 3:          05:55          Doesn't that mean though that that you have get, you had to like a half dozen soccer moms to work out the logistical problems because you've now got four leads? We used to have one and someone has to be in the Seward park on Mondays and Wednesdays, but who's going to be inserted fucking Thursdays and Fridays. Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:07          So you would just for the sake of efficiency, you'd know, I was very happy. I was shocked. I was to know two thirds of them. Know what I'm saying? No, but your, this is exactly why I brought this up with, um, I had a conversation with this hockey guy in Canada. Big Deal hockey. Mocker I dunno whether they call them markers. You can go and Matthews here, but absolutely. And I say to him, look, you're Canada, you want to be the best hockey country in the world. Why don't you have the three parallel leaks? How hard is that? Every single town in Canada has like 25 different hockey teams. Just divide them up. How hard is this? He, he's like, oh, it's too difficult.

Speaker 3:          06:47          Well, let me make it, let me give you a harder one because cause uh, just another success puzzle from the book. This is off to set up for you. It's um, it's about the Janklow family. So there's two gang close. We're gonna talk about more and Mort, but since those are names are socially, we caught one daddy Janklow and one Sonny Genco. Yeah. So daddy goes to Brooklyn law school class in 1919 sets up a practice in Brooklyn, elegant fellow dresses in a Homburg Bruce brother's clothes, drives a big car and we was the queens, married the right girl, worked hard, hard, hard, hard sets of the business, goes nowhere. The Sun Baby Janklow when 30 years later it gets a law degree, marries nicely to works hard to put together a cable franchise, sells it to Cox Broadcasting, makes a fortune, creates a literary agency. Janklow and Nesbitt signs you now he lives on Park Avenue. He has an Anselm Kiefer painting on his own airplane. So the question is, is the son succeeds? The father fails. Why is this

Speaker 2:          07:43          that definitely that part. The book I'm really interested in, um, generational effects, uh, the worst year to be born in the 20th century is you can all kinds of sociologists figure these things out. It's between 1900 and 1907 or maybe at 1,919 10 that decade because you get out of college and the, just as you're getting going to depression hits, yeah, you have nine years of depression. And just as you're emerging out the depression, trying to make a go of it, you're shipped off to war for six years. Right? And so by the time you come back, I want to start your business. You're in your late forties right? So it's really, really hard for where is the best year to be born in the 20th century. If you live in, grew up in New York City, actually I think anywhere, but particularly in New York City is 1935 because it's perfect because you, it's the smallest birth year of the 20th century.

Speaker 2:          08:43          You always want to be part of a really small birth cohort because no one's competing with you. Right? Think about it. So the difference between being a part of the smallest postcard and the largest one, the differences between the smallest one is enormous. It's like per capita twice as many babies are born in, you know, 1920 is 1935 so if you're a nursing 35 there's this huge generation before you. So what do they do for that generation? They build big, huge, shiny schools and hire tons of teachers. Right? Then there's no more kids. So you sail in and all of a sudden your older brother had 35 kids in this class, you have 18 your older brother competed against a zillion people to get into city college. You competed against no one you wanted to join the debate team. No one went out for the debate team.

Speaker 2:          09:31          You are captain of the base team. Like I always, you know it's funny, you always talk to people well in this forum itch small cohorts and they always think you're talking to some guy accomplished old guy, grew up in the Bronx, white hair and he'll tell you about his extraordinary high school experiences. And so you know, I was captain of the basketball team and you look at, this guy is five foot two and you say to yourself, this is a man who belonged to a small generation, right? Nobody was going out for basketball. So these guys, they haven't made in the shade and then they come into the workforce. No, they go to a Harvard law school. Of course they go to Harvard law school, right? No one's applying to Harvard law school. And they get out in the workforce, do they get a job?

Speaker 2:          10:11          Of course they do. Everyone's desperate for work because there's no one out there. And then what's behind them? The biggest generation of 20th century. So they sail in the positions of authority and they have in front of them this enormous market to serve, right? It's just genius. You can even go more specifically, this is great thing that happens. Great in quotation marks in New York City, in the depression, which is that a whole bunch of very, very, very able, people can't get jobs in the private sector. There are no jobs in private sectors. So what do they do? They become teachers, right? And you talked to this generation born in 35 about their high school experience. And I lost count and the number of people of that generation who went to public schools in New York who told me, for example, that their math teacher had a phd in math.

Speaker 2:          10:57          And so here's the generation who not only could they be kept on the basketball team, but their teachers were these extraordinary people who you know, were, um, by virtue of a lack of opportunity ended up in the public school system. So is that the difference then between Janklow Dan and Genco son? That is just the beginning of the explanation. I mean, I never met Jankel. I mean, you can only go so far with this, but it helps you to sort of set the stage to understand his shoe. You've got these two very capable people, one of whom achieved extraordinary success and one didn't. And you, I think you have to go beyond the individual to make sense of them, right? I mean,

Speaker 3:          11:35          so there is such a thing as getting an accidental boost and I mean, you know, nobody chooses when they're going to be born. It's always mom and dad's fault, but there's something even bigger and even more important than good luck with your birthday. And you illustrate this. Malcolm cites the example of bill gates, he so-called genius behind Microsoft.

Speaker 2:          11:54          When you say so-called, you'll see here's the luckiest guy in the world. And he's the first to tell you that, um, he goes to, uh, he shows up for eighth grade in 1968 or nine at a lakeside academy. And for reasons no one can remember, somebody on the parent's committee bought a computer for the kids and a little teletype hooked into the main mainframe in downtown Seattle. And Gates has essentially now what that allows you is to do realtime programming. Everyone, everyone's programmed with cards back then, right? Which is incredibly laborious, time consuming. And you don't really learn at a program cause it just takes too long. He can do real time programming the way we program now on this little teletype. And he does that starting in 1968 basically for his entire teenage life. Um, and you mean that almost literally. Yeah. You tell him, he told me this one story about, he then goes to these whole series of things of finding other computers.

Speaker 2:          12:51          And at one point, Paul Allen is Pat's paid at this school, um, discovers that there's a mainframe that's free at the University of Washington Medical Center between, it's free between two and six in the morning on weeknights, and he's now 15 years old. And so he sets his alarm for one 30 in the morning and he crawls out the window, right? Because someone's parents know at two in the morning walks two miles to the arrest of Washington programs from two til six walks home and goes back to bed. And his mom, upon discovering this years later says, I was wondering why it was so hard to get bill up in the morning. Um, so the question is, he's clearly a brilliant guy. No one's taking that away from him, but he has this other thing which he, by the way, what's really remarkable about that, but the story to me is when he does that, he's 15. So he's a teenage boy. And then all of us here know about teenage boys, right? Or what did he need to do? I want to do what is the tangible I want to do? Well, what does one of the things that teenage boy wants to do? Sleep right? Here's a kid, here's a teenage boy who was willing to surrender his sleep, you know, five nights a week to program from two, six in the morning. That is what's special about Bill Gates.

Speaker 3:          14:02          And it accumulates, right? It gets, it's out. It's three hours or four hours a day and then five hours a day whenever you can make it six hours a day. It's for years and years and years until he,

Speaker 2:          14:12          a lot of hours. Yeah. Uh, and Mozart I guess play the piano for lawful hours and tiger woods just plays out. People are all examples of what's called the 10,000 hour rule, which is this notion that, um, Scott of brilliant kind of Ericsson a psychologist has kind of formulated this principle that if you look at any kind of cognitively complex discipline, it seems almost without exception, that in order to be good, you must practice at least 10,000 hours. What sort of surprised me? You put the Beatles on this list. Why are the Beatles? Because they go to, um, Humberg, uh, before they come to America as teenagers, they go to Hamburg and they play a, they're the house band in a strip club and they play eight hour sets, seven days a week for months at a stretch. I mean, it's incredible. I mean, you know, paranthetically one cannot imagine a more dismal experience than playing first of all, playing in a strip club. Secondly, playing at a strip club in Hamburg and 30 playing in a strip club in Hamburg in the 50s. I mean, can you imagine? It's just again,

Speaker 3:          15:20          so they learned in those hours and hours and hours of playing every night. They learned just to play and play and play and play whatever. And somehow, because I mean there is in the book you're arguing, I think that, I mean you could say by the way, that the rolling stones I don't think went to Han Borg and uh, there probably were other Liverpool bands that did go to Hamburg and played in the same strip clubs and you do not know their names. I don't know how you,

Speaker 2:          15:44          it's a, isn't necessarily not sufficient as sufficient on a, sorry, I forget which way it goes, but whatever way it goes, if that is that okay.

Speaker 3:          15:52          But now, so what we got here then is you have this talent plus the persistence versus this Matthew effect that is the Matthew effect. You start out with these little accidental differences and then coaches and situations magnify them so they get bigger and bigger. But with persistence, what seems to be happening here is the accidental differences that that may have given you. Advantages get narrowed when you add the practice and the practice. Add the practice. Mozart at 13, you know, copying other people's work. Practice, practice, practice, practice, Mozart 17 better. Mozart 2124. Oh my God. All right, so, um, Lennon and McCartney at 15, 16, 17. But when they make their jumps, they make leaps of a genius. Nature leaves that are not available to other people. Isaac Newton, he goes home for vacation, thinks about, oh, how am I gonna measure this? He invented calculus. So you are being accused of being a genius denier. Yes. Are you a genius denier or are you simply a genius disliked her?

Speaker 2:          17:00          Um, well, so, uh, this career, this thing called talent, right? Great. Um, and it's this, it's this, it's the, it's the, it's the magic dust, right? That gets sprinkled onto persistence. It turns a lot of hard work into something great. Um, and the question is, how larger role does it play and what does it consist of? Municipal piece, I wrote years ago for the New Yorker, I remember writing about Wayne Gretzky and reading a biography of Wayne Gretzky and he's a keys as an educated hockey player, great hockey player, greatest hockey player of all time as a kid when he's two years old, his parents would sit up in front of the television, he would watch, um, uh, hockey games on, on Saturday nights. And when the game he would burst into tears, right? And it was this little glimpse into his future greatness because here he was at two and he loved this, that he was, he could imply hockey's too.

Speaker 2:          18:00          I mean, you can barely walk, but he already is understood. He loves this thing so much that for it to end is an unconscionable burden. Right. And it just, it's like the world is ending and he's, he's just consulate. So what is Wayne Gretzky's talent? Well, part of it is his extraordinary, you know, uh, vision, his coordination, his, whatever, his, this, but a lot of it is this guy loves this game so much that he would do nothing but do it and think about it and engage it and do all those things. Now, if is this magic dust called talent, is that all it is? Maybe. I don't think fun is that, I don't think that's a, that's um, denying or hating genius. No, I think that that definition of genius is far more, um, appealing to me. Then the notion that it's this, it's simply some sky high IQ or some,

Speaker 3:          18:56          well this is the genius, which just won't quit and you can't eat, it won't quit. You sort of like break the movie, but the two guys on the mountain, I mean, I'm recasting it sort of like what I just broke back, break back, you know, I go put you. So it's the love of hockey.

Speaker 4:          19:16          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:17          That will not speak its name. That they're not taking his name. Yes. I suppose that's it. I'm not a, a good analogy that would have occurred to me. Maybe a what? One of the things that I detect is that it's not that you don't like geniuses is that maybe you don't think we need them and maybe ought to be for money.

Speaker 2:          19:37          Okay. Your watching. Why are people so hostile to the notion that what genius is is an extraordinary love for a particular, um, thing. Why is the love so we look, we're, we're, you know, we hear the ability, definition of genius, the rare ability definition and we think, oh, that's so plausible. Totally. That's what it is. But then we hear the, the extraordinary love definition of genius and we say he's a genius denier. Why? Why is, why are we so hostile to the notion that what separates the genius and the rest of us is the genius loves what he or she does more than we do. But we have no problem at all. But what separates the genius is that they have some, you know,

Speaker 3:          20:18          well, because it misses the point. I mean, there are YPO like Paul McCartney and you hostile, the notion of love,

Speaker 4:          20:25          Robert, is that what that is?

Speaker 3:          20:28          No, I just want to make an obvious point here that you know, Harry Smith, no, that's a real person. Uh, Harry x could love, uh, um, my writing songs, but Paul McCarthy for the way you say love though, is so you really have, you, have you thought about this to

Speaker 2:          20:47          others?

Speaker 4:          20:47          Yes.

Speaker 3:          20:49          Your Harry x could love, yeah, that's better writing songs. [inaudible] loves writing songs so much that he can't stop, but for lunch and dinner and sometimes not even those, but next door is, um, is a Richard Rogers little be tree. Ricky Rogers. He loves writing songs too. But for some reason Harry reits loves writing Ricky whites and love writing and how he writes a, a memorable song called the babbling book. Those two in flow. And Richard Wright's Shannon chanted evening.

Speaker 2:          21:24          Well, no. So, um, your, there's a difference there. No, well, hold on, hold on. No love doesn't get you. No, no, no. The love, but the love does. So think about this. Love is not the complete explanation. Love is the way in, because Wayne Gretzky loves hockey so much. He thinks about it all the time and does more than that. He engages the sport in a way that no one else had ever engaged in. So there's this wonderful, um, that, remember in I running a fresco, this is thing that he famously did ones where he um, scored a goal from behind the net and he flips the puck over the net like, and it kind of does a little thing and goes in. Um, and the reason no one had ever done that before was not just that no one could do it. Lots of good do it.

Speaker 2:          22:09          It had never occurred to anyone else before. No one had engaged the sport on that level. So why is Gretzky engaging in that way? Why is he thinking about it that deeply and creatively? Because he can't get hockey out of his head. Right. Whenever I encounter someone like that, I cannot get past that sense. They give off that they have. They have, they have found their calling that they are in actively in love and almost in a romantic way with this thing that they do. Right. Absent that you can't be a genius. I'm sorry Ken,

Speaker 4:          22:45          are you convinced yet? Hi.

Speaker 2:          22:48          Still holding up for some really abstract Nietzschean notion of,

Speaker 1:          22:55          no, I'm going to pull back for a minute here. Oh, we remodeled a little bit longer, but I think they come to shove. Oh Malcolm. That's what I say. I say go Malcolm right there. Hello. You know, I would say he might be shortchanging the idea that there's a diversity of ability out there. Innate talent. Yeah. But I do agree with him though that the idea of genius, that old 19th century stupid idea, uh, you know, the eye does contain within it are a really dangerous thought, which is that our abilities are just sort of God given. And so they're fixed. So nobody but so, but his argument would be, you know, you need some talent and you need certainly a little bit of good luck, but what you really need is this strange love of the thing you're doing. And it's the love or the determination to succeed. If what? Love equals, it makes you just want to do it and then do it, and then do it some more. Amen. Yeah. We should thank the 92nd street y and then get the hell out of here. It's them and you to Malcolm Gladwell and to you for listening. I'm Jad Abumrad [inaudible] all new episode in two weeks. See them.
