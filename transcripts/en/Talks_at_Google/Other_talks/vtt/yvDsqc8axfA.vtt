00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.900
CLIFF: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.024
Today for the Google Talks,
the Talks at Google program,

00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:07.440
we are very thrilled
to be talking

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.690
about absolute value, what
really influences customers

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.340
in the age of nearly
perfect information.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.790
Today we're taking an in depth
look at behavioral decision

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.520
making and consumer choice.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.920
Guiding us through
this talk will

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.450
be Professor Itamar
Simonson and Emanuel Rosen.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.442
Itamar is actually a professor
at the Stanford Graduate

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:29.525
School of Business and one
of the most influential

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:33.190
and cited researchers in
the area of decision making

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.060
and marketing.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.480
And he's discovered some
of the phenomenon, himself,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.270
described in various journals
including the compromise

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.020
effect.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.150
And we're also joined
by Emanuel Rosen,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.580
the author of the national best
seller, "The Anatomy of Buzz",

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.630
a pioneering book that
predicted the rise

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.900
of interpersonal
influence in marketing.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.260
And his research appears in
numerous journals as well.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.410
And so we will have time
for some Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.770
Please use the microphones.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.280
But without further ado,
we'll launch right in.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.320
So thank you very much.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.111
Please join me in
welcoming them to Google.

00:01:06.877 --> 00:01:12.060
ITAMAR SIMONSON: Thank you,
and thanks for your patience.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.350
Today we would like to talk
about consumer decision making

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.590
in the age of nearly
perfect information.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
But before we get there,
let's take a moment

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.630
to talk about what we used
to believe about consumers.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.330
In the beginning, the assumption
was that consumers are

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.280
generally rational, but because
they cannot tell the quality

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.500
of things, marketers
can influence them using

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.980
advertising, and branding,
and building loyalty,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.680
and all those other things
that you might have read

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.910
in marketing textbooks.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.280
Then about 30 years ago, it
got a little more interesting.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.860
And more and more
studies that we have done

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.090
have shown that
consumers often make

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.410
decisions that are irrational.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.070
By irrational, contrary to the
common concept or conception

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.950
of irrationality, what
we mean by irrationality

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.210
is that we violate
assumptions of economics.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.740
People do not maximize utility.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.660
And sometimes they
choose a over b.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170
Other times they
choose b over a,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.771
even though it's
the same a and b.

00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:26.490
I spent the first 20, 25
years of my career working

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.280
on the irrationality
of consumers.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.745
This is an article that
I published back in 1994

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:36.560
in the New York Times, and I
think the title of the article

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.650
tells you what it was about and
who I thought was in control.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.470
Let me just give you
a couple of examples

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.470
of effects,
irrationality effects.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.100
So in this particular
study, we showed one group

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.179
of consumers those
two microwave ovens.

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.470
We asked them to make a choice.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.300
You see there is one that's the
Amazon that's less expensive,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.410
and a Panasonic
that's more expensive.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.200
Both of them are 35%
off the regular price.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.680
A second group of
consumers chose

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.460
among three microwave ovens.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.100
You note that the top one is
the same one that we saw before.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.980
The bottom one is the same
one that we saw before.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.280
But now there's a third option,
which is another Panasonic.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.950
It's even more expensive,
has more features,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.230
but it's only 10% off.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.830
OK.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.480
What did we find?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.920
We found that
consumers were more

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.550
likely to choose the Panasonic
over the Amazon in this group

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.260
than in the other group,
even though we added

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.260
another Panasonic
to the choices.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.470
That's known as the
asymmetric dominance effect,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.845
because this Panasonic is
dominated by this Panasonic.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.160
Since then, those effects
have been shown many times.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.860
Now a year ago, a doctoral
student at Stanford,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.790
[INAUDIBLE] and I,
tried to replicate

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.100
the asymmetric dominance effect,
except that, in this case,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.500
we provided consumers,
or participants

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.440
in the study,
additional information.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.890
The kind of information
that you receive today

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.190
when you go to shop on
Google Shopping, or Amazon,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.980
or any other website.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.420
We showed them some reviews.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.860
We showed them other options.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.600
We showed them more detailed
specifications, and so on.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.190
So some people chose between
these two paper shredders,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.206
and other respondents saw
these three shredders.

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:48.580
And you don't see here all
the information they received.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.780
As I said, they received a
great deal more information.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.050
What did we find?

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.120
We found that now, the
asymmetric dominance effect

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.000
was gone.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.020
Consumers no longer
made a choice

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.660
on the basis of comparing
the options in front of them.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.950
Instead, they took advantage
of all the other information

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.880
we presented to them.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.370
As we will explain later,
we would connect it

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.780
to a broader phenomenon
whereby consumers are much less

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.040
likely to make judgment relative
to the options you show them

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.590
and relative to all
kinds of other things,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.520
like other products
by the same brand.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.270
And instead, they evaluate
each product individually.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.550
So this is a really fundamental
change in decision making.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.500
Let me give you another example.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.100
This is something to do
with frequency programs.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.000
This is based on a study that
Ran Kivetz, who at the time

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.575
was a doctoral
student at Stanford

00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:54.540
and is now a professor
of marketing at Columbia.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.270
So we looked here at whether
participants-- they didn't even

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.430
know they were
participating in a study--

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.100
would sign up for
this loyalty program.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.750
So we told them-- these
were students at Columbia--

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.600
we said, if you
join this program,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.980
after you buy twelve sandwiches
in any food place on campus,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.470
at the end of the day you'll
get two free movie tickets.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.540
A second group of
participants were

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.300
told that if they buy 12
sandwiches and they also

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.030
by 12 orders of sushi, they
will, at the end of the day,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.990
get two free movie tickets.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.117
Now, which program
is more attractive?

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:44.700
The first one.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.890
This one requires you to
buy 12 sandwiches and also

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.460
12 orders of sushi
for the same reward.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.380
Now we asked all
of the participants

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.880
about the kinds of food
they like and dislike

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.010
so we could identify
the segments

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.660
of what we called sushi lovers.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.510
For those, what
we found was they

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.500
were more likely to join this
program than the other program.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.040
Why?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.580
We call that the idiosyncratic
[? futuristic. ?] What

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.860
we're saying is that people
really cannot assess the value

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.050
of a program or how you
translate effort to reward.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.050
Instead what they do,
they assess the reward

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.390
relative to the
effort that it would

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.630
require from other participants.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.560
And they say to themselves,
I really like sushi.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.735
I buy sushi anyway.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.730
Relative to others this
is more attractive for me.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.440
And as a result, those
people who like sushi

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.870
were more likely to prefer
the frequency program that

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:59.315
required you to buy both
12 sandwiches and 12

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:00.430
orders of sushi.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.840
That's another example
of making decisions

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.610
relative to other
things, in this case,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.400
relative to other consumers.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.240
This is, what Cliff mentioned,
the compromise effect.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.540
So what I worked
on many years ago,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.200
about 30 years ago
for my dissertation,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.890
I looked at what I later
called the compromise effect.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.990
So some participants in
the study, in this case,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.100
chose between two cameras.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.409
That's actually from a
study done later in 1990.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:40.059
And you see there are two
models of Minolta, which

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.520
those if you who
are old remember

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.190
there was such a brand, and
different number of features

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.450
and different price level.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.960
Other people choose
among three cameras.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.980
You know that the first two
are the same as those before,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.480
but now there is another one
that has even more features

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.960
and is more expensive.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.950
Well, what did we find?

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:13.070
We found that most consumers
shifted to the middle option.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.200
The big loser was
the cheapest option.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.060
And there was a general tendency
of people to go, to converge,

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.020
on the middle option
in a given set.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.900
Again this relative
decision making.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.770
Why?

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.490
Because it means that you
are not basing your decision

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.340
on the quality and value
of the particular option.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.240
Instead, you're looking
at other options.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.720
And on that basis you
make your decision.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.990
Again, last year we tried
to replicate this effect,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.670
and we used again cameras,
different cameras, same design.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.090
And as I said earlier, we
provided more information.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.700
We also gave them reviews, and
we got them specifications,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.340
and additional information,
the kind of information

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.780
you easily obtain today.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.260
The compromise effect was gone.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.970
Now the significance
of this effect

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.295
goes far beyond the compromise
effect and the other effects

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:21.150
that I talked about.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.420
It means that there is a general
trend that Emanuel and I are

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:33.200
calling the shift from relative
to absolute decision making.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.030
If you think about it, suppose
you were buying a laptop back

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.280
in '99.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.170
You might have based your
decision on the brand,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.450
on where it was made.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.680
You might have used
some general rule,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.140
such as you get
what you pay for.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.510
These are all relative
proxies or quality proxies.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.170
Why?

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.200
Because you compare
this product that you're

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.860
thinking of buying to other
products by the same brand,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.200
other products of the same
price level, and other products

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.190
in the same country
of origin, and so on.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.960
You're not making your decision
on the basis of your evaluation

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.670
of the quality of this
particular product.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.940
Now the problem
with quality proxies

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.590
is that they're
often inaccurate,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.990
because some brands make good
products and bad products.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:33.160
And that's true for all kinds
of other quality proxies.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.370
Now what has changed?

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.560
These are just a few of
the sources of information

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.600
that you have today to
assess the real value

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.130
of each individual product.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.540
It means that today
you don't have

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.220
to rely on relative proxies.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:58.090
Instead, you can evaluate
each product individually.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.380
Now this is a very
important change.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.670
If you think about if you've
ever taken a marketing course

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.750
or read any marketing
textbook, you

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.120
know that much of what
we teach in marketing

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.590
is about the creation of quality
proxies, how to build brands,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.720
how to create customer
loyalty, all of those things

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:31.250
that represent quality proxies,
or relative quality proxies.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.410
And we say that they are
becoming, in many product

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.980
categories, much less important.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.930
Now let's simplify
and talk about what

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.250
are the main forces
that influence

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.520
consumer decision making.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.480
One, we call O. O stands for
what you learn from others.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.040
For example, a friend
of yours tells you

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.560
about a good restaurant
or a good movie, that

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.340
would be an example of O.
P is what's in your head

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:10.280
from prior experience,
what you were born with,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.040
your family background,
what you've done before,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.740
anything already
stored in your head.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.530
We call that P, or prior.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.740
And the third one is M, which
is the influence of marketers,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.520
advertising, brands, and so on.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.510
These three sources
of information

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:37.890
together influence what you know
and how you evaluate products.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.180
If you want a summary of what
has happened in the past 10,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:51.580
15 years, it's the rise
in the impact of O,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.950
through reviews, with the
easy access to expert reviews,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.610
social media, and so on.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:06.290
At the expense, primarily,
of marketers, of M.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.370
Because if you can assess
the quality of each product

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.930
individually, you're
less likely to rely

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.940
on what marketers are telling
you about the product.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.870
And as we know, they
have their own interest

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.340
to promote those products.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.440
So one thing to
think about it, is

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.190
what we call the O continuum.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:36.720
And what we're saying is
that the degree to which O

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.780
influences consumer decisions
is a function of the product

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.990
category.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.600
So there are some products--
before you buy a Snickers bar

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.910
or before you buy paper
clips, you probably

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.460
are not going to
bother to read reviews.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.750
On the other hand,
before you buy cameras

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.660
you may very well will.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.700
It also varies by segment.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.480
Some consumers are
more likely to look

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.940
for reviews than others.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.540
It also depends on context.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.740
If you buy a product on
a website like Amazon,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.130
like it or not, you'll
be staring at reviews,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.960
so therefore they are
likely to influence you.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.830
So there are different factors
that determine the impact of O

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.870
on your decisions.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:31.940
The rest of our talk will
focus on this end, which

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.250
is all of those categories and
situations where consumers make

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:42.380
decisions largely based on
O, on what others are saying,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.660
consumers and experts.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.460
Well now quickly we'll review
some of the key marketing

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.670
mantras, or the key
marketing principles, that

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.690
are influenced by
this shift from

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.850
relative to absolute
decision making.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.370
Let's start with branding.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.270
And there's probably nothing
more marketing than branding.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.510
And this is the
topic where we are

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.780
saying all kinds of
surprising things in the book,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.760
among other things, this
notion that consumers

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.500
are becoming a
little more rational.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.490
Even though nowadays there's
a lot more talk about consumer

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.850
irrationality there's
really nothing

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.460
that generated greater
response then this notion

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.930
that brands in many
product categories

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.580
are becoming less
important, especially as

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.250
indicators of quality.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.810
Some people, in fact are
saying that, if anything,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.890
brands are becoming
more important.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.720
Why?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.810
They say, well there's
so much information

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.930
out there on the
internet that consumers

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.910
experience information overload.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.450
And as a result, what they have
to do, they just go by brand.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.020
This argument assumes
that consumers

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.230
have just two options.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.250
Either you process all
the information out there,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.667
or you go by brands.

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:10.250
Of course, in reality,
there are a lot

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.673
of good intermediate solutions.

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:14.589
You don't have to process
all the information.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.290
In fact, you can make
very good decisions

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.089
and get a great deal of
information in a few seconds.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:26.069
And I'll illustrate
that in a second.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.565
Let's think about restaurants.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.580
In the past, chain restaurants
had a significant advantage,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.460
because you knew what you were
getting regardless of location,

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.230
even if, for example,
you were out of town.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.430
However, think about
nowadays if you're

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.030
looking for information
about individual restaurants.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.550
This particular
one is a restaurant

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.640
from Seattle, Machiavelli.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.060
If you're interested
in Machiavelli,

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.280
you get over 400 reviews.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.840
You get over 50 pictures,
photos of various dishes.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.790
You have a great
deal of information.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.150
It doesn't take a
whole lot of effort

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:14.150
to get an idea of how good and
how popular this restaurant is.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.200
And if you like to read a
little bit of the reviews,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.170
you quickly see that
one of the issues

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.840
there is that there
are long lines

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.090
and they don't
take reservations.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:29.610
So as we can see,
this new environment

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:35.190
increases the power of
independent restaurants

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.170
at the expense of
chain restaurants.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.000
Indeed, a study conducted
might by Michael Luca

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.340
established that's the case.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.580
That as Yelp penetrated the
Seattle market, the revenues

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.670
of independent
restaurants increased

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.018
at the expense of
chain restaurants.

00:18:53.018 --> 00:18:54.643
Now this has far
reaching implications.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.260
For example, it means
that the entry barriers

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.950
to many categories
are declining.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.900
As long as you have
a good product,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.240
you have a chance
of being successful.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.710
Think about this
computer that we

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.375
brought here and
didn't work by Asus.

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:20.500
EMANUEL ROSEN: It did work.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.600
ITAMAR SIMONSON: It did work.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.433
EMANUEL ROSEN: Yeah.

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:24.210
ITAMAR SIMONSON: I take it back.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:31.620
Asus used to make components
for other PC manufacturers,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.590
but at some point
their CEO decided

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.650
to sell directly to consumers
under the name of Asus.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.570
People told him, you're
not going to be successful,

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.680
because no one knows
your name, and you'll

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.350
need to spend a lot of
money on advertising.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.280
But he thought that he has a
way of doing it successfully.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.960
He just sold a good product
that got excellent reviews

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.840
on the internet.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.580
Some of you may
remember the Eee PC.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.270
And indeed, it became
very successful.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:06.030
And nowadays Asus
is in the top five

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.245
in categories such as
laptops and tablets.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.430
It also means that
previously unknown names

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.720
can establish themselves
as leaders in the category.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.490
You may be familiar with the
recent acquisition of Google

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.830
called Nest, and
some of you are also

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.480
familiar with Roku, which
is one of the leaders

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.810
in the video streaming category.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.940
Previously unknown names
have become very popular.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.675
It shows you that when
brands are less important,

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:46.890
and each product is evaluated
independently, then even

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.940
no-names have a chance of
establishing themselves,

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.780
as long as they have
the right product that

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.110
gets the right reviews.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.560
It also means that it's
easier to diversify.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.940
Now in the past, we used
to teach our MBA students

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.920
that each brand is associated
with certain perceived skills,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.960
so therefore, you should stay
in your area of expertise.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.680
But that's no longer true,
because if each product is

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.490
evaluated
independently, it means

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:24.280
that you can be in all kinds of
categories like LG and Samsung.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.540
And as long as you make
the right products,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.440
consumers will accept it.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.190
EMANUEL ROSEN: Hi.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.430
I'll continue with the rest
of the ideas that are still

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.040
very common among marketers.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.610
Itamar talked about the
first one, which is brand

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.570
is the most important thing.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.790
Another big one is loyalty.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.980
Talk to marketers and they
say that nurturing loyalty is

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.750
the most important thing, is the
best investment you can make.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.170
Marketers love to
talk about loyalty,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.440
promote loyalty,
measure loyalty.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.920
But we're saying that when
consumers can actually

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.260
assess the quality of
each individual product,

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.580
loyalty is becoming
less important.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.470
Let me tell you about my
experience in buying cars

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.520
throughout the '80s and '90s.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.510
So in 1985 I was a student.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.880
I got this old car.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.060
I was trying to
remember how old it was,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.180
but it was really
old, from my uncle.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.400
And I started
driving this Volvo.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:29.310
Now in 1989, I was going to
buy a new car, or another car.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.800
The most dominant piece
of information in my mind

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.550
was my past experience
with that Volvo.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.140
So guess what I bought?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.400
I bought a Volvo.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.950
In 1995, the same
thing happened.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.100
I bought a Volvo.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.190
In 2000, I bought
a Volvo, and so on.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.450
In 2012, I bought a new
car, and it was truly

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.656
a different experience.

00:22:50.656 --> 00:22:51.780
I remember it very vividly.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.840
I was sitting in
front of my computer,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.250
cars.com, edmunds.com,
reviews from users,

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.970
reviews from experts, videos.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.280
Actually, I remember one
video-- so I was still

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.180
considering Volvo.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.670
It's not that I hate Volvo--
but I was looking at the video

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.920
off a backup camera.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.260
You know when you put it in
reverse, you want to see.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.630
And that's a feature that
I always wanted to have.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.190
And I remember how
slowly-- I don't

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.660
know if anyone here has a Volvo,
or that particular Volvo--

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.380
the screen for the
backup camera was coming

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.830
up so slowly that
I was saying, no.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.540
I'm not going to do that every
time that I put it in reverse,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.170
and I will have to wait
for the car to back up.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:37.530
So suddenly, the way I
was buying this car--

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.490
I was actually assessing
what it would feel like,

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.580
what it would be like to
actually drive a Volvo, as

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.920
opposed to relying on
some past experience.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:53.090
So loyalty is going to
be less of an issue.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:58.460
Marketers can rely
less on loyalty,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.270
which means your
success is determined

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.790
by your current product.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.780
The good news is
that your competitors

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.160
suffer from the
same thing, which

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.140
means that your competitive
advantage here and there can

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.620
be improved.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.620
That's not new, but
as loyalty goes down,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.940
it's even more powerful.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.430
Measuring loyalty--
and there are

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.460
lots of organizations
that put a lot of emphasis

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.680
on measuring loyalty--
is less informative.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.580
Because the consumer can
tell you that they're loyal,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.070
but when they go to
make the decision,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.760
they are not going to rely
on their past experience,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.790
but they will rely on O.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.300
The third mantra, which Itamar
essentially addressed already,

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.660
but I just want to mention
again, is irrationality.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.210
So in general, marketers and
certainly people in academia

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.750
believe that consumers
are irrational,

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.040
and that you can manipulate
quote unquote "their action",

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.220
by using the context of
offer, or the framing.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.780
Again what we're saying is, no.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.960
It's going to be less true
as consumers can assess

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.870
the value of each product
as Itamar just showed you.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.620
Number four is the big one--
and this is four out of six,

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.050
so we're almost reaching Q&amp;A,
so think about your questions--

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.960
communication.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.280
Communication is a big area, and
there are several mantras here

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.670
but I've combined them under
positioning, brand awareness,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.520
persuasion are key.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.760
Still marketers by and large,
if you open a textbook,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.570
they tell you that if you
persuade, if you position it

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.700
rightly, target it rightly,
you will be successful.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.040
Again we're saying, no.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.040
It's going to depend much
more on the absolute value

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.950
of the product.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.700
That is determined by O.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.360
So let's look at something
that is called positioning.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.970
What's the idea
behind positioning?

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.890
The idea is that,
if you're a company,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.940
you look for that area that has
not been occupied previously

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.450
by your competitors, and you
try to associate your product

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:06.950
with that.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:12.530
So Volvo stood for safety,
Cadillac stood for luxury,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.390
and so on.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.820
Which makes a lot
of sense, but this

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.590
doesn't work as
well when consumers

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.370
base their decisions on reviews.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.590
Let's look at an
example with phones.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.170
In the past three
or four years there

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.810
have been several attempts to
position the Facebook phone.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.460
So the idea was, nobody
has the Facebook phone,

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.710
so HTC and AT&amp;T,
I think, came up

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:43.570
with this idea of associating
the product with Facebook.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.800
Maybe it's a great
idea, but the problem

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.210
is that reviewers hardly
ever review a product only

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.990
on one feature, especially
not the feature you

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.290
decided they should
review it on.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.680
So I read a lot of reviews of
this phone, a lot of reviews,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.240
and I don't remember
maybe a handful that

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.674
talked specifically a lot
about this feature of Facebook.

00:27:08.674 --> 00:27:10.590
Of course everyone
mentioned it, but they also

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.157
talked about the screen,
the keyboard, voice.

00:27:15.157 --> 00:27:16.240
They talk about the phone.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.000
So it's much more difficult
to position a product the way

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.030
you want consumers
to think about it.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.860
Or more in general talking
about communication,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.410
persuasion is becoming
much less important.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.290
There is almost
no point in trying

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.150
to persuade your customer
that your product is better,

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.240
because they go to O for that.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.420
That's O's job.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.940
They will read
reviews and determine

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.320
if your product is
better than others.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.550
So what is your job?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.890
Your job is to promote
an ongoing flow--

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.280
your job as a
marketer-- is to promote

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.230
an ongoing flow off authentic
content from real users,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.830
from experts, and so on.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.780
Another concept
in communication--

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.520
when I worked in advertising,
it was all about awareness.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.780
You want to make the consumer
have Sony, Sony, Sony,

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.350
Sony at the top of
their mind, so when

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.500
they reach the
point of purchase,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.340
they'll grab the first
Sony product they see.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.000
But again, you
understand that when

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.150
the consumer comes to
a point of purchase

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:27.870
and actually decides on reviews,
this is much less relevant.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.100
It's not about creating
that top of mind awareness.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:36.240
It's about generating
interest in specific products.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.300
And this translates to
very practical things.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.880
Do you go and buy banner
ads that just say Sony?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.700
Or do you create a
PR campaign, invest

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.890
in a PR campaign, that promotes
the latest product that

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.210
does this or that?

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.120
And we talked already
about positioning

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.110
that worked when people relied
on M. Much more difficult when

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:08.170
people rely on O. There's
another mantra, or a set

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.090
of mantras, in the area
of market research.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.510
Overall, marketers believe
that market research

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.430
can predict people's choices.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.680
Well, it's less
true when consumers

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.230
rely on O, because
here's the problem.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.420
Market research,
by and large, tries

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.060
to predict what
people's preferences are

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.530
at point a in time.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.470
So I ask you a lot
of questions, and I

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.260
try to understand what
are your preferences.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.550
The problem is that at
point b in time, you

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.380
will no longer make the decision
based on your preferences,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.160
but you will actually reach
out to O for that information.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.820
Let me give you an example.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:58.990
A 2007 study, conducted before
the release of the iPhone,

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.340
concluded that such
convergent products are not

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.830
desired by US consumers.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.780
That was a mega study
done all over the world,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.370
and they determined
the iPhone will not

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.880
be desired by US consumers.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.500
As we know, this did not happen.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.640
The opposite happened.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.430
What was the problem?

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.920
What was the problem here?

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.120
The problem was that
they measured P. People's

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.350
preferences at point a in time,
where consumers were actually

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:34.130
influenced by O, that
is reviews, TV coverage.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.170
I remember David Pogue wrote
about it in the New York Times,

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.540
such an amazing review.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.160
All this stuff is the stuff
that actually influences people.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.900
So what we see in market
research-- what we already

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.290
see and we predict will become
even more true-- a shift

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.570
from predicting what
customers will do,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.030
to actually tracking
what are we saying.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.040
Because think about it.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.750
If O influences the
decision, go directly to O,

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.190
and see what O is saying.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.690
Because this is going to
ultimately determine what

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.970
the consumer will do.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.440
There will be more
systematic measurement

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:16.560
of O and real time experiments,
adjustment and experiments,

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.990
much more in real
time then trying

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.700
to predict what people will do
six months from now or a year

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.310
from now.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.985
Because again, they are
influenced by other sources.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:36.050
The last set of
mantras is in the area

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.750
of diffusion of innovations.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.560
And this, I wouldn't
say that it's

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.320
a mantra that is shared by the
whole tech sector, for example.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.910
I think that there are many
companies that don't really

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.790
operate that way.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.640
I suspect that Google
is one of them,

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.320
but let's not get into that.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.440
But there are a lot of
people in high tech marketing

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.060
who still believe that you
start with the early adopters,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.750
and then you try to get
into the early majority

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.490
by addressing different niches.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.810
So I'm sure you're familiar
with categories of adopters.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:15.080
There are the innovators,
early adopters, early majority,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.900
late majority, et cetera.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.920
Well this type of
thinking-- which

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.560
was initiated by Everett
Rogers, the author of "Diffusion

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.590
of Innovations", who I still
consider him personally

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.660
my mentor.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.920
And he also was a great
supporter of my first book

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.140
that Cliff mentioned.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.820
And it's also reflective
work of a very good book

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.400
called "Crossing the
Chasm" by Geoffrey Moore.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.690
I see that some people
are familiar with that.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:46.810
--But this way of thinking
was really true in a world

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.845
where one thing existed,
and that is uncertainty.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.920
Think about it.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.470
The moment that
people can actually

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.460
assess the absolute
value of things.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.280
They know what
they're getting into.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.830
Uncertainty is
resolved much faster.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.960
So there is much less of a
need for category thinking,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.970
and less of a need
for a strategy

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.160
where you say, OK in order to
move to the early majority,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.130
I am going to
identify some niches

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.270
and get into these niches.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.540
And if you look-- we don't
have time to get into this,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.998
but if you read it
in the book-- we

00:33:29.998 --> 00:33:33.220
talk about how the
iPad was introduced

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.580
versus how the tablet
PC, back in 2000,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.050
was introduced by Microsoft.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.000
Two different approaches.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.120
The iPad obviously
was more successful.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.980
And one reason, we
believe, is that they

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.500
let consumer niches
and different groups

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.630
adopt it by themselves
without dictating

00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:00.060
which niche should buy
it according to them.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.870
So that was a very
quick overview

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.240
of the different mantras.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.120
We talked about branding,
what Itamar talked about,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.000
loyalty, irrationality,
communication, market research,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.659
and diffusion of innovations.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.540
And more broadly, what we
talked about in this talk--

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.710
and then we'll move to Q&amp;A-- we
talked about really a new era

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:24.080
in consumer decision
making and marketing.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.909
Itamar described this shift,
that we believe exists,

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:31.699
from assessing from relative
thinking-- it's good

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.719
because it's from this
brand, or from this country,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.179
or it costs so much-- to
assessing the absolute value.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.100
And what happens when
this is the case?

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.860
Proxies for quality
play a much smaller role

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.320
in O dependent areas.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.570
Again, the value
is determined by O.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.080
What's left for
the marketer to do?

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.040
Don't fire your
marketing department yet,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.680
because marketing
is still important.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.370
Marketers have to
generate interest.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:12.140
They have to make sure there
is an ongoing flow of O.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.680
And probably most
important, they

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.300
need to track O, analyze O, and
make sure there are adjustments

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.810
to provide the best products
a company can provide.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:30.979
Thank you very much, and
we'll take it now for Q&amp;A.

00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:31.520
MICHELLE: Hi.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.450
My name is Michelle.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.290
I'm on the search
marketing team.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:38.180
So my job is to make sure that
folks who have a smartphone

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.890
choose to search with Google,
hopefully through our app.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.430
And so, the point of
sale for us-- and this

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.330
is a very important
moment for Google

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.560
in terms of point
of sale-- is not

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.870
buying something with a review.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.610
Maybe you even
already have the app,

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.870
or maybe you even have
a choice of browsers,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.360
or maybe you're on your
computer and you can open Google

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.000
or you can open Bing.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.620
One of the things
that we look at

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.780
is how do we make sure
that the user chooses us

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.920
at a moment when
there is no review,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.500
there is no purchase process.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.530
We're actually past that point.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.730
So we sometimes
rely on the thinking

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.810
of defaults, which I'm sure
you know of Dan Ariely's work.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.540
And we think about
how do we get the user

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.480
to put this thing in
their tray, if we're

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.010
talking about an iPhone.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.640
So I was wondering if you
could talk about these concepts

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.220
and how they relate
to a decision

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.500
where you don't have
that information anymore.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.007
And you make that
decision very quickly,

00:36:36.007 --> 00:36:37.840
and it's one of the
most important decisions

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.630
that consumers make for Google.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.580
ITAMAR SIMONSON: You talked
about defaults and status quo,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:48.800
which research on that has been
done for a long, long time,

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.440
and that's certainly true.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:55.370
But as you said, usually you
have, at any point in time,

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.160
you have whatever comes up.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:05.680
Is it Google, or Bing,
or Yahoo slash Bing.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.640
And that's what you use.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.330
Now the decision that you make,
it really largely depends on

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:19.040
what comes with your computer,
or what you set as the default.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.640
It's not the kind of decision
that you would evaluate reviews

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.030
each time.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.830
Now there might be
some differences.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.090
Now Google search, if
I recall correctly,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.460
has an advantage over
Bing in the sense

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.030
that you get the results even
before you finish the search

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.780
term, which I think
Bing does not offer.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:45.660
But Bing has better
social media integration.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.560
So that may be a
factor that influences

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.290
your choice of a search engine.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:38:00.190
I don't think that what we said
about reviews would apply here.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:04.280
I'm not even sure that
that's a matter of reviews.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.160
Let's not forget.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.730
Search engine is something that
you use, how many times a day?

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.560
Many.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.060
Every day.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.200
So that's a very different
kind of decision.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.490
Not something like a camera
or lots of other decisions.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.950
It's a decision that
you make all the time.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.690
You set a default and
that will determine

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.842
what you decide to do.

00:38:29.842 --> 00:38:31.800
Now it could be, over
time, that you figure out

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.420
there is another search engine
that has certain advantages.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.890
And that may, over time, cause
you to change your choice.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.220
But it's a different
kind of decision,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.560
a very unique one,
an interesting one.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.010
As you said, what's the default?

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:55.210
And it's a slow
changing decision.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.270
So if, over time, you
see someone else is using

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.070
another search engine and
they seem to be happy,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.840
that may cause you
to change your mind.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.840
It's not the traditional
O environment.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.290
You know brand and loyalty
can mean different things.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.106
We know loyalty could be
just a matter of habit.

00:39:16.106 --> 00:39:21.110
I fly United, because they
have the most flights from SFO.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.150
I may like them
or not like them.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.030
I fly United.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.740
Then there is
loyalty that's kind

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.180
of more emotional attachment.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.630
I don't think-- I use
Google all the time-- I

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.900
don't think I'm emotionally
attached to Google.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.190
I think it's not that
kind of category.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:46.150
And therefore,
building the brand-- I

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.380
think it has some value.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.715
I think a limited value.

00:39:48.715 --> 00:39:52.900
It just so happens that Google's
search engine is really good.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.820
And if you've been
using it, you'll

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.940
continue to use it unless you
have a really good reason not

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.130
to.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.870
But I think it's more a matter
of performance, real quality,

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.820
and less of brand
equity in the abstract.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.940
AUDIENCE: In the
teaser for this talk

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.020
it was mentioned
that your thesis is

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.280
that fake reviews,
or spam reviews,

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.250
are not a problem long term.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:23.320
Could you elaborate
on that please?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.870
EMANUEL ROSEN: First
of all, we think

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.890
that numbers make a difference.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.770
That if you have four or
five reviews of something

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.510
it's much easier to manipulate
through fake reviews.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.370
Fake reviews are not
going to disappear.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.330
There is always
going to be attempts

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.270
to manipulate, to
game the system.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.360
But overall, when you
remember this restaurant

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.070
that Itamar showed,
Machiavelli in Seattle,

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.080
they had 440 reviews, I think.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.380
Extremely difficult to fake
that without getting caught.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:02.990
So, we believe that
as numbers grow,

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:07.060
the credibility of reviews
as a source will grow.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.810
The hosts of these systems,
for example in this case Yelp,

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.100
have a very strong
economic incentive

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.770
to make sure that they
curve manipulation.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.320
The reason is very simple.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.360
Yelp makes its money
through advertising.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.430
If you stop trusting Yelp,
because you have repeated

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.520
experiences where you read
reviews of great restaurants

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.450
and you go there
and it's terrible,

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:38.110
you will trust Yelp
less, which will

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.850
mean that you won't go
to Yelp next time, which

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.530
means Yelp will not
be able to be viable.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:50.760
We think that people may
switch to another source

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.080
of information.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.950
But let me tell you which
source it will not be.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.720
It will not be the marketer.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.860
It won't be M as the source
for information about quality.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.180
And it's not that marketers
are perceived necessarily

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.740
as crooks or dishonest.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.880
It's simply because the
marketer, by definition,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.010
has vested interests.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:17.430
So you look for alternative
sources of information.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:20.700
10, 15 years ago those
were very limited.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.475
What we experienced
in the past 10,

00:42:22.475 --> 00:42:25.850
15 years is an explosion
in the availability of O,

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.700
and this is not going away.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.435
So you may see movement
within O. People

00:42:30.435 --> 00:42:33.810
will stop trusting one
source of information

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.990
and will move to another.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.330
For example, if people
in general stop trusting

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:44.100
reviews from strangers they
may go to trusting something

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.250
like graph search, Facebook
graph search, where

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.910
you can tell who that person is.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.400
Currently, there are no
signs that people are not

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.320
trusting reviews.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:59.270
In fact, there is evidence
that people definitely

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.120
trust reviews.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.040
And the reason, I
believe, is simple.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.070
Overall reviews do reflect
the general concept

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.610
of a place, a general
idea about the product.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.920
Is it 100% accurate?

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.810
Absolutely not,
but you get an idea

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.240
of what your likely
experience is

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.370
going to be when
you read reviews.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.340
AUDIENCE: I used to work
in the games industry,

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.830
and one of the
factors that we always

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.160
faced with introducing
new consoles

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.880
is a lot of parents
would always--

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.270
they played Nintendo
games when they grew up--

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:37.790
so they would automatically buy
then Zelda, and Super Mario,

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.320
and 3DS, and Wii, and whatnot.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:47.220
So the dominance of O over P,
I don't see that all the time.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:51.090
Actually in business
to business commerce

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:57.480
it's almost always P, as well
as some O and other factors.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.362
ITAMAR SIMONSON: So you
have kind of two questions.

00:44:02.362 --> 00:44:03.570
Let's talk about video games.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.830
It's clearly very O dominated.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:10.340
I mean if your
friends like a game,

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.500
and if Xbox is more
cool than PlayStation

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:22.230
whatever it is now 4 or 5, that
will certainly influence you.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:27.640
It may be reviews, not
necessarily on Amazon,

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:33.340
but social media, just the
old fashioned word of mouth.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:39.410
So that certainly has been
for a long time an O domain,

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.580
much more so than
a marketing domain.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.180
As to b-to-b, that's an
interesting question.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:52.630
Because it is true that as
absolute value goes b-to-b--

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:56.230
let's say if you invest millions
of dollars in something,

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.950
you probably have consultants,
and you have in-house experts,

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.226
and so on.

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:06.310
You could assess absolute
value even before that.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.190
Now, one thing where
the b-to-b sector

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.730
is lagging behind
the consumer segment

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:17.120
is that you don't have all
that many review sites.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.400
Let's say in
enterprise software,

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.360
you're beginning to see
some websites, relatively

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.850
small numbers.

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.720
And they tend to be
overwhelmingly positive,

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.460
which makes them a
little less useful.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:40.370
We would expect that
there will be development

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:44.050
also in the b-to-b
arena with respect

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:48.120
to their reliance on reviews.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.980
But they're beginning
from a higher level

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.700
where, especially
for large purchases,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:58.010
they already have a pretty good
assessment of absolute value.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.840
AUDIENCE: So going
back to the first point

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.360
where, if I bought something
and I really liked it--

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.590
It is a very high bias.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:09.180
I mean, you bought Volvo
four times over the years

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.700
until you changed your mind.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:18.080
And if the O reinforces the P,
it becomes almost automatic.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.800
It's by default.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.442
I'm going to buy this thing
that I've already tried.

00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:26.110
ITAMAR SIMONSON: Well, if you
heard good things about skim

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.830
milk, and you started
buying skim milk, yeah.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.830
That becomes a
habitual purchase.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.060
That's what you're buying.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.760
You're not even
thinking about it.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.210
Many purchases, especially
more substantial ones,

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.760
are not decisions that
you make every day.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:48.920
So when the time comes to buy
even a new electric toothbrush,

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.420
you may check reviews.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.570
In other words, for
less frequent decisions

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:58.010
that tend to be the
more costly ones,

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.100
that's where you see
the biggest shift.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:06.250
AUDIENCE: You have
mentioned that the marketers

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:11.660
traditionally were trying to
influence consumers directly

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:17.420
by creating a brand,
by targeting products

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.090
for specific niches.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.980
And since, there is
a trend for consumers

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.100
to evaluate the
value of each project

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:31.370
individually rather than
relative to other products.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:34.490
So you have mentioned
that the role of marketers

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:40.730
will be to observe
the trends in O,

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.220
and then to make sure
that the company responds

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.160
to those trends.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.630
So my question is
this, is it foreseeable

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:52.800
that marketers would draw a
different lesson from this?

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.560
And the lesson
would be to attempt

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.650
to influence O rather
than consumers directly?

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:04.290
And if so, what
do you think would

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.714
be the effect on the
whole review system?

00:48:07.714 --> 00:48:09.130
ITAMAR SIMONSON:
Let's not forget,

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.130
marketers have to come
up with good ideas.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:16.900
So it obviously would not
be sufficient to introduce

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:21.845
products, see what customers
are saying, and then revise it.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.530
As Emanuel said,
market research,

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.760
asking consumers what they
will want in the future,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.480
often doesn't work.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.390
For truly new concepts
it probably never did.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:39.720
But you need to come up
with the right products

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.850
and then be responsive.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:43.580
Did you--

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.413
EMANUEL ROSEN: Yeah.

00:48:44.413 --> 00:48:47.480
What I would like
to add-- part of it

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.840
is the answer I gave this
gentleman here about marketers.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.620
Some marketers will
try to influence

00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:00.000
O in unethical ways, that
is, fake reviews, et cetera.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.140
So that's one part.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.940
Another part is very legitimate.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:08.340
That is, I think that
indeed PR, for example,

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.080
is becoming more important.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:17.692
Because you can see PR
as a company's attempt

00:49:17.692 --> 00:49:22.200
to promote its point of view
to O. The O that matter,

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.080
that is, expert reviews.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.260
The experts-- and that's
not a new thing of course,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.300
but it's becoming even
more important today

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.530
when people rely so
heavily on expert reviews,

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:40.320
and accessing these
resources is so easy.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.280
So a company that
introduces a new gadget.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.970
Today it's even more
important than 10 years ago,

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:51.460
even five years ago, to make
sure that people who matter,

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.810
the Engadgets of the world
and the tens of thousands

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.820
of these bloggers, and
so on, know about it.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:05.180
And you cannot ultimately
influence what they will say,

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.116
I would argue.

00:50:06.116 --> 00:50:07.490
Of course you can
here and there,

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:11.880
but overall these
people, this part of O,

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.640
reaches a broad consensus
about a product, which

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.890
is another interesting thing.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:21.940
But of course trying to
influence O in legitimate ways

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.220
will be important,
and also trying

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.120
to make sure that there is an
ongoing flow from current users

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.250
is another important thing.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.100
Because if I go to a restaurant,
or I consider a restaurant,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.510
and the last review
was written in 2009,

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.480
I'm probably not going
to go there, right?

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.882
So you need to make sure it's
always viable and has energy.

00:50:43.882 --> 00:50:44.840
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.150
A company could spend
a lot of resources

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.560
trying to get, say
90% of all bloggers

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.737
to write about, to review,
their product first.

00:50:56.737 --> 00:50:58.820
Let's say there are two
competing companies trying

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.480
to enter a certain market,
and Company A, let's say,

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.190
could try to basically pay
money to all the bloggers

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.270
to influence their
product first.

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.980
It's not that they would
write fake reviews.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.820
They would write real
reviews, but they

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.060
would write them first.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.030
So what people
see, mostly, would

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.570
be reviews for product
of the Company A.

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.780
Now it's not illegitimate, but
it certainly would probably

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:30.660
influence what choices
consumers will make.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.412
EMANUEL ROSEN: In
theory-- Oh, I'm sorry--

00:51:32.412 --> 00:51:33.120
AUDIENCE: So yes.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:44.400
So the question is does changing
the domain where marketers

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:54.960
try to create an influence
from consumers directly to O,

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.520
do you think that benefits
the consumers overall?

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.742
Does it make things
more objective?

00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:01.450
EMANUEL ROSEN: I
understand the question.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.810
Overall, there is one
thing that bloggers really

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:07.387
want to have more
than anything else.

00:52:07.387 --> 00:52:08.220
You know what it is?

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.660
Readers.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:14.750
So if I start feeling that this
blogger is basically giving me

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:18.300
the party line, and are
really not giving me

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.480
the true story-- Most
bloggers, if they

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.756
know that there is a product
and another product will come

00:52:23.756 --> 00:52:25.630
shortly after it, the
first thing they'll do,

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:26.860
they'll compare them.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:33.520
I mean bloggers want to give
their followers-- they want

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.640
to have followers first of all--
and in order to have followers,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.040
they need to provide them
with valuable information.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.410
Again, the same thing that
I said about fake reviews.

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:48.630
Yes, people will fake, will
game the system sometimes.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.350
It's far from being perfect.

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:54.590
The same applies to the
blogosphere as to reviews.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.910
But overall, I believe
that the system does work,

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:04.350
and blogs' reviews about
products or about services

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.950
overall reflect the actual
experience of consumers.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.630
When they don't, people
will go elsewhere,

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.980
because if they're
disappointed they

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.110
will not trust this
source anymore.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.822
Same logic works here.

00:53:16.822 --> 00:53:18.780
ITAMAR SIMONSON: You've
been waiting patiently.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.270
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.250
I have something quick.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.630
Do you see any difference
on amateur reviews

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:26.370
like Yelp versus professional
reviews like Engadget,

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.795
how they affect consumers?

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:34.080
ITAMAR SIMONSON:
I think that they

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.480
tend to talk about different
things in many cases.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.410
Let's say that I'm thinking
of buying new headphones.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:47.530
I'm interested in how
comfortable they are.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.580
I think for that,
I probably would

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.910
go to-- if I see 100
reviews, I probably

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.075
will look for user reviews.

00:53:58.225 --> 00:54:00.350
On the other hand, if you
talk about some technical

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:04.410
specifications and comparing
this model to that model,

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:09.794
I may rely more on
Engadget or CNET and so on.

00:54:09.794 --> 00:54:11.460
At the same time,
there is some overlap.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.480
And I think it's
not a zero sum game.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.260
You can, and consumers
as we know, they do both.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.800
They go to expert reviews,
and they go to user reviews.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.729
It's very easy to do.

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:27.270
CLIFF: Thank you
all for stopping by,

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.260
and we'll be able
to sign some books.
