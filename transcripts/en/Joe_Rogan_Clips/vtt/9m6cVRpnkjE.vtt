1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.940
The Joe Rogan experience.
Hey can I do some but like emotionally activity?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.050
Tell me what it's called.
What is it?

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.610
This book is called mentors and I actually I read like I read bits of it again

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.250
cause I knew I was coming here.
I think he's actually pretty good.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.500
Like I wrote quite a lot about Brazilian Jujitsu.
You really love it,

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.900
Huh?
Yeah I do.
My writing is not from a,

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.540
you'll understand not from a technical perspective.

8
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:29.130
I'm not saying this is why I've got to say on open guard transition.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.310
I'm talking about how the psychological impact that it's had on me and also in

10
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.280
there about like the protocols of going to a group which as a beginner are very

11
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.130
relevant.
Like you touched on how ritualize the eas.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
I got a hunch that the more we emulate in connect to original ways of human

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:47.131
behavior,

14
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:52.131
whether that's diet tree or hierarchies or organization of groups,

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.080
I feel that we will spill a sense of greater connection.
Now the,

16
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:59.940
the thing I got from the guy named Bj Jay classes genesis,

17
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:04.530
where I'll go in back in England is like that all the white belts get changed.

18
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.610
That one ended a room,

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.700
the purple belts and above get changed at the other end of the room,

20
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.510
which coincidentally or not is where the control for the timer is and the

21
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.050
control for the music is and where the kit is that all up.

22
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.980
That room's the end of the room.
So all the control is that end,
but it begins,

23
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:23.880
we've sort of dancing around in a circle doing all of those various exercises.

24
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.780
Now lift your knees,

25
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:29.070
now do the shrimp hit and that kind of stuff is that a lower belt shouldn't

26
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:34.050
invite a higher bell to spa or role,
you know,
it's sat and like the,

27
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.700
as you say,
the amount of respect,
the bowing,
the handshaking at the end of it.

28
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.780
It's so sort of,

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.900
it provides such a safe environment in which to deal with the primal.

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.600
I can see why it's valuable and it's like,
you know,

31
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.560
I should've been taught that shit when I was 1413 like as Amanda terribly so

32
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.350
that I didn't come across it like,
you know,

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.880
not going to be setting fire to feel Jen allotments and put in frogs on

34
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.560
fireworks.
If you've got a way of dealing with that primal energy.
Yeah.
When,

35
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.770
when it's coming so many people that don't understand that think that you should

36
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.740
suppress it somehow you should just ignore it or suppress it.

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.280
They don't understand that when men it really ever a biological male,

38
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.100
it really needs to be tackled head on.
I mean you really,

39
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:22.101
you really need to embrace what it is to be a physical mail and it frees you in

40
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.490
a lot of ways.

41
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.150
Do you think this might be a comparable moment too in the 1960s when there was a

42
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:31.080
sort of a sense of sexual repression versus sexual free love?
You know,

43
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.470
the images of Woodstock and flowers in their hair and smoking joints and having

44
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:38.190
sort of sex outdoors in mud or possibly wheat,
that,

45
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.850
that this time of like a kind of an anger about maleness and maleness may not,

46
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:49.770
as you said,
it may be a biological male bay,
could be the energy of,
I don't know,

47
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:54.090
assertion or wherever these like,
you know,
as in grammar in male and female,

48
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.910
relate to certain words in French grammar where,
I don't know,

49
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.090
Kat is female and doggies mouth.
I don't know the system.
I don't speak French,

50
00:03:00.091 --> 00:03:03.080
but I'm saying that these,
we have labeled these energies.

51
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.170
Yeah.
