00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
okay would you like to see a magic trick

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170
okay would you like to see a magic trick
 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.880
okay would you like to see a magic trick
always okay so these are a set of four

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
always okay so these are a set of four
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.039
always okay so these are a set of four
little sticks that I've got here they've

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
little sticks that I've got here they've
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.360
little sticks that I've got here they've
got numbers on them they're called the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
got numbers on them they're called the
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.299
got numbers on them they're called the
mental logs and I'm gonna use them to do

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
mental logs and I'm gonna use them to do
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.520
mental logs and I'm gonna use them to do
a super-fast mental calculation which

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
a super-fast mental calculation which
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.810
a super-fast mental calculation which
I'm sure you'll enjoy very much so

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
I'm sure you'll enjoy very much so
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.099
I'm sure you'll enjoy very much so
you're allowed to order these in

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
you're allowed to order these in
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.080
you're allowed to order these in
whatever order you want to so that's

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
whatever order you want to so that's
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.450
whatever order you want to so that's
what the middle two and this end both n

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
what the middle two and this end both n
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.960
what the middle two and this end both n
T's okay that one and that one yep so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
T's okay that one and that one yep so
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820
T's okay that one and that one yep so
they've got four faces on each one so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
they've got four faces on each one so
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.160
they've got four faces on each one so
what you want to do I want to turn the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
what you want to do I want to turn the
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.470
what you want to do I want to turn the
first one like that yep okay like that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
first one like that yep okay like that
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619
first one like that yep okay like that
unlike that so you've now created four

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
unlike that so you've now created four
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.869
unlike that so you've now created four
four digit numbers across the top so

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
four digit numbers across the top so
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.830
four digit numbers across the top so
you've got four thousand nine hundred

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
you've got four thousand nine hundred
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.389
you've got four thousand nine hundred
and fifty nine across the top there and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
and fifty nine across the top there and
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400
and fifty nine across the top there and
then three other numbers as well and I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
then three other numbers as well and I
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.690
then three other numbers as well and I
would like you to add up those four

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
would like you to add up those four
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:05.509
would like you to add up those four
numbers 49:59 okay I'll stop you there

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
numbers 49:59 okay I'll stop you there
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.859
numbers 49:59 okay I'll stop you there
before you press equals so I'm gonna

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
before you press equals so I'm gonna
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570
before you press equals so I'm gonna
tell you the total is going to be twenty

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
tell you the total is going to be twenty
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.359
tell you the total is going to be twenty
two thousand four hundred and eighty six

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369
 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.770
okay yeah it's a magic trick yes so this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
okay yeah it's a magic trick yes so this
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.390
okay yeah it's a magic trick yes so this
is this is a nice little it's actually a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
is this is a nice little it's actually a
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980
is this is a nice little it's actually a
really classic magic trick is the thing

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
really classic magic trick is the thing
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.749
really classic magic trick is the thing
you can buy in magic shops and it's a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
you can buy in magic shops and it's a
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850
you can buy in magic shops and it's a
hundred percent maths and it's just it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
hundred percent maths and it's just it's
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350
hundred percent maths and it's just it's
adorable once you figure out how this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
adorable once you figure out how this
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539
adorable once you figure out how this
works it's actually super easy to do and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
works it's actually super easy to do and
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.300
works it's actually super easy to do and
the mass is really really satisfying the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
the mass is really really satisfying the
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640
the mass is really really satisfying the
way that it actually works so I mean if

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
way that it actually works so I mean if
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080
way that it actually works so I mean if
if people want to try and figure out how

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
if people want to try and figure out how
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580
if people want to try and figure out how
this works you can have a look at them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
this works you can have a look at them
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.749
this works you can have a look at them
you can look at the numbers on them

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
you can look at the numbers on them
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.160
you can look at the numbers on them
they've all got different sets of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
they've all got different sets of
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.440
they've all got different sets of
numbers on each side the the numbers it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
numbers on each side the the numbers it
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880
numbers on each side the the numbers it
doesn't really matter what they are but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
doesn't really matter what they are but
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560
doesn't really matter what they are but
there is a pattern to it so you might be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
there is a pattern to it so you might be
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.819
there is a pattern to it so you might be
able to look at some of those and maybe

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
able to look at some of those and maybe
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.380
able to look at some of those and maybe
spot some of the patterns in there but I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
spot some of the patterns in there but I
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090
spot some of the patterns in there but I
will explain what it is that's going on

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
will explain what it is that's going on
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160
will explain what it is that's going on
here so on here these numbers have been

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
here so on here these numbers have been
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200
here so on here these numbers have been
chosen very carefully so the the third

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
chosen very carefully so the the third
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850
chosen very carefully so the the third
number there is the one that I'm

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
number there is the one that I'm
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350
number there is the one that I'm
interested in and that's the one that I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
interested in and that's the one that I
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149
interested in and that's the one that I
use to work out the total of all the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
use to work out the total of all the
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.859
use to work out the total of all the
others so in fact I can do this with

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
others so in fact I can do this with
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.120
others so in fact I can do this with
fewer than four I can do it with two

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
fewer than four I can do it with two
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160
fewer than four I can do it with two
rods instead so if I pick these two rods

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
rods instead so if I pick these two rods
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.219
rods instead so if I pick these two rods
like this I would say the total there is

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229
like this I would say the total there is
 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.960
like this I would say the total there is
275 and the reason I know that is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
275 and the reason I know that is
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910
275 and the reason I know that is
because I'm taking this number and put

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
because I'm taking this number and put
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440
because I'm taking this number and put
the two at the start taking this number

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
the two at the start taking this number
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.770
the two at the start taking this number
and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
and
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.290
and
- - from that one if I had these three

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
- - from that one if I had these three
 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.250
- - from that one if I had these three
rods together I would say the total is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
rods together I would say the total is
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.660
rods together I would say the total is
2777 because I'm putting a two at the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
2777 because I'm putting a two at the
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.309
2777 because I'm putting a two at the
star and I'm subtracting two from that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
star and I'm subtracting two from that
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.320
star and I'm subtracting two from that
last number and in fact if I take these

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
last number and in fact if I take these
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.940
last number and in fact if I take these
and change them so that they're all

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
and change them so that they're all
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.040
and change them so that they're all
facing different ways like that yep

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
facing different ways like that yep
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.540
facing different ways like that yep
so that'll be the total for those and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550
so that'll be the total for those and
 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.400
so that'll be the total for those and
you can do it with one so the total

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
you can do it with one so the total
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710
you can do it with one so the total
there would be 21 because I put a two at

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
there would be 21 because I put a two at
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.180
there would be 21 because I put a two at
the start and I subtract two from the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
the start and I subtract two from the
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370
the start and I subtract two from the
last digit and the reason why this works

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
last digit and the reason why this works
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.070
last digit and the reason why this works
is it's just lovely so if you look at

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
is it's just lovely so if you look at
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.900
is it's just lovely so if you look at
the numbers on here the numbers except

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
the numbers on here the numbers except
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.300
the numbers on here the numbers except
for that third one will always add up to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
for that third one will always add up to
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.280
for that third one will always add up to
the same total so here I've got four

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
the same total so here I've got four
 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.009
the same total so here I've got four
nine and five total of 18 again here

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
nine and five total of 18 again here
 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.440
nine and five total of 18 again here
I've got nine four and five here I've

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
I've got nine four and five here I've
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.690
I've got nine four and five here I've
got three seven and eight total of 18

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
got three seven and eight total of 18
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.150
got three seven and eight total of 18
and again three eight and seven and the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
and again three eight and seven and the
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040
and again three eight and seven and the
same thing works on any one of these so

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
same thing works on any one of these so
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.690
same thing works on any one of these so
there I've got eight three and seven

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
there I've got eight three and seven
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.440
there I've got eight three and seven
total 1872 and nine total 18 and that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
total 1872 and nine total 18 and that
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.509
total 1872 and nine total 18 and that
will always work and what this means is

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
will always work and what this means is
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.520
will always work and what this means is
that if you have your four columns of

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
that if you have your four columns of
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199
that if you have your four columns of
numbers and you're adding them all

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209
numbers and you're adding them all
 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.600
numbers and you're adding them all
together you get 18 in each of the three

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610
together you get 18 in each of the three
 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.699
together you get 18 in each of the three
columns plus whatever that extra digit

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
columns plus whatever that extra digit
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.160
columns plus whatever that extra digit
is so what I'm essentially adding up is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
is so what I'm essentially adding up is
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.930
is so what I'm essentially adding up is
whatever the number in the third row is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
whatever the number in the third row is
 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.490
whatever the number in the third row is
and we'll come back to that later but

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
and we'll come back to that later but
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.160
and we'll come back to that later but
I've got this one is 2 2 7 2 - yep okay

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
I've got this one is 2 2 7 2 - yep okay
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.449
I've got this one is 2 2 7 2 - yep okay
okay so yeah you'll get a five digit

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459
okay so yeah you'll get a five digit
 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.060
okay so yeah you'll get a five digit
number if you've got four columns and so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070
number if you've got four columns and so
 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.620
number if you've got four columns and so
what I've essentially got here is I've

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
what I've essentially got here is I've
 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.770
what I've essentially got here is I've
got 18 in the right-hand column and in

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
got 18 in the right-hand column and in
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.630
got 18 in the right-hand column and in
this column I've got 18 again but

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640
this column I've got 18 again but
 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.890
this column I've got 18 again but
because it's the tens column I've

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
because it's the tens column I've
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.830
because it's the tens column I've
effectively got 180 and in the next

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
effectively got 180 and in the next
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.039
effectively got 180 and in the next
column I've got 1,800 and in the next

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
column I've got 1,800 and in the next
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.550
column I've got 1,800 and in the next
column I've got 18 thousand and if I add

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
column I've got 18 thousand and if I add
 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.539
column I've got 18 thousand and if I add
all of those together you some live

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
all of those together you some live
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.319
all of those together you some live
maths live very very easy maths I get

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329
maths live very very easy maths I get
 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.199
maths live very very easy maths I get
this and this number is 20 thousand

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209
this and this number is 20 thousand
 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.080
this and this number is 20 thousand
minus two so if I take this row which is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090
minus two so if I take this row which is
 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.270
minus two so if I take this row which is
the only row I haven't used yet add 20

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280
the only row I haven't used yet add 20
 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.220
the only row I haven't used yet add 20
thousand and subtract two I'll get the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
thousand and subtract two I'll get the
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.930
thousand and subtract two I'll get the
same as if I'd added up all of the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
same as if I'd added up all of the
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.940
same as if I'd added up all of the
numbers and in that case it's the same

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
numbers and in that case it's the same
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.680
numbers and in that case it's the same
as putting a two at the start and then

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
as putting a two at the start and then
 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.930
as putting a two at the start and then
minus thing to from the number at the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
minus thing to from the number at the
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880
minus thing to from the number at the
end so actually nice and and this is why

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890
end so actually nice and and this is why
 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.589
end so actually nice and and this is why
it works with any number of columns as

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599
it works with any number of columns as
 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.909
it works with any number of columns as
well because the exact same thing

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
well because the exact same thing
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.430
well because the exact same thing
happens

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440
happens
 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.650
happens
but you know I just don't have this here

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660
but you know I just don't have this here
 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.720
but you know I just don't have this here
so I'd have one nine nine eight and the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730
so I'd have one nine nine eight and the
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.210
so I'd have one nine nine eight and the
same thing would work and also there's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220
same thing would work and also there's
 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.100
same thing would work and also there's
there's an extra hidden thing built into

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
there's an extra hidden thing built into
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.530
there's an extra hidden thing built into
these which i think is quite nifty which

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
these which i think is quite nifty which
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.450
these which i think is quite nifty which
is that if you put the rods in this

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
is that if you put the rods in this
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.150
is that if you put the rods in this
order I can tell you the total on the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160
order I can tell you the total on the
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.590
order I can tell you the total on the
back is twenty eight thousand six

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600
back is twenty eight thousand six
 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.460
back is twenty eight thousand six
hundred and thirty-two so if I flip

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470
hundred and thirty-two so if I flip
 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.370
hundred and thirty-two so if I flip
those over you can see I've got my eight

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380
those over you can see I've got my eight
 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.290
those over you can see I've got my eight
six three four which gives me twenty

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300
six three four which gives me twenty
 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.310
six three four which gives me twenty
eight thousand six hundred and

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320
eight thousand six hundred and
 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.410
eight thousand six hundred and
thirty-two but in fact this number here

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420
thirty-two but in fact this number here
 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.690
thirty-two but in fact this number here
is the same as this number here and this

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700

to add up to eighteen you've got a bit

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370
to add up to eighteen you've got a bit
 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.890
to add up to eighteen you've got a bit
of flexibility in there they've

this number is it's the same as that one

so if I want to do the back I just look

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750
so if I want to do the back I just look
 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.080
so if I want to do the back I just look
at this number read backwards so they're

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090
at this number read backwards so they're
 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.670
at this number read backwards so they're
twenty two thousand seven hundred and

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
twenty two thousand seven hundred and
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.570
twenty two thousand seven hundred and
twenty two I do always enjoy checking in
