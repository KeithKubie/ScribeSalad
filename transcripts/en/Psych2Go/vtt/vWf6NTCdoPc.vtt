Seven subtle signs a shy girl likes you

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.460
Not everyone is as confident or outgoing as Elle Woods from Legally Blonde

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.560
Instead of wearing bold bright pink every day some girls might shy away from that and wear more muted tones

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.840
for a shy person

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:24.900
common struggles

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.920
they face are public speaking going to parties and of course confessing their feelings to someone they like

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.100
Are you wondering if you're shy co-worker, a friend, or classmate likes you? here are seven signs a shy girl likes you

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.360
1. she fidgets and adjusts her clothes. girls want to look good in front of their crush

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.760
So if you find her smoothing her skirt or combing her fingers through her hair

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.840
Know that she's making an effort to look attractive for you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.200
If you find her fidgeting with her fingers too, it means she's nervous around you. help her relax and show her

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
It's okay to be silly with you

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.220
2. she finds small excuses to be around you. a shy girl will rarely ever outwardly ask you out on a date

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.760
What she'll do instead is find small open windows in your schedule just to be around you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.760
Whether it means hanging out in a group setting or knowing when you'll be at the library or coffee shop

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.940
She'll make sure to show up at your favorite spots a shy girl wants to be noticed too. 3. she looks away at first

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.720
Strong eye contact is usually a good sign someone's in to you, but shy girls often have a hard time with this one

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.710
When you talk to her take note on how quickly she looks away from you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.970
If you notice that she does this frequently it's because she's nervous around you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.240
Eventually though shy girls want to boost their confidence. So the more you talk to her, the better she'll be at holding her gaze

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.000
4. she eavesdrops on you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.000
When a girl likes you she'll want to know every little detail about you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.749
She might not be the best at asking questions to you. So watch out

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.869
She'll be sleuthing in the background if you catch her

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.789
Leaning in as you talk to others or notice that she's asking your friends about you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.060
Chances are she's collecting information to make a good impression

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.000
Pretty cute right? 5.  She laughs at your jokes. a girl whether she's shy or not

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.080
Will often laugh at a guy's joke when she's into him

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.740
Consider it a shy girl's subtle way of flirting with you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.160
Even if you weren't being intentionally funny and she suddenly laughs at what you said

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.140
This is a clear indicator that she's into you. people tend to find others funny when they find them attractive. 6.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.020
She interacts with every guy but you.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.580
You might think she's avoided you because she doesn't like you or finds you annoying

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.640
But this is actually not the case at all, when a shy girl is into you. She'll feel nervous and awkward when you're around

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.180
If you catch her comfortable and at ease around other guys

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.800
She could either be trying to make you jealous or has no idea how to act towards you. Don't be discouraged by her flightiness

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.700
Instead approach her confidently and see how she behaves

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.900
If she acts strange or blushes then this is a clear sign, she likes you. 7. she's more interactive with you online

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.780
Shy girls might not be as talkative in person because they're worried about saying something weird

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.769
Or unsure about what to talk about

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.840
So if you've received lengthy text messages or notice that she's putting effort in to keep the conversation going

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.548
Then it's a sure sign. She's into you

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.180
Don't worry too much about the time she takes to respond if she's quick then it's a strong giveaway

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.200
But if she takes her time know that it's also possible she could be playing hard to get or you know, she could be busy

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.060
Too but hey, it makes it all the more obvious. She's taking time to get back to you

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.660
