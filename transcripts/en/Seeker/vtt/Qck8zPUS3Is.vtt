00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.950
Antarctica contains between 60 and 90 percent
of the world’s fresh water in the form of

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.950
ice.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.540
It may look relatively barren, but don’t
let its seemingly uniform appearance on top

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.549
fool you—a dead satellite has now given
us clues that something very interesting is

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.460
hiding underneath.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.670
The satellite in question is called the Gravity
Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.860
pronounced GOCE for short, because
the European Space Agency is cosmopolitan

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
like that.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.220
This sleek little sports car of a satellite
was created to measure and record fluctuations

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.320
in the earth’s gravitational field and global
mean sea level.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.570
We then use this data to produce a model of
the earth called the geoid—hold that thought,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.010
we’ll come back to that in a second.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.260
The GOCE satellite completed its mission in
2013, but research teams all over the world

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.050
have still been piecing together the data
ever since its cute little butt burned up

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.430
in the earth’s atmosphere.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.329
Because here’s the thing about gravitational
field data: it tells us what the earth is

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.770
like...even the parts of it we can’t see.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.470
And here’s where the geoid comes back in.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.080
The geoid is a hypothetical ocean—no tides,
no waves, no nothin’.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
In this model, the only things the world’s
oceans are influenced by are the earth’s

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.040
gravity, and the rotation of the earth.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.549
Since objects with more mass have more gravity,
the ‘water’ of the geoid bunches up in

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.230
places on earth where there’s greater mass,
giving us a model of the earth that looks

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.170
a little bit like a misshapen ball

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.060
It’s funky shape is our map to all the topographical
features on earth!

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.130
So GOCE’s mission was really important.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.640
The geoid lets us better understand ocean
currents, sea level rise, and changes in ice

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.439
coverage, but it also lets us see inside the
earth.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.689
Using three pairs of ultra-sensitive accelerometers,
mounted orthogonally to create what’s called

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.170
a gradiometer, GOCE took measurements that
allowed one research team to calculate gravity

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.110
gradients, which allow us to see the size and character of all of the earth’s topography—including

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.170
what’s under Antarctica, the least understood
of all the continents.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.070
Turns out, it’s a patchwork continent, made
up of at least three different cratons,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.870
which are remnant rocky cores of long-lost ancient
landmasses.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.650
and—get this—each craton has geologic
similarities to an existing land mass we know

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.760
and love today.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.930
One is similar to Australia, one matches up
to India, and so on.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.220
Now we finally know that this—Antarctica–is
the accumulation of what was left over after

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.160
supercontinent Gondwana broke up and all the
pieces went their separate ways 160 million

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
years ago!

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.000
This new understanding of the tectonic puzzle
pieces locked together at the bottom of the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.480
globe can help us visualize the plate tectonics
of earth past.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.880
How did the continental plates move around,
what did they bump into, what mountain ranges

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.770
and volcanoes and oceans did they create?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.430
But how does knowing what’s under Antarctica’s
icy face add to the science of the present?

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.470
Well, the ice is melting.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.709
Antarctica’s ice sheets and glaciers are
losing just shy of 300 billion tons of ice

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.709
per year.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.780
That’s compared to the 1980s, when the continent
was losing just 44 billion tons a year.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.520
When factoring in melting from other huge
ice sheets like Greenland, Antarctica’s

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.300
melting ice could contribute to up to six
feet of sea level rise before the end of the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.300
century.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.459
Plus—we’re contending with something called
post-glacial rebound.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.099
Turns out, the earth’s crust is pretty elastic,
and after all that heavy, heavy ice is gone

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.060
off Antarctica’s back, that landmass, all
that bedrock...is going to spring back up.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.060
Yeah.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.200
So it’d be nice to be prepared for how that
might play out.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.409
This most recent study, with the help of handy
dandy GOCE data, gives us a detailed look

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.830
at the rock composition and the configuration
of land masses underneath all that ice–the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.230
nature of the rock, the way it’s all put
together and the way it moves will influence

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.330
how fast the ice melts, what directions that
water is likely to go in, and how the ice

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.799
may shift as it melts and breaks apart.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.403
And remember, these are big freaking ice sheets,
so knowing how they may move as they melt

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:11.580
is pretty important.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.069
So collecting and analyzing data like this
may complete our picture of how earth changed

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:22.479
and molded itself during formative periods
of geologic time, helping us understand both

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.430
its past and prepare us for its uncertain—but
definitely shifting—future.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.370
What else do you think is also lurking beneath
our icy continent.
