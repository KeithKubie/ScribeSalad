00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.802
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.460
CAMILLE MASSEY: What
vision and power

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.460
and beauty and talent, Jeremy.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.594
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Thank you.

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:16.760
CAMILLE MASSEY: This is
such a pleasure and an honor

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.450
to be here and to have
this conversation with you.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.210
It was several years
ago when we first met,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.760
and you were just starting.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.980
You were just
starting Black Iris.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.960
You had this idea.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.250
You were going out.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.370
You were doing it all on
your own, pushing it forward.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360
And now, we are
sitting here at Google,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.250
and you are preparing
for the world

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.510
premiere of "A Mother's Rite".

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.250
Tell us about this journey.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.580
JEREMY MCQUEEN: It's
been full of challenges,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.540
but it's been very
fulfilling in so many ways

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.480
that I hadn't even
ever imagined.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.810
I've always loved dancing
and creating my own dances

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.280
in my bedroom as a child.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.470
And to be able to see
my work being performed

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.630
on stages like the
Kennedy Center,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.685
it's just been very humbling.

00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:08.060
CAMILLE MASSEY: And the Kennedy
Center, you mention that,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.970
because that was April 2017.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.730
And I believe a
principal dancer somehow

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.170
noticed what you were doing.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.550
How did that happen?

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.310
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Misty
Copeland invited us

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.160
personally to come
and present "Madiba"

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
on her program for a week
long at the Kennedy Center.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.280
I recall the day that I got the
email from the Kennedy Center

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.750
that they were
considering my work,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.730
and that Misty Copeland
had given them my name.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.250
I actually thought
it was junk mail.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.940
I was sitting down in a
meeting, a very intense meeting,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.522
and I noticed this email that
I had from the Kennedy Center.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:42.980
And I was like, why am I getting
junk mail from the Kennedy

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.100
Center?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.660
I've never even
seen a show there?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.530
How did this happen?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.302
So I just so
happened to open it.

00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:49.010
And it said something
along the lines of,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.460
your ballet about Nelson
Mandela at the Kennedy Center

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.070
for a week live orchestra.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.272
And I was just like, I
immediately started crying.

00:01:57.272 --> 00:01:59.480
I hadn't even finished
choreographing the ballet yet,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.475
and there was already a lot
of buzz about what I was doing

00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.350
and the change that I've
been trying to make.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.220
So it was really
rewarding and so humbling

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.310
that Misty Copeland was so
generous to recommend me

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.170
for this opportunity.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.910
CAMILLE MASSEY: And
so you've been there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.620
at the Kennedy Center,
and then you're

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.700
going to be at Marcus Garvey
Park, which is free and open,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.920
1600 seats.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.190
Hopefully, filling many
of those, if not all.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.390
And so part of your
mission is about audience

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.670
and about who you bring in.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.050
But before we get
to that, I just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.260
want to ask you more
about "A Mother's Rite"

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.940
and how that came about.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.310
I had the pleasure of seeing the
rehearsal at the Bronx museum,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.660
and there was a moment
when a woman stood up

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.460
from the audience during
the Q&amp;A, and said,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.330
you've told my story to you.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.370
Which she then went on to say
that her son had been killed.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.750
And how do you work to
create a project that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.640
has that kind of effect?

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.500
JEREMY MCQUEEN: I'm not sure
I know the answer to that.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.900
Guts, I guess, a lot of faith
and trust in my journey.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.220
"A Mother's Rite"
was something--

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.870
one of my composition
teachers, Kazuko Hirabayashi,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.890
who has been a mentor
to me for many years,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.470
always wanted me to
use Rite of Spring.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.215
As part of our
college courses, she

00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:35.590
was like, why don't you try
choreographing to this music?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.600
And I was like, no way.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.160
Are you kidding me?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.650
So many choreographers
have choreographed to it.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.650
The most iconic of
levels, and the music

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.480
is extremely complicated to
hear, to count musically,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.580
and so I just always
pushed it away.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.680
But at this point
in my career, I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.721
started to feel like I
wanted to push myself.

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:56.220
I feel like the
only way that we can

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.230
grow as individuals
is if we put ourselves

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.240
in uncomfortable positions.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.060
And so just looking at
the music and listening

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.330
to the intonation
of the melodies

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.870
and how sharp and strong certain
moments were in the music,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.880
and then also thinking
about black culture

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.040
and black history
today, I was trying

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.630
to find a way to connect
the two things together.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.510
And as I started to
dig a little bit more

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.740
into the original story for Rite
of Spring, which was a ritual

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.206
sacrifice within a
pagan Russian village,

00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:28.080
I started to see a little
bit of similarities

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.420
within the sacrifices
that are happening

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.720
within the black community
not necessarily willingly,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.090
but the sacrifices
of the mothers

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.660
essentially turning a new
leaf and taking on a new life

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.300
as a champion for their
sons and daughters

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.939
that have been
killed senselessly.

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.480
CAMILLE MASSEY: And
there's certainly

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.780
a lot to be mad about
in this society.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.490
But Courtney
Celeste Spears talks

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.460
about the power and the
strength of the mother,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.825
but also anger was a component.

00:04:57.825 --> 00:04:58.950
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Absolutely.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.420
CAMILLE MASSEY: And I heard you
mention Solange in the concert,

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.436
right to be mad.

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:05.310
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.110
CAMILLE MASSEY: How
did that affect you?

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.526
JEREMY MCQUEEN:
So the day, I want

00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:10.596
to say it was the day
before my boyfriend

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:11.970
and I went to the
Solange concert

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.160
at Radio City Music
Hall, I had a sit

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.710
down with an advisor of mine.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.630
And we talked about
this ballet that I

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.630
had been developing and working
on for about six months prior.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.480
And it originally started
out as a chess game, kind

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.700
of a white versus
black sort of thing,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.275
but I really wanted to put
it in a chess game format,

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:34.400
so that we could see all
the characters and players

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.800
within these two sides.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.532
But we were having
this conversation,

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:40.490
and he was just like,
something's missing here.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.770
It doesn't feel like we're
pushing culture forward.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.030
It doesn't feel revolutionary
or unique and different.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.030
And so he challenged
me to take a moment

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.640
to sit back and dig
a little bit deeper.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.100
And I'm so grateful that I did.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.160
I went to the Solange concert
that night with my boyfriend.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.331
And I like to engulf myself
in whatever experience

00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:03.830
that I'm in.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.980
So a lot of my work is
either inspired by something

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.560
that I'm going through or
just the observations of those

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.260
around me.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.410
And so I was really captivated
by how people were so engulfed

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.660
in Solange and her concert.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.100
I mean, people were taking
pictures and videos.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.640
And for me, it was like, OK.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.340
There are attention's
here on her.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.910
What do people that go
to the Solange concert,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.230
how can they connect with her?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.190
And they were really
connected to a moment

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.190
that she was having a
nervous breakdown onstage.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.407
She has this song called Mad.

00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:37.490
And she talks about, I've
got the right to be mad.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.630
And she kept saying that
over and over and over again.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.510
I started to look around.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.259
I started to think,
you know, what do we

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.550
have the right to be mad about?

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.760
And I started to think about
the senseless killings of men

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.030
and women, but more
specifically about the mothers

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.140
and how we often don't get to
hear their side of what they're

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.740
going through.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.130
We often hear them talking
about what has happened,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.430
and they are fighting for
justice for their child.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.510
But we don't often get to
see that grieving process.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.470
So this new ballet, it evaluates
a number of stages of grief.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.680
And the ballet starts when
the mother is coming home

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.040
from the final court trial where
she finds out the gentleman

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.570
was acquitted of all charges.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.280
And so it's that process of,
OK, now the cameras are gone.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.500
We've moved on to
the next trial,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.670
but that mother still has
to live with this forever.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.550
And so we get to have a
microscope look at her healing

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.520
process and how she
continues to struggle

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.450
every day, every hour
with the loss of something

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.750
that she can never get back.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.833
CAMILLE MASSEY: And she's
holding that sweatshirt.

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.167
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:48.000
CAMILLE MASSEY: What
meaning does that have?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.625
JEREMY MCQUEEN: The
sweatshirt, for us,

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:53.010
symbolizes her son's presence.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:59.830
He passed away, or was killed,
in that sweatshirt in our story

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.730
that we've created.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.115
And so that's the
last bit of him

00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:05.680
that she can still hold on to.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.780
His body is buried, but
that still smells like him.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.140
It just feels like him.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.220
So that was the last
thing she saw him in.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.020
And so she keeps that at
very high symbolism for her.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.230
She keeps it on a couch,
and she constantly

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.297
is gravitating towards it.

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:24.130
CAMILLE MASSEY: Well,
we're living at a time

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.010
where Black Lives Matter
has become, fortunately,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.960
part of the zeitgeist.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.100
And many people are
working for more justice.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.679
And the Sorenson's Center
for International Peace

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.990
and Justice, where I work,
is based at Cuny Law.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.730
And as you know,
some of my colleagues

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.360
have been working on the
disproportionate treatment

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.410
against communities
of color for conduct

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.810
that's not policed in more
privileged neighborhoods,

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.380
and are working for
change in a system.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.420
What do you think
that dance, though,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.821
brings that's different?

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:00.320
JEREMY MCQUEEN:
Movement in general,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.300
I think that it provides
a different perspective.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.780
It allows audience members
to be taken on a journey

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.050
that perhaps they would
not otherwise get to see.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.900
We often see and read
articles, or hear

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.970
things on the news
about what's going on.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.820
But to be able to see this
being told through movement,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.990
I think is very different and
creative in the sense of it

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.197
allows you to feel an emotional
attachment on a greater level

00:09:27.197 --> 00:09:28.780
than you would just
reading something.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.450
Being able to see someone
and feel their experience

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.150
and see them crying on
stage, to feel that, I think,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.150
is very different than a
two dimensional screen.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.260
CAMILLE MASSEY: I also want
to get in some information

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.220
about your other projects.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.000
So Nelson Mandela, we
have an anniversary

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.490
of 100 years the day
he was born coming up

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.830
this month, next week.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.190
And tell us about
why you chose Nelson

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.920
Mandela for a performance.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.990
JEREMY MCQUEEN:
So Nelson Mandela

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.830
was one of the world's
greatest leaders.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.730
And it just so happened that
this piece of music, written

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.910
by a composer, Carmen
Moore, it just so happened

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.260
to fall into my lap.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.820
And it was entitled
"Madiba", and it

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.904
was about the story of
Nelson Mandela's life.

00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:16.570
Part of the Black
Iris Project's mission

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.030
is to not only create
works that reflect

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.470
black history or black culture,
but also to promote and elevate

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.190
black creative artists.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.440
And so for me to stumble upon
this black classical composer,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.070
and he wrote this amazing
score for a full orchestra,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.560
I immediately was like,
can I sit down with you

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.690
and talk about my
idea and my vision?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.940
My vision was always
to create ballets

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.270
that reflected
our culture, but I

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.540
didn't want to tell stories
that were often commonly told.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.210
Often Black History Month
comes along in February,

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.170
we always hear about Rosa Parks
and Martin Luther King Jr,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.270
and certain other
historical figures.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.884
So I wanted this to be
an opportunity for people

00:10:57.884 --> 00:10:59.800
to learn a little bit
more about black history

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.230
and black culture outside
of Black History Month,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.990
and perhaps stories that
were not commonly told.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.035
So Nelson Mandela
was a figure of that.

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:09.160
For me growing up in middle
school and high school,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.517
I knew very little about him.

00:11:11.517 --> 00:11:13.600
And I feel like he was a
very little talked about.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.450
So I was really excited
about the opportunity

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.030
to get to share his life journey
on stage through movement.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.030
CAMILLE MASSEY: And that
will also be performed?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.863
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yes.

00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:24.550
So Nelson Mandela
turns 100 years

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.307
old on July 18th this year.

00:11:26.307 --> 00:11:28.390
And we're really excited
to bring this ballet back

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.014
to the city as part of our
August 16th performance.

00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:31.930
CAMILLE MASSEY: Great.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.570
Can you give us,
can we kind of delve

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.535
into your ambitions and
wishes for the years to come?

00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:39.410
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.120
Yeah, of course.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.440
CAMILLE MASSEY: Give
us a peek inside.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.773
JEREMY MCQUEEN: So the next
ballet that we're working on

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.469
is a ballet about
Harriet Tubman's life.

00:11:45.469 --> 00:11:46.760
CAMILLE MASSEY: Harriet Tubman?

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.340
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Harriet Tubman.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.600
My dad passed away
two years ago.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.060
And he owned a large
amount of land in the South

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.950
in Alabama, where he grew up.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.550
And so I've inherited that
land along with my mother.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.060
And one of the things that I've
wanted to do for a long time

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.062
is find a way to pay tribute
to him and to the land.

00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:10.270
And so I thought it'd be
really great to film a dance

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.970
film about Harriet
Tubman's life on the land,

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.910
so we would actually
go through the woods

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.440
and work through the trees.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.240
And hopefully, work with
a steady cam operator.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.630
Our collaborative,
we, of course,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.470
want to create works that
are accessible on stage,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.330
but especially wanting to create
opportunities to allow people

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.420
to view our works from the
comfort of their own home,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.920
so that they can still find more
about black history and dance

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.750
and ballet and how we
merge them together.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.833
CAMILLE MASSEY: Fantastic.

00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:44.590
And a woman, too, and conductor
of the Underground Railroad

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.370
and the safe houses through.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.695
Where is the land exactly?

00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:51.070
JEREMY MCQUEEN: It's just
outside of Montgomery, Alabama.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.770
CAMILLE MASSEY: OK, where
Brian Stevenson and team

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.337
opened the National Memorial
for Peace and Justice.

00:12:57.337 --> 00:12:58.170
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yes.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.211
I'm hoping that there
might be some opportunities

00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:01.887
to collaborate
with them as well.

00:13:01.887 --> 00:13:02.970
CAMILLE MASSEY: Fantastic.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.390
In the video, you mentioned
some of your seed support

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.380
and funders.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.820
And I'm just curious how
you accomplish so much right

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.590
now with this small team and
who's supporting your work

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.939
and what needs do
you have to grow.

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:20.730
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Definitely
financial needs.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.400
You know, we have been able
to get some seed offerings

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.495
from the Rockefeller Brothers
fund and the Ford Foundation,

00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:27.870
as well as some
other foundations

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.500
that I've poured my heart
out to and shared with them

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.230
my mission for social
justice and social equity

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.410
or racial equity.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.040
But yeah, we always
need financial support.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.770
As a newer
organization, we are not

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.290
eligible for some of the
bigger foundation grants.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.840
You have to have at least
a track record of three

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.810
to five years and tons of
reviews and lots of press

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.410
and just a proven track
record of success,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.660
and so we're still
building that track record

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.690
to get to that point.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.820
So financially, it's
always a struggle.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.760
But I'm always cold emailing
people and meeting people,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.500
out introducing myself.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.930
I feel so strongly
that this is a movement

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.380
that we need to have
right now, especially

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.850
with the climate that we're in.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.810
Just being able to allow
yourself to experience art

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.180
or to even find an
artistic discipline that

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.790
allows you to cope and
heal is so important.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.080
CAMILLE MASSEY: As you're
thinking ambitiously,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.080
where do you see yourself
after Marcus Garvey Park?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.645
Are there or outside
of the US as well?

00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:32.520
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.360
I would love to take our Nelson
Mandela ballet to South Africa.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.310
I've never been to
South Africa myself,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.290
so I would love to
actually go and see

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.040
the historical landmarks that
we feature in our ballet.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.550
I also want the collaborative
to continue to grow and blossom,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.879
and for us to be able to
travel around the country

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:52.170
and the world to be able to
share these ballets that we

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.860
create.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.820
Part of our initiative is to
create one new ballet per year.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.610
And so I hope that 20
years down the line,

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:03.630
we'll have 20 ballets of
very diverse background

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.620
black individuals that we can
continue to expose and share

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.870
with young people.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.360
CAMILLE MASSEY: I'm just
thinking that you also

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.110
refer to yourself as an
educator and a performer

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.582
as well as a choreographer.

00:15:17.582 --> 00:15:19.290
And we've been talking
about your talents

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.540
as a choreographer,
but I just want

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.390
to take a minute to
talk about your life

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:29.430
as a dancer in "Wicked"
and other performances,

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.680
and also as an
educator, because you

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.710
have this other big life where
you're inspiring young people

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.040
and teaching.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.130
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Well, I started
dancing at a really young age.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.140
My mom was an educator
in the public school

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.950
system for 40 years.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.770
And so she taught
English and history.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.400
And from her, I
really understood what

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.620
it takes to be an educator.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.720
I saw her learn the floppy disk
drive to the hard scan disk

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.110
drive to zip drive
to flash drives.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.940
She's constantly had
to educate herself.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.790
And I've always been so
inspired in the creative ways

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.440
that she motivates her students
to keep growing and learning as

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.760
well as she grows and learns.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.847
And so I was on
tour with "Wicked".

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.930
"Wicked" was one of my
favorite Broadway musicals.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.830
It was my dream show that
I've always wanted to be in.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.980
And I was in
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.440
As I was on tour, I would reach
out to different organizations

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.390
and just let them
know I was in town.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.230
I love to give back.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.570
I love to teach, and
to go in especially

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.820
to communities of color and
just talk about my experience

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.260
as a way to motivate
and uplift and encourage

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.820
people that might be thinking
about wanting to be performers.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.480
And so in Louisville, Kentucky,
I reached out to the Kentucky

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.800
Center where we are performing,
and they gave me a huge plate

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.930
of schools to go to.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.990
And I really fell in love
with teaching and giving back

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.780
in that city.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.246
And so I feel like all of
these things encompass,

00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:58.620
Black Iris Project encompasses
so many things that I love

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.750
and so many things that I
believe in from education

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.417
to performing to choreography.

00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:04.500
CAMILLE MASSEY: Fantastic.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.550
I know we're going to
turn for questions.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.339
But while people are
thinking of their questions,

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.440
I'll ask you a last question.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.410
And that is, who inspires you?

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.880
You've mentioned your mother.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.170
You mentioned a teacher
earlier, collaborators.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.200
Who comes to mind, either those
you've worked with closely

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.487
or others in the world?

00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:28.820
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Donald Robinson.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.300
Donald Robinson was a
dance teacher of mine

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.050
from seventh grade to
my 12th grade year.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.190
He really taught me
so much about just

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.541
being a human being in society.

00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:44.040
And I feel like a
lot of the lessons

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.410
that he's taught me
have stayed with me even

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.097
still today on a daily basis.

00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:50.430
One of the lessons that he
taught me was that discipline

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.013
is doing what you
know you're supposed

00:17:52.013 --> 00:17:54.930
to do even when no one's
there to make sure you do it.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.650
And that has really
stayed with me every day.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.630
I feel like without
his teachings,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.607
I may not be where
I am right now,

00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:05.190
because of so much
that he's ingrained

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.370
and invested into my life
as well as so many others.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.910
CAMILLE MASSEY: I think your
discipline is so obvious given

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.450
all that you've accomplished
in this short time.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.990
Do we have any questions?

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.030
Go ahead.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.696
AUDIENCE: Should I
go to the microphone?

00:18:23.696 --> 00:18:26.214
CAMILLE MASSEY: Yes, you
can go to the microphone.

00:18:26.214 --> 00:18:28.684
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:28.684 --> 00:18:31.650
Put it down a little bit.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.290
So as you mentioned
earlier, grieving

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:41.310
is often a very private
process that is, unfortunately,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.830
faced on an individual level.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.590
I imagine it's very difficult
to represent that visually

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.170
for a broad audience.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.170
You mentioned also
your own experience

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.760
with your father passing.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.740
How did you go about researching
how best to represent grief

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.960
onstage and respect the
experiences of so many mothers

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.930
who, unfortunately, have
had to go through it?

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.650
JEREMY MCQUEEN: It's
been a challenge.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.600
We did a lot of research.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.430
Whatever I could do
scholarly in terms

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.050
of pulling up
articles or interviews

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.200
with different mothers
and trying to find a way

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.610
to capture the essence
of their feelings

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.870
and based on what they've told
us, but really a lot of it

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.410
was looking at the
people closest to me,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.807
so my mother, my boyfriend also.

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.390
As I was developing
this whole ballet,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.430
my boyfriend had a
very good friend of his

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.420
that was suddenly murdered
just after Thanksgiving.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.740
So to be able to evaluate his
grief process as well as mine

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.750
as well as my mother's,
but it's specifically

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.770
the people outside of myself,
it really inspired me.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.410
So I looked a lot
about mannerisms.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.900
There's also a
number of articles

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.750
that have been done on various
different stages of grief.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.400
And so I started
to read up on that

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.120
as well as comparing what stage
of grief I thought I was in

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.980
as well as my family members.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.354
But it's been a
very slippery slope.

00:20:10.354 --> 00:20:12.020
It's been very nerve
wracking, because I

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.007
do want to create
something that's authentic.

00:20:14.007 --> 00:20:16.590
The biggest thing for me that I
always try to stress to people

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.320
is that it's a
fictional story inspired

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.410
by so many different mothers.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.270
I don't know anyone
personally that has

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:29.670
lost a child to police brutality
or racially based violence

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.920
in that way.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.250
But in just being respectful
of these different mothers,

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.070
I've tried my best
to try to capture

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:43.410
that in an authentic way
by looking at purely nuance

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.290
and mannerisms
that can be shared

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.849
through movement, because
there's no spoken dialogue.

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.390
But as Camille had
mentioned earlier,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.970
there was a mother that
actually came to our preview

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.830
at the Bronx Museum
of the Arts, and it

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.780
was so rewarding
to be able to hear

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.570
her say, I feel like
you've told my story

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.820
and in a very authentic way.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.900
She was brought to tears.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.444
She felt like her son's
spirit had brought her there.

00:21:08.444 --> 00:21:10.360
What Camille was talking
about the sweatshirt,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.340
she said that she
actually had a sweatshirt

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.220
that she kept up on her
mantle for a very long time.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.320
So that was very affirming,
but it's very sensitive.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.600
And we try to be as cognizant
of all of the energies

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.430
that we could receive
based on what we're doing.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.630
CAMILLE MASSEY: And in terms
of how you work with a dancer,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.230
with Courtney Celeste Spears
in this piece as the mother,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.770
how did you communicate
with her about grief?

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.380
And how did she draw
also on not only

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.770
the research that was done,
but on her own experience?

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.410
JEREMY MCQUEEN: She
had just lost a friend.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.820
I would say a week after we
started working on the ballet,

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.970
she had lost a friend.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.220
And so literally
when it came down

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.160
to choreographing the very
beginning of our ballet,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.130
I said, well, when you found
out that your friend had

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.950
passed away, what did you do?

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.250
We literally walked
through her process of,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.740
OK, so you walked in your house.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.730
What was the first
thing that you did?

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.140
And it was really hard for her.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.620
She didn't want to go there at
first, because she was like,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.450
I'm probably going to
break down and cry.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.670
And I just said, OK,
this a safe space.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.160
We always consider the studio to
be safe space and sacred space.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.740
And so we cried.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.760
We cried together.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.237
I, like I said, I evaluated
her journey as well as

00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:33.820
the journey of those
around me, and we

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.569
tried to piece this
together that way.

00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:38.860
CAMILLE MASSEY: More questions?

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:44.100
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.560
I have a question about
the writing process.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.185
You talked a bit
about your inspiration

00:22:48.185 --> 00:22:51.072
and about the music
that inspired you,

00:22:51.072 --> 00:22:52.530
about the artist
that inspired you.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.640
I'm curious whether during
the process of rehearsal

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.660
working with the dancer or
even through previewing it,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.260
you've made changes to the
story or you've otherwise

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.350
introduced adaptations.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.820
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Absolutely.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.490
A big part of choreography
and creation, I think

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.980
is the editing process
just like as a writer would

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.440
write a book, being able
to look at your work.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.820
We showed it at
the Bronx Museum,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.710
and being able to take a look
and take a step back and say,

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.510
OK, what worked?

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.200
What didn't work?

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.630
One of the things that
we really looked at

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.660
was how the story progresses.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.010
Does it progress too fast?

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.930
Does the dancer
have enough breaks?

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.930
And how can we-- it's 38
minutes, and it's one dancer.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.680
She never leaves the stage.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.490
So in looking at
that process, there

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.920
was a lot of stepping back.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.690
We also had a Survey
Monkey that we

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.750
did at our first performance, or
our first preview performance,

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.180
where we allowed people to
give their feedback written

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.550
as well as verbally
to let us know,

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.722
how did this make you feel?

00:23:54.722 --> 00:23:55.680
Were you uncomfortable?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.888
Were there things that you
wanted to know more about?

00:23:57.888 --> 00:24:00.390
Were there things that
you wanted to see less of?

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.342
All of that really informed
my process moving forward.

00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:04.800
And I think that
by the time we get

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.630
to the stage on August 16th, it
will be the fullest and richest

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.590
version of what we can present.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.770
CAMILLE MASSEY: Other questions?

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.830
While people are
thinking, August 16th

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.597
is going to be at 7 PM.

00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:22.430
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yes.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.170
CAMILLE MASSEY: Outside?

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:23.690
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yes.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.856
CAMILLE MASSEY: Will there
be any kind of talk back,

00:24:25.856 --> 00:24:27.780
or is it the two
performances together?

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.738
JEREMY MCQUEEN: It's just
the two performances.

00:24:29.738 --> 00:24:32.130
So it'll be the Nelson
Mandela work entitled "Madiba"

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.007
followed by a brief intermission
and then "A Mother's Rite".

00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:36.090
CAMILLE MASSEY: OK, great.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.640
And how many dancers
are involved?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.770
JEREMY MCQUEEN: In the entire
program, there's 17 dancers.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.909
So we're excited.

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:46.200
Our collaborative brings in
professional ballet dancers

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.600
from all around the
country that dance

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.681
from San Francisco Ballet
to American Ballet Theater

00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:52.680
to New York City Ballet.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.920
So it's really great to be able
to have an opportunity for them

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.770
to create a tighter
sense of community

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.350
amongst the black dancers at
various different companies

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.790
as well as being able to share
our works for free or very low

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.940
cost.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.290
CAMILLE MASSEY: And I notice you
call it a collaborative rather

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.020
than a company.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.894
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:25:11.894 --> 00:25:14.460
CAMILLE MASSEY: And how
do you find dancers?

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.450
Or do they find you?

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.620
Or is it a combination?

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.286
JEREMY MCQUEEN: You
know, it started out

00:25:18.286 --> 00:25:20.421
as some dancers
reach out to me now.

00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:22.170
They send me their
head shots and resumes.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.600
But it literally started out
as just a group of friends

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.250
that never really get to dance
together that we were like,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.330
let's come together.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.150
Let's create some dance.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.560
Let's work.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.299
And--

00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:33.090
CAMILLE MASSEY: OK.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.745
Any dancers out there.

00:25:34.745 --> 00:25:36.120
JEREMY MCQUEEN:
We're always, you

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.160
know, I consider it a
revolving door of dancers.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.290
We're always open to
more people joining,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.339
and it's all based on
the project that we have.

00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:44.880
And all these dancers
dance full time

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.470
for other companies,
which is why

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.320
we call ourselves a
collective or a collaborative.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.510
Because we're a
seasonal organization.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.460
We typically work
during the summer months

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.830
when kids need
something to do, so we

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.340
want to be an outlet for them
to be able to come and see

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.130
some dance.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.560
CAMILLE MASSEY: Great.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.921
Other questions?

00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:05.370
It's a shy audience.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.500
Well, while you're
still thinking,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.800
is there something that I
haven't asked you that you

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.880
would like to talk about?

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.790
I'm curious as how we were
so lucky to get you here

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.635
in New York when you're
from California originally.

00:26:20.635 --> 00:26:21.510
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yeah.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.370
So my parents grew
up in the South.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.450
They grew up in Alabama.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.050
And they grew up in
very large families.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.547
And my parents decided that
when they got old enough,

00:26:31.547 --> 00:26:33.130
they were going to
move to California.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.002
They wanted to do something
totally different.

00:26:36.002 --> 00:26:36.960
They grew up very poor.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.240
And my dad said,
you know, I want

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.560
to make my child accessible.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.710
I want him to have
access to all the things

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.450
that I didn't have
access to, because who

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.070
knows where my
life and my career

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.671
could have gone had I been
exposed to things at a younger

00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:50.170
age.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.086
So I started playing
music at the age of five.

00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:54.330
I played the violin at five.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.457
I carried that all
through high school.

00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:58.290
And then I added on the
piano and the flute.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.373
Played for the San Diego
Youth Symphony Orchestra,

00:27:00.373 --> 00:27:04.617
but dance and theater was
the biggest passion of mine.

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:06.450
My mom took me to see
"Phantom of the Opera"

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.710
on tour when it
came to San Diego.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.927
And I was completely enamored
by the whole experience.

00:27:11.927 --> 00:27:14.260
And I looked at my mom, and
was like, I want to do this.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.170
Didn't know I could
make a living doing it,

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.740
but I just knew that I wanted
to be a part of that experience

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.180
and feel that energy.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.610
Even at eight years old,
sitting on the edge of my seat

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.830
with the binoculars
glued to my face,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.860
I really wanted to
keep finding a way

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.050
to have that energized feeling.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.510
So naturally, moving
to New York, Broadway,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.330
you know, the capital of
Broadway in the United States,

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.830
it was a natural progression.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.790
I attended The Ailey School's
Fordham University college

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.160
program, which is a four
year degree program.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.480
And started auditioning
right away after I finished.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.709
So I've been really
grateful and blessed

00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:54.000
to have been able to see some
of my wildest dreams come

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.700
true in these past 13
years in New York City.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.550
CAMILLE MASSEY: Well, I'm sure
your mentor and your mother

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.590
and your father would
have been so proud.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.560
And we're all so proud at
everything you've accomplished.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.000
And we look forward to more.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.750
If you aren't in town in
August, we'll stay tuned.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.460
People can go to your
website, which is?

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.293
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Yes.

00:28:12.293 --> 00:28:13.964
Blackirisproject.org.

00:28:13.964 --> 00:28:14.880
CAMILLE MASSEY: Great.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.890
And we hope to feature
you at the Sorenson

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.470
Center at Cuny Law at some
point and other places

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.434
during your world tour.

00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:23.140
AUDIENCE: I had
one more question.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.070
Do we have time
for one question?

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.800
CAMILLE MASSEY: Oh, yes.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.080
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.800
Hi.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.670
Thanks for coming.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.628
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Thanks.

00:28:27.628 --> 00:28:30.900
AUDIENCE: I was really intrigued
by what your dancer said about

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.730
how, you know, for 20 minutes,
there's this lone performance.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.230
Right?

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.459
That really can be
uncomfortable, I think,

00:28:36.459 --> 00:28:37.500
for some people to watch.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.115
Were there other works
of art that inspired you

00:28:41.115 --> 00:28:44.640
in that sounds, like a
performance dance or even

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.860
performance art where
it's one performer

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.410
really demanding that attention?

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.840
JEREMY MCQUEEN: I
had never seen--

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.890
I've seen plays with
one person as a child,

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.980
but I'd never seen
a dance performance

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.320
this long as one person.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.370
Alvin Ailey's "Cry",
it's a very historic,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.170
it was a tribute to his mother.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.170
I think that ballet
is probably somewhere

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.480
around eight or nine minutes.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.250
But something of this
length, and then it

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.380
kept getting longer and
longer, because I couldn't

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.030
do the math apparently.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.010
I would look at, I was trying to
add up the different sections,

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.060
and I kept missing things
and missing things.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.510
And then I was like, by the
way, I think this is 40 minutes.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.570
It was terrifying.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.850
It was really terrifying.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.710
I said, who would
want to dance this?

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.130
Who would want to be on
stage for 40 minutes long?

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.920
But it was just a constant
communication between myself

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.100
and the dancer saying,
like, how do you feel?

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.400
I remember we did a run through
of the first 12 minutes,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.770
and she was like,
that was 12 minutes?

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.150
It felt like four.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.690
So it was a very
collaborative experience.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.070
But, no, I had never seen
anything like it before.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.744
And I think that that's the
reason why I wanted to do it.

00:29:59.744 --> 00:30:00.410
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:01.319
Thank you.

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:02.610
CAMILLE MASSEY: Great question.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.380
And Courtney really,
when she described

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.950
she felt engulfed by
it, I have to say just

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.830
watching that performance
that I saw, I really

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.430
felt that the whole audience
was engulfed in her,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.260
and it's really a very beautiful
and powerful experience.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.600
So I hope many of
you can see it.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.407
And thank you.

00:30:23.407 --> 00:30:24.490
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Thank you.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.406
CAMILLE MASSEY: Bravo.

00:30:26.395 --> 00:30:27.686
JEREMY MCQUEEN: Thanks so much.

00:30:27.686 --> 00:30:28.977
Well, thank you all for coming.

00:30:28.977 --> 00:30:31.660
[APPLAUSE]
