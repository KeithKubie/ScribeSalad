00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.029
Dropping like flies (or at least as far as
many stories indicate), it seems as if well-bred

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.570
ladies in the 1800s struggled to maintain
consciousness when faced with even the slightest

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.320
emotional or physical shock.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.820
Over the years there have been several theories
as to why this seemed to happen, from the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.550
women’s garb to simply conforming to societal
expectations.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.650
To begin with, throughout the 19th century
(among other times), ladies often wore corsets.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.600
Worn around the torso, corsets were made of
a durable tightly woven fabric or leather,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.090
fashioned with channels running throughout
them in which vertical ribs were inserted,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.960
called boning because they were often made
with whale bone (although ivory and wood were

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.290
also used).

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.910
While the purpose of the corset changed over
time- sometimes meant to give a flat look,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.890
sometimes meant to give extra curves via tightening,
it’s the latter fad, particularly in the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.509
Victorian era, that many propose was the cause
of at least some fainting spells.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.900
In this case, the entire device was held together,
and tightened (sometimes to extremes) by a

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.980
system of lacing.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.080
The archetypical corset had its laces at the
back, and for the most fashionable ladies,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.970
these had to be tightened by another.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.840
Girls were started in corsets at a very young
age and, for them and ladies after childbirth,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.230
waist training (to shrink the side of the
waist) via super tight lacing, was common.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.780
child-corsetAs a result of this particular
version of corset fashion, over time, corset-wearers’

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.240
bodies changed: their ribs were displaced,
their lungs were squashed, some organs were

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.940
compressed against the spine and others were
shoved down into the lower abdomen.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.260
In addition to making it hard to breathe,
hearts struggled to pump and, guts struggled

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.050
to digest what little food they could get
down.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.330
As one Victorian lady is reported, “I had
only eaten two bites of my biscuit there was

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.130
no room beneath my corset for a third.”

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.990
Said the West Coast Times in August of 1884,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.890
The evil consequences of tight lacing are
universally admitted.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.379
Ladies, however, generally refuse to acknowledge
that tight lacing is at all common.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.790
Each possessor of a small waist claims that
it is a gift of Nature, not a work of art,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.190
and wears a corset, not for the purpose of
compressing her shape into a narrow circumference,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.100
but merely as a comfortable, if not necessary
support.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.050
This lead to the “great corset controversy”
of the 19th century.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.680
Said one woman in a letter to the Boston Globe
in January of 1893,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.799
I myself have never felt any ill effects from
nearly 30 years of the most severe tight lacing,

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.980
nor have I yet found any authentic case of
real harm being done by stays, even when laced

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.829
to the utmost degree of tightness, both day
and night.

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.430
People who write against the practice of tight
lacing are either those who have never been

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.651
laced and have never take the trouble to inquire
into the pros and cons of the subject, or

00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:09.040
those who have, perhaps been once lace up
very tightly in badly made, ill-fitting stays

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.209
with the settled determination of finding
them most awful instruments of torture.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.370
Those who have been systematically laced up
in proper stays from their childhood are the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.299
only ones who are capable of forming a right
judgment on this subject and I hope you will

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.299
allow tight lacers the opportunity of defending
themselves against the enemies of trim little

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.299
waist.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.870
On the other side of the argument, in an article
titled “The Slaves of Fashion,” published

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.999
in the Chicago Tribune in September of 1891,
it was noted,

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:43.439
It is difficult to imagine a slavery more
senseless, cruel or far-reaching in its injurious

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:49.330
consequences than that imposed by fashion
on civilized womanhood during the last generation.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.519
… the tight lacing required by the wasp
waist has produced generations of invalids

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.459
and bequeathed to posterity suffering that
will not vanish for many decades.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.900
… And in order to look stylish, thousands
of women wear dress waist so tight that no

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.660
free movement of the upper body is possible;
indeed in numbers of instances, ladies are

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.329
compelled to put their bonnets on before attempting
the painful ordeal of getting into glove-fitting

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.730
dress waists.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.889
Whatever side of the tight laced argument
a particular woman was on, whether by their

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.639
suboptimal blood pressure, inability to breathe
properly, or low blood sugar, it’s thought

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.270
this may have been one potential cause for
Victorian ladies reportedly retreating to

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.520
their fainting rooms and swooning onto their
fainting couches.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.190
Another fashion-based theory is that a well
dressed woman of this era wore an enormous

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.540
amount of clothing, and even in the summer,
such a lady had, in addition to the corset,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.960
underwear, a bustle pad, a full skirt supported
by crinoline (read: horsehair) petticoats

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.050
(sometimes lined with steel hoops) and a bonnet.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.420
Some may have fainted from overheating, while
others may have collapsed under the sheer

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.690
weight of their garments which would have
been more difficult to handle combined with

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.680
the other aforementioned cinching aspects.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.410
(This could also be dangerous for other reasons.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.190
For instance, the wife of famed poet Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow tragically died when

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.750
she accidentally dropped a burning match onto
her hoop skirt.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.820
Her clothing burst into flames.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.370
Even after the fire was smothered, it was
not an easy task to remove the cindered clothing.)

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.940
Another potential contributor sometimes pointed
to in trying to explain some of the swooning

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.220
could have been chronic poisoning.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.620
During the 19th century, while people knew
that arsenic was poisonous, they didn’t

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.360
seem to know (or care) that environmental
exposure from its fumes could also have a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.530
deleterious effect.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.020
As such, and given its utility in certain
applications, it was widely used in the manufacture

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.110
of everything from fabrics to paints to the
paper in which food was wrapped; in fact,

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.970
by the end of the 1800s, 80% of all wallpaper
was arsenic-laced.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.440
Arsenic poisoning has a variety of symptoms
including headaches, cold sweats, and fainting.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.420
There was an 1880 report of a woman who had
“fainting fits almost daily,” until she

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.830
was moved to another room in her home that
wasn’t furnished with arsenic-tainted wallpaper

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.120
– where she recovered a few weeks later.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.050
In addition, arsenic, along with lead, mercury
and other such toxic substances, were commonly

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.440
found in makeup during the Victorian era.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.400
(see: Why Lead is Bad for Humans) Lead was
also a common ingredient in hair dyes and

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.070
was frequently found in wine (along with arsenic
and copper).

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.410
Together, these toxins contributed to more
wealthy Victorians suffering from seizures

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.580
(and, theoretically, swooning) when compared
with their poorer neighbors who couldn’t

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.150
afford such luxuries.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.460
All that said, it is highly likely that some
(or even the majority) of this swooning was

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.460
put on.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.190
You see, besides potential side effects from
the fad of extreme tight lacing of corsets

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.600
or other such things, for a time, swooning
at the least hint of a shock also became expected

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.890
and downright ladylike.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.850
(This also made it a great literary device
in stories.)

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.530
Women, particularly of high station, were
expected to act the role of a delicate flower,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.410
while men were expected to be hard as nails.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.450
(see: In Which Teddy Roosevelt Makes Men Everywhere
Feel a Little Less Manly)

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.300
Swooning was simply one method of a woman
showing her delicate nature in the form of

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.620
an extreme emotional reaction to a particular
event.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.400
Today, simply gasping might be the best social-cue
equivalent.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.030
Similarly, people rarely laugh when by themselves,
even when finding something incredibly humorous.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.530
In fact, contrary to popular belief, most
laughter is not associated with humor, but

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.550
rather stems from non-humor related social
interactions.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.780
This was noted in a study covering over 2,000
cases of naturally occurring laughter, almost

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.720
none of which stemmed from jokes or other
such humor devices.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.940
Most cases were simple, short “ha ha’s”
during otherwise normal conversations.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.640
These short laughs almost never interrupted
speech, but rather occurred during breaks,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.880
providing social cues to those around.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.940
So in the 19th century, swooning was just
another form of accepted social cue for ladies

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.871
to have in their toolbox, whether they literally
were fainting or just, more likely in most

00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:59.090
cases, making a show of it.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.650
Beyond this, the ladies also had another potential
incentive for swooning.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.240
You see, at the time, well-to-do women often
had something called a “fainting room”.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.760
This was a room for the woman to recover from
a fainting spell and other forms of so-called

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.040
hysteria.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.400
Besides just getting to relax in piece on
a comfortable fainting chair, there was another

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400
benefit.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.140
A doctor or midwife could be called to attend
to a woman who was suffering from some form

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.070
of hysteria, which included symptoms of swooning,
among other things.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.320
And by “attend to”, we mean give vigorous
pelvic massage, whether manually with their

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.750
hands or using a water massager, if attending
to the woman in their offices or other location

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.940
that had one.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.740
This went on until the lady in question was
relieved, curing her of her hysteria.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.839
This was also a boon to doctors at the time
who otherwise tended to be avoided by the

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:50.970
general public unless absolutely necessary.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.540
Treating female hysteria, though, was something
women who had the money often needed done

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.959
regularly and were more than happy to pay.

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:02.540
However, this was very time consuming and
could require some amount of physical exertion

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.699
for the midwife or doctor in question, particularly
if they had to attend to multiple ladies in

00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:12.689
the same day in this way, with “doctors
lamented that treating hysterics taxed their

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:14.220
physical endurance.”

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.890
In this case, the husband could potentially
also be called in to help.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.449
Later, this practice, and the cramped hands
of physicians throughout Europe and North

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:26.120
America, led to the invention of the vibrator
for quickly relieving such “hysteria,”

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.730
saving the physicians significant time and
effort.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.420
In the early 20th century as houses wired
up with electricity became more and more common,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.029
the vibrator for this use became something
of a common household item for those who could

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:39.110
afford one.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:54.370
With it, you didn’t even need to necessarily
call the doctor to relieve hysteria.
