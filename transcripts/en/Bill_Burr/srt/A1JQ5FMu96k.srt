1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,350
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:07,730
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,730
and Ah, I'm just checking in on
you. What's going on? How are you?

4
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:18,330
How's your week going? Oh, you're
having a rough one. We'll, it's okay.

5
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,500
It's almost over. It's Thursday.
You know, don't you hate your boss?

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,400
A little less on Thursday.
Hey, comes in. Hey,

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,350
go over there and do what I say.
And you're like, oh, chubby cheeks.

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:35,100
You know, you love to say that to them.

9
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,460
Just grab his muffin top
doll. What veto do shop doing?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,250
Okay.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,710
Did you technically
get fired for that? He,

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,200
all you have to do is just when you're
going in for the disciplinary meeting,

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,060
he just, you know, you just stay
in the pocket. Just be luck.

14
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:59,590
I have no problem doing what this man
says, but I can't fight the fact that,

15
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,360
yeah, I think he's adorable.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,770
I mean look at him once you want to go
up there and give him a little, you know,

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,190
oh, we'll put on a tie today. Yeah,

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,000
that's a fucking great way to
get your ass fired. I don't know.

19
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,210
What if everybody does it though?
You know the strength in numbers.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,100
Is this like a Sally field movie?

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,720
Should I be fucking standing
up holding a sign? Yeah. Union.

22
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,500
Right? Still brave. It was so
brave what she did in the mind.

23
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,530
Um, is there any word more
overused in the entertainment,

24
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:41,531
specifically the movie acting business
than brave Jesus fucking Christ.

25
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,440
Has any actor ever looked
up that fucking word?

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,130
The way you went out there with that band,
Dan? It was such a brave performance.

27
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,970
Yeah. Jesus Christ. You know, just go.

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,800
When did you go over to craft service
and get yourself something that has yoga

29
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,240
in it? You fucking stupid,
you know, courageous, brave,

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,490
important. This was a story
that needed to be told.

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,973
Okay.

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,370
Oh my God, those fucking award shows.

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,580
And it never dawns on him the irony
that everything we're wearing colluding,

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,350
what they shtick,

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,080
sweat pants and t shirt I have on right
now is all made in a sweatshop by some

36
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:26,040
crying child at fucking three in
the morning and Che in n whatever,

37
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,480
Honduras or some shit. Right.

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,750
And they're all up there acting
like they give a fuck about people.

39
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,410
It's like you don't, you
want to go with their,

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,680
you want fucking Ruth buzzy or whatever
fucking name is to say what you're

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,870
wearing. Looks good. You know,

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,870
and then you want to win the shiny
thing and you want to cry and thank your

43
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:49,130
mother and pretend you're down to earth
and go back to you fucking infinity

44
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:52,400
pool. That's what you really want to do.
Right. Do a little fucking, you know,

45
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,320
have Jack Nicholson come over, do
some blow off your titties. You know,

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,670
if you're a guy, a, you know, who
knows what you want to do out here.

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,310
I didn't want to talk in about, you know,

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,120
I'm just having one of those scatterbrain
days and I went to bed early last

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,620
night. You know, as I always do,

50
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,430
whenever I go on tour with [inaudible]
and Bart, nick, I think all of us,

51
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,810
like for the next three days, have to
like dry out and try to get about, oh,

52
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:23,710
about 14 hours sleep. Um,

53
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,450
so yeah, I'm off the booze.
I'm off to cigars, you know,

54
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,290
the usual fucking thing. I'm all
over the goddamn place. And um,

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,400
oh fuck. You know what? Somebody told
me yesterday, here's a new thing.

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,271
All right,

57
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:42,160
how fucking in this fucking world that
just keeps getting more and more creepy.

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,910
You know, that whole big brother
thing, but blah, blah blah, blah, blah.

59
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:50,500
And then people are saying, oh, big
brother turns out it's actually us. Um,

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,560
and it is, it is because we were
just keep going along with this shit.

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,633
Yeah.

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
Listen, his belt,

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,710
just tell the fucking story before you
go on your stupid little rant here.

64
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,130
All right, so buddy, my
tells me another day, right?

65
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,520
He a that a friend of his came over to
do some work on his house because a,

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,140
if you own a house, you're constantly
trying to fix it so it doesn't fall down.

67
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,450
That's what they don't tell you. You know,

68
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:18,630
when they show the commercial and the
real estate commercials, you know, Oh,

69
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:21,150
white picket fence, golden retriever,

70
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,750
you watch had six kids and
she's still hot, right?

71
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,410
Isn't that the other song goes anyways.
And they're all running around there.

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,360
They're uh, you know, ridiculously green,
front yard played Frisbee, you know,

73
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:36,340
the dog's not trying to eat
anybody. Your wife's laughing.

74
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,030
The kids are all good looking
right. Everything's fine, right?

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
Nobody has a list. Nobody has, you
know, fucking jealousy issues. You know,

76
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,910
guy doesn't have dad bod
basically crushing it.

77
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,430
They can and you just look at it and
you're like, you know what, if I, if I,

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,390
you know, if I buy a house, you know,
I know I'm not going to look like that,

79
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:58,470
but is that the mood I'm going to be
in? It's like a drug, right? So anyways,

80
00:04:58,471 --> 00:04:59,470
he fucking, um,

81
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,120
he fucking has this guy's
buddy come over to some work.

82
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,060
So he goes to pay him and as all good
guys do, well, you don't need to pay him.

83
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,490
You don't even pay me. And he's like,
no, come on, I want to pay it. Nah,

84
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,050
I'll tell you I'm not gonna accept it.
Just take the fucking money. Right.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,970
They had to do a sketch like that with
too polite friends and ends up in a knife

86
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:17,271
fight.

87
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:20,990
One person finally kills the guy and then
fucking stuffs the money in his mouth.

88
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,450
Should they do a sketch like that? I
think they should. Um, anyway, so he goes,

89
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,690
so finally the guy goes, you don't have
to pay me, just get me a case of beer.

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
So the guy goes, fine.

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,880
So the closest place that at
a little bit Owlette was cvs.

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,500
So it goes down to cvs.

93
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,950
He buys the fucking case of beer and the
lady behind the lady behind the counter

94
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:51,030
goes, do you have an id? And he's
looking at it like, bitch, I'm 50.

95
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,890
And he goes, do you really think I,
you know, you don't think I'm of age?

96
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,890
She goes, I need to swipe your
license. And she, he goes for what?

97
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,440
She goes, oh, um, basically
for health insurance purposes,

98
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,420
they record, you know, if you
drink or not. And if you drink,

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,800
your premium goes up because
you're a drinker. Now,

100
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,801
what the fuck this cds give a shit about
rat and everybody out who's a fucking

101
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,030
booze face out there. Right?

102
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,250
Cause you know what it is the money that
they're gonna fucking be able to, to,

103
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,700
to knock up, you know on
your premium to pump it up.

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,140
CVS gets, it gets a little kickback.
That's how it fucking works.

105
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,890
It's like when I drive you
to fucking amazon.com right?

106
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,650
If you go through my website,
they give me a little aid.

107
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,550
Thanks for sending some business our
way. Break you off a couple of honeys.

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,653
Right.

109
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,460
Okay.

110
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,180
But I'm not costing you any more
money. I'm the hero with this.

111
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,610
I don't cost you any more money.
Whether you go directly to Amazon,

112
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,960
if you go to my website,

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,140
it doesn't make any difference to
me and I'm mostly not ratting out.

114
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,470
What I'm trying to say here is I am
a way better person than cvs. No,

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,490
I'm fucking with you. Look we're all
trying to make money out here but that's,

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,460
that's really, it's fucking ridiculous.

117
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,300
I actually always try and look at it
from the insurance company side of it.

118
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,260
Cause you know God damn well everybody
goes in there and lies these smoke,

119
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,090
you know, you drink. No,

120
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,460
I mean maybe I'll have
a beer, I don't know,

121
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,490
on the 4th of July to support the troops.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,020
[inaudible]

123
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,980
do you engage in any a drug activity?

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,540
If, I mean food's at drugs
self, technically yes, but
I mean that other style,

125
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,630
no, I would do you have
unprotected sex with prostitutes?

126
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,150
Listen, I got a phone call. Can I,
can I take this? You know, you know,

127
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,100
you know that deal. You
lie your fucking ass off.

128
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,240
You're going to get life insurance.
You lie your fucking ass off. Right?

129
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,710
So on one side,

130
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,740
I actually have empathy from insurance
companies because I understand that

131
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,574
aspect of it.

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,870
Provided they ever fucking paid
out any goddamn money remotely.

133
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:09,650
Like they said they were gonna you
know the deal, you pay for insurance,

134
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,020
they say you're covered and you
say to them, hey, if this happens,

135
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:15,890
am I going to be covered if I, I got the,
uh, the old stuff, the tow insurance.

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,330
So if I wake up in the morning, I stub
my toe. Okay, I'm a man, I can take it,

137
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,160
but if I break my fucking toe, okay,

138
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,070
and you know my job is to
skip on stage every night.

139
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,120
If I have to take a night off,
can you, can you kick me the,

140
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:31,580
you know the fucking $25 feature
spot money. Can you kick that to me?

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,180
They're like, absolutely. I
go hide. So if I break my toe,

142
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,760
step my toe in my house and Co,
absolutely you're covered right now.

143
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,640
What happens? You stub your toe, you
break it, you fucking call them up.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,280
They're like, okay, I've got
to send it through the Ya,

145
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,670
you're not getting paid quadrant quadrant
of the fucking insurance company.

146
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,650
Then they come back and what do they do?

147
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,700
They'll give you like fucking 13 bucks
instead of the 25 they owed you nine or

148
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,860
13 between 25 doesn't seem
like a lot money. Right?

149
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,930
But you just ratchet that up there. Right?

150
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,860
But if they owed LG two 50
they only gave you one 30 what?

151
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:04,770
They owed you 25 grand and
they only gave you fucking six.

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,850
That's what the fuck they do.

153
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,420
They are in the business of taking your
fucking money and buying themselves a

154
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:14,421
yacht and fucking banging Victoria's
secret models in the ass while I'm looking

155
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,930
at the next year's model of
fucking uh, yeah, that's,

156
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,290
that's what they're in the business of.

157
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,420
They are not in the business
of fucking help it people,

158
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,890
they're in the business
of taking your money,

159
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,530
telling you that you're going to be
covered and then when you go, dude,

160
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,860
what the fuck? Right? They go, yeah,

161
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,430
go fuck yourself cause we got more
money taken a leave it. Right.

162
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,360
And what should happen is
like, you know, when, uh,

163
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,730
do you remember the mighty heroes when
they would send out that little signal

164
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,860
and they'd all fucking tour
diaper man and strongman,

165
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,230
they'd all turn into some or was it
Batman out fucking remember when everybody

166
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:49,320
was insured by that company should
go at those cons and be like, dude,

167
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,270
what the fuck? I thought you
said this guy was covered.

168
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,040
This is what you're doing to him. You're
going to do it to all of us. Right.

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,120
I'm going back to the Sally field
thing. You know what the problem is,

170
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,360
is nobody likes their neighbor. You know,

171
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:04,240
you look across that and you look at the
car you drive and you look at his wife

172
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,850
either don't understand what
he bought or you want it.

173
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,070
There's never a middle
ground like, yeah, you know,

174
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:12,460
I'm pretty much on par with this guy and
I get my ego can handle living across

175
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:15,520
from him. You're either going to
resent them or not understand them.

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,180
So then when he gets fucked out of
money, he's telling you the story.

177
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:21,310
You're sitting there nodding your
head, acting like you don't like it,

178
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,370
but you hate to admit it. There's a part
of your soul that's getting filled up,

179
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:28,360
isn't it? Admit it. You know
like your neighbors, right.

180
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,940
It really came down to it.

181
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,180
Don't you want a house as big as
your house and your neighbors?

182
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,300
Wouldn't it be great if they
just weren't there anymore?

183
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,500
Somehow there was wasn't
any like forensics and they
could figure it out that

184
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,740
you a hastened his demise
and took over his house.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Just added a fucking hallway
between your house and his right.

186
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,800
Then the whole other
house is yours, right?

187
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,500
So when your wife and kids are driving
you nuts, you just say, listen,

188
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,340
Daddy's going over to his other life.
I'll be back when I can deal with you.

189
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,020
And everybody just
looks at you like those,

190
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,530
that family in that real estate commercial
just smiling and waving, being like,

191
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,110
yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about
it. Right? Then you go in there,

192
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:11,520
right and said anything you want,
you've got booze, you got cigars,

193
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,480
you know you got, I'm a
sue slash a fucking whore.

194
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,140
They want to have that the timeout
room for a married guy. You know,

195
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,780
and I know what you ladies to tick. Well,

196
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,960
why don't they have a time out room
for women? Ain't no what I say. Well,

197
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,830
why don't you come up with it? The world
doesn't know you're around a drinks.

198
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,410
Okay? And goddammit, you got
debt, multitask and pray.

199
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:37,320
Once you sit down with a couple other
prods, what would be in your room?

200
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,480
You know a bunch of shit
that makes you live longer.

201
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,140
See if you notice what the guy, everything
I said would slowly fucking kill me.

202
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,840
The Bose, the cigars, the
horse, all of it just,

203
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,080
it just eats away at your soul
in your fucking liver, right?

204
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,530
Women would go on the first,

205
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:56,740
one of the first things they probably
want is like the most beautiful fucking

206
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:00,490
tub they ever could find. They could
take a nice fucking bath. You know what?

207
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,040
They're crazy little fucking soaps, right?

208
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,960
They have a whole spa day and they'd have
a friend that they could sit down and

209
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,800
get all of that resentment out of their
heart with someone who can actually

210
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,870
listen to it. They
download all of that shit.

211
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,340
You just totally clean up their soul
before they go into the next room and get

212
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,110
fucking bang by Brad Pitt. You know,

213
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,200
whoever the fucking Jake Gyllenhaal
guy is nowadays. Who is it?

214
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,600
Is it Justin Bieber? Has he become
a man yet? He's in his 20s. Right?

215
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,760
He's riding the wave out of teen
idol. Them slowly become an a man,

216
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,110
right? As long as he
doesn't remake blue lagoon,

217
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:41,440
I think that kid's going to
be all right. Um, anyways,

218
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,030
my Jesus Christ, these 12 minutes of
your life, you'll never get back. Um,

219
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,010
you know what? Today's about
everybody. Today's not about you.

220
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,190
Today's not about me. Today's
not even about America.

221
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,020
You know what today's about.

222
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,480
Today's about the Boston Bruins
versus the Detroit Red Wings.

223
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,360
That's what it's all about. Okay?

224
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,390
It's funny that they play all these
fucking games and it can come down to one

225
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:12,280
God damn game for those of
you who don't watch hockey,

226
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,130
all right? Which is kind of me. I
just pay attention to it because I've,

227
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,100
are you fucking content once? Can I pass
whatever worked the first fucking time?

228
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,680
You know, they're always like, you
know, that's not secure enough. Well,

229
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,030
it's like, it's so fucking secure.

230
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,150
I can't do it on one time while
I'm still on a fucking podcast.

231
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,250
Jesus fucking Christ. Anyways,
they play all these goddamn games.

232
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,940
Let me get back into the nicest
soothing tone that I had earlier. Um,

233
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,620
they play all these fucking games, 80
goddamn games, whatever the hell it is.

234
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,920
And you would think that, you know, by
now everything would be all sorted out,

235
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,250
right? Let's go to the playoff picture.

236
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,650
The playoff picture. Here we
go. I didn't need a picture.

237
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,260
I need a brow to play playoff
bracket. I can't read that shit.

238
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,660
Bracket. Challenge the fucking standings.

239
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,750
That's how, that's how old I am. I think.

240
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,180
I feel like if I just yell at
a website, I'll do what I want.

241
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,850
Um, all right so the,

242
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,560
so the fucking red wings have
93 points. Oh they got 93.

243
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,300
That's right. Cause they, that's right.

244
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,190
Cause they beat the fucking filthy
flyers. All the flyers needed that one.

245
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,420
The flyers needed that one. For some
reason I root for the Philadelphia Flyers.

246
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,600
I like them. They know what I mean.

247
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,380
I know that they'd been dirty
and fought knowledge ship.

248
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,600
He can't tell me it wasn't
entertaining. You know,

249
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,460
Ron Hextall come and flying out of the
net cause he's pissed that he lost the

250
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,390
Stanley Cup finals. I've
always enjoyed that shit. Um,

251
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't like the offense,
but I liked it. Team.

252
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,840
Uh, but you know, Philly fans work at,

253
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,200
you're not liking making you not like
them. So they did the job with me.

254
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,140
I don't like them. Um, so
anyways, so Detroit beat them.

255
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,180
So as of right now, Detroit has 93 points.

256
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,420
Philadelphia has 91. The Bruins have 91,

257
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,050
but for whatever fucking
reason, I guess head their head,

258
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,060
maybe we or we have a game
at hand. I don't know what,

259
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,800
we're still under the fucking bar
line. So basically tonight, tonight,

260
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:25,520
the red wings I think could solidify,

261
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,180
let's see, I have two more. Get look
to choice. Detroit wants to an idea.

262
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:32,210
They're either in or they've
totally fucking, you know,

263
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,690
they'd have to basically put me
in net to not make the playoffs.

264
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,010
But if the Bruins,

265
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,310
when we will go up two points on
the Philadelphia flyers and a,

266
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,170
this is the biggest fucking game.
They're all big games this week,

267
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:49,640
but this is a for [inaudible]. This
is a big one this week. And uh,

268
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,730
and other Redwings haven't been
the greatest in the past few years,

269
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,470
but they got enough guys left.
Oh, and by the way, I want to say,

270
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,060
shout out to that fucking Twitter cunt.
That fucking laughed at me when I said,

271
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,150
you know, Carolina fucking, I feel
like they always get the best of us.

272
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,010
And he was saying like, oh,
we're the Bruins are six. So,

273
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,940
and to the last fucking tie, well, you
know something, I never forgot that game.

274
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,050
Seven in 2009 when they came
back and they fucking beat us.

275
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,380
And just times, every time there's a
big game like that, you know, something,

276
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,980
they always beat us. And what happens?
We play those kinds. And what happened?

277
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,510
What happened? They ended
up beating us in a shooter,

278
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,670
but we did get one point then Christ. Um,

279
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,940
I think you do right? Don't
you get one point that I don't,

280
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,650
every time I turn it on,
they fucking change the rule.

281
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,950
Now they're doing three on three in the
overtone, which I like, but you know,

282
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,090
it makes me feel like I blacked
out for five years. So anyways,

283
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,430
we gotta to win that game
tonight. Um, and I was hoping, uh,

284
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,110
Detroit would look a little more
tired than they did last night,

285
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:47,450
but they totally looked like
they were on their fucking game.

286
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,370
The one thing we got going
is it's back to back. Um,

287
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,010
which usually during the
season you'd have a let down,

288
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:58,040
but there's too much at stake. So I think
this is going to be a tough game. And,

289
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,300
uh, um, I don't know. My
heart says we're gonna win,

290
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,590
but I don't know. We'll see.
It's been tough for us lately.

291
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,190
All right, let's, uh, oh, and by the way,

292
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,610
the amount of people that hate the fucking
Bruins, I, hey, it's like four white.

293
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,200
We want one cup in 40 years. The
fuck is your problem. You know,

294
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,710
I love when our fucking teams sit
there and they act like, you know,

295
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,020
this team's dirty and
this team has excuses,

296
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,780
but our team's fucking
squeaky clean. You know,

297
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,260
I see the pieces of shit on my team,
just the way I see them on your team,

298
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,370
you know,

299
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,540
I see your fucking coaches screaming
and yelling anytime anybody touches your

300
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,350
players. And then when your
players touch somebody else there,

301
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,480
I don't give a fuck. Everybody does that.

302
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,470
It's called being an
immature cunt. You know,

303
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,830
welcome to the party. Have a seat.
Can I get you a drink? All score big,

304
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:54,090
everybody. A little bit of advert
to Miss Smith's million since uh,

305
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:58,310
you're paying too much for tickets
between all the mockups and last minutes.

306
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,100
Convert convenience charges,
even printed home fees.

307
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,690
They really charge you to print tickets
at home. It's fucking unbelievable.

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,920
All those types of charges, I'm telling
you, that just ends up, you know,

309
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,070
that's just somebody standing
in a four year of a house.

310
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,090
He can't afford just reign
and money down on prostitutes.

311
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,000
You ever watch American greed? That's
that. It gradually all adds up to that.

312
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,000
All right, you end up paying
courtside prices for nosebleed seats.

313
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,340
Score big.com is here to change that.

314
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,510
Did you know that 40% of all live
tickets go on sold? Do you know that?

315
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,780
And did you know that there's a
place to get seats at huge savings?

316
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,900
It's called score. Big Dotcom score.

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,390
the quasi cut saying seasick.

330

Queet NERF DCE Finney. Um, no
surprise fees and free shipping.

331
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,790
Wait, uh, did I say get an instant answer
and save up to 60% of your tickets?

332
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,990
No surprise fees and free shipping.

Um, I'm at one time went to a game,

342
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,620
the guy was like, hey, how'd you get
tickets? It's like, oh, scout them out,

343
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:21,330
how much you pay. And I answered him and
he's like, yeah, we got these for this.

344
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,130
It's like, go here. Does that make you
feel better? You tight. Fuck, I couldn't.

345
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,450
Every once in a while it's like, you
know, just in those moments you're like,

346
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,800
why did I just let another
adult do that to me? You know,

347
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,361
and you hate yourself.

348
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,550
Then you're a little surly to your
wife and next thing you know, yeah,

349
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:40,230
she's not banging you a
pole in branch. You know,

350
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:43,740
you probably spend more time with your
bedsheets than anything else you own.

351
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,410
You really shouldn't
skimp on your bedding,

352
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,290
but most people do because
great sheets are very expensive.

353
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,770
Thanks to Boll and branch,
that's not the case anymore.

354
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,030
And when you spend the big bucks on
sheets with super high thread count,

355
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,650
you think you're getting the best.

356
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,020
But what you're really getting is
marketing Mumbo jumbo. Oh my God, dude,

357
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,180
am I really have to read
five paragraphs about sheets?

358
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,530
Thread counts have nothing to do with
quality and don't get me started on

359
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,640
so-called Egyptian cotton. The
fuck is that. That just came,

360
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,030
just just the name of a plant
grown in Pakistan, in China.

361
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,700
Uh, well, you know,

362
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,430
it didn't back in the date and the
they'll no white man bring his ships over

363
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:28,580
there for all the fucking spices and
sheets. Isn't that what happened? Um,

364
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,590
you value your, you value your
sleep. Don't put words in my mouth,

365
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,660
but you know what? You're right.
Instinctive son of a pitch.

366
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,970
But whenever you head
to a department store,

367
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,840
you're forced to pay a huge markup for
sheets that aren't even that great.

368
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,690
Boll and branch sheets are
different. First of all,

369
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,000
let me cross my legs during
this part. First of all,

370
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,230
sit down and let me tell you a story.
You can only get them at Boland,

371
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,440
branch.com so you know you're paying
for quality sheets and not for overhead.

372
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,910
And quite frankly,

373
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,410
they're the most comfortable sheets in
the world they made with the entirely

374
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,880
organic cotton and a night sleeping on
Boll and branch sheets makes your day so

375
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:07,990
much better. Three US presidents
sleep on Boll and branch.

376
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,790
Well how do you know that? Isn't
there like a security issue? Jesus.

377
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,791
How filthy or Bill Clinton's
that fucking animal a,

378
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,690
these are people who can afford to sleep
on any brand of sheets in the world and

379
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:26,020
they even choose bold and they
even choose boll and branch.

380
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,080
How can they afford to sleep
on any brand in the world?

381
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:33,130
They only make 400 grand a year
before taxes. Oh that's right.

382
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,460
Cause then they give speeches for
fucking 500 grand and night to everybody.

383
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:40,330
You put them in office. So they wash
their bribe money. Oh, shut up bill. Okay,

384
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:43,410
here we go. They even cut out all the
middlemen, department store markups,

385
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,040
which by the way are up to 800% so you're
getting amazing luxurious sheets for a

386
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,010
couple of hundred bucks. Boll
and branch is so confident. Oh,

387
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,920
this is all capital letters.
Boll and branch is so confident.

388
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:57,250
You'll love their sheets that they'll
let you try them completely risk free for

389
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,390
30 nights, jerk off on them, fuck on
them, sleep on them, drool on them.

390
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,020
We don't give a shit. Uh, it gets
even better. If you order right now,

391
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,650

You guys want some drum node shit
before I get off the podcast,

430
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,013
wind it down here.

431
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,030
You guys know that song by sting
love is stronger than justice.

432
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,630
A lot of people sleep on stink, you
know, cause he comes out all yoga it up,

433
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,110
still looking like he could bang a 22
year old and every he's like, oh man,

434
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,070
that's fucking a baby boomer
elevator music. Well, I like it.

435
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,800
I like it. Um, is a song on a,

436
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,490
what does that 10 summers tails as a
song? Love is stronger than justice.

437
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,290
This is some drum nerd shit.

438
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,940
Now I've listened to that song at least
a thousand fucking times and I thought

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,560
it was like, I don't know if it's bar
a measure. I don't know. I say it,

440
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,010
I thought you counted seven twice
then you counted four, four,

441
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,290
then three, four and then seven.
Right. Can I actually play this here?

442
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,500
Why don't I play the fucking song?
I'll show you. So this is some fucking,

443
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,680
this is the dumbest Shit I think
I'm going to do. Oh, that's right.

444
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:17,270
I can't play it on my fucking laptop
for whatever fucking reason. Um,

445
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,140
yeah.

446
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,200
Cause I have too many things signed into
fucking iTunes and then my old shit,

447
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,450
I can't, I don't remember
the password for.

448
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,080
Okay.

449
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,610
I thought the big brother was
looking at me through the camera.

450
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:33,380
Can't they fucking see?
Can't they see that?

451
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,020
Is that it's me. Let me see if
I can fucking play this for you.

452
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,003
Okay.

453
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,370
All right. So I always thought that
this is how you counted it, right?

454
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,180
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, one, two, three, four, five, six,

455
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:54,860
seven one, two, three, four, one,
three, one, two, three, four, five,

456
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:55,910
six, seven, one.

457
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,860
Right. It finally dawned on me today
that when I was counting four, four,

458
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:04,670
and then three for four plus three is
seven so you can count the whole fucking

459
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,504
thing and she's seven

460
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,290
the one here we go.

461
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,310
Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven one, two, three, four, five,

462
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:21,290
six, seven, three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven 43 four, five,

463
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,390
six, seven, one.

464
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,580
So it's really four fucking measures
is seven and I was like, Oh,

465
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:32,050
the plain who fucking Shevon twice.
Then they go for four Dan, it's three,

466
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,730
four days back to seven. All right.

467
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,800
It's like no stupid that just
making it sound like it's in four,

468
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:42,250
four and then all of a sudden they
lop off one beat and you're like, oh,

469
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,260
what the fuck? But back to one again,

470
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,100
which really is the layman's
term for still being at seven.

471
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,710
I learned that while walking at pit bull
picking up dog shit this morning. Huh?

472
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,120
What the fuck have you been doing? Um,

473
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,920
so anyways, um,

474
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,930
how the fuck do I get
out of this? You know,

475
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,650
in defense to me as much as I also
loved that album, that fucking,

476
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,310
I don't all the new shit that
I listened to. Uh, you know,

477
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,230
as I watched the Grammy's and I was like,

478
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:20,090
I am downloading everything that
wings some Grammy's here, right?

479
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,240
Not Everything, but you know,
so I basically, I downloaded a,

480
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,750
I can't remember Alabama
shakes the weekend.

481
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,940
Leonardo DiCaprio. What's a fuck set
guys? That rapper who won everything?

482
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,840
I can never remember. Kendrick
Lamar, right? I downloaded all,

483
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:39,710
all this shit that, and I like all of
this stuff. I got to tell you that like,

484
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,970
uh, the one that actually I, I
liked the best is the weekend.

485
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:47,780
I just think it's a fucking, it's
an unbelievable album. Unbelievable.

486
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,933
You're an amazing voice.

487
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,430
And some of the songs that he really
does sound a lot like Michael Jackson,

488
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,960
but not, and not even in a bad way,
just like influenced by the guy. Um,

489
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,020
so this morning when I walked, when
I was walking around the block,

490
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,630
I listened to rat round and round,

491
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,490
starting the day off with the
little Bobby blocks up, right?

492
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,770
Then I listened to that sting
song and I was thinking like, ah,

493
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:15,770
that's what I figured out. Wait a minute.
Four, three to seven. What the fuck?

494
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,920
Literally picking up dog shit with a big
goofy grin on my face and this fucking

495
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:22,640
beautiful woman jog by looking at me
like, is this guy excited about dog shit?

496
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,770
See listening to a podcast about dog
shit. Just one of those moments, you know,

497
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,100
and just like, yeah, whatever, you
know. Anyways. And then I was just like,

498
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,310
alright, I keep, as much as I keep
trying to listen to new music,

499
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:38,860
I keep going back to the shit I listened
to when I was growing up. So, um,

500
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,700
out of all the ones that I keep coming
back to that guy's fucking album,

501
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,480
I just think it's the shit. So I'm
not, I'm not 100% over the hill,

502
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,350
you know what I mean? And I
actually have, unbeknownst to me,

503
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,620
I have a college gig coming up,
which I'm very excited about.

504
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:57,880
I barely do college gigs anymore.
I don't know why, you know,

505
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,510
I have to keep doing college kids
cause I gotta keep my fan base being,

506
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:04,960
you know, I've got to keep getting the
next generation of people how it works.

507
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,611
You know, you can't,

508
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:11,230
you don't want to grow old with your
crowd and that just reminded you how old

509
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,210
you are. It's like I should
only think that, you know,

510
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,760
twice a day when I'm brushing my
teeth, you know, put the toothpaste on,

511
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,110
you start brushing, you look up
Jason far off. Oh it's me. You know,

512
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,710
I only want to feel that
twice and fill it twice

513
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,740
in a day. Um, but uh,

514
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,260
okay.

515
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,040
What happens is, is if you just kind
of state, you know, with your fan base,

516
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,040
you know, they get married, they have
kids and even if they want to come out,

517
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,630
they're so fucking tired. They just want
to sleep if they actually get a moment,

518
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:48,380
you know what I mean? So, uh, you got
to keep the young kids coming out.

519
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,270
The young kids that can't feel their
face, but they love it. Um, oh Jesus.

520
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,510
Alright, that's the, uh, the just
checking in for you on your podcast.

521
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:59,030

[inaudible]

531
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,050
depress dude, a Billy
cunt exclamation point.

532
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,380
I'd been listening. I've been
listening to your podcast for years.

533
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,930
Your deranged psychopathic perspective
reminds me I'm not the only one

534
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,320
shaken ladders. I don't know what
that means is this guy from Boston.

535
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,620
I've been listening to
the podcast for years.

536
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,050
You Drain psychopathic perspective reminds
me and not the only one shake and lad

537
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,240
his kid that still doesn't even
have any accent shaking ladders.

538
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,020
I don't know what that means.
Anyways, I got a problem. Yeah,

539
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:26,360
I was in Boston all last
week. So the fast ball,

540
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,540
the Boston accent kind of came
back. The old La, you know,

541
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,630
I got a problem saying that get
a job and get a julep duties.

542
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,480
You get a job and for those you
working on your Boston accents job,

543
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:42,790
just say like jaw.

544
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,850
Like I'm going to punch you in the jaw
and then B Joe up gotta get a fucking

545
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:51,370

546
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,790
Just muttering g self give
fucking job and your cubicle.

547
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,350
Okay.

548
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,330
I'm freaking out. Your coworkers
just mumbling, you know, fucking do

549
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,190
you fucking Kwok shocker. Um,
I've got a problem for years now.

550
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:10,510
I've been trapped in my
KFC and wet wipes. Okay,

551
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:11,344
that's disgusting.

552
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,690
I used to be a bodybuilder and actor and
a comedian with fucking prospects right

553
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:21,130
in front of me, but then adulthood
raped me in the eyes. Oh Jesus.

554
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:22,300
Could you be more dramatic?

555
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,820
It sounds like that fucking
chick from a sex in the city.

556
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,120
Crazy Bro. Broke my hat. I had,
this is the guy again, crazy broad,

557
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:34,811
broke my heart.

558
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:39,811
I had to cut away old friends and
family shutting me out of their smiles.

559
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,830
All right, so this is like getting
creepier with each sentence.

560
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,810
If you don't bring this
around in like two sentences,

561
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,950
am I going to abandon this?

562
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,900
Had a cut away from old friends and
family's shutting me out of their smiles.

563
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:53,831
Dude,

564
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:57,310
what did you do that your friends and
family decided they didn't want to be

565
00:33:57,311 --> 00:34:02,260
around you anyways? I don't feel
sorry for myself or want any pity. Uh,

566
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:05,200
I just, you're not going to get any.
So good. I'm glad you don't. He goes,

567
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:09,400
I just want to know how to get out of
this. Never ending routine of demise.

568
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,020
Well, first of all, I would just stop
using those goth death metal words.

569
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,470
Yeah.

570
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,170
You know, demise when she got in here.

571
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,460
Adult rape me in the eyes.
These are like song lyrics,

572
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,593
you know,

573
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,550
depressed dude. What would be the
name of this trafficker? Barker.

574
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,480
I have to get wet wipes. Right? It
sounds like I can't sing like that.

575
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,803
Great

576
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,620
digital and I've got my eyes and all
these fucking kids get like wet fucking

577
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,080
whiplash. I'm,

578
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,180
I work too much in a jeweler that was
supposed to pay for my comedy career when

579
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:50,430
I don't work. I, uh, I was supposed
to wait for my comedy career when I,

580
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,820
when I don't work, uh, I sleep
or oh, when I don't work,

581
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:58,200
I sleep or watch endless DVDs. I'm 24
years old of what the fuck this reads.

582
00:34:58,201 --> 00:35:00,780
Like you have 56, dude, he goes,

583
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:04,380
I'm tired all the time from all the
hating of the world and my body just won't

584
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:09,020
listen to the screaming
frustration in my soul. Dude,

585
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:11,870
you listen to like you
listen to progressive metal.

586
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,060
I'm guessing by the
words you use here, uh,

587
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,890
either that you played
dungeons and dragons.

588
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,070
I'm really not helping you depression
by shitting on you through all of this.

589
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Um, don't worry. I'm going to give you
some sunshine here in the end here.

590
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,690
So I sometimes get a spark of motivation
to get back in shape and just start

591
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:33,020
writing scripts. But it only lasts
for a day or two at the most. Yeah,

592
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,650
exactly. And then, and then the
work comes and you have to going.

593
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,860
And that's what separates the people in
life who fucking work and in make it.

594
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:47,550
And those who don't, you
know, everything's fun for
a couple of fucking days.

595
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:49,770
I'm going to get shredded.
I'm gonna join a boxing gym.

596
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:52,170
I'm going to look like I'm going to
fight in a title fight and you go down

597
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,640
there, you skip rope.
I'm going to get abs.

598
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,680
You're doing all the fucking
shit in two days in, you know,

599
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,920
after two days you get tired. All right?

600
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,530
And that's where you need the
discipline to get up and go over there.

601
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:04,140
Even though you don't want to. You know,

602
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,170
people who've written
Oscar when he scripts,

603
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:10,050
I bet they don't like fucking
doing it on, on a certain level,

604
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,460
but they keep going. So I would just
tell you to keep fucking going. Anyways,

605
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:16,650
let me read the rest of this
drum overly dramatic shit.

606
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,670
I've lost all faith in the world.
Have nothing to fight for anymore.

607
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,541
I respect you.

608
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:25,830
Go Fuck yourself attitude and want and
want to know what you did to finally pick

609
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:28,980
yourself up from your dark
inflicted depression. Uh, sorry.

610
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,950
It's not the funniest emails, but I could
really do with you guys. I know, dude,

611
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:34,390
I'm fucking with you. I know you going
through some shit. So I, here we go.

612
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm going to help you out here.
Uh, first thing I would do,

613
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,110
get rid of the KFC and
wet wipes. All right?

614
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,590
If you're already kind of a
depressed dude, if you eat bad food,

615
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:46,710
that's just going add, cause I, I'm
just speaking personally. Once again,

616
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,530
not a licensed guy here in case you
throw yourself off the fucking roof.

617
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,310
All right? Um, yeah. Number one,

618
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,860
this is what I do. Go out and get
something healthy to eat. You know,

619
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,830
drink some water. Okay?
Get eight hours sleep.

620
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,270
Wake up and need something healthy.

621
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,770
Then go to the grocery store when you
full and go buy a bunch of healthy shit.

622
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,860
Okay? Chop up the veggies,
chop up the lettuce,

623
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,710
get a fucking salad already made in there
so you don't have to think about it.

624
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,010
All right, cook up some fucking
chicken. Chop that shit up.

625
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,210
Make some chicken salad.

626
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,410
You got that in there to get yourself
some fucking lunch fried and get yourself

627
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,230
some real bread from a fucking
bakery. Start with that bullshit.

628
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,450
You start eating right and
then just start working out.

629
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,230
You're automatically gonna feel good about
yourself and fucking stick with that.

630
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,040
As far as that other shit goes.
Dude, you're 24 years old. All right.

631
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,670
I started comedy when I was 24 you sound
like you've already been doing it and

632
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:42,150
quit, so you're ahead of where
where I was at at your age,

633
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,900
so there's no reason to be
depressed. All right. Um,

634
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,870
this is how I got beyond my depression
was I just started observing it.

635
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,000
I looked at it as a spectator rather
than feeling a thought and just accepting

636
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,610
it and then being dragged to the
bottom of the fucking ocean with it.

637
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,340
I just started to pay attention.

638
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,710
I just sat there and listened
to what my brain was telling me,

639
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,380
and it was a bunch of negative, oh my God,

640
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,750
I'm going to fail and I have to go back
and move in with my parents and they're

641
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:10,290
going to die.

642
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,280
I'm going to be able to afford to pay
for the house and then I'm gonna be

643
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:16,320
homeless and then I'm just
going to die. And, uh, you know,

644
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,060
nothing's ever gonna work
out for me. You know,

645
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,370
those were the thoughts I was having.

646
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,430
So I just sat back and observed
them and I just started going,

647
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:27,300
I don't want to think that. I want
to think that. And I would just,

648
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,190
as I felt them coming, I would just
replace it with like a positive thought.

649
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:34,860
I know this is really corny and
simple, but I kinda started doing that.

650
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,910
And the more I did that because it
didn't quite work as to what actually did

651
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:42,730
work in the beginning at all. But like
I just kept doing it more and more,

652
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:45,940
and then I just became conscious of when
my brain was going in that direction.

653
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,770
And, um, working out
helps me eating right.

654
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,060
Helps me going down to a comedy
club, telling jokes helps me out,

655
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,710
play in drums, wrestling
with my dog, you know,

656
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:05,260
taking Nia out to dinner. Just go do
something. Like, it's just a choice,

657
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,910
you know, July 30th. So
only gonna happen once.

658
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,870
So am I gonna fucking be a miserable
cunt on this or I said July 30th,

659
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,090
2012 is only gonna happen once. It's
just, it's just a fucking choice dude.

660
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:18,580
So you know, if what you're
dealing with this clinical,

661
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,160
then it's obviously way beyond
me, so I don't need, you know,

662
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,410
and then I'll have to fucking
apologize like Fred Willard.

663
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,350
Okay.

664
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:25,360
Um,

665
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,620
I'm sorry that you didn't
go to a psychiatrist and
you went to a hacky comedian

666
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:31,480
instead. Evidently that's my fault.

667
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,620
[inaudible] fuck you me these bad thoughts

668
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,460
to this place

669
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,343
because

670
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,223
[inaudible].

671
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,220
Um, all right. Why don't
we end with this segment?

672
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,510
I'm sure I can do another 10 minutes on
this to give you at least 45 minutes for

673
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:25,250
the week. Let's end with
this. This segment. Oh Jesus.

674
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,490
Which is really taking
on a life of its own.

675
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,030
I thought it was going to
die, but it is somehow risen.

676
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,033
Okay.

677
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,620
Um, okay. Here we go.

678
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,070
And get ready for bill is the dumbest
person on the planet. All right, Bill,

679
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:43,940
for what it's worth,

680
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,720
I think you're fucking crazy and
irresponsible explanation point.

681
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,910
I can ever say the x Scullin x skull.
Exclaim exclamation. There we go.

682
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,050
Exclamation point.

683
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,570
I just want to let you know that those
words that you kind of know how to say,

684
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,800
but you just sort of fly through them.

685
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,420
Escalation point a what kind of
person talks about God like that.

686
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,080
And I love this shit. This is
what they all do. You should.

687
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,880
And I believe deep down inside you
are, be ashamed of yourself. Dude.

688
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,830
This is what I love about these fucking
maniacs is they're so wrapped up into

689
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:19,010
what they believe that they listen to,

690
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:23,780
how much this person just keeps fucking
including other invisible people.

691
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:28,010
And then superimposing what he
believes into what you know he thinks.

692
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,060
I truly believe,

693
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,120
because he's so wrapped up in his own
fucking world that he can't possibly even

694
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:39,080
fathom that somebody has a difference
of opinion on this subject. So he goes,

695
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,850
uh, you should, and I believe deep down
inside you are, be ashamed of yourself.

696
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:46,940
Dude, are your mom and dad's still alive?

697
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,500
What exactly does that
have to do with any,

698
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,660
your shtick with respect to God
is hurtful, offensive, offensive.

699
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,130
And despicable. I'm in three things
that always has to be three things.

700
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:01,400
It can't be hurtful and despicable
or offensive and hurtful.

701
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:04,490
It has to be hurtful,
offensive and despicable.

702
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,800
Just like comedy has
to come in threes. Um,

703
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,580
how difficult it must be to spew
hatred and vulgarities for shock value.

704
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:15,860
Laughs, no talent in that my friend.

705
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,810
That's the classic place that
people go. Um, whenever you,

706
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,673
whenever you,

707
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,570
this is the classic guy where everything
is funny until it comes around to the

708
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:31,040
subject that they take seriously
100% and no one can even joke it,

709
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,590
joke about it or even
questioned it on any level.

710
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,520
And then they always say that you're
just doing it for shock because they find

711
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,260
it shocking. It's like really my views
on women, women haven't been, you know,

712
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,550
that didn't offend you. All this shit
that I've said over the two fucking years,

713
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:49,560
none of that is offended you and
Al of a sudden this does anyway,

714
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:54,561
so he goes enjoy your success air quotes
and all the money you are making on the

715
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:59,780
backs of hardworking, decent people
that understand what it means to follow.

716
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:04,781
The rules and be the best they can be
without putting other people and god down.

717
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,620
The rest of us are watching
and we are not laughing.

718
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,890
Dude. How many people are
in your bedroom as you're,

719
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,400
do you have a group podcast listening
party every week. All right,

720
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:20,270
let's get back to that. Oh,

721
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:24,470
evidently I am making a money on the
backs of hardworking, decent people.

722
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,290
So let me get this straight
because I'm standing on a stage.

723
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,390
Evidently what I'm doing is not hard work.

724
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,470
And if people are sitting in the audience
automatically, they're all decent,

725
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,560
hardworking people. And not only that,

726
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,720
I'm making money on the backs of them,

727
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:42,290
really do I have some sort of
comedy sweatshop like you know,

728
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,060
of comedy factory was sweatshop
Labor. What I do is actually,

729
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,460
uh, takes advantage of no
one. I stand on a stage and I,

730
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,650
I tell jokes and if you
like what I say you,

731
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,810
you sit and listen and if
you don't, you walk out

732
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,840
right where, where, you know, and I love
how just because you're in the crowd,

733
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,310
that means you're a decent human being.

734
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,510
Do you know the amount of fucking
freaks and scumbags that come up to me?

735
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,890
This is what I found at a comedy show
for the most part, decent people.

736
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,990
They leave after the show.

737
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,850
I didn't want to bug them and then they
walk out and then mania x come up to me.

738
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,260
You know, let's do some Jaeger and they
fucking spit in your face and shit.

739
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,970
You know, believe me. All right? But
I know I made fun of God. So now, uh,

740
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,570
you know,

741
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,340
now all of a sudden I'm now all of a
sudden you want to talk about people

742
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:35,130
making, making money off of
decent, hardworking people.

743
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,430
Take a look at fucking
organized religion. All right?

744
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:40,260
Those guys will make those
guys who live in pretty good,

745
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:44,100
scaring the fucking shit out of
you. Every God damn week. All right?

746
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,850
And I'm entitled to an opinion and I
never was cramming my opinion down your

747
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,040
throat. I wasn't okay.

748
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:53,850
You believe in what you believe
in and I 100% respect that,

749
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:57,240
but I have the right to
question it. You know?

750
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,670
And you shouldn't find it shocking
that I question it. You should.

751
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,910
Shouldn't you just be what Jesus would
do when Jesus just started praying for

752
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,480
me. Anyways, let's, let's continue
this just in case you're interested.

753
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:10,590
I was raised Catholic,

754
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,670
married and raised my children Catholic
and definitely have my doubts about the

755
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,640
whole organized religion thing.
Great. So you agree with me?

756
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,390
Not even sure that I
believe in God. Once again,

757
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:23,190
there's another appoint
that we, that we agree on.

758
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,390
I lost my father three years ago and never
would have uttered these words in his

759
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,340
presence. Neither would I.
What am I voice go up. So

760
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,550
dude, I did it on a podcast. All right,
I'm sorry your father passed away.

761
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,980
But you know that has
nothing to do with me.

762
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:42,150
Do you understand what you're doing here?

763
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,030
Now all of a sudden you're making it
seem like I'm walking in with my Mr

764
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:50,010
microphone into the intensive care
saying there's no god, you know,

765
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:53,940
whispering into somebody's ear in a
coma. You just go into the ground.

766
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,070
We're all like, dear, I'm not doing that.

767
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,380
I'm doing a podcast and I'm
fucking around. Alright,

768
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,220
if you want to take it seriously,
that's your problem. Okay.

769
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:06,180
And if you want to bring up your father
passing away as some way to try to guilt

770
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:10,470
me and to feeling like, I mean, you
know what I'm saying? In a hateful,

771
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,810
hurtful fucking way. Dude,
those are all your issues.

772
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,680
They have nothing to do
with me. All right? 10.

773
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:19,500
He goes on to say that his dad believed
that there is something out there

774
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,230
responsible for all the
beauty in the world, uh,

775
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:25,890
in our world and for our lives as human
beings. I don't even disagree with that.

776
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,810
I just know human beings have no idea
what it is until they fucking die.

777
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,990
So I'm not going to sit there and listen
to another human being who tries to

778
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:38,520
scare the shit out of me and who's living
in a fucking palace telling me that if

779
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,410
I become rich, I'm not going to heaven.

780
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,340
I'm not out of my mind to think
that that reeks of a fucking scam.

781
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,660
The same way late at night when they
have those fucking gold coins that

782
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:53,580
evidently are with 50 bucks
in this selling them for
1999 that that doesn't reek

783
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:58,170
of a scam. Somebody actually sent me a
a, an email. Of course I didn't save it.

784
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:03,090
Evidently it's sprayed with like a
dollar something worth of gold. Okay,

785
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:05,970
so they're making, what
is that? A 2000% profit.

786
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,400
All right. Believe it or not,

787
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:14,740
just because you're walking around talking
about religion in the afterlife and

788
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,900
and doing unto others and
you're talking this great game,

789
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,930
it doesn't mean that you
can't be full of shit.

790
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,033
All right?

791
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,630
Okay, and I'm not saying that I'm right
about what I feel, but this is just,

792
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,870
it reeks of, of, of, of a scam.

793
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,880
I really believe that there is some sort
of thing out there and I wouldn't be

794
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:39,460
surprised if there is
something after this.

795
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,880
I wouldn't be surprised if you just go
into the ground and you decay and you

796
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:44,530
give life to the next fucking thing.

797
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,700
I wouldn't be surprised if earth is
punishment for something that I did in a,

798
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,580
in a different solar system. That's
another thing about religion. Um,

799
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,420
forget about the dinosaurs is it
doesn't even bring up space. Okay.

800
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:02,350
Let's say there is this all
powerful beauty being. Okay, okay.

801
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:04,030
And I'm just trying to
question this right now.

802
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:06,610
So I'm not trying to be shocking
or I'm just questioning this.

803
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,210
Let's say there is this all powerful
being being, they're created,

804
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,040
the everything that there is.
Okay. The entire solar system,

805
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,830
why would you do all of that and just put
people on this one planet that's like,

806
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,030
you created an n a, you
built this house that has

807
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,940
an infinity basically amount of rooms,

808
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,600
bedrooms and you just put everybody,
you're only using one room in the house.

809
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,810
It doesn't make any
fucking sense whatsoever.

810
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,780
And that's one thing about Scientology
for as much shit as people give

811
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,220
Scientology, at least it has the
brains to incorporate outer space.

812
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,193
You know,

813
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,580
I don't know if that's a really good
point or if that's really fucking stupid,

814
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:59,470
but you know, I don't fucking
know. So anyways. Yeah. Dude,

815
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:02,500
I wasn't trying to offend you
or anything that you fucking,

816
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:06,040
I was just trying to be funny and I'm
just fucking around and if you want to

817
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:10,750
take this shit seriously, that is
totally your fucking choice. Um,

818
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,830
you know, that's it. All right. I'm
fucking done with that. All right,

819
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:18,340
let's move on to the next
person trashing me. Um,

820
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,070
oh, what the fuck? Where the fuck is it?

821
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,780
A Jesus Christ? I think I
only bodily put one of them.

822
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:30,220
I thought I had another one. I'm
really just organized this week.

823
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,400
That's cause you don't have Jesus
in your life. You don't have Jason,

824
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:37,420
another guy said, I love how you
pick on, on, uh, on a, on a, uh,

825
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,850
a punching bag of religion,
basically saying like,

826
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,560
it's very easy to make fun of Christians,

827
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:46,510
but I don't dare make fun of Muslims
because if you make fun of them, Oh Shit,

828
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:47,920
look what's going to
happen. You know? And,

829
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:51,010
which I thought was fucking hilarious
because the person was sitting there

830
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:54,400
talking about how insensitive I am. And
that basically, in a roundabout way,

831
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,640
we're alluding to the fact that people
who are Muslim means that you're, uh,

832
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,750
you're a fucking, uh, uh, you
know, you're going to blow up.

833
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,710
Like they're all gonna blow up planes
and that type of shit. You know,

834
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,060
I went to a wedding one time,

835
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:09,010
this girl was Pakistani and
they actually address that,

836
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,950
that what they fucking hated
was that all, you know,

837
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,040
Christians thought that all of them just
wanted to walk around blowing up shit.

838
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,391
And, uh,

839
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,150
and I also thought it was funny that this
guy's fucking sitting there suggesting

840
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:21,190
that, uh, people just
because they're Christian,

841
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:24,820
that they're peaceful when you know,
what is it once every 18 months,

842
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,860
some Jesus freaks fucking kills an doctor.

843
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,720
That's pretty much par for the
course, isn't it? Um, no, and it's,

844
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,480
it's not safe to make fun of
Jesus freaks. It really isn't.

845
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,980
It really fucking isn't.

846
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:41,981
And I think Bill Maher is out of his
fucking mind to say what he says in like,

847
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,670
or actually has balls the size of the
Grand Canyon to say what the fuck he says

848
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:50,780
and then just walk out in Wade
into those people and just,

849
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,150
I would never do that shit anyways.

850
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,470
And I got to admit the level with which
that people take this shit seriously.

851
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,650
It actually kind of creeps me out to
continue talking about this shit. So a,

852
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,610
this might be the last fucking week
of it because I've definitely made my

853
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:08,090
fucking points and at this point we're
just going to go around in circles and

854
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:11,570
I'm just going to piss people off. So, uh,

855
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,610
let's move onto this last guy. What
she brought up some great points. Um,

856
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,420
all right, set a bunch of Nice
stuff and then he said, all right,

857
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,850
enough with the Dick
Sucking. I was gonna try,

858
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,320
I was going to criticize religion,
but to describe those belief is,

859
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,190
is to mock them there. And you know
what dude? That's what I learned. Um,

860
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,030
yeah, if you describe them, then
you start making fun of them.

861
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:39,560
And then everybody gets mad, or as you're
saying, they're just so ridiculous.

862
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,730
You just have to, you know. Anyways,
let's fly ahead here. Yeah. He said,

863
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:47,690
you mentioned needing a code in the
absence of religion to live by. Um,

864
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,130
I'm not sure how much, um, of the,
I don't read things as a Shtick,

865
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,230
but I recommend an excellent text used
in an intro to Undergrad and Undergrad

866
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:02,030
ethics course called the elements
of moral philosophy by James.

867
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,060
I don't know if that's
Raquel's or Rachael's. Um,

868
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,730
everybody goes on and on about Jesus,

869
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:11,150
but Socrates who define morality
as how we ought to live,

870
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,870
let a compelling life, as you
probably know. Actually, I don't,

871
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,820
I just know him as a party reference.
Um, what are you fucking Socrates,

872
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:20,930
you know,

873
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,960
that's one of those references that
even morons can use and get away with.

874
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,140
And I'm sad to say I'm one
of those people. Um, he said,

875
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,260
I didn't know this shit. He was
found guilty of corrupting the youth.

876
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:35,390
He thought Zeus, Venus, Aries,
et Cetera, smacked of bullshit.

877
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,610
All right, think about that. Right?
They're corrupting the youth now.

878
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,270
Every I Christians, Muslims, and
everybody today would say that. Yeah,

879
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:48,500
that is bullshit. That those people do
not exist because now we've evolved to,

880
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:52,010
there's only one God.
There's only one bank.

881
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,870
There's one world power. Um, and
let's see, and his punishment,

882
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,310
he was forced to take his own
life by drinking hemlock poison.

883
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:06,380
Once again another death because
of organized religion. You know,

884
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,890
these Jesus freaks, these, these
people who are into fucking, I didn't,

885
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,780
don't want the reason why
I don't make fun of, uh,

886
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,750
the Muslim religion is really because
I don't know anything about it.

887
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:17,360
And the reason why I make fun of
Christianity's because that's what I was

888
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,690
brought up. And those are
the stories that, that I,

889
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,590
that I hear and all I know about
Muslims is basically, uh, you know,

890
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,320
the couple of wars with Iraq.
So I basically don't know shit.

891
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,151
I just think what you,

892
00:53:29,151 --> 00:53:33,300
you've wrapped your wrap your women up
in bounty paper towels and then cut their

893
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:36,330
clips off. And am I wrong?
Am I wrong on that one?

894
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,740
Either they're not allowed to show
their fucking songs because, uh,

895
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,160
you're going to get an erection.
And because you wear that bed sheet,

896
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,290
everybody's gonna fucking see it.
I, I don't really think about it,

897
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,020
but I would definitely make fun of it if
I knew something about it, but I don't.

898
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:49,620
All right.

899
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,380
And I reserve the right to make fun of
the fuck a religion that I was brought

900
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:55,470
up. And, um, so anyways, he says, um,

901
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,050
Socrates was a humble man,

902
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,760
famously announcing all I
know is my ignorance. Um,

903
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,460
he sought I the one that I love people
who would take that at face value. See,

904
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,630
he shatty was you fucking moron,
right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know,

905
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:11,790
Jesus is the solution. Um,

906
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,440
he sought answers to questions where
his religions prohibits questioning

907
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:17,274
answers.

908
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,550
Yeah.

909
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,260
Oh, fucking brilliant. And
this guy's really smart.

910
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:23,470
You should do a podcast instead of me.
I'm a fucking idiot. Listen to that.

911
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,420
He sought answers to questions,

912
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,230
whereas religion prohibits
questioning answers.

913
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,910
And if anything fucking proves that
it's the 50 emails I got this week.

914
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,190
I like how I'm actually asking,

915
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:39,640
like I'm questioning religion on
any sort of intelligent level. Um,

916
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,640
I think actually I think I am just cause
I say cut and fuck doesn't mean I'm not

917
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,600
, uh, bringing up some good questions.
All right. Let's finish this for, uh,

918
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:50,940
for Socrates. The unexamined
life is not worth living. Uh,

919
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,390
his sentiments on marriage and
nagging women are remarkably markably,

920
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,860
similar to your own, so
underrated. Socrates, overrated.

921
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:02,410
Jesus. Uh,

922
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,260
okay.

923
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,460
Yeah, that, that's, you know,
that's, that is the one thing,

924
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:11,480
and I'm not being a dick here that
I don't understand about people who,

925
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:17,050
like I respect people who, who, you
know, are raised in religion or,

926
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,120
or find a religion that speaks to them
and that they decide to commit their

927
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:23,760
lives to what? And what I
don't understand is you don't,

928
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,290
it brings you this piece, right?
Am I wrong there? All right.

929
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,880
So it brings you this piece.
But then if anybody questions

930
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,300
that belief that you have,
how quickly it turns violent,

931
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:46,270
like the amount of people who died because
they questioned these a holy people,

932
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:48,903
it's this,

933
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:54,790
you don't find that fucking like
hilarious and ridiculous on any level

934
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,970
like this sitting there calling
the other person, that devil,

935
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:03,650
because they're questioning their beliefs
and they're saying that that other

936
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,910
person is going to hell.

937
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:09,350
And then they turn around and kill the
person because they don't believe in the

938
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:11,780
holy pure way that they live
their life. I mean, I just,

939
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,190
I can't get behind that.

940
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,990
Okay.

941
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:18,140
I can't get behind that the
same way. Is that the same way?

942
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,700
It's just because you're a red sox fan.

943
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:23,590
You can't recognize the talent of Derek
Jeter and I gotta be like two full

944
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,370
cuvees you fig now he's the shit.

945
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:34,240
And I was fucking no. Why? Why do I
continue with this shit? Um, I don't know.

946
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,570
I don't fucking know. Anyways, that's the
podcast for this week. And once again,

947
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:39,580
I'm not disrespecting
your religions. Okay?

948
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:44,080
But this is my podcast and when I
bring shit up, I fucking go off on it.

949
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:44,651
And I,

950
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:49,651
and I definitely go over the top
saying that somebody was pent.

951
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,710
Playing the upright bass with Jesus's
Juggler is fucking hilarious because it's

952
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:59,010
over the top. And I believe the
God in my world thinks it's funny.

953
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:00,450
Yeah,

954
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,150
he's God. Why would he be
intimidated? I bet another thing too,

955
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:07,080
I don't understand why God
would make all this stuff. Okay.

956
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:10,470
And then just be so doe angry
all the time. Jesus Christ here.

957
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,970
I'd gone back in and again, I got a lot
of questions. Fuck you. It's by podcast.

958
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,070
I don't know. That's
why I don't understand.

959
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,470
Okay.

960
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,540
You know, I is, it is more
like, you know, when you,

961
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,090
when you build a bookshelf
and you, you know,

962
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:26,830
stand back and Meyer on your work and
then it falls down on the floor and you're

963
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:31,360
like God damn fucking piece of Shit and
you start blaming the bookshelf even

964
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:35,200
though you made it, you're the
one who put it up there, you know?

965
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:36,690
Yeah.

966
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,330
I guess technically God didn't make a,

967
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,360
he didn't make titty bars. I
guess those are manmade, but a,

968
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:48,530
you know the broad cinema ma or are wow,

969
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,650
I'm really fucking, I was just gonna
say maiden. His image isn't that,

970
00:57:51,651 --> 00:57:56,570
isn't that what you guys say? They
found a devil. That's the devil.

971
00:57:56,571 --> 00:58:01,160
They got the devil in them. Um, all
right. Whatever. All I'm saying is,

972
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:03,440
cause it really got serious this week,
people, people really got fucking,

973
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:05,870
they took it a little too seriously.
All right, so back the fuck off.

974
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,810
Stop taking it so God damn
seriously. And you know,

975
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,740
why don't you actually practice what your
preacher preaches and why don't you go

976
00:58:12,741 --> 00:58:16,700
pray for me? Why don't you do that
instead of coming on here telling me,

977
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,660
you know, giving me your wrath. Isn't
that one of the seven deadly sins?

978
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,160
You fucking maniacs.

979
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,930
You just as fucked up as I am and
you don't know shit either. Right?

980
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,170
All right. I'm sorry. God
bless all of you. Okay.

981
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,040
I hope you find what works for you
and a seriously. If I'm bugging you,

982
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:39,710
don't listen to the podcast. God
knows I'm not making any money off it.

983
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:43,160
I don't give a fuck. That's it. You
guys all have a great weekend. Uh,

984
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,840
I tell you where I was
going to be this week,

985
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:48,560
but I'm worried some Jesus freak is
going to show up. So a, that's it.

986
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,820
That's it. Have a great week. I'll
talk to you next Monday. Hopefully.

987
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,490
[inaudible] [inaudible] it

988
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,890
show at smart

989
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,110
smiles for much.

990
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,363
It's

991
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,630
g,

992
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,683
so

993
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,160
t.

994
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Okay.
