00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.120
So there's really two rules for building fluid layouts. Use

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.260
percentages or viewport units, something that'll size as you resize

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.990
the window. And then, test while you're resizing the window.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.380
Let's take a look at how this worked out on

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.390
the mobile device. We went from this layout without any

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.430
changes to my blog. To this layout, definitely an improvement.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.210
I don't have to scroll left or right to see

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.620
everything on the screen. And, you may notice the font size

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.330
is actually a bit larger now. The font size

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.620
was always set in M units, although it's actually still

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.730
a bit small for a mobile device. So, we

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.860
should probably bump that up. Let's take a look on

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.730
the tablet. In the tablet layout, we went from

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.390
this layout to this, again, a definite improvement. This is

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.060
actually a pretty readable experience. And, even when we

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.530
rotate the screen, we end up with a nice reformatting.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.910
All this is really just a long winded way of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.210
saying, be sure to create fluid layouts. Be sure to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.810
reflow to use all the space on the screen and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.620
take advantage of every bit you can. And be sure

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.680
you adapt to different screens as well. One tool that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.640
makes reflow a lot easier, particularly across very different screen

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.740
sizes, is the new flex box layout in CSS. This

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.540
new tool let's you stack elements in flexible rows or columns.
