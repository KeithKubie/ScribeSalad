00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.533
&gt;&gt; It's my pleasure today

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.133
to welcome Peter,
Bjorn, and John

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.300
in their only Bay Area appearance.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.433
[clapping and cheering]

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.367
I'd like to introduce
Peter Moren on guitar,

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:26.900
Bjorn Yttling on...

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.333
&gt;&gt; PETER: That's Bjorn.
&gt;&gt; BJORN: We changed places.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.567
&gt;&gt; You changed places.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:30.600
Okay. Sorry.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.333
Bjorn on guitar and
Peter on keyboards.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:41.066
But John is still on drum
and percussion like objects.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:45.934
Excellent.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:47.800
So the trio that we're
about to enjoy today

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.800
were formed in
Stockholm back in '99

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.033
and as I hear it were
influenced by the sounds

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.133
of classic '60s baroque,

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.300
pop, power pop,
and new wave,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.033
but these guys
aren't revivalists.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.800
Instead, they've created
some of the most exciting

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.734
and original Indie rock
of the new millennium.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.333
The band began playing
gigs soon after forming

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.500
and quickly began a
period of compilations

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.200
alongside artists like
Sahara Hotnights,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.533
Badly Drawn Boy,

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.200
and Holiday for Strings.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.633
After releasing a few singles,

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.166
they released their self-titled
first album in 2002

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.700
on the tiny
Beat that Label.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.767
After a few more shows
and singles and an EP,

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:33.367
the group jumped to the
plankanomy [ph] label in 2004

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:36.166
and released Beats, Straps,
and Backgrounds EP.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.767
It was soon followed by the
wonderful 2004 full length

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:40.667
released Falling Out

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.800
and then by Writer's
Block a year later.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.934
The trio's fifth
album Living Things,

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.567
offers more of what
made young folks

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:50.066
and international hipster
anthem, infectious,

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.233
electro-acoustic tunes,

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.300
framing tales of romance
and its just contents,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.900
without further ado,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.100

Do you want us to talk more?

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:18.200
Then, you think you
should ask these two.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.567
&gt;&gt; PETER: Oh, yeah.

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:23.467

ask something. John?

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:30.734
What's your first question?

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:40.934
Yeah, take it back.
No questions.

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.166
[laugher]

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:45.800
Next question.

00:16:56.533 --> 00:17:02.233
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah. The first
record was like ketchup;

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:06.700
the second one was
like dark chocolates;

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.934
third one was like beer;

00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:13.233
and the one previous
to this one

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:16.300
was an instrumental
record that was like--

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.300
what was that?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.867
Ketchup mixed with
chocolate or something.

00:17:22.867 --> 00:17:27.000
And this new one is what
flavor is that, Peter?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.700
&gt;&gt; PETER: Marshmallows.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.166
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.233
Okay.

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:33.133
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Thank you.

00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:41.800
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah, we're going to do the title track of the album.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.266
And since we were supposed
to talk, we forgot about that.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:48.133
I had a lot of things to say
earlier but I didn't know

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.133
how I was supposed to talk.

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:51.867
Usually, we're not
supposed to talk

00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:55.900
because we never
had time to talk.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.900
&gt;&gt; BJORN: This is talking, huh. &gt;&gt; So talk.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.467
&gt;&gt; PETER: Like in the old days
we used to do like 90% talking

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:04.900
and some playing,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.500
but now we got
used to just play

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.500
and--anyway, I can say
something about this song,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.066
this is called Living Thing.

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:13.600
It's the title track
of the new album

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.333
and there's a couple of reasons
why it is the title track.

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:20.133
One of them is very simple,

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.767
because all our albums,

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.200
apart from the very first one

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.533
which is called Peter,
Bjorn, and John

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:27.400
which is a good name
for an album,

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.467
all the other ones have had
two words and three spellings,

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:34.633
so the second was Falling Out

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:37.133
and then came Writer's Block,

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.033
Seaside Rock,

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:41.033
Living Thing.

00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:45.000
So, it's all very clever.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.367
It's going to continue
like that.

00:18:46.367 --> 00:18:48.133
Let's see what we can
come up with next time.

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:50.533
&gt;&gt; BJORN: I've been playing
this for the sound

00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:54.467
and that's a center [ph] pad
and that's a guitar.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.533
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Guitar.

00:18:57.533 --> 00:18:59.934
I think the next one is going to
be called a Google Map.

00:18:59.934 --> 00:19:01.567
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yes.

00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:02.633
Google Earth.

00:19:02.633 --> 00:19:05.166
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Google Earth.

00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:08.934
&gt;&gt; PETER: But it's also a song
that it's kind of about the band

00:19:08.934 --> 00:19:12.266
which is, you know,
it's three people that

00:19:12.266 --> 00:19:14.834
when they come together
they become a monster

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:17.467
rather than three
separate persons.

00:19:17.467 --> 00:19:19.934
So, it's like a blob
that you can't control.

00:19:19.934 --> 00:19:24.633
It just takes over and explodes
and weird things happen.

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:26.633
So, it's like a different organism

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:29.533
to Peter, Bjorn, and John,
the persons,

00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:32.400
the band, it's like
a living thing.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah.

00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:41.400
That's what the song is
about the band. Okay.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.333

00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:04.734
This is the single
in Australia.

00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:12.600
&gt;&gt; Talk about something else.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.567
&gt;&gt; PETER: Okay. I think
a single in Germany.

00:25:14.567 --> 00:25:15.734
Okay.

00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:18.367
First, it's the same single.

00:25:18.367 --> 00:25:20.700
You can always kind
of make up stories,

&gt;&gt; No, but what's going on.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.900
PETER:We're going to do a song called 100 Meters of Hurdles,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.367
which is a very good song
from our first record.

00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:41.133
And we never play that because no one likes it, for me--

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.233
so, we don't know
how to play too.

00:25:43.233 --> 00:25:46.300
&gt;&gt; BJORN: I do.
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah, good.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.066
I think we should do
this German single.

00:25:49.066 --> 00:25:50.700
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Okay.
&gt;&gt; PETER: Australian single.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.433
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Okay.
All right.

00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:54.667
&gt;&gt; PETER: And the reason it's
not a single anywhere else

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:58.500
is because it's got cursing
and swearing in it,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.300
and that you don't want that
on the radio in America

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.333
and not in the U.K. either,

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:06.367
but in Australia it's fine.

00:26:06.367 --> 00:26:08.233
It's great.
So,

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.734
but I think we can
curse on Google or...

00:26:10.734 --> 00:26:13.033
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Can we do that?
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.

00:26:13.033 --> 00:26:17.066
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Okay.
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah.

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:23.900

Apart from yesterday,

00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:45.367
it's all being really good,

00:30:45.367 --> 00:30:46.567
much better than
we expected.

00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:49.734

what you call it?

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.734
glued to our instruments

00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:07.900
and like bottles thrown
at us or something,

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:13.900
but being the opposite, actually.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.567
Yeah.

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:17.066
Help me.

00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:20.367
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah, we're
going to do that after.

00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:21.400
He was an ace after.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.567
It was just a joke but...

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:25.433
&gt;&gt; JOHN: No, it wasn't--
okay. But...

00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:26.567
&gt;&gt; PETER: Give us some now.

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:28.000
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.667
&gt;&gt; PETER: More questions?
Oh.

00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:33.166
&gt;&gt; What it was like
to sing in English?

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:37.567
&gt;&gt; PETER: You know, when
you are five-six years old,

00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:38.834
it didn't--
we never decided,

00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:41.433
it's just everyone listens to

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:43.767
American and English
music in Sweden,

00:31:43.767 --> 00:31:47.266
and we learn English
in school from nine--

00:31:47.266 --> 00:31:50.033
from nine years old, so.

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:52.900
We see a lot of American TV,
you know.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.900
You know, I never thought
about it really.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.867
But of course
in the beginning,

00:31:55.867 --> 00:31:59.533
you couldn't do proper lyrics,
so it was more,

00:31:59.533 --> 00:32:02.633
"Why they go..."

00:32:02.633 --> 00:32:04.834
like a cowboy language.

00:32:04.834 --> 00:32:06.133
I
don't know.

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:10.133
It's a bit fair now.

00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:11.100
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.
And your question,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.533
what band we would like to
tour with except Depeche Mode.

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:18.233
I will--I think I
would take Van Halen.

00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:18.900
[laugher]

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.066
Yeah.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.667
Sorry.

00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:33.800
&gt;&gt; PETER: More questions?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.967
Yeah.

00:32:38.967 --> 00:32:39.900
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Remixing?

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.567
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Remixing music.

00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:47.066
I'll have the CI, that's you
in the Google shirt.

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:49.800
You get that for free?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.400
Remixing music,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.433
that's--
it's too easy now,

00:32:55.433 --> 00:33:00.934
but it's still very
hard to get it right,

00:33:00.934 --> 00:33:02.900
I think,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.533
you know, like many things now.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.500
And apart from that,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.800
I don't think anything
about that.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.333
&gt;&gt; PETER: Some of the remixes
are really good,

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.967
some are not so good,

00:33:18.967 --> 00:33:21.233
more are not so good, but,

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:22.166
you know,

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:25.033
it's [indistinct] who do it,

00:33:25.033 --> 00:33:26.100
so it's fine.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.367
Yes.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.400
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Drake, yeah,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.200
the artist, Drake.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.834
He bought the record,
I hope,

00:33:43.834 --> 00:33:46.266
and then he used to work on it because he liked it, I guess.

00:33:46.266 --> 00:33:51.834
So, we didn't hear it until it was finished and then we said,

00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:54.033
"Okay, this is good.

00:33:54.033 --> 00:33:55.133
It's a good one.

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.667
You got some good lyrics
going there, Drake.

00:33:57.667 --> 00:34:02.066
So you might as well put it
out on your official mix tape

00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:05.467
or album maybe or"--
I don't know really what is.

00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:09.433
I think it's like a mixed-tape
on an album.

00:34:09.433 --> 00:34:11.734
He put it out on now,
so, yeah.

00:34:11.734 --> 00:34:13.033
We like that.

00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:15.734
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yup.

00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:19.433
&gt;&gt; Maybe we should change...

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:20.834
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.

00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:24.266
&gt;&gt; PETER: I don't know, maybe we should change the next record.

00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:28.400
JOHN: We tried to make it as close to Peter, Paul and Mary,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.200
since I'm not to marry yet.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.133
I might fix that, yeah.

00:34:36.133 --> 00:34:42.734
So, then it should have been

00:34:42.734 --> 00:34:44.667
Peter, Bjorn, and Johnny,

00:34:44.667 --> 00:34:50.900
Johnny, yeah. Okay.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.433
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Spill out, yeah,

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:55.333
that's, you know--
questions?

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:00.600
Yeah

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.900
&gt;&gt; How did you guys
find each other?

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.066
&gt;&gt; PETER: We all been
playing separately

00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:11.900
since we were super small

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.667
by ourselves and
with other people,

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:16.900
but this band has been going
on for 10 years now,

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.000
so it's our 10th anniversary.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.433
Before that--yeah.

00:35:22.433 --> 00:35:24.834
Thank you.

00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:28.033
Before that, me and Bjorn
had some other projects.

00:35:28.033 --> 00:35:32.767
But we had to get John to make
something happening out of it.

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:36.600
So, yeah, I don't know how
we found each other really,

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.900
but there was no one else
to play with I guess,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.533
so we had to stick
with each other.

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:46.400
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Actually, we put the--this--one of these notes up on--

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.100
in a music shop,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.600
but that didn't
work out that well.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.900
Maybe, you didn't-- you've never had to meet those persons,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.266
John, so but you're lucky.

00:35:55.266 --> 00:35:56.934
&gt;&gt; JOHN: No, I put up--
I also put up,

00:35:56.934 --> 00:36:02.433
but it didn't happen.
Yeah.

00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:06.633
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah, thank you.

00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:08.600
&gt;&gt; PETER: Anything else?

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.734
Yeah.

00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:23.467
This year, 2009?

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:26.734
It's a Swedish album by a guy called Existence Minimum (ph),

00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:28.033
which is very, very good.

00:36:28.033 --> 00:36:29.133
It's hard to explain,

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:32.500
but it means like you don't
have anything to live out of,

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.266
minimum of existence,
I guess.

00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:36.767
So Google that,

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:37.400
it's a great album,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.000
it should be released
over here, I think.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.700
And I like The Pains of
Being Pure at Heart,

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.400
I think it's a good record.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.834
And what else came out
this year?

00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:52.433
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Usually the stuff
came out the year before,

00:36:52.433 --> 00:36:55.133
but the Empire of the Sun maybe
didn't meet last year--

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:56.633
I don't know.

00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:57.800
But it's really good one.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.567
Empire of the Sun.

00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:02.000
Thank you.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.467
&gt;&gt; JOHN: It was last year,
but you should check out

00:37:12.467 --> 00:37:15.367
Jenny Wilson, Wilson--

00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:18.500
Jenny Wilson,
a Swedish,

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.333
good singer--

00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:21.500
singers, woman,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.867
friend, and mother.

00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:27.100
&gt;&gt; PETER: Not John's mother.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: No.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.500
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yet. But some
other great Swedish artist

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.266
that we're going to tour with
in November over here

00:37:34.266 --> 00:37:36.033
at Sura El Spring,

00:37:36.033 --> 00:37:37.967
El Perro Del Mar (ph),

00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:40.233
and she's going to open for
us in November in station.

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:43.033
She's got a really good new
record called Love Is Not Pop,

00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:46.000
which I think is really good.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.033
&gt;&gt; BJORN: So, she'll be coming here, right, San Francisco?

00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:51.033
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah, I think so.

00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:54.133
Come to that show.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.

00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:56.367
&gt;&gt; So check out Swedish rules. &gt;&gt; JOHN: Paper.

00:37:56.367 --> 00:37:58.467
&gt;&gt; PETER: Swedish
medical paper.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.500
There's another Swedish
band called Bear Quartet.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.500
It's coming out
with a new record, so.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:08.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.600
&gt;&gt; PETER: They've
been around since '91.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.200
They got like 15 albums
out or something

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.300
and most of them
are really good.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.300
So, they want to tour here,
they told,

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.333
and have too many kids.

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:25.800
But get their albums
from somewhere.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.433
I don't know how
to get from here,

00:38:27.433 --> 00:38:30.667
but web--the Web, yeah?

00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:31.667
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Internet?

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:33.800
&gt;&gt; PETER: Internet? Yeah.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:47.633
&gt;&gt;Yeah,when you guys tour here in November, you know--?

00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:50.266
&gt;&gt; PETER: Well, you have to eat,

00:38:50.266 --> 00:38:51.200
that's very important.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.133
And I learned something
for the past year that--

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:57.133
and Bjorn has known
for a long time

00:38:57.133 --> 00:38:59.000
that you shouldn't go
and walk around

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.166
and try to look for the best
restaurant if you're hungry,

00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:05.400
just take the closest one.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.767
And if it's shit--
I mean,

00:39:07.767 --> 00:39:12.800
get something in your
stomach and keeps you sane.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.033
So--because we're kind
of picky about food,

00:39:15.033 --> 00:39:17.000
but you can't always pick.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And in San Francisco,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.066
we've been so happy so far.

00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:22.567
I just walk around the block
and it's all pretty good,

00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:23.800
so it's a good city.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.300
And apart from that,
just walking around,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.900
go to museums and...

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.367
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah. But
the problem on tour--

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.900
if you have not been
on a tour--

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.233
I don't know--

00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:35.000
is that you feel like you're
not doing anything like, so,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.900
you're not like really
supposed to get anything to eat

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.233
because you didn't do anything

00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:44.867
because you sat on
a bus or, you know,

00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:46.900
talk to some people or
played on Google or,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.467
you know, I didn't--
we didn't really, you know--

00:39:49.467 --> 00:39:51.533
so hours just pass
by and then you

00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:54.567
kind of forget to eat,
so eat.

00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:57.200
It's good.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.467
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.

00:39:58.467 --> 00:40:00.700
&gt;&gt; Have you guys
tried the Yahoo?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.266
&gt;&gt; PETER: What's that?

00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:03.367
&gt;&gt; Have you guys tried Yahoo?

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.967
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yup?
&gt;&gt; Y-L-T

00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:08.266
&gt;&gt; PETER: Jupe (ph).
&gt;&gt; Yahoo.

00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:12.100
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yahoo?

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.166
&gt;&gt; So Yahoo is a Website that helps you find good restaurant.

00:40:15.166 --> 00:40:16.200
&gt;&gt; PETER: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.033
&gt;&gt; BJORN: No
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.

00:40:17.033 --> 00:40:18.800
&gt;&gt; BJORN: With wherever you are? &gt;&gt; PETER: Nope.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.767
&gt;&gt; Nope?

00:40:19.767 --> 00:40:23.633
&gt;&gt; PETER: Nope,
you should try that.

00:40:23.633 --> 00:40:25.333
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah. Or asking someone, you know.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:27.700
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BJORN: It's good too.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.066
&gt;&gt; PETER: Like, old school way.

00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:36.500
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Respect.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.667
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
album [INDISTINCT]?

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:45.333
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah, there's
some poo in my post mail

00:40:45.333 --> 00:40:50.000
and like old fish and stuff.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.166
So it wasn't very nice,

00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:59.367
but and we sort
that out and--yeah.

00:40:59.367 --> 00:41:01.266
It's important
to do other stuff.

00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:03.066
We all do separate projects.

00:41:03.066 --> 00:41:07.400
And that's also part
of keeping you sane

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.033
when you've been in
a band for so long,

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.266
and you also have
the time to do it.

00:41:11.266 --> 00:41:14.300
Before, we had other jobs
or other things to do,

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.533
so you only had time
for maybe this project.

00:41:16.533 --> 00:41:19.533
But now, there's lots of time.

00:41:19.533 --> 00:41:20.633
People think you're
busy all the time,

00:41:20.633 --> 00:41:22.367
and you are, but it's
your own fault, so...

00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:25.433
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.

00:41:25.433 --> 00:41:26.667
Yep

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:27.900
&gt;&gt; So, what do you think
of your country being

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.900
called a socialist
stronghold (ph).

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.467
&gt;&gt; PETER: Say's who?

00:41:34.467 --> 00:41:35.066
&gt;&gt; BJORN: We got no
problem with that.

00:41:35.066 --> 00:41:38.033
&gt;&gt; PETER: Who says that?
You says that? No?

00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:41.400
&gt;&gt; PETER: Oh, okay.
Yeah.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.433
&gt;&gt; BJORN: I like it.

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:45.000
&gt;&gt; PETER: I don't like
socialists, so...

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.333
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Not being in hell,

00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:50.934
so--but--yeah. Yeah.

00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:56.367
You think nothing
about that, actually.

00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:58.000
We're economists, yeah.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.800
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah?
We are.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.667
You should try it.

00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:08.467
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah.

00:42:08.467 --> 00:42:12.734
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Okay.

00:42:12.734 --> 00:42:14.300
&gt;&gt; BJORN: No.
&gt;&gt; PETER: Questions?

00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.900
&gt;&gt; PETER: Yeah.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.066
&gt;&gt; BJORN: Yeah, it works.

00:43:03.133 --> 00:43:04.934
This song is from an EP

00:43:04.934 --> 00:43:09.900
that we put out in Sweden
on Flown Economy (ph) that's--

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.133
yeah, check that on the net too,

00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:18.100
Flown Economy (ph) that we put it out on the Falling Out album,

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.300
extra material not here
maybe though.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.900
Is it out here?

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.667
Well, in Europe,
