AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "MADAM
PRESIDENT," NICOLLE WALLACE.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.887 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A NOVEL.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.021 align:start position:0% line:85%
MADAM PRESIDENT.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.290 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THE WAY YOU SAY THAT.

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.892 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOOD.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS TIME MAGAZINE THING I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT FIRST

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.296 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I'LL JUST QUOTE IT AGAIN.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
DR. JULIE --
[LAUGHING]

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:37.103 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO, SHE SAID BIOLOGICALLY
SPEAKING POST MENOPAUSAL WOMAN

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.205 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE IDEAL CANDIDATES FOR
LEADERSHIP.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:43.543 line:91%
THEY'RE PRIMED TO HANDLE STRESS
WELL. AND THERE IS OF COURSE NO

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:48.281 line:91%
MORE STRESSFUL JOB THAN THE
PRESIDENCY. IS THERE TRUTH IN

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT? I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYONE
IS POST MENOPAUSAL.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.687 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M PROUDLY POST MENOPAUSAL.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.855 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:59.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HERE IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT
THAT.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE STATEMENT IS NOT IN ITSELF
TRUE.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:06.766 line:91%
THE STATEMENT WOULD BE FALSE IF
SHE ADDED PREMENOPAUSAL WOMAN

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.434 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO BE
PRESIDENT. I THINK AS YOU GET 

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.870 align:start position:0% line:91%
OLDER YOU ARE MORE EQUIPPED TO
HANDLE STRESS BUT

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:14.474 line:91%
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME
IS LIKE SAYING IF WE HAVE A MALE

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:20.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESIDENT HE HAS TO BE A EUNICH
OR A CASTRATI.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.617 line:91%
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU CAN'T
HAVE A MAN WITH A SEX DRIVE BE

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.751 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRESIDENT.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:33.493 line:91%
YOU CAN'T HAVE A WOMAN WHO IS
MENSTRUATING BE PRESIDENT.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S STUPID
&gt;&gt; I AGREE.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:40.533 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU HAD A GUEST WITH
THE BOOK "WHEN THE BALLS DROP."

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:46.772 line:91%
I THINK TIME MAGAZINE OWES AS
MANY COLUMN INCHES TO SAY WHERE

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:47.206 align:start position:0% line:85%
MEN ARE IN THE PROCESS.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.706 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S A THING.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.641 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:49.809 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY ACHE, THEY DROP.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:54.280 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT 
BRAD GARRETT'S BALLS?

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.816 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK --
&gt;&gt; IT'S IN THE BOOK.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:02.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NICOLLE IF THEY HAVE PROSTATE
PROBLEMS THEY PEE NONSTOP.

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.290 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH MY GOD.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:08.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU STARE DOWN
VLADIMIR IF YOU HAVE TO PEE.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.896 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.164 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.065 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD POINT.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:19.438 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF MENOPAUSAL WOMEN ARE ON
THE TABLE SO ARE BALL ACHES.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.407 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.711 line:91%
IF A MAN IS 35 OR 40 HE MAYBE
JERKING OFTEN 10 TIMES A DAY.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:26.746 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:32.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEN WE CAN ONLY HAVE EUNICHS
RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:33.185 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:37.890 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ISN'T CASTRATI LIKE AN
ITALIAN CAR?

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
I ACTUALLY THINK THERE IS SOME
TRUTH TO IT.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:45.064 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I THINK THAT POST MENOPAUSAL
WOMAN ARE IDEAL CANDIDATES.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:49.835 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK THAT PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN
ARE GREAT CANDIDATES.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:54.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK DURING MENOPAUSAL ARE
GREAT CANDIDATES.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:57.743 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL OF THE PAUSALS ARE GOOD
CANDIDATES.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:00.413 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ALL THE OF THE PAUSALS.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CAN I --
&gt;&gt; GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.553 line:91%
&gt;&gt; HERE IS THE THING WHEN I WAS
PREMENOPAUSAL AND HAD A PERIOD

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:13.292 line:91%
ONCE A MONTH, I RAN A CAREER, I
BROUGHT UP CHILDREN, I RAN A

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOUSEHOLD.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:17.463 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DID ALL OF THESE THINGS PLUS
BLEEDING EVERY MONTH.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.865 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY DO THAT
HAVING MY PERIOD --

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.934 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NICOLLE, YOU HAVE A FULL-TIME
JOB.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:26.606 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES I WAS IN THE WHITE
HOUSE AND EVERY 28 DAYS I BLED

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE COUNTRY WENT ON.
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:31.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH WOMEN
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOMEN AS NATIONAL SECURITY
ADVISORS.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:37.850 align:start position:0% line:91%
LISTEN THIS IS -- THIS IS YOUR
TOPIC NOT OURS.

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:40.853 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TELL IS ABOUT THE BLEEDING
EVERY 28 DAYS.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, I'M BLEEDING RIGHT
NOW.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
[BEEP]
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS --

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; YES YOU'RE SPEAKING.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:52.465 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M TALKING AND THINGS ARE
OKAY.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.568 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT VICTORIAN WOMAN
HAVING FAINTING SPELLS

00:03:55.601 --> 00:04:01.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW --
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:05.711 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ON THE FAINTING COUCH,
ARRRGGGH!

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.747 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON PERIOD CAN'T TALK.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETHING'S WRONG! MORE
CHOCOLATE AND SALTED NUTS!

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.056 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; TO ME -- IT'S LIKE WE'RE

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTING LIKE WOMEN ARE A CREATURE
WE HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.827 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THIS BIOLOGY WE'RE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH?

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:30.303 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN
THE AUDIENCE ARE POTENTIALLY

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.404 align:start position:0% line:85%
BLEEDING RIGHT NOW?

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:36.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINGS ARE NOT GOING -- WE'RE
NOT BURNING DOWN STUFF.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE CAN STILL TALK.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.214 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE SUBJECT -- I FIND
IT OFFENSIVE.

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:42.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DO.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOW SHOULD HILLARY HANDLE
IT?

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.019 line:85%
&gt;&gt; SHE SHOULDN'T PAY ATTENTION.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:54.994 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; REAGAN HANDLED ALL THIS STUFF
WITH JOKES.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:59.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT HIS AGE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAD

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALZHEIMERS
&gt;&gt; NO BUT HE SLAMMED MONDALE.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:09.375 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I THOUGHT HILLARY COULD SAY
"HOPE AND GONE THROUGH THE

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.743 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHANGE."
&gt;&gt; THEY LIKE IT.

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:14.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; OR HOW ABOUT IF HOLLY WAS THE

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.048 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.718 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M BLEEDING RIGHT NOW, WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO DO?

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IGNORE IT.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:20.619 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IGNORE IT.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.855 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE IT ENERGY.

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:24.990 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IT'S A RIDICULOUS TOPIC.

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:28.260 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE VOTERS WILL MAKE THEIR
OWN CORRECTIONS.

00:05:28.293 --> 00:05:30.930 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY HAVE A WAY TO SIFT THROUGH
THIS.

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:39.405 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PEOPLE DETERMINING THE
OUTCOME OF PRESIDENTIAL

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECTIONS ARE WOMEN.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:44.744 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF
SWING VOTERS AND INDEPENDENTS.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:48.314 line:91%
THAT'S WHO THE CANDIDATES ARE
SPEAKING TO IN THE END, IN THE

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:49.281 size:88% position:44% line:85%
CLOSING DAYS OF ANY ELECTION

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:50.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO THEY'RE IMPORTANT.

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.384 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES, THEY ARE.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:56.589 line:91%
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN OTHER
WOMEN THROW SHADE ON WOMEN

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.256 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOMETIMES.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.125 line:85%
I WANT TO SHOW THIS CEO CLIP.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS ON
MORNING JOE.

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:04.597 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I AM A STRONG WOMEN.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.700 align:start position:0% line:91%
I RUN MY OWN COMPANY LIKE YOU
SAID.

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:12.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS
RUNNING THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.941 align:start position:0% line:91%
WORLD AND BEING COMMANDER IN
CHIEF AND HEAD OF STATE.

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:17.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.145 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO ME SHOULD BE A MAN.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.679 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT A FEMALE.

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:23.716 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.818 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBVIOUSLY --
&gt;&gt; WAS SHE TRANSGENDER.

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.619 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.954 line:85%
DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD, SUSIE

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:29.622 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; JUST ASKING.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:32.057 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY SHE'S CRAY.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SHE SAYS --
&gt;&gt; ARE WOMEN, WOMENS BIGGEST

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:36.762 align:start position:0% line:85%
OBSTACLES?

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.731 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN BE.

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:43.702 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE SAID IN HER FACEBOOK POST IF
A WOMAN WON SHE WOULD MOVE TO

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:44.603 align:start position:0% line:85%
CANADA.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF A WOMAN WON SHE WOULD MOVE
TO CANADA?

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:48.373 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:51.877 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, HILLARY WE NEED YOU
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.979 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THOSE POOR CANADIANS.

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:59.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS THREATEN TO MOVE TO
CANADA TOO FOR REPUBLICANS

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:03.722 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE TO HOLD ANYONE THIS

&gt;&gt; THIS MENSTRUAL CYCLE?

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:06.091 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:10.796 align:start position:0% line:91%
CANADIANS. THEY'RE LOVELY
