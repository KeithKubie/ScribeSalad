00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.370
So guys I saw a pretty cool idea floating around the internet.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
And that was to take plastic bottles and cut them out and use them [for] spoons bowls and funnels.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.159
Which is a really cool idea except the spoons that I saw being made looked very very weak.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.440
So I thought today we would try the idea, see what modifications we can make,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.440
and share those ideas with you.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.920
Now, I don't usually drink soda, but when I do I drink root beer.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.550
But it's not really going to matter which bottle you use as long as it's got these little knobby things on the end

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.360
You can see there are five little knobby crowns on the bottom

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.000
and the coke bottle and the standard Soda bottle are a little bit different,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.560
but that's not going to make much of a difference by the time we're done with it.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.240
Now, there are a couple of different ways that you could approach this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100
if you want to make a spoon you're gonna have to use the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
Entire length of the bottle including one of these knobby things and I'll show you how to do that in a second

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.119
But instead let's start off with something simple. Let's start off by making a bowl now check this out

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
If you look really closely near the bottom here you [can] actually see there's already a line drawn for you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.369
So if you take something like a knife or a pair of scissors and just cut along that line

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.759
It instantly transformed your soda bottle into a nice Makeshift Bowl

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.039
Let's move on to making the spoons next

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.680
These little nubs at the bottom of the soda bottle are gonna make the actual spoon,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.260
the rest of its going to form the handle.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.150
And this is how it's going to work. This is a spoon

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.939
I made it from a previous bottle and I'm just using it as a guide here

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.269
So it all starts by sketching out a spoon pattern on the bottle you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.089
Don't want to go all the way to the bottom you want to cut about halfway up

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.520
and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.619
Just make it look as close to a spoon shape as you can and then go ahead and cut it out with a pair of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.110
scissors

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.169
when you've got all of your spoons drawn go ahead and cut the top of the bottle off and you can reuse this as a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.449
Funnel so it's not actually garbage it can be useful you can use this for filling your car up with gasoline

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.779
Transferring water back into a tank. It's even got a screw on and screw off

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.229
Lid so if you need to you can hold material in here until you need to let it out

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.699
Now that we've got the top cut off we can very easily access our stencil lines here

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
So let's go ahead and cut them out one by one

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.019
We ended up with five different spoons that look pretty cool

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
There's still a little bit rough so you might just want [to] go around and clean up the edges one more time

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.760
with a pair of scissors, and they will get you by it a pinch however there is a problem with them now these spoons

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.800
Do look pretty cool and it's a great idea however

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.389
They're extremely flimsy you guys you can't pick anything up with this spoon you put in your cereal

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.080
And it's just going to flop over and you can't pick anything up, but there is a simple little trick

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.630
You can do to actually make it quite versatile and quite functional

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.369
put your finger right into the center [of] the handle and press upward and tell the two sides touch and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.520
continue creasing it all the way down to the spoon part what's going to happen is this will add a lot of rigidity and a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.600
Lot of strength now. I around at this end of my handle as well, just for decoration

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.059
I think it looks cool and ends up looking rather decorative just by making that very simple fold right down the middle

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.280
It's added quite a bit of tensile strength you can see if I hold it now. It doesn't move anywhere, so considering

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.350
This is just a little plastic spoon hacked out of a bottle

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.040
[I] think it's going to do the job quite well

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.110
So just [like] that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.589
We've turned a couple of soda bottles into a really cool Little Bowl and five

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.830
Makeshift spoons that look really awesome, and actually work, really

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.580
Well as well now you could use these for cereal you can use them for oatmeal

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.949
You could use them for pretty much anything even mashed potatoes

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.970
They're very robust very durable and the cool thing is they don't cost anything

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.019
There are actually a ton of uses for plastic bottles. I've seen a lot of ideas floating out there

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.000
this is the one that I wanted to try another one that I thought was cool is just taking your water bottle cutting out a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.220
Few sections and folding the top over the bottom and just like that you have yourself a little makeshift camp mug.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.649
So we got our bowls our spoons and our mugs

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.650
What else do you need. So thanks so much for joining me for this experiment guys?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.980
I've enjoyed hanging out with you, and I'll be looking for you the next video. Talk to you then

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.760
That might be the thumbnail right there that looks wicked awesome
