00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.290
 Let us be given a circle and 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.280
 its diameter. 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.080
 Let me draw my best diameter. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.760
 This is fairly good. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.710
 Here is the diameter of the circle. 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.110
 It's a diameter. 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.290
 Let's have a triangle for which the diameter is one side, 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.040
 and the tip of the corner opposite to it 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.960
 lies somewhere in the circle. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.200
 Let's say the angle against this diameter 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.260
 lies on this circle. 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.020
 Therefore the triangle looks like this. 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 The triangle looks like this. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.170
 What I will show you in this video is that 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.280
 this triangle will be a rectangular triangle. 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.040
 The angle of 90 degrees will be the angle that is 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.550
 opposed to this diameter. 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.340
 I do not want to name it yet because it would 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.140
 the pleasure of proof has failed. 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 Now let's see what we can do to show that. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.910
 In our toolkit we have the idea of ​​an entered angle, 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.970
 and its connection to the center angle, which 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.830
 cuts the same arc. 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.720
 Let's look at this. 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.950
 Let's say this is an entry corner here. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.760
 Let us denote it with the (theta). 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.070
 Now let's say this is the center of 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.370
 my circle here. 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.190
 Then this angle would be a central angle here. 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.620
 Let me draw another corner here, 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.460
 another section here. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.130
 This is a central corner here. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.190
 This is a radius. 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070
 It's the same radius - actually that 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.230
 distance is the same. 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.480
 But we learned in a previous video that ... 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.420
 see this inscribed corner, he cuts that arc up here. 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.850
 The central corner, which cuts the same arc, 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.400
 is twice that angle. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.040
 We have proven it in a previous video. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.150
 So it will be 2h. 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.260
 This is the central angle that cuts the same arc. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.120
 Now this triangle here, here, 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.620
 is an isosceles triangle. 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.570
 I can rotate it and draw it like that. 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.163
 If I turned it, it would look like this and then 

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:25.000
 the green side will be down here. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.980
 Both these countries are of length r. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.160
 This tip angle is 2 theta. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.530
 All I did was turn it around 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.060
 it looks like this. 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.050
 This country is here. 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.660
 Once its two sides are equal, it is an isosceles triangle, therefore 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.560
 the angles at the base must be equal. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 These angles should be the same, or if I had to draw them up here, 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.150
 this and this should be exactly the same angles at the base. 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
 Now let me see, I already used theta, maybe 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.800
 I will use x for these angles. 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.230
 Therefore, this should be x, and that should be x. 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.000
 How short will it be? 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.120
 x plus x plus 20 should be 180 degrees. 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.970
 They are all in a triangle. 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.770
 Let me write it down. 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.010
 We have x + x + 2θ = 180 degrees, 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 or we have 2x + 2θ = 180 degrees, 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.970
 or we get 2x = 180 - 20. 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.980
 We divide the two sides of 2 and get x = 90 - θ. 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.590
 So x = 90 - θ. 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.890
 Now let's see what else we can do about it. 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.130
 We can look at this triangle here. 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.160
 This triangle, this country here, also has this distance 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.930
 this here is also the radius of the circle. 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.080
 That distance we have already noted, 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.060
 is the radius of the circle. 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.870
 Once again, this is also an isosceles triangle. 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.770
 These two sides are equal, so these two corners in the base 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.500
 must be equal. 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.160
 If this is theta, it will also be 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.895
 equal to theta. 

00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.770
 And in fact we use this information to 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.100
 we show that the first result for the entered corners and 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.340
 the relationship between them and the central corners they cut 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.980
 the same arc. 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.670
 So if this is theta, it's the theta because it is 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.120
 isosceles triangle. 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.150
 So how much is this entire angle here? 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.850
 Will be θ + (90 - θ). 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.650
 This angle will be here 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.690
 θ + 90 - θ. 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.270
 Well, the teeth are getting shorter. 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.690
 So whatever, while one side of my triangle is 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.070
 diameter and then the tip of the opposite corner, 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.620
 which is opposed to that country, 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.780
 lies on the circle, then this angle will be here 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.750
 right angle and it will be a rectangular triangle. 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.640
 So if I draw something random, like this ... 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.010
 if it just takes a point here, so, and 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.750
 I draw it right, it's a right angle. 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.220
 If I draw something like this and come out that way, 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.240
 this is a right angle. 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.860
 For each of these I can do exactly the same proof. 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.090
 And in fact, the way I drew it here I kept it 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.810
 basically so that it can be applied to each of these triangles.
