NARRATOR: When you look at
this picture, what do you see?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.427
A disoriented seahorse, a
ghost woman, a boomerang.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:14.597
This is actually Massachusetts'
7th Congressional District.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.683
And these are some
other creatures--

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.767
I mean districts.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.728
[music playing]

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.563
Congressional districts
are geographic voting

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.482
areas represented by a
single member of Congress.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.526

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.946
Gerrymandering happens when
a political party in charge

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.865
carefully slices up
voting districts,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.200
so that the representatives
they want to win-- win.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.827
[cheers]

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.370
They do this by
drawing the districts

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.707
around the populations most
likely to support them,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.918
or splitting up populations
less likely to support them,

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:47.756
making this outline
of a stegosaurus.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.383
The practice is named for
Massachusetts' politician

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.760
and founding father,
you've likely

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.386
never heard of, Elbridge Gerry.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.387
[music - "yankee doodle"]

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.639
Yes, it's pronounced GAR-ee.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.601
Elected to the Continental
Congress in 1775,

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.811
Gerry signed the
Declaration of Independence.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.689
He was also very involved
in shaping the Constitution,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.274
but he didn't sign that.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:09.194
Because as an anti-federalist,
he opposed a stronger

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.071
federal government, believing
the Constitution got

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.990
the balance of power all wrong.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.450
Gerry thought the
federal government

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.076
had way too much of it.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.622
Gerry eventually joined the
Democratic Republican Party.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.332
Yes, that was a real thing.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.919
In 1810, at age 65,
Gerry was elected

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.378
Governor of Massachusetts.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:30.006
Around this time, the
United States was edging

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.050
toward war with Great Britain.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.928
Concerned that Federalist
might betray the country,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.472
Gerry's party decided
to find ways to replace

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.724
every possible
Federalist in office

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.310
with a Democratic Republican.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.854
This included changing
Massachusetts' Senate districts

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.607
from reflecting county
lines to ones benefiting

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.734
the Democratic Republicans.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.445
In the grand tradition
of political satire,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.990
an Illustrator drew a picture
of one of Gerry's new districts,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.785
depicting it as a
monster that supposedly

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:03.206
looked like a salamander--
no, a gerrymander.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.001
The drawing ran in the Boston
Gazette on March 26, 1812.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.878
From that year
onward, Elbridge Gerry

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.089
would be known, not for
signing the Declaration

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.676
of Independence, or helping
to frame the Constitution,

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:18.012
or for being the fifth Vice
President of the United States.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.806
Yeah, he did that too.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.143
Gerry would instead be known for
the controversial redistricting

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.062
practice that bears his
name, even though we now

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.021
pronounce it, gerrymandering.

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.065
