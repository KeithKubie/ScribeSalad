00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.870
PROFESSOR: So welcome back.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.710
Today, we're going to look
at the modular synthesizer.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.670
And our area of focus
right now is still

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.660
looking at musical interfaces.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.930
A lot of people present
the modular synthesizer

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.080
in the context of basic
synthesis techniques

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.004
and the development of
musical instruments.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.670
I think it's very
useful for us to think

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.680
of the modular synthesizer as
a type of musical interface,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.630
and particularly the
interface available

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.384
through the creative patching
and combination of modules.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.800
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.424
going to look at a little bit of
the history of the development

00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:59.100
of modular synthesizers,
starting with the giant RCA

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.309
synth, and then
moving on to the Moog.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.850
We're going to spend a little
time with the basic Moog design

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120
and look at some of the
basic synthesis techniques.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.495
We're going to do
that by looking

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:11.750
at the emulation of
virtual Moog that we

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.900
have available through
Arturia's very nice virtual Moog

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.210
instrument plug-in, which
is going to give us a way

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.760
to hear some of the sounds
and see some of the approaches

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.670
to patching this instrument.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.180
And then next time we meet in
workshop mode next Tuesday,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.750
we're going to build some
similar designs in PD

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.580
using the Martingale
Library and explore

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.649
some of these
approaches, as well.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.190
We're going to listen to some
music and then if we get to it,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.120
talk about some
semi-modular synths.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.140
And see the design go from
fully modular synthesizers

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.770
to semi-modular and
non-modular synthesizers, which

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.530
is a valuable trajectory to see.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.730
So coming up on the horizon, we
have a brief quiz on Thursday.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.030
Keep that in mind.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.200
Your music technology
case studies--

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.720
the draft is due on Tuesday.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.260
If you have any questions about
this as you approach this,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.750
feel free to drop me
an email or the like.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180
And that's it for now.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.238
Any questions?

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:14.520
OK.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.510
So now with the
modular synthesizer,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.650
we see numerous things
start to come together.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.490
We saw in the early studios
used by Varese, by Stockhausen,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.890
and others, this cobbling
together of various components

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.970
and interconnecting them
into sound-producing devices.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.690
We see with the
modular synthesizer

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.250
these components
start to solidify

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.770
into a single common
collection of entities.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.480
With these semi-modular
designs, we

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.540
see this solidification
happen even more.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.970
And the designs solidify
into a single common thing.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.410
There wasn't anything shockingly
new about the technologies used

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.000
in the modular synthesizer.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.700
Again, they were
technologies that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.350
had been around
for 10 or 20 years.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.580
But really, the
interface, and the design,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.160
and the integration of these
components, in my view,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.830
was the really important thing.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.720
Voltage control-- the ability
to interconnect and control

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.290
these devices with
voltages-- was really

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.740
the key technology that made
this synthesizer more flexible,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.550
more powerful, and more
creative for the operator.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.660
Now we start with the RCA
synthesizer, which isn't really

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.800
a modular synthesizer.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.840
To my knowledge, this device
had a fairly fixed signal path.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.065
So it wasn't really modular.

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.280
It had components.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.760
But you couldn't
interconnect the components

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.660
with patch cords.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.110
You couldn't radically
change the type of sounds

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.090
that it made.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.020
Now this synthesizer came
in two different forms.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.640
There was the first one, which
later became known as the Mark

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.940
I and then the Mark II,
the later version of this.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.140
This synthesizer was the result
of quite a bit of research

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.270
by Olson and Belar,
who were working

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.360
at RCA for a number of years.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520
The Holmes text nicely
describes their early research

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.314
with music synthesis
technologies.

00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:17.730
Does anybody recall
what they were

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.680
trying to do in the
beginning-- Olson and Belar.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.320
Their first attempt
at synthesis was

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.550
directed towards this
certain activity.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.580
Anybody recall?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.580
They were trying to synthesize
Steven Walter pop tunes-- pop

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.166
melodies-- basic melodies,
using essentially Markov chains.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.040
And they were trying to
create a machine that

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.370
could compose simple melodies
by analyzing basic tunes

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.410
and then re-synthesizing them.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.500
In that process, they
developed some technologies

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.660
for creating
oscillators and filters.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.450
And that led to their
first RCA synthesizer.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:04.320
So this device used essentially
tuning-fork-based oscillators.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.010
So their basic oscillator
was a tuning fork

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.590
that was set in motion and
picked up electromagnetically.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.810
And that signal was then divided
to shift into different octaves

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.250
and transformed into a square
wave to create a rich tone.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.590
And then they filtered
that tone to create

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.360
the variety of timbres that
the instrument could make.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.640
The device featured
a number of filters,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.250
as well-- high- and low-pass
filters and this really kind

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.110
of bizarre resonator
chain, which

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.620
is an interesting
selective filter.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.280
This image here is from
their first publication

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.900
on the synthesizer from 1955.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.600
And it's also reproduced
in the Holmes book.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.700
We can see the basic way
that the synthesizer worked.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.960
Information was encoded on
something kind of like a piano

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.610
roll, but just storing
control information

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.970
in a binary representation.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.790
Here, rather than
using a vacuum,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.020
brushes are used to pick up
when an opening in the hole

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.140
was to trigger a circuit.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.320
The frequency source
here is those oscillators

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.960
controlled by tuning forks.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.400
And that signal is then
split by the octiver.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.110
And then it has the
frequency glider,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.100
which allows the transition
between pitches, the growth,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.620
and decay, which is a fancy
name for an envelope generator.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.970
Or not fancy, I guess--
historic-- various high-pass,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.030
low-pass filters,
volume control,

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.730
low-frequency
modulator, probably

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.990
for adding vibrato or other
slow changes to the sound.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.340
Resonator change--
that's that unique filter

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.540
I was talking about--
timbre control, probably

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.530
additional filters.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.840
Or I'm not exactly sure what
that last component did.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.750
But that's something to look at.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.670
And then finally, all going
to a nice record cutter,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.280
which allowed you
to record the sound.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.410
So there were two
nearly identical voices

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.920
that could be used and
controlled by this paper roll.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.070
So partly out of Olson and
Belar's earlier research

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.900
in synthesizing pop tunes,
they approached a synthesizer

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.310
as a device that needed to be
controlled, not by a keyboard,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.120
not by some other
type of interface,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.430
but by a type of notation.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.217
And their notation was this
punched-hole paper record,

00:07:41.217 --> 00:07:43.550
which again, is kind of like
a piano roll but different.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.780
Because rather than a one-to-one
relationship with parameters

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.180
and their values,
these are essentially

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:56.750
three- and four-bit codes that
determine frequency, octave,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.470
timbre, the envelope growth
and decay, and volume.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.140
So frequency is determined by
these four on-and-off switches,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.430
which give us 16
possible values.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.700
But they only used 12.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.050
Octave could be selected.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:18.170
Similarly here, timbre, the
envelope, volume, et cetera.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.120
This roll right there shows
us the necessary information

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.979
to encode these six pitches.

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.020
So you can imagine working
with this device would

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.610
be a little tedious.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.714
But it offered explicit,
complete control.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.380
This nice diagram, also
from that original article,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.590
shows us a massive
simplification of the device,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.180
going from reading the
roll, to the two synthesizer

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.130
channels, mixer, amplifier, and
then a direct-to-disk cutting

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.100
lathe.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.570
Some notable thing
about this-- it

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.350
was really the first
attempt to parameterize

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.290
musical information in a very
rigorous and complete way.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.440
We saw with the player
piano an earlier attempt

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.830
at parameterization.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.570
But here, we're starting
to parameterize timbre,

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.520
amplitude envelopes, and
volume and level controls

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.751
at a greater degree than we
had with the player piano.

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.250
Also important about
this instrument

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.450
is it was not designed
for performance.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.490
It was really designed
as a machine where

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.160
you composed in
advance and played back

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.800
what you had notated.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.130
That was the Mark
I. The Mark II was

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.610
housed at Princeton University.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.130
And that started a relationship
with Columbia and Princeton

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.172
University, which led to
Columbia and Princeton

00:09:38.172 --> 00:09:40.130
getting a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.240
to buy the second version of
this synth-- the RCA Mark II.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.620
This synth was very
similar to the Mark I,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.350
except for it added a
white-noise generator, which

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.970
was useful for creating a
variety of noisier percussive

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.530
sounds.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.440
It had four voices
instead of two.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.750
It had a microphone input.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.980
And it had some variable
frequency oscillators.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.680
Similar to the RCA Mark I, it
was a room-sized giant beast

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.450
of a synthesizer.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.890
In this picture, we can
see the disk cutters here.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.360
We can see, also, some tape.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.450
Eventually, they did
add tape machines.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:24.050
And we can see the
paper readers there.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.300
Notice that we don't see,
really, a patch bay or patch

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.010
cords.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.300
This was a modular synthesizer
in that had modules.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.250
But it wasn't freely
interconnectable in the way

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:42.310
that we later find with our
Moog and Buchla synthesizers.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:48.130
Now I sent you guys the link
to this demo recording, which

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.610
has this great narrator
helping us along the way.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.990
This demo record
was made in 1955.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.080
I believe it was a
recording of the Mark II.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.910
The reason why is because
in this demonstration,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.170
they use a filtered white noise.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.330
And I think this is a
very nice example where

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.690
they tried to synthesize the
sound of a complete dance band.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.850
So they had four voices.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.290
So they used some of the
voices for bass, percussion,

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.566
and melody.

00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:16.940
Let's listen to
a little of this.

[HIGH-PITCHED SYNTHESIZER BEEPS]

00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:19.874
PROFESSOR: That's
the high-hat sound.

[LOW-PITCHED SYNTHESIZER BEEPS]

00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:23.429
PROFESSOR: And that's the bass.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.544
PROFESSOR: And here's
everything altogether.

00:11:27.544 --> 00:11:28.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.110
-We can also
synthesize a part where

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.832
each tone has a rapid growth
and slow decay, like this.

00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:35.665
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.460
PROFESSOR: Let's go
back to that dance band.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:37.715
[LOW-PITCHED SYNTHESIZER BEEPS]

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:38.470
PROFESSOR: Come on.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.823
[SYNTHESIZED MUSIC]

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:39.781
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.700
Notice the white noise being
used for the snare-like sound

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.380
there.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.905
So as this demo record shows,
and as the history of Olson

00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:01.694
and Belar's work
shows, they were

00:12:01.694 --> 00:12:03.360
very interested in
using the synthesizer

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.230
to generate pop music,
which is interesting.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.050
Because what it became used
for was not popular music,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.550
but music of composers
like Milton Babbitt, Mario

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.730
Davidovsky, and other
composers working

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.020
at the Columbia-Princeton
studios.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.340
One of our listenings for today
was "Philomel," Babbitt's 1964

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.550
composition that used
the RCA synthesizer.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.210
Let's listen to a
little bit of this

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.370
to remind you guys
what this sounds like.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.290
[MUSIC -- MILTON BABBITT,
 "PHILOMEL"]

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.570
PROFESSOR: So
there's three sources

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.820
of sound in this composition.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.170
What are they-- three
sources of sound?

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.365
AUDIENCE: There's the voice.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:43.740
PROFESSOR: Right,
the live voice.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.156
AUDIENCE: There's
the synthesizer.

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:46.470
Not sure what the third was.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.680
PROFESSOR: Anybody
notice or recall?

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.950
There's also pre-recorded voice.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.450
So there's some tape-recorded
and processed voice sounds

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.460
in here, which are used to
create some very nice distance

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.660
echo and some
depth to the voice.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.940
And actually in my view, one
of the most interesting things

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.380
about this piece is
how the tape part

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.530
blends with the synthesis
and acts as an intermediary.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.895
Thoughts about this piece?

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.210
AUDIENCE: It's very sporadic.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.595
PROFESSOR: Sporadic-- what
do you mean, sporadic?

00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:22.269
AUDIENCE: Very jagged.

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.810
I don't know.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.280
It's not really-- they
follow a certain pattern.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.620
But there's not a ton of tune.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's this
jagged, jerky, gestural shape

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.890
to a lot of the musical parts.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.170
And that's clear in the voice
and also in the synthesizer

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.192
parts.

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:42.900
AUDIENCE: As the piece
goes on, the voice

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.513
smooths out a
little bit, though,

00:14:44.513 --> 00:14:45.513
if I remember correctly.

00:14:45.513 --> 00:14:48.575
And then the synthesizer's still
doing the jagged [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:52.455
So it has the background
interjections, I guess.

00:14:52.455 --> 00:14:53.836
It seems like longer stretches.

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:54.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.418
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's
jump to the end in here.

00:14:56.418 --> 00:14:58.855
[MUSIC -- MILTON BABBITT,
 "PHILOMEL"]

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.980
PROFESSOR: Now Babbitt was
using a method of organization

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.890
that we have talked
about previously.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.796
What was that method
of organization?

00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.200
AUDIENCE: Serialism.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.430
PROFESSOR: Serialism, or
the 12-tone technique.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.200
Did the RCA synthesizer
provide facilities

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.570
for 12-tone composers?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.380
Was it well suited for that?

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.290
I mean, Olson and Belar wanted
to use it to do popular music.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.580
AUDIENCE: You had absolute
control over everything, right?

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.710
So it was perfect.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.650
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.660
All your parameters
were fixed on the roll.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.240
So you could compose very
carefully crafted lines

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.660
in a very organized way.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.430
And that's very much
what we hear here.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.290
It's kind of, I think, ironic
in that Olson and Belar imagined

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.140
this instrument
originally to create

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.820
an endless variety
of pop tunes to sell

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.070
in the commercial market.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.590
And of course, it
ended up being used

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.760
to create some very esoteric,
non-commercial music

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.270
in the end.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.810
And that's one of
our many examples

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:20.690
of unintended consequences
of certain technologies.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.159
Other comments or
reflections on this piece?

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:24.534
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was really

00:16:24.534 --> 00:16:27.260
cool to use the
operatic voice with it,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.645
as opposed to other
singing styles.

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:33.430
Because in conjunction
with the synthesizer,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.340
the strange timbre
of operatic singing

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.392
became this thing that
was more like a thing

00:16:40.392 --> 00:16:44.550
to listen to than typically
what operatic singing is about.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.539
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.580
For me, the really striking
thing is the vibrato.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.121
Because the vibrato
is really, really

00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.049
wide-- contrast between that
wide vibrato and the more flat

00:16:53.049 --> 00:16:54.840
tones we're getting
out of the synthesizer.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.800
Are you hearing
something else, as well?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.425
AUDIENCE: No, that's
the sort of thing.

00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:00.640
But then also in the
tape-modulated parts.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.480
Because he speeds her
up and slows her down.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.480
And so this thing happens
with the vibrato right

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.239
where they like.

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:07.535
It was very tight, or
even looser and lower.

00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:08.910
And there's this
really, I think,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.300
great interplay between that
and the synthesized sounds.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I agree.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:13.950
Yep.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the sound I heard

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.898
reminded me a lot
of science fiction.

00:17:17.898 --> 00:17:19.022
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh. [LAUGHS]

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:21.725
AUDIENCE: There seems
to be a common thread

00:17:21.725 --> 00:17:22.953
about that recording.

00:17:22.953 --> 00:17:23.619
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.310
Well, a lot of the early
sounds of early synthesizers

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.820
were used in science fiction and
film, since Forbidden Planet,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.990
and even before that
with the theremin.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.610
The connection has been
there for some time.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.490
We don't hear a lot of
variety of timbres and colors

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.600
with the synthesizer.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.280
A lot of it is sinusoidal
or filtered waveforms.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.800
So there's not a huge variety
of sounds out of the synth.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.620
But it didn't provide a
tremendous amount of control,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.630
as we can tell by looking
at the control information

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.076
available on the tape.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.330
AUDIENCE: Do you know
anything about how

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.690
it was serialed, whether he
used all of his parameters

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.680
in the serial way?

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.260
I was trying to parse it
out, and I had no idea.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.117
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:10.117 --> 00:18:11.700
I mean, it's worth
looking at further.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.740
I suspect, given
Babbitt's inclinations,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.960
that both pitch and the other
parameters were serialized.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.130
So it's very likely
he had the opportunity

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.160
to serialize envelopes
and serialize

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.777
the timbre controls
of the synth.

00:18:26.777 --> 00:18:28.610
So I think it's very
likely that he probably

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.750
did, which is similar to an
approach taken by Stockhausen,

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.900
who was rigorously exploring
some of these things.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.440
But with the RCA synthesizer,
this became very notatable

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.294
in a way that wasn't
possible before.

00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:42.460
Do you have another comment?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.380
OK.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.410
So two innovators followed
the RCA synthesizer

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:54.760
with devices that were
more flexible than the RCA

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.550
synthesizer.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.420
They were more flexible in
that they allowed the operator

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.520
to reconnect the
modules in various ways.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.580
Rather than that fixed sequence
of oscillator, filter, et

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.060
cetera, these devices
allowed the operator

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.640
to interconnect them in a
variety of different ways

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.660
and also allowed the
operator to control them

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.540
in a variety of different
ways, not with punched paper

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.020
but with various types
of input devices.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.700
Buchla generally gets credit
for coming a little bit

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.570
before Moog.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:36.730
His devices were very diverse
and often custom-designed

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.860
for particular people,
particular studios.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.480
His interest as a
composer himself

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.820
was in creating diverse
and unique instruments,

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.990
not really in creating
a commercial market

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.520
for the synthesizer.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.550
So he not only explored a wide
variety of different modules

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.300
that use noise and
randomness in different ways,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.570
but also various
types of input devices

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.970
other than the keyboard.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.340
And our readings for today
emphasize the point about how

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.280
Buchla initially didn't want
a keyboard control for his

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.172
instrument, and
Moog embraced that,

00:20:09.172 --> 00:20:11.380
which is an issue we'll talk
about when we talk about

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.070
the [? Pinchen-Trocho ?]
reading.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.750
In 1965, he releases
the Buchla Box

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.670
without a keyboard-- a
very popular instrument.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.400
1970, he has this 200
series Electric Music Box,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.670
which you can see there.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.520
Also doesn't have a
keyboard, but has a variety

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.310
of sliders, knobs, and
other interface components.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.390
In the '70s, he released
some portable devices.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.520
This one, although apparently I
think Holmes says that only 200

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.330
of these were made-- wouldn't
you like one of these?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.300
He did use a keyboard at times.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.400
But notice that this is a
touch-sensitive keyboard

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.806
and probably does some
things we wouldn't expect.

00:20:54.806 --> 00:20:58.250
A small, portable
modular synthesizer--

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.180
if you can find one
of these, get it.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.360
[LAUGHS]

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.200
Buchla is still
making synthesizers.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.590
They're very expensive.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.470
But they really offer
some unique designs.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.480
Looking at his designs--
you can go to his website--

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:16.230
are really fascinating, creative
approaches to the synthesizer.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.980
Buchla is a separate
thread from that of Moog.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.330
Because Moog's instruments
were dedicated to meeting the

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.450
needs-- the demands--
of musicians.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.440
Our readings make
that very clear.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.930
He worked with musicians
in a variety of ways.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.980
He invited musicians
to come to his factory

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.590
and explore his instruments.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.700
He adapted his instruments
to the demands of musicians

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.670
in order to meet their needs,
and really, through that,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.964
made a very successful
commercial instrument.

00:21:46.964 --> 00:21:48.380
Now we've already
talked about how

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.320
Moog got started with
the theremin as a kid,

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.930
creating theremin
kits in his garage.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.400
In 1954, he published this
article in Radio and Television

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.130
News about his design for
a tube-based theremin.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.140
This article's great.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.730
You can check it out online.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:10.260
It also has the whole schematic
diagram for the circuit.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.450
At this time in
the '40s and '50s,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.490
there was this whole
kit-bit building culture,

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.810
and a lot of interest
in building theremin.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.320
So his design
became very popular

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.560
and attracted a
lot of attention.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.840
He published another
article in 1961

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.790
using a transistor-based
theremin that was actually

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.580
featured on the cover
of this magazine

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.480
and also got him a
lot of attention.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.200
He, by then, had a business.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.240
He and his dad were selling
theremins out of their garage--

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.620
theremin kits.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.680
By the '60s, he meets a
composer by the name of Deutsch,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.410
who knew Moog because
of the theremin--

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.250
his theremin kits-- and
wanted to know about, well,

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:57.830
if he can do some other types
of synthesizing devices--

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.550
some other types of
devices that allowed

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.450
you to take basic oscillators,
interconnect them, and put them

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.580
under flexible control.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.885
Moog develops his first
synthesizer, the 900 Series,

00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:11.640
in 1965.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.860
This device wasn't
distributed broadly.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.320
It was used mostly by
composers and some studios.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.650
In 1966, he patents
his low-pass filter,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:27.320
which becomes a very important
part of his synthesizer.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.880
Because it allowed to take
a rich, wide bandwidth

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.950
sound and control its timbre
and give it a very crisp tone.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.960
We'll hear some of that
sound very shortly.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.690
People say that this was the
only thing that Moog patented.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.460
But there are some other patents
associated with the Moog name.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.580
It was definitely the first
device that he patented.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.020
And the low-pass filter
was novel in that it

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.840
had a particularly
steep roll-off curve.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.050
So it was able to really focus
the sound underneath the cutoff

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:02.760
frequency.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.170
And it had an
adjustable resonance,

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.730
which provided a nice peak
at that cutoff frequency.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.050
Now it's in 1967
that he releases

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:17.930
his first real commercial
product, the series Systems 1,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.510
2, and 3.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.820
This is an earlier device.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.580
We can see with this
one, the keyboard.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.130
We can see some of
the basic modules.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.090
And we can see, also, a ribbon
controller, another type

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.910
of input device
that he explored.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.660
This got later
refined into devices

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.760
of this sort, which
is very often what

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.350
we see when we imagine
the Moog synthesizer.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.680
Here we have a number of
oscillators, filters, up here.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.605
And this over here
is a sequencer,

00:24:48.605 --> 00:24:50.730
which we're actually going
to talk about sequencing

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.410
next time we meet-- also,
the keyboard and the ribbon

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.990
controller, as well.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.470
So with the Systems
1, 2, and 3 in 1967,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.640
there was some standard
packages you could buy.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.640
But you could still
buy individual modules

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.510
for your own synthesizer.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.110
And this nice
price list shows us

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.460
some of the prices
of these devices.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.160
We could get a
voltage-controlled amplifier

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.830
for $150-- fair price.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.690
That voltage-controlled
low-pass, high-pass filter,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:32.910
$475 for one filter in 1968.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.510
That's pretty expensive.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:39.960
These synthesizers were
extremely expensive.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.450
But they started to be
sold and commercialized.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.460
And people started to buy them.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.880
But one thing in particular led
to the explosion of the Moog

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.620
industry, and that was Wendy
Carlos's Switched-on Bach

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.970
recording, recorded in
1968, released in '69,

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.340
and garnered a huge
amount of attention

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.320
to the Moog synthesizer.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.750
We'll talk about Wendy
Carlos and her recording

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.560
in a little bit.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.750
But let's review
some of the concepts

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.470
of the modular synthesizer.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.260
So we have two basic components.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.800
We have things that
generate sound,

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.860
like our oscillators
and other devices.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.601
And we have components
that modify those sounds.

00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:20.100
So we have these
two different types

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.120
of modules that can be
interconnected and modified.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.570
The input four module
is either the knobs

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.770
on the front panel
or another voltage.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.460
And some devices
allow you to switch

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.440
between using the knob
or a voltage as an input,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.020
or using both-- using the
knob to set a basic level

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.690
and then the input voltage
to adjust it further.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.250
The output of these
modules is another voltage,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:49.690
which can be interconnected to
modules further down the line.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.460
Within the modular synthesizer,
we have two types of signals.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.010
We have control signals
and audio signals.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.180
Both of these,
depending on the design,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.836
can be interconnected
in various ways.

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.460
Audio signals are
the things that we're

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:07.340
used to-- sounds represented
as a bipolar voltage.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.030
Voltage ranges would generally
between negative 3 and 3 volts.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:15.300
Sometimes higher or wider
ranges were possible.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.770
Control signals were also
voltages but generally unipolar

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.040
voltages between maybe
0 and plus 5 volts.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.230
These were often
more slowly moving

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.430
signals that could
be used to control

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.510
the parameters of
another module.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.530
Control signals were used,
obviously, to shape envelopes.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.190
And these envelopes
could be applied

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.230
to parameters other than
the amplitude of the sound,

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.590
such as a cutoff
frequency or the like.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.330
Now a key concept of
the modular synthesizer

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.070
was the ability to
reuse the modules.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.560
We could use an oscillator
to produce a tone

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.710
and hear that tone
of the oscillator.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.610
We could also use an
oscillator to shape

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.560
the amplitude of a sound
and produce a tremolo,

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.970
or to modulate the frequency
of another oscillator

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.880
and produce a vibrato, or use
the output of an oscillator

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.010
to modulate the cutoff
frequency to create

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.470
a variable timbre to a sound.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.420
I'm going to demonstrate
all of those in a second.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.800
This ability to reuse these
modules-- to mix audio signals

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.610
and control signals and
transform one to the other--

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.650
was really the key feature
of the modular synthesizer,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.910
combined with voltage
control, and gave it

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.740
a great degree of flexibility.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.390
Now in this golden age of
the modular synthesizer,

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.100
when you sat down
to this instrument,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.110
you got nothing for free.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.940
You sat down.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.260
It didn't make any sound.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.370
In order to make a sound, you
had to design an instrument.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.400
So the interface, in order to
make a sound, became patching.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.340
You had to patch
to make a sound.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.630
No sounds were given to you.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.470
And this promoted a huge degree
of freedom and creativity

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.090
in the design of sounds.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.220
We see, over the
history of synthesizers,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.240
this start to decrease.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.080
And so in the late '60s is
when we have the most freedom.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.400
And as the '70s move
on, we see synthesizers

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.750
that reduce the
ability of patching

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.600
and make it easier to get
a sound more automatically.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.990
And then by the early
'80s, we have synthesizers

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.390
that are programmable but
have very little in terms

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.140
of a customizable interface.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.930
Some of the basic components
of the synthesizer-- these

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.179
are screenshots
of virtual synths,

00:29:35.179 --> 00:29:36.220
which is kind of amusing.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.320
But they allow us
to see more clearly

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.560
some of the designs
of these synthesizers.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.260
So our basic oscillators, or
voltage-control oscillators,

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.920
generally provided a
control for frequency.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.330
Often, the range of
the frequency knob

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.170
would be variable in steps.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.430
So we have a dedicated
low-frequency switch

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.880
for low-frequency oscillators.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.790
And then we have
various higher ranges,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.960
which use the terminology
derived from organs--

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.600
32 foot, 16 foot, 8
foot, and the like.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.090
We had the ability to
get different waveforms

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.340
from the same
oscillator, which is

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.205
a nice convenience
of such devices.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.200
We have various noise sources,
and we'll hear example of those

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.050
as well.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.490
And we have a sample on
hold generators, which

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.040
allow us to take an input signal
and sample it periodically

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.410
to create a stepped shape.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.931
I'll demonstrate that in
a little bit, as well.

00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.430
Now our modular
synthesizers usually

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.180
had some sort of mixing
control-- some ability

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.690
to combine signals.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.150
And this sometimes was under
control of another voltage.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.360
So we have voltage-control
amplifiers, or VCAs.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.380
Sometimes we have
mixers that use

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.080
various toggles or
on-off switches.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.750
This is from the design
of the Minimoog, where

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.420
the various oscillators had
a level control and then

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.340
a toggle switch.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.010
And some devices
had various types

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.950
of matrix-mixing and
patching controls,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.730
which are very, very cool.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.020
This EMS synthesizer--
the Synthi,

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.380
Synth-I-- allowed you to control
the routing of signals, rather

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.680
than through patch
cords through a matrix.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.800
This was a template
used to help you

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.540
remember your patch
with this synth.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.040
These synths are very cool.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.332
If you can find one, grab it.

00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:29.540
Notice the convenient handle.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.430
You can take it with you.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.390
All of our synthesizers have
various types of filters.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.520
A VCF, or
voltage-control filter,

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.600
allows you to adjust
the parameters

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.580
with a voltage, the low-pass
filter and high-pass filter

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.170
being the most common,
a band-pass filter

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.499
and other varieties also found.

00:31:52.499 --> 00:31:54.540
In our modular synthesizer,
we have various types

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.210
of envelope generators.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.920
The envelope is
a unipolar signal

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.070
that we can apply to the
amplitude of a sound.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.780
But we can also
apply the envelope

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.890
to other musical parameters.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.620
The key thing about an
envelope is its control signal

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.969
that's designed to be triggered.

00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:12.510
It's a control signal
that's designed

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.580
to start at a certain
time and end, as opposed

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.110
to something like a
low-frequency oscillator that

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.580
is continuous and ongoing.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.595
The ADSR is probably
the most common type

00:32:25.595 --> 00:32:29.650
of envelope control on these
early modular synthesizers,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.420
although there were
other varieties, as well.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:38.380
There was AR filters and
attack-decay-sustain filters--

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.830
various simplifications
of the ADSR model.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.500
The key approach to using
the modular synthesizer

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.670
at this time is often called
subtractive synthesis.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.310
The idea of
subtractive synthesis

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.350
is we start with a
rich, complex tone,

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.800
and we use our filters to
take away from that tone

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.730
and get the sound
that we're looking at.

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.430
This is part of the reason
why Moog's low-pass filter was

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.210
so important.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.360
Because we could start with
a complex tone and then

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.790
use the low-pass filter to
shape out the frequencies

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.850
that we did not want.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.380
So our basic approach of
working in subtractive synthesis

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.420
would be to start with
a rich complex tone,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.620
to cut out some of
those frequencies,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.610
apply amplitude
envelopes to vary

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.070
the amplitude shape
of that sound,

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:33.030
and then use modulation
to vary the parameters.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.100
And this starts to
become really interesting

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.020
when we modulate the modulators.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.920
And we'll listen to what
that sounds like in a second.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.721
Questions, comments, ideas?

00:33:44.721 --> 00:33:45.220
OK.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.550
So let's hear what
this sounds like.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.096
Now probably the most
basic approach on one

00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:56.470
of the most common approaches
to creating a complex sound

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.450
would be combining
multiple oscillators.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.560
And this design is embodied
in some of the early Moog

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:09.030
synthesizers, where we
have three oscillators--

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.900
like these three oscillators
right here-- all under one

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.949
driver to control the
three oscillators.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.510
The idea embodied
in the interface

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.290
here is that we're
going to create

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.690
a rich tone by
combining oscillators.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.840
We can tune each of
these oscillators

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.650
to different octaves and
slight tuning differences.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.800
But they're all going to
be under a single control.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.420
Let's listen to what
this sounds like.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:40.600
So our first example-- if we
start off with just a single

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.716
oscillator--

00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:44.201
[LOW-PITCH SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:52.590
So here, we're hearing
a sawtooth waveform.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.130
And I'm taking it
from this oscillator

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.400
here and just dropping it
over into my big ADSR envelope

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.120
there.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.800
If we want to hear a sign
tone, we can just replace that.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.572
That's it.

00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:12.730
A strong sign tone.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:17.550
And we have our
triangle waveform here.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.446
[SYNTHESIZER BEATS]

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.950

sounds dead at that range.

[SYNTHESIZER BEATS AND TONE]

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.690
That's unexpected.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.500
Let's go back to this.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.363
I wonder if I--

00:35:36.363 --> 00:35:38.680
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.410
There's our saw.

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:45.770
And then we have our
square wave, which also--

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.110
[FAINT SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.630
--is not performing
well, strangely.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:53.860
OK.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.340
So that's our basic oscillators.

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.220
Now we can combine these
to create a rich tone.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.290
So here, what I've
done is combine

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.370
the sound of three oscillators.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.705
And let me tune them
all the same first.

00:36:07.705 --> 00:36:12.660
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.580
So we're actually hearing
three oscillators.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.560
And if you think about what you
think of a Moog sounding like,

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.670
this thick sound is very
much what we think about.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.260
We're hearing sawtooth
and square waves here

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.135
at different octaves.

00:36:26.135 --> 00:36:30.326
Let me vary the octaves
of this a little bit.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:34.167

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.200
Or if I set them all
to low registers.

[LOW-PITCHED SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.310
Now we can tune each of
these oscillators separately.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.010
And a very common
practice would be

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.960
to make the oscillators
slightly out of tune

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.540
to create an even thicker sound.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.410
So if I tune each
of these oscillators

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.420
out a little bit
from the center--

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.820

like out-of-tune oscillators.

closer together--

[WAVERING SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:37:35.225 --> 00:37:37.100
You don't hear it as

You hear it as a
single complex tone.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.680
Now we can see already that most
of these early modular designs

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:50.570
were designed to be monophonic,
so produce one sound at a time.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.470
Early on, it was
figured out that it'd

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.450
be pretty nice to
be able to control

00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:00.160
the transition between
these monophonic voices.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.260
And so we have the use
of a portamento control.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.220
This was available in the
RCA synthesizer, as well.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.500

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.820
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.403
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:42.403 --> 00:39:44.870
So our first step in
subtractive synthesis

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.820
is creating a complex tone.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.740
And we've done that by combining
and de-tuning oscillators.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.140
We can use a variety of
different wave shapes

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.410
with those oscillators.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.160
And we can de-tune them.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.732
And we can add three or-- I
don't know, should we go crazy?

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:01.580
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.680
If we want to add some
more, let's-- I don't know.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.850
What does six sound like?

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.120
Let's see.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.967
Let's throw in a sign tone.

00:40:09.967 --> 00:40:12.452
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.500
That's kind of nice.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.190
And let's throw in
another sawtooth.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.800
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.602
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:40:28.602 --> 00:40:29.310
You get the idea.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.000
So we've produced
our complex tone.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.520
The next basic step of
subtractive synthesis

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.070
is to apply a filter.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:43.930
And this is where Moog's
patented low-pass filter comes

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:49.600
into play and why his steep
roll-off curve was so valuable.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.580
We take our complex
tone generated

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.860
by three or more oscillators.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.990
And we filter it.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:02.071
And let's start off
with just the filtered--

00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:02.973
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:02.973 --> 00:41:04.326
OK.

00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:06.560
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.560
We're a little bit ahead
of where we want to be.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.533
Let's start first
with our complex tone.

00:41:10.533 --> 00:41:12.948
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:17.320
There's our complex tone.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:25.500
And our filter provides
cutoff frequency

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.870
to shape the timbre of that
sound and a resonance control

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.047
to set the amount of amplitude
on the peak of the cutoff

00:41:32.047 --> 00:41:32.547
frequency.

00:41:32.547 --> 00:41:34.982
[HIGH-PITCHED SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.650
One of the design features
of Moog's low-pass filter

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.590
was that it could self-resonate.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.940
So if the resonance
was set loud enough--

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.830
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.360
--we could actually produce
a very clear sinusoidal sound

at the cutoff frequency.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:54.675 --> 00:41:56.130

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.210
So there's our low-pass
filter-- taking our thick tone,

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.220
put it through a
low-pass filter.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.060
One of the most common
things we want to do

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.570
and one of the easy advantages
of using a modular synthesizer

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.640
is we can take a sign tone,
or some other wave shape,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.720
and use it to modulate
the cutoff frequency.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.999
[STATICKY SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:42:17.999 --> 00:42:19.040
There it's a little fast.

[PULSING SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.540
So now we're modulating
the cutoff frequency

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.400
by a sign tone, whose
frequency I can control--

--and whose depth
I can control here.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.947
We would have to scale it.

This is much harder to
do with a real synth.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.584
But this makes it nice and easy.

Because here, we're hearing
the smooth transition.

There's no separation between--

00:43:46.522 --> 00:43:48.563

had different designs

00:43:48.563 --> 00:43:49.703
in terms of that.

00:43:51.036 --> 00:43:53.320
PROFESSOR: With
the Moog, well, I

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.440
believe except for the
voltage ranges, sometimes

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.370
you would need to
scale an audio input.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:00.550
Some devices, you would need
to transform your voltage

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.930
before you could use it.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.866
But you could take
an audio oscillator

00:44:05.866 --> 00:44:07.990
and use it as a control
voltage if it could perform

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.660
at a slow enough rate as a
low-frequency oscillator.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.960
Some designs, you would need
a dedicated low-frequency

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.459
oscillator.

00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:16.160
Because it couldn't perform
slowly in a reliable way.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.070
That would be an issue
why sometimes there

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.630
would be a dedicated
low-frequency oscillator.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.760
But with computers, doing
low-frequency oscillation

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.260
is easy.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.889
So it's more interoperable.

AUDIENCE: Is there
some responsiveness

issue with that, where it seems
like you [? couldn't ?] do

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.360
really cool things if you
took audio signal that

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.030
was not synthesized but
recorded, and amplified,

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.454
and made to control things,
like a [INAUDIBLE], kind of.

00:44:39.454 --> 00:44:40.370
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.190
AUDIENCE: Is there a
responsiveness issue?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.480
Because what you were saying
before about control-voltage

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.787
versus audio signals is
that the control tends

00:44:48.787 --> 00:44:50.796
to be at a slow--
like obviously,

00:44:50.796 --> 00:44:53.667
audio is at a higher rate,
not [INAUDIBLE] not digital.

00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:54.375
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:44:54.375 --> 00:44:55.791
AUDIENCE: With
that kind of thing,

00:44:55.791 --> 00:44:58.870
is that a problem if you want
to modulate, say, the filter

00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:59.639
with your voice?

00:44:59.639 --> 00:45:00.430
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.330
Yeah, I mentioned in passing
that the RCA synthesizer had

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.210
a microphone input.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.044
And Moog's synthesizers
had-- this one

00:45:08.044 --> 00:45:09.710
doesn't show us a
good example of that--

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.040
but had microphone inputs.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.760
We could take an analog
signal, use a low-pass filter

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.720
to smooth out the edges,
and use that to drive

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.880
some other parameters.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.250
So it was possible
to take other inputs,

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:24.140
use them to control
your musical parameters.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.598
That general
technique is something

00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:27.420
we call envelope following.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.340
And sometimes there would be
dedicated envelope followers

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.031
in these early synths to
make that even easier.

00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:35.030
AUDIENCE: So like optimize
it for that, kind of?

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.821
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:36.320
OK.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.586
So what we just did was
have our dense combination

00:45:39.586 --> 00:45:40.210
of oscillators.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:45.390
And we use an LFO to shape
the sound in a periodic way.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.420
A very common--
probably the most common

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.130
approach to
subtractive synthesis--

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.430
so common that it was embodied
in the design of the Minimoog

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.420
a few years later from the
time of this synthesizer--

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.990
was using an envelope to
control the cutoff frequency.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:05.810
Why would you use an envelope
to control the cutoff frequency?

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.290
So with the LFO, we get
that continuous change

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.080
in the timbre, no matter
when we trigger the note.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.460
Why would we want to use an
envelope, which we generally

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.040
use to control the
amplitude, to control

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.720
the cutoff frequency
of a filter?

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.630
Any ideas?

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.055
AUDIENCE: More like a
real instrument then,

00:46:29.055 --> 00:46:32.450
if it's linked to when you
play, as opposed to continuous.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:33.490
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.790
Many real instruments
have different timbres

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.000
over the course
of their envelope.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.350
Many instruments are often
brighter at the initial onset--

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:46.350
the articulation-- and then
darken as the tone sustains.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:56.460
So a very common approach is to
use a-- pull it up-- envelope.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.190
And here, I'm using
an ADSR set to trigger

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.730
when I press a note
to control the cutoff

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.800
frequency of the filter.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.554
And I'll start off with the
modulation of this being small.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.435
Here on the onset-- the initial
little bump in the frequency--

00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:16.167
let me make this broader.

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:20.040
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.060
And even broader.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.976
And I'll start off with
the lower start point.

00:47:22.976 --> 00:47:26.210
[SYNTHESIZER TONE BURSTS]

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.780
So that's an extreme setting.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.195
We're using the ADSR to
control the cutoff frequency.

00:47:31.195 --> 00:47:33.725
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:35.895
And I can adjust the attack.

00:47:35.895 --> 00:47:38.020
So if the attack is quick,
we'll get a bright sound

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.936
at the very beginning
and then it'll get dark.

like that before, maybe?

common approach--

control the cutoff

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.710

to be longer--

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.130

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:14.070
Questions?

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.400
So again, that
approach was so common,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.940
it was embodied in nearly
almost every synthesizer that

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.570
came after the Moog,
this idea of applying

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.350
a filter to the
cutoff frequencies.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.720
Some designs, like the Minimoog,
even had a dedicated envelope

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.405
just to control the
cutoff frequency.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.400
So what else could we do
with the modular synthesizer?

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:39.290
Well, we could do amplitude
modulation and ring modulation,

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.320
where we modulate the
amplitude of the sound,

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.340
either with a sinusoidal
shape or some other shape.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.210
And we can use this to
create tremolo effects when

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.150
we use a low-frequency
oscillator

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:54.790
or amplitude-modulation
or ring-modulation effects

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.350
as we speed up the modulation.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.870
So in the first
example here, we're

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:03.020
taking the output of our
three oscillators here,

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.420
and we're putting them
into what is essentially

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.530
a voltage-controlled amplifier.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.690
And we're modulating the
voltage of the amplifier

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.520
by another oscillator.

00:57:48.792 --> 00:57:54.199
You can hear it's already--
here's low frequency.

00:57:54.199 --> 00:57:54.990
Let me speed it up.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.027
[SYNTHESIZER]

00:57:56.027 --> 00:57:57.860
And as I increase the
amount of modulation--

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.290
[VARYING SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:07.680
--we get all sorts of
new spectral components

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.700
due to the frequency modulation.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.460
And of course, we could scale
that frequency modulation.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.114
We could modulate the modulator.

00:58:14.114 --> 00:58:16.280
So we could control the
parameters of the modulation

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.370
with another oscillator
or another envelope.

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:23.660
And the process goes on and on.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.212
Now a very common technique
available as early as the RCA

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:29.170
synthesizer-- we heard
a little taste of this--

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:30.960
was the use of filtered noise.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.600
We can use our noise sources
through either a low-pass or

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.350
band-pass filter to
create some novel timbres.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:40.580
This was used in that
example we listened

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.440
to before to create
a drum sound.

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.740
And it can be used for a
lot of interesting sounds.

Oh, sorry.

[SYNTHESIZER]

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.550
That was modulating
the modulator of FM.

Here's our
filtered-noise example.

[STATICKY SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:03.430
So here I'm using a white-noise
source into a band-pass filter.

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:05.700
And I'm controlling
the cutoff frequency

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.280
of that band-pass
filter by the keyboard.

[STATICKY SYNTHESIZER TONES]

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:17.150
So we can create
something somewhat

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.760
in between a pitched
and unpitched sound.

the cutoff frequency is
controlled by the keyboard,

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.072

when you modulate

00:59:49.996 --> 00:59:54.408

00:59:54.408 --> 00:59:55.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:57.954
Can you even do
that on the Moog?

00:59:57.954 --> 00:59:58.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.330
On the Moog?

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.880
I'm not sure I
can do it on this.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.170
But with a computer, we need
to insert a little bit of delay

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:05.220
in there.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.190
We'll do that with PD.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:09.000
When we work this with
PD, we'll feed that back

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.110
and see what happens.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.530
You could use
feedback on the Moog,

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.850
particularly with delay,
which is something

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.337
that sometimes people would use.

01:00:18.337 --> 01:00:20.170
Because we still had
the old tape technique.

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:22.500
So some people would
integrate tape delay

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.170
with the synthesizer,
send a signal out,

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:28.470
put it through tape
delay, bring it back in,

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:30.900
which allowed you to do some
pretty interesting things.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.540
I believe we heard that in the
Oliveros tune, "Alien Bog."

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.550
She used a lot of tape delay.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.880
The last example I
have for you guys

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.710
is one of the most common sounds
from the modular synthesizer,

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:47.790
or one of the many
common sounds.

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.000
And this is using
the sample and hold

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.720
generator applied to noise.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.830
So here, what I'm doing
is taking white noise,

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.610
bringing it into the
sample-and-hold generator.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.900
The sample and hold takes
that noise and samples

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.490
values from it in
a periodic fashion.

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:08.500
Here, I'm using the internal
trigger to sample the noise.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.250
And I'm applying the output
of that to an oscillator

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:16.520
to do frequency modulation
of the oscillator.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.565
So in short--

01:01:17.565 --> 01:01:20.680
[SYNTHESIZER BEEPS]

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.710
--we get this.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.640

[SYNTHESIZER BEEPS]

01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:29.400
So what we're
doing, again, we're

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.100
taking noise and using it
as a source of randomness.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.450
But the noise is coming
out at the audio rate.

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:36.870
So basically, what we need
to do is slow it down.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:41.230
And the sample and hold gives
us a way to slow down a signal

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.970
and make it into
a stepped pattern.

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.350
[SYNTHESIZER]

01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.400
Here, it's really slow.

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:50.094
I can speed it up.

And this sample and hold has
a nice glide parameter here,

get to the points.

it through a sample

way to get random parameters.

those random parameters

wide frequency range.

to the synthesizer.

Questions?

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:16.147
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE]
is very digital, right?

01:03:16.147 --> 01:03:17.230
PROFESSOR: Well, in a way.

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.820
I mean, the way that
analog-to-digital conversion

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.630
works is essentially through a
process of sampling and holding

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:23.560
the value.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.235
But sample and hold processors
were available for a long time.

01:03:27.235 --> 01:03:27.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.075
But it seems like
an in-between step,

01:03:30.075 --> 01:03:33.626
between this idea of sampling
these individual values out

01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:34.740
and then putting them out.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.800
It's very digital, kind of.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.590
But then with this
glide control,

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.950
we get right back into
the smooth analog domain.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.200
So that's--

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.190

A-B-C, B-A-C built together.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:52.470

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.483
So--

01:03:53.483 --> 01:03:53.976

01:03:53.976 --> 01:03:54.642
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:54.642 --> 01:03:58.413
AUDIENCE: So you showed us the
matrix, like the plug-in one.

01:03:58.413 --> 01:04:00.878
Do they have virtual
versions of the matrix?

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:02.154
Or is it just a bad interface?

01:04:02.154 --> 01:04:04.070
PROFESSOR: Oh, I think
it's a great interface.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.080
But I don't know of
a virtualized version

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.820
of those EMS synths yet.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.340
EMS really explore that.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:14.200
And there is another
synthesizer-- look

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.960
at this, ARP 2500--
that use matrices

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.700
for the entire patching system.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.780
I would love to see a
virtualization of that.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.055
But I don't know of one yet.

01:04:27.055 --> 01:04:28.679

of like [INAUDIBLE]

Does it do--

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.380
PROFESSOR: Max has a
matrix GUI control.

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:35.880

AUDIENCE: So you can [INAUDIBLE]
things and [INAUDIBLE] similar,

01:04:39.072 --> 01:04:40.440
but not--

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.240
PROFESSOR: Of course,
with this design,

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.656
depending on how
it's implemented,

01:04:43.656 --> 01:04:45.100
you can do one-to-one
connections,

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.016
like with a patch bay.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:49.270
But you can also do one-to-many
connections, as long

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:51.580
as that doesn't weaken
your signal too much.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.560
Right.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.470
So we listened to a
number of different pieces

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:03.850
using the modular
synthesizer-- various sorts.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.100
Probably some of the
most important in terms

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.820
of the history of
music technology

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:12.080
were those that were released
on the Switched-on Bach album.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.530
This was released in
1968 by Wendy Carlos

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:21.252
and featured this very
unhappy looking guy, well,

01:05:21.252 --> 01:05:22.335
I guess he-- I don't know.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.900
It's supposed to be Bach.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.540
He's got headphones.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.830
And he's sitting in front
of the Moog synthesizer.

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.380
This really solidifies
some of the issues

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:37.560
in music and technology that
we've seen again and again.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.020
In order for new instruments
to be successful,

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.850
they often need to be tied
to historical practice.

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.980
And if you want to
legitimize an instrument,

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.620
well, play Bach on it.

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.700
And if you can play Bach on it,
then it's got to be legitimate.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.480
Quotes of Moog and others
talk about the importance

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.290
of this album in showing people
what this thing was-- what

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.450
the synthesizer was,
that it could be used

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:06.190
as a musical
instrument and really,

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.900
inspired a whole generation
or generations of musicians

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.170
to become interested
in the Moog.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:15.100
They say that sales
of the Moog exploded

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.527
after the release of this album,
at least for a couple of years,

01:06:19.527 --> 01:06:21.110
even though the Moog
was so expensive.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.320
So I had you guys
listen to two-- refresh

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.280

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.750
This is one of my favorite
timbres in this whole album.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.995
That's a filtered noise
sound you can hear there.

01:07:01.995 --> 01:07:04.370
But it's got a little bit of
modulation on the frequency.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:06.676
So it's kind of like there's
a little vibrato on it.

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:13.940
So there's that, and then
"Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1,

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.120

[MUSIC -- JS BACH, "THE
WELL-TEMPERED CLAVIER, BOOK 1,

PRELUDE AND FUGUE IN C MINOR"]

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.600
Nice, huh?

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.785
What do you guys think?

01:08:10.785 --> 01:08:13.260
AUDIENCE: I said this
earlier, but that

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.735
was my favorite part
of all the listenings.

01:08:15.735 --> 01:08:16.714
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:08:16.714 --> 01:08:18.130
AUDIENCE: They
were very pleasant.

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:19.994
PROFESSOR: They
were very pleasant.

01:08:19.994 --> 01:08:21.910
I mean, at the time, I
imagine for some people

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.609
they were probably
pretty jarring.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:28.550
Some of the timbres in that
are pretty strident timbres.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:29.850
But it's still Bach.

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:33.260
And it relates to
organ sounds that you

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.220
might associate some
of these sounds with.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.091
Other observations about this?

01:08:39.091 --> 01:08:41.229
AUDIENCE: There was
some volume modulation.

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:43.209
Was that done independently?

01:08:43.209 --> 01:08:44.500
PROFESSOR: In that right there?

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.708
AUDIENCE: The last one, yeah.

01:08:45.708 --> 01:08:48.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you here
it as stepped dynamics.

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:53.169
And that's because dynamics
was a weak point of the Moog.

01:08:53.169 --> 01:08:57.330
You had a volume control,
but the keyboards

01:08:57.330 --> 01:08:59.170
weren't velocity sensitive.

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:02.340
So adjusting volume
was difficult.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.307
So this album was recorded
through multi-track recording.

01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:08.015
So they could do it
in the mixing process

01:09:08.015 --> 01:09:10.069
of recording different
layers or adjusting--

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:11.569
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
seemed a little--

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:12.010
PROFESSOR: --the knobs.

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:13.468
It seems a little
artificial, yeah.

01:09:13.468 --> 01:09:15.050
You hear the step
dynamics there.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.010
AUDIENCE: So did that
[INAUDIBLE] portable

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.716
synthesizers, the red one with
the keyboard that we looked

01:09:20.716 --> 01:09:25.120
at earlier, have touch-sensitive
keys so the performer could

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.326
actually express dynamics
without having to--

01:09:27.326 --> 01:09:29.700
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure if
they were just on-off switches

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:32.779
or if they had some sort of
the more contact the louder,

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.376
or something of the sort.

01:09:34.376 --> 01:09:35.834
That would be
something to look at.

01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:38.689
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ribbon-style controller

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:41.383
up and down, like they're
higher on key or lower on key.

01:09:41.383 --> 01:09:42.049
I'd notice that.

01:09:42.049 --> 01:09:43.752
But I don't know if
it knows how loud.

01:09:43.752 --> 01:09:44.460
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:44.710
Yeah.

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:46.609
We have many devices--
even Moog explored

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:50.620
in ribbons-- that would use
a lateral movement for pitch.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.020
But I'm not sure when we got
a really flexible amplitude

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.200
control into our synths.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.419
AUDIENCE: Was any
of that sequenced?

01:09:57.419 --> 01:09:58.710
PROFESSOR: It wasn't sequenced.

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.120
It was all performed live.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.690
But it's a mistake
to think of this

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.470
as just a demonstration
of the Moog synth.

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:06.170
This composition
was a demonstration

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:10.280
of the Moog synth and some very
excellent multi-track recording

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.250
and audio production.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.780
Because this was all
composed and performed

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.570
one part at a time,
recorded to tape,

01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:22.640
and layered one part at a time.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.300
Remember, the Moog
synth is essentially

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.910
a monophonic instrument
at this time.

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:30.730
And so she had to play one
part at a time, and layer,

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:34.940
and re-record, and every
time, adjusting the timbre.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.267
In many ways, this album--
I really recommend you guys

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:39.350
listen to the whole album,
because it's fantastic.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:43.780
It's a catalog of sounds you can
make with the Moog synthesizer

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.567
and served as a catalog for
many others afterwards, going,

01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:49.400
what was that sound?

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.310
What was that sound?

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:54.940
Trying to get the sounds from
that album-- really a resource

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.640
for many other
musicians, I think.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.724
Other comments about this?

01:10:58.724 --> 01:11:00.598
AUDIENCE: There was a
bit in the reading that

01:11:00.598 --> 01:11:02.220
says that Carlos
commissioned Moog

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.110
to build touch-sensitive
keyboards that

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:05.040
had velocity control.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.206
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's great.

01:11:06.206 --> 01:11:07.444
Was it before or after this?

01:11:07.444 --> 01:11:08.777
AUDIENCE: It must've been after.

01:11:08.777 --> 01:11:09.234
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:11:09.234 --> 01:11:10.300
AUDIENCE: I can't
imagine why you'd

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.925
want to [INAUDIBLE]
the volume control.

01:11:11.925 --> 01:11:13.530
PROFESSOR: That's
interesting, yeah.

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:15.520
She worked with
Moog quite a bit.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.630
She worked with Moog to
create that Moog demo

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:22.650
LP, which I sent you
guys the link to.

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:26.170
She worked with Moog, I think,
to improve the sequencer

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:26.910
design.

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:31.030
And that's an interesting issue
about the touch-sensitive,

01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:32.197
volume-sensitive keyboard.

01:11:32.197 --> 01:11:34.030
It'd be interesting to
see when that came in

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:36.540
and how that was applied.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:42.100
So that was a key
point in our history

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.640
of music and technology,
the legitimization

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.080
of the instrument through Bach.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.360
Now something totally
different comes to us

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.170
from the Netherlands.

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:56.869
And this is a composition
by Gottfried Michael Koenig,

01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:58.910
a German composer who had
been living and working

01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:59.740
in the Netherlands.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.660
And he was the artistic
director of a place called

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.200
the Institute of Sonology,
first in Utrecht and now

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.100
in the Hague, where
they had over a period

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.180
of a number of years, developed
their own modular synthesizer

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.400
from scratch.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.470
So while Moog led to the
first commercial packaged

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.800
synthesizer, many
people were developing

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.150
custom-built synthesizers
that looked something

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:30.050
like this, where you have
numerous individual components

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.020
often custom designed,
scattered around the room,

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:38.180
and a giant patch bay to
connect them all together.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.570
This synthesizer is
still in existence.

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:43.630
In fact, I took this
photo five years ago.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.920
This isn't historical.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.460
It looks like that still.

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.620
And it sounds fantastic.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.840
It's an amazing-sounding
synthesizer.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.950
His composition that we
listened to-- "Gray Function,"

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.430
is how it translates-- is part
of a series of function pieces

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:03.980
that explored automating
some of the parameters

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.860
of the modular synthesizer
using a single control

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.470
voltage as a pattern
that was applied

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:16.880
to numerous different parameters
of a synthesis system.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.195
We can hear a little bit of
this piece to remind you.

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.670
[MUSIC -- GOTTFRIED MICHAEL
 KOENIG, "GRAY FUNCTION"]

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.990
Now this piece was
composed for four channels.

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:56.910
And the four channels were
composed independently.

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:59.710
So you can hear that in
this two-channel mix.

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:03.405
You can hear the four
sources independently moving.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.430
Thoughts about this piece?

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:18.181
Is it still going? [LAUGHS]
That was interesting. [LAUGHS]

01:14:18.181 --> 01:14:18.930
What do you think?

01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:20.286
AUDIENCE: I like
the Carlos better.

01:14:20.286 --> 01:14:21.190
But it's interesting.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.125
PROFESSOR: It's a
little more melodic.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.583
AUDIENCE: It's
interesting in terms

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:25.850
of the technical aspect
of how it was created.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
of this piece providing

01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.860
a landscape of noise
textures that we can make.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.060
Often, we hear these
oscillators combined and used

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.320
for pitch sounds.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.770
This composition really
gives us a sampling

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:41.190
of the variety of noise
timbres that could be produced.

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:43.520
The Institute of
Sonology synthesizer also

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.810
features a number
of modules not found

01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:52.320
on the Moog-- for instance,
voltage-controlled envelope

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.110
generators, so where the
attack, decay, sustain,

01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.470
release parameters
could be controlled

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.699
by voltages, which is
pretty interesting.

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:02.240
So if you think
about that, you could

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.830
set the attack and the
release of a series of sounds

01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:10.350
to be controlled by a
low-frequency oscillator

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:11.960
or something else,
which allows you

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.200
to create series of
dynamic envelopes.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:22.770
So moving on-- Subotnick,
"Silver Apples of the Moon."

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:26.770
This piece was composed
with a Buchla synthesizer.

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:30.720
It's not exactly clear how
much multi-track layering

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.390
was going on in the
production of this.

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.210
It's not clear if
this was one set up,

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.380
or if it was multiple
takes of layer.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.960
That's something to look at
in the production of this.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.970
This composition
was noted for being

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:47.470
one of the first recordings
made for commercial distribution

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:48.970
with a synthesizer.

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:55.910
It actually predates
Switched-on Bach by a few years

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:59.080
but didn't have quite
the commercial success

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.340
of Switched-on Bach.

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.518
Let's listen to a
little bit of this.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:07.482
[MUSIC -- MORTON SUBOTNICK,
 "SILVER APPLES OF THE MOON"]

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:24.630
Notice the filtered
noise timbres

01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:27.270
coming out of the
speaker right there.

01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:32.150
Notice, also, the--
say you had a Buchla

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:35.900
and you wanted to create
that flute-like sound,

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.020
how might you do that?

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:37.520
Any ideas?

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.240
It sounds to me like an
oscillator with a glide time,

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.419
with its pitch being controlled
by a sample and hold.

01:16:53.419 --> 01:16:55.460
Although we're only getting
a few couple pitches,

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.680
that might be a way that
some of the frequencies

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.880
are chosen in this
composition, using a sample

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.670
and hold adjusted and shifted
to control the frequencies.

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:08.130
What sort of musical
roles are we hearing?

01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.400
Are we hearing
musical roles or parts

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.100
that sound like
acoustic instruments,

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.770
or musical roles
or parts that sound

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:15.145
like something
totally different?

01:17:15.145 --> 01:17:16.650
I think that's a
useful way for us

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:18.040
to approach some
of these pieces.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.850
With the Carlos,
we hear synthesizer

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:24.640
being used to emulate
parts that were

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.060
done by acoustic instruments.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.820
In the Koenig
composition, we heard

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:30.510
sounds that sound nothing
like acoustic instruments.

01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:32.420
With this, we have
a nice mixture

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:36.440
of sounds that are
somewhat acoustic-sounding

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.650
in their roles and
somewhat electronic.

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:41.150
Let's listen to a little bit
and think about which is which.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:43.525
[MUSIC -- MORTON SUBOTNICK,
 "SILVER APPLES OF THE MOON"]

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:51.860
Well, that was a good
point to do that.

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.710
Because our initial
flute-like sound

01:17:54.710 --> 01:18:02.240
transformed into a something
that a flute player

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.312
couldn't normally do.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.170
Now in Part B of this, we
get a very surprising change.

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:16.544
[MUSIC -- MORTON SUBOTNICK,
 "SILVER APPLES OF THE MOON"]

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.672
We get this rhythmic section
building up at the end here.

01:18:25.672 --> 01:18:28.142
[MUSIC -- MORTON SUBOTNICK,
 "SILVER APPLES OF THE MOON"]

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:43.640
Now Buchla's early
synthesizers were often notable

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.350
for the use of both
randomness and sequencers.

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.450
So we had various types
of random controllers

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:52.360
that were pretty novel.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.910
Your book mentions
that one of them

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:56.180
was called a Source
of Uncertainty, which

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.370
is a very evocative name
for a random generator,

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:03.850
and also had
dedicated sequencers.

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:06.390
We're going to talk about
sequencers next time we meet.

01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:09.050
But we hear there some
use of the sequencer

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:10.930
to create patterns
of voltages that

01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:13.780
are applied to pitch or
other musical parameters.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.045
Reflections on this piece?

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:19.426
Did you like it?

01:19:19.426 --> 01:19:20.380
AUDIENCE: It is long.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.470
PROFESSOR: It is long.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:24.640
AUDIENCE: The first
part, in Part A,

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.833
the noise, I guess, sort of
sounds like the [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:30.300
I think it had like the
[INAUDIBLE] in there.

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.365
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:35.670
Did you hear accelerating and
de-accelerating articulations?

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:36.435
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

01:19:36.435 --> 01:19:37.018
Like for real.

01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:40.387
Just the timbre really
matched the usual [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:42.387
[INAUDIBLE] start out
with that one [INAUDIBLE],

01:19:42.387 --> 01:19:43.895
but that timbre's faster.

01:19:43.895 --> 01:19:45.899
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's interesting.

01:19:45.899 --> 01:19:47.440
Although that was--
you sampled here,

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.540
these are all synthesized.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.110
But yeah, that's
a good connection.

01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:53.540
Anything else?

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.920
I think the depth
of this composition

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.590
is pretty remarkable.

01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:59.500
There's just so much
going on in terms

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.460
of background and
foreground that

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:03.830
makes it such a
thick composition.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:05.760
There had to be
multi-track layering

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.160
going on in this
composition, I think.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.480
Either that, or they hooked up
numerous synths all together

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.090
in some massive piece.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:16.390
All right.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.420
We had the Oliveros as
well, which is probably

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.730
the one of the most novel
compositions in that it

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:22.980
doesn't sound at all
like Western instruments

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.050
but really takes advantage
of the synthesizer

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:27.120
in some unique ways.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.950
Next time we meet, we're going
to talk about the sequencer

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:34.430
and continue our trajectory
up to drum machines.

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.350
I'll see you then.

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:37.200
See you guys.
