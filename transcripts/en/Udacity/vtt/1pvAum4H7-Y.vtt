00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've gone and I've fetched some art.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this case, you can probably guess what it's going to be.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Title Batman--let's paste him in here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And when I click submit, we see our Batman.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Pretty neat, huh?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we have this nice art channel.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So this is our html.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I've been including these classes, and I keep referring to,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
oh, these are good for styling things and this area is good for styling things.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to go ahead and show you a few styles here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that just make this app a little bit better.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So you can add a style tag.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This has type text/css.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We are not going to quiz you at all on this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In a lot of our homeworks and stuff going forward,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'll provide the styles,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but I'm going to pop in a few here that I wrote.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Okay, I just pasted in a bunch of styles,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I'll just walk you through them real quick, because it's fairly easy to read.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Basically, the syntax is body.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So this means our body tag is going to have a font family--sans serif

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so we'll get rid of the serifs.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's going to be with 800 pixels.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is a trick for centering it and giving some padding.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Our error style that we added for our error message--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that's going to have red text.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Our label, instead of being displayed inline,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm going to make it display block, which is going to cause it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to use its own line.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I'm going to make the font bigger.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Our input for our title--I'm going to make that wider with 400.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm going to make the font size bigger.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to add some padding.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That padding is kind of spaced between the outside of the element and the contents.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm going to make our text area wider and taller

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and give it a bigger font

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and also make it a monospace font, which is good for ASCII art.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm going to make the text of our submit button bigger.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to add some margins between these elements

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that our HR--our rule--is going to have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
20 pixels on either side.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Our artwork is going to have 20 pixels between each of them.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And our art titles are going to be bold,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and they're going to be 20 pixels tall--the font.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And our art body is not going to have any margin on it,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and its font size is going to be 17 pixels.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So I know that was a lot.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You don't have to know this, or really even have to understand it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I just want you to know what it does or what it is.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And let's go to our browser and see how this looks.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So here's our old page.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm going to reload this with our new styles.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh, yeah, look at that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now we've got this big form, nicer fonts,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and a big, big, much nicer Batman

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and a much nicer camel. 25

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Just a few little styles can go a long way to making

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a web app look a lot nicer, actually.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay, so I hope you enjoyed that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I hope you learned something.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's the end of this unit.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Your next homework is going to be basically using these skills I just demonstrated.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So I hope you had fun with that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Thanks for participating so far.
