00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:02.431
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that I had the number

00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:06.761
zero point one seven.

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:09.640
How could I say this number?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.351
I said it one way, I said
zero point one seven,

00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:14.051
but what are other ways
that I could say it,

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:15.131
especially if I wanted to express it

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.233
in terms of tenths or hundredths

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:18.707
or other places?

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.786
And like always, try to pause the video

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.165
and try think about it on your own.

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:25.010
Alright, so there's
actually a couple of ways

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.191
that we could say this number.

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:30.722
One is just to say zero point one seven.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.568
Other ways are to say look,

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:36.329
I have a one in the tenths place,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.450
so that's going to be one tenth,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.059
one tenth and

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.838
one tenth and I have a seven
in the hundredths place,

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:50.659
so this is a seven right over here

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.470
in the hundredths place, so I can say

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.777
one tenth and seven hundredths.

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:58.158
Hun-

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.352
Hundredths.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.490
And there you go.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.148
That's one way to say this number.

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:05.611
Now another to think about it

00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:09.326
is just say the whole thing
in terms of hundredths.

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:12.310
So a tenth is how many hundredths?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.827
Well a tenth is the same
thing as 10 hundredths,

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:18.022
so you could say, you could say

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:20.620
instead of a tenth, you could
say this is 10 hundredths,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.699
and the way I'm writing it right now,

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:24.242
very few people would
actually do it this way.

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:27.803
10 hundredths and

00:01:27.803 --> 00:01:30.288
and seven hundredths.

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:34.660
And seven hundredths.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.681
Well not I could just
add these hundredths,

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.330
if I have 10 hundredths and I have another

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.195
seven hundredths, that's
going to be 17 hundredths.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:44.714
So I could just write this down as

00:01:44.714 --> 00:01:48.034
17 hundredths.

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:49.427
Hundredths.

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:50.914
And to make that intuition of how we could

00:01:50.914 --> 00:01:53.130
just call this 17
hundredths instead of just

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.522
calling it one tenth and seven hundredths,

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:58.076
let's actually count by hundredths.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:02.000
So that is one hundredth,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.660
that is two hundredth,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.903
and actually, let me just go straight to

00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:07.038
nine hundredths.

00:02:07.038 --> 00:02:09.303
So I skipped a bunch right over here.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:10.962
And what would be the
next, how would I say

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:12.634
10 hundredths?

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.491
Well 10 hundredths, let
me write it this way,

00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:19.262
10 hundredths is the
same thing as one tenth.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.980
So if we go from nine
hundredths, the next,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.638
if I'm counting by hundredths,
the next one's going to be

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:27.017
10 hundredths.

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:29.769
Now once again, 10
hundredths is the same thing

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.891
as one tenth, just the
same way that 10 ones

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:35.097
is the same thing as one 10.

00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:36.258
I hope that doesn't confuse you,

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:37.082
but we could keep counting.

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:39.973
10 hundredths, 11 hundredths,

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.467
12 hundredths, 13 hundredths,

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:47.554
14 hundredths, 15 hundredths,

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:52.244
16 hundredths, and then
finally 17 hundredths.

00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:53.451
So hopefully that gives
you a little intuition

00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:55.169
for why we can call this number,

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.888
instead of just calling
it zero point one seven,

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:59.232
or one tenth and seven hundredths,

00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:02.670
we could call this 17 hundredths.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.364
So with that out of the way,
let's do a couple of examples

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:06.523
going the other way.

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:10.191
Let's say we're given a name of a number

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.735
or the words, and we wanna
write it down as a decimal.

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:17.529
So this is four tens and three hundredths.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.083
Alright, so four tens.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:22.578
So the four tens right over here.

00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:24.529
So actually let me just
put some places over here,

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.489
so this would be, if
this is our tens place,

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.064
and then this is our ones place,

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:33.886
and then you're gonna have your decimal,

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:37.148
and then you're gonna
have your tenths place,

00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:39.911
tenths place, and then
you're going to have,

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.373
and I'll do this in a different color,

00:03:41.373 --> 00:03:43.405
your hundredths place.

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:44.902
Hun-

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:47.109
Hundredths place.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.733
So we're going to have four tens.

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:52.564
Not tenths, four tens.

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:56.048
So four tens, zero ones,

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.009
zero ones, we got our decimal,

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.981
they don't have any tenths
over here so zero tenths,

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.803
and then we have three hundredths.

00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:08.191
Three hundredths, so three hundredths.

00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:11.127
So four tens, which is
the same thing as 40,

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:12.951
and three hundredths right over here,

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:16.027
so 40 point zero three.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:18.918
Let's do another one of
these, this is kinda fun.

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:22.075
So we have 24 hundredths.

00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:23.816
24 hundredths.

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:26.707
So by the logic that we
saw in the first one,

00:04:26.707 --> 00:04:29.226
in the first one, we
could just write this as,

00:04:29.226 --> 00:04:31.176
remember, this would be nine hundredths,

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:32.825
and if we want one more hundredth,

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:34.718
this would be 10 hundredths.

00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:36.516
So if we want to do 24 hundredths,

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:38.919
it would just be zero point two four.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.858
And if you're saying well wait a minute,

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:44.236
this looks like two tenths
and four hundredths,

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:45.467
you'd be right!

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:49.019
But remember, so actually let
me, I could re-write this as,

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:53.843
I could re-write this as two tenths,

00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:58.562
two tenths and four hundredths.

00:04:58.562 --> 00:05:00.699
Let me say and

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.265
four hundredths.

00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:05.481
Hundredths.

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:08.895
But remember, a tenth is
equal to 10 hundredths,

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:13.527
so two tenths is the same
thing as 20 hundredths.

00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:15.234
Hundredths.

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:16.393
I have trouble saying-

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:18.553
So this is the same thing as 20 hundredths

00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:20.875
and four hundredths.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.682
And four, let me write it neatly.

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:28.294
Four hundredths.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.964
And of course 20 hundredths
and four hundredths

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:32.762
is the same thing as 24 hundredths.

00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:36.193
So hopefully that makes sense.
