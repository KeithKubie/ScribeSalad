00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:15.760
[silence]

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.540
&gt;&gt; TED WIDMER: Welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm Ted Widmer.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.250
I'm the Director of the John W.
Kluge Center here at the Library.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.170
And I want to thank Rob Casper
of the Poetry &amp; Literature Center

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.150
for all he did to include
our center,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.860
including all of our
scholars who are here tonight.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.400
I want to take this
opportunity to invite you

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.930
to silence your cellphones and
any other electronic devices.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.440
And also, after the panel
discussion, we will have a Q&amp;A

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.750
that will be live streamed.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.920
If you choose to ask a
question, which I hope you will,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.380
you give permission to the
Library to broadcast yourself.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.290
So, choose your question carefully.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.870
I have a special reason
for rejoicing this evening.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.590
I was in a huge audience on the
Main Green of Brown University,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.620
my former employer, and the
alma mater of Marilynne Robinson

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.220
when she was given an
honorary degree in 2012.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.470
I was so far across that Green
that I couldn't even see her.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.120
I'm grateful to the Library
for hosting this event

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480
because I will have
a much better seat.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.350
While in Rhode Island, I was the
Director for Rare Books Library

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.750
that specialized in early
American history, 16th,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.150
17th, and 18th Centuries.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.360
We all felt a special debt
of gratitude to Marilynne

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.290
for breathing new life into the
old spiritual questions that had

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.370
so deeply moved these very early
Americans all too often consigned

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.420 position:56%
to the so-called dust bin of history
in our small part of the country.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.740
Her wonderful books have always
felt like letters from a friend.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.360
But, she's also, of course,
a great national figure

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.660
in our Republic of Letters.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.640
That's why tonight's
award means so much.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.500
We have some extraordinarily
literate people here

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.970
to assess her impact.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.240
I will conclude these introductory
remarks by simply saying welcome

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.850
and thank you for being here.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.660
Now, it's my pleasure to
introduce the Director of National

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.410
and International Outreach here at
the Library, the Former Director

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.100
of the Kluge Center,
and the Former President

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.940
of Bryn Mawr College,
Dr. Jane McAuliffe.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.740
Thank you.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.440
[applause]

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.740
&gt;&gt; JANE MCAULIFFE: Thank you, Ted.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.710
It's great to see all of you here
tonight to help us honor the work

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.230
of Marilynne Robinson,
winner of the 2016 Library

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050
of Congress Prize for
American Fiction.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.660
Welcome to the Library.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.740
I also want to welcome
our online audience,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.720
especially the Congressional United
Church of Christ in Iowa City

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.050
where Marilynne served as
a deacon for many years.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.120
The prize in American Fiction
stands as one of the highest honors

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.410
that the Library bestows on
a living American writer.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.700
It seeks to commend strong,
unique, enduring voices

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.800
that have told us something new
about the American experience.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.160
For those of you who weren't

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.970
at the National Book Festival
last September when the Librarian

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.350
of Congress presented Marilynne
with her prize, I can tell you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.290
that our winner had a lively
and insightful conversation

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.210
about her work with the festival's
Literary Director, Marie Arana.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.030
No single conversation,
however, could capture the power

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.870
of Marilynne's work,
which has received many

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.850
of the country's other top honors,
including the Pulitzer Prize,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.710
the National Book Critics
Circle Award,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.350
and the National Humanities Medal,
which brings us to tonight's event,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.280 position:56%
a conversation we're calling
Fiction, Faith, and the Imagination.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.600
We have an amazing
panel here with us,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.430
including two Pulitzer
Prize winners,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.630
Geraldine Brooks and Paul Harding.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.320
Paul studied under Marilynne at
the famed Iowa Writers' Workshop.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.620
We're also joined by the renowned
American physicist, Alan Lightman.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.190
And Dr. Steven Knapp, President

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.010
of George Washington University
will moderate the discussion.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.130
Of course, Marilynne is here
with us tonight as well.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:32.130
One of Marilynne's great admirers
is former President Barack Obama.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.870
He couldn't be with us tonight,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.880
but he sent a special
surprise message for Marilynne.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.880
Please let me read
President Obama's words.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.360
"Like most Americans, I first met
Marilynne Robinson on the pages

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.570
of one of her extraordinary novels.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.330
For me, it was Gilead, a book I'd
picked up as I was barnstorming

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.150
across Iowa during my first
campaign for president.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.140
In it, I met folks who were
decent and goodhearted,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.720
full of their own complexities
and struggles.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.390
I was absorbed into a story that
grapples equally with the blossoms

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.950
and the thorns in our relationships
with each other, with ourselves,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.810
with our Creator, and still
manages to achieve a level of grace

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.050
that we are all striving
for in our own lives.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.010
That's what Marilynne
does so brilliantly.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.690
She not only draws us into
the texture of the people

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.470
and the community she creates,
but wraps us all together

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.540 position:56%
in something larger, a patchwork of
characters, and readers, and author,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.220
of our struggles and our
delights, of our faith,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.080
our doubts, our redemption.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.800
And in so doing, she
elevates our understanding

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.060
of what it means to be fully human.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.930
That's what the highest
of art can achieve.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.060
It's what the greatest library
in the world should celebrate.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.500
It's what Marilynne Robinson seems

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.090
to radiate every time
she sits down to write.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.440
So, I want to once again
congratulate my friend, Marilynne,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.530
on her distinguished award.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.640
And I want to thank you all
for gathering together tonight

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.200
for something that for Marilynne
might be an even greater award,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.880
a thoughtful, lively
conversation on some

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.800
of the topics dear
to all our hearts.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.120
Have a great night everyone."

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.170
On that lovely note
from President Obama,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.310
please let me turn this evening
over to President Steven Knapp.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:54.170
[applause]

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.750
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Thank
you very much, Jane.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.870
It's a pleasure to welcome you.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.450
I'd also like to thank the
Center for Poetry and Literature,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.970
and the Kluge Center, and
their directors, Robert Casper

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.190
and Ted Widmer respectively
for hosting this event here

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.360
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.130
I want to say at the outset how
honored I am to be moderating

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.480
such a distinguished panel,
as you've already heard.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.030
I do think that President
Obama has just done a great job

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.020
of opening the panel discussion,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.330
but I'm going to still say a few
things before I start posing some

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.190
questions to our panelists.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.740
Our topic is the relationship
between faith and imagination.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.380 position:56%
I'm really not aware of the more
compelling instance of that relation

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.870
in modern fiction in the way
Marilynne Robinson reimagines the

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.190 position:56%
Christian, and more specifically the
Calvinist conception of divine grace

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.070
in the three novels
of her Gilead trilogy.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.800
Those are Gilead, Home,
and Lila, of course.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.350
She does so impart the remarkable
elaboration and transposition

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.090
of the most famous imaginative
depiction of divine grace

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.040
in the New Testament,
the so-called Parable

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.100
of the Prodigal Son
in the Gospel of Luke.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.800
A man has two sons,
and the younger asked

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.990
for his inheritance in advance.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.290
The father grants the request.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.020
The son goes off, squanders his
patrimony through dissonant living,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.190
and returns home impoverished
and disgraced.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.650
His father not only forgives him,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.820
but amazingly throws
a party in his honor.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.670
The older son, who was always
been dutiful and obedient,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.670
objects to this special treatment,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.700
but the father gently
rebukes him explaining that,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.010
"This brother of yours was
dead, and has come to life.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.920
He was lost and has been found."

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.260
I think I could show how echoes

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.280
of this parable pervade
Robinson's trilogy,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.000
but it's most obviously evoked
by the middle novel, Home.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.200
Home begins with a child's return
to a father, only this child,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.530
named Glory, is a younger
sister, not a brother.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.330
Her only sin was misplaced trust
in a fiancé who jilted her.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.840
She isn't greeted by
any sort of party,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.900
and she quickly assumes the role of
the dutiful and obedient caregiver

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.100
of her ailing father, Presbyterian
Minister Robert Boughton.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.810
The real prodigal son,
her elder brother,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.160
Jack, soon comes home as well.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.060
Much of the novel focuses
on his difficult

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.130
and never-quite-finished
reconciliation with their father.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.670
Jack, who remains the
father's favorite,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.710
despite his delinquent childhood
and his many years of absence

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.240
from the family home, eventually
leaves before disclosing the act

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.200
that would have been his
greatest sin in his father's eyes,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.500
but is also the source of
his own moral redemption,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.260
his marriage to an
African American woman

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.450
and his fathering of
a mixed-race son.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.880 position:56%
Jack's wife, Della, and son, Robert,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.070
show up at the family home
just after Jack has left.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.560
So, Glory, not the father,
finds out the truth.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.030
The novel ends with
Glory prophesying

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.960
in her own imagination the
day when Jack's son, Robert,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.980
will return to the homestead truly
answering his father's prayers

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.140
in a way that Jack never quite
answered his own father's prayers.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.980
And that, Glory sees
as the long delayed

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.690
but infinitely merciful
expression of God's grace.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.370 position:56%
Now that only scratches the surface
of Robinson's treatment of the theme

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.330
of grace, explicitly analyzed by
the terminally ill protagonist

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.110
and narrator of the first
novel, Reverend John Ames,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.920
and reworked in an entirely
new way through the thoughts

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.560 position:56%
of his religiously uneducated and
much younger wife, Lila, protagonist

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.100
and namesake of the third novel.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.400
What gives Robinson's exploration
of grace, its imaginative depth,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.810 position:56%
is not just the variety of personal
angles from which she approaches it,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.780
but the subtle way in which she
connects those personal stories

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:48.050 position:56%
with the salient movements and
events that inform or surround them.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.100
Abolitionism, the Civil War, the
Dust Bowl, the Great Depression,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.960
the beginning of the
Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.450
Throughout the trilogy,
these elements

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.500
of history sometimes lie dormant,
sometimes hunt the present,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.440
sometimes break violently through
the surface of her narrative.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.430
I'd like to start our discussion.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.660
I think I'll start with
you, Geraldine Brooks.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.230
Again, our topic is fiction,
faith, and imagination.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.290
As I just suggested, one
of the fascinating elements

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.010 position:56%
of Robinson's fiction is the way she
weaves together religious concerns

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.990
with a rich, historical context.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.410
What's your sense of the way
that works in her novels?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.030
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: Marilynne
Robinson's novels temporarily are

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.980
situated in the near past.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.090
It's not traditionally what would
be described as historical fiction.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:49.250 position:56%
It's in what I'd like to think of
as Henry James' designated safe zone

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.290
because James famously once
observed that any attempt to write

00:11:54.290 --> 00:12:00.070 position:56%
about a period more than 50 years
removed from one's zone is worthless

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.310
and should not be attempted

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:10.370
because the old consciousness
will be too elusive to us.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.970
Actually, if you think about it,
if you're a novelist in the middle

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:22.530 position:56%
of the journey of your life, that
50-year window added to the 50 years

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.370
of your own experience gives
you an entire century in which

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.950
to apply your trade, which is a
not ungenerous period of time.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.530
And I think in the case of
Marilynne's luminous novels,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:46.330 position:56%
this is very important because I
can't imagine Gilead set after 1960.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:53.260
I think it is much better set in
the slightly more distant past.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.680
Perhaps, if you wanted to
look for a dividing line,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.720
it would be before you could
possibly have a Time Magazine cover

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.020
that said, "Is God Dead?"

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:10.250
I think you're in a time period
where the corrosive influence

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:16.440
of materialistic skepticism has not
yet eroded the social fabric of,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.070
at least, the English-speaking
world to the extent

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.520
that happened perhaps
after the '60s.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:33.030
It reminds me of a wonderful essay
by James Wood in his collection

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:40.280
of The Broken Estate where he talks
about how the novel itself was,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:50.620
in a way, corrosive to faith
because the novel is an as-if form.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.730
You're creating as if, but
you're not creating certainty.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:02.430
And he talks about the very few
brilliant writers who are able

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.380
to retain a mysticism and a
religious element in their fiction

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.960
with the true belief
in fiction itself

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.160
and the prophecies of fiction.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.060
He singles out Virginia Woolf and
talks about the gentle dalliance

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.330
that she has between
religion and mysticism.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.780
And I think that Marilynne Robinson
is not a gentle dalliance at all.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.410
It is a passionate,
sweaty, congress.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:38.280
I think it works very beautifully
because she sees the mystical

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.180
and religious in the ordinary.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.510
It doesn't have to be a
virgin birth to be wonderful

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:50.070
because any birth is a miracle
as Ames' love for his young son,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.260 position:56%
so beautifully evoked, demonstrates.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.250
Then, I think of that wonderful
passage that Ames reflects

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.350
that light is constant and
we just turn over in it.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.650
Every day is one day.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.950
Once you have that
thought, then who needs

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.250
to argue whether the world
was created in six days?

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.550
It becomes a magnificent
irrelevancy.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.850
You can have the faith without.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.150
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Thanks very much.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.450
Thank you.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.710
Alan, you're, among
other things, a novelist.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:21.460
You have many roles, but you're
a novelist who's written Mr. g,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:30.740
a speculative novel about
the ultimate reality.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.040
You're also a scientist.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.150
As we know, some prominent
scientists of recent years,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.720
and this relates to the
corrosive materialism

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.280
that Geraldine just mentioned,
you've noticed how in recent years,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.260
science has been highly
critical of religion,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.440
and tend to affirm
evidence-based reasoning

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.480
and contrast to reliance on faith.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.450
Defenders of religion
often respond by arguing

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.130
that science itself relies
on its own kind of faith.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.430
What's your take on that?

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.900
Does faith play a role in science?

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.810
If so, what kind of faith?

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.820
How do you think about
that in relation

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.720
to your imaginative engagement
with both religion and science?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.380
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I think,
for me, faith is belief

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.470
in something that you can't prove.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:22.980 position:56%
The folklore is that everything
that science believes, it can prove,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:29.550
and nothing that religion
believes, it can prove.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:38.840
I think that science and religion
have very different methods

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:46.700
of arriving at their beliefs, but
I think there is a faith in both.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:53.180
The faith in science is something
that's very, very fundamental,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.530
the kind of faith that
scientists have.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:03.590
It's something that one might call
the central doctrine of science.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.050
And the central doctrine
of science is

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:13.430
that the universe is
lawful and logical.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:23.340
It's a doctrine that we scientists,
learn as graduate students.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.620
We may not learn it
consciously but it's in the air.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.140
It's a belief that just
osmosis into the skin.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:39.180
It's a fundamental working
belief that scientists have.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.290
It's a belief that can't be proved.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:49.500
It has to be taken on faith because
no matter how much science knows

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:56.230
and no matter how successful our
theories are, they're incomplete.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:02.010 position:56%
There are things that we don't know,
which Marilynne has talked about,

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.640
things that science doesn't know.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.230
We can't be certain that all parts

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.040
of the universe are
lawful and logical.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.350
We don't know for sure whether some
new phenomena discovered tomorrow

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.070
will be lawful and logical.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.370
We can't be certain.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:26.070
The belief in the central
doctrine that everything

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:32.540
in the physical universe is lawful
and logical, that is something

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.830
that has to be taken on faith.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.790
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: You've also
expressed the interest of times

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.960
in relation between physical and
nonphysical conceptions of reality.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.490
Can you say maybe a little bit
more about that as a physicist,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.070
and how you think about
the nonphysical?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:54.400
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Marilynne
has written wonderfully

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:01.140
about science and religion.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:10.650
She suggests in her writing
that we make too much a deal

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.280
out of the difference between
the physical and nonphysical,

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.450
but we make too big a distinction.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:22.460
What she says, and please
correct me, Marilynne,

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.750
if I'm getting you wrong.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.000
She says that because
the knowledge of science

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.600
about the physical
universe is incomplete

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:42.400
that we can't confidently
make an opposition

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.660
between the physical universe
and a nonphysical universe

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.880
because we don't really fully
understand the physical universe.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.990
I agree with part of
that, but not all of it.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.750
I do agree that the
knowledge of science

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.450
about the physical
universe is incomplete.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:09.450
For me, as both a scientist, and
a humanist, and if I can say,

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.680
a spiritual person, I think the
distinction between the physical

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.260
and the nonphysical
universe is very important.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:26.150
I think that there are
experiences that we have

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.270
and probably everybody
here has had them,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.590
you could call them
transcendent experiences,

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.450
that science will never be able
to explain even in principle,

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.850
will never be able
to fully comprehend.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:47.550
You can hook a hundred billion
electrodes to my neurons

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.330
and measure every electrical
output of each neuron,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.080
but that will not explain the
experience that I have in looking

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.190 position:56%
at the stars at night or the feeling

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.580
that there's something
larger than myself.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:10.960
That, for me, is part of
the nonphysical universe.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:21.730
If we believe in God, if God
exists, every religion that I know

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:28.200 position:56%
of has a conception of God in which
God does not live in time and space.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.700
God is not subject
to laws and rules.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.870
And so God would also be a part

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.660
of what I would call the
nonphysical universe.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:43.860
On the other hand, I am a strong
subscriber to the central doctrine

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.580
of science having said all of that.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.700
And I do think that there
is a vast range of phenomena

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.900 position:56%
that science does understand, that
science can explain, that is subject

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.520
to the laws that we understand, and
I call that the physical universe.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.660
So, I need to have a distinction
between those two universes

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:13.560
to live a life both as a
scientist and as a humanist.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.860
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Do you
want to say a little bit

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.660
about how your novelistic
interest fit into that?

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.960
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: How?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.260
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: How
your interest as a writer

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.130
of fiction yourself are
related to that distinction?

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.870
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well
I, I wrote a book,

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:37.850
my novel called Mr. g. That's a
lower case "G" standing for god.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.120
It's a book that tells
the story of creation

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.050
from the point of view of God.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.890
God is the narrator of the book.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:54.190
God has an uncle and an aunt
who are always chastising him

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:59.720
for not getting things right.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.620
The universe that God
creates is a lawful universe.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:14.530
God considers the possibility
of entering the universe,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.370
and intervening, and performing
miracles, which would be unlawful,

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.950
and would violate the
central doctrine of science,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.240
but God chooses not to do that.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:34.870
For me, this was an important
exploration for me to think

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:40.660
about how the physical and the
spiritual universes could exist

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.120
in harmony with each other
without any contradiction.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.550
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: We've
talked a little bit

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.460
about how the imagination
engages the not-too-distant past.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.470
We've talked now about how the
imagination negotiates the path

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.640
between the common physical

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.140
and nonphysical dimensions
of our experience.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.890
I want to shift to a
slightly more personal take

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.950
on Marilynne Robinson's
career, and that is to do, Paul,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.640
with her role as a teacher.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.120
In the courses that happened,
you've been a student of hers.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.590
I wonder if you could say
a little bit about what

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.830
that experience was like, and
does the intersection of faith

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.040
and imagination also play a role
in the classroom, in her classroom?

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.110
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: I can say
that it was a good experience

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.950
to be Marilynne's student.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:31.200 position:56%
Just to start anecdotally, I had the
experience of having been a drummer

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.300
in a rock band for many years.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:40.160
The rock band broke up, and
came time for me to get a job.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.840
I was so teared to that
prospect, so I thought,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.660
"I'll just go to grad school."

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:51.460
Like a lot of writers, people who
become writers, I was a reader.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.260
I thought of myself as a writer
long before I wrote anything.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.780
I just walked around saying,
"I'm the writer in the family."

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:03.740
I, finally, had the opportunity
to take a fiction writing class

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.210
at Skidmore College in Saratoga.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.450
Just by luck of lottery,
I signed up for a class,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.360
and Marilynne Robinson walked in.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.780
Within 10 minutes of her starting
to talk about the life of the mind,

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:24.590
our spirituality, history, I knew
that that's the life I wanted

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:30.250
for my own mind, and want
to try to emulate that.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:35.270
I was lucky enough to
be able to follow her

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.660
to that Iowa Writers' Workshop
at the University of Iowa.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.290
I think the day I found out I
got into Iowa was the day I found

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.850 position:56%
out that she had won the Strauss
Living award and was not going to be

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.270 position:56%
in Iowa while I was a student there.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.600
I had to figure out
how to make my breaks.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.290
She taught a class
in the Old Testament

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.380
at the Congregational
Church in Iowa City.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.850
I think that was the first time I
studied the Old Testament with her.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.610
I've used the analogy before
but being able to study

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.000
with Marilynne is like the
difference between sitting

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.330
in a seminar room and
studying Paradise Lost,

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.810
and sitting in a seminar
room with John Milton.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.710
It really is that profound.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.130
She taught me fellowship.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.800
She taught me how to treat
other human beings as reverence,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.410
which as a skeptic
fresh from sophomore,

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.830
my sophomore skepticism
class, I was not in the habit

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.710
of granting other people reverence
or respect in a way that was

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:49.910
like running into the best brick
wall you could ever run into.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:54.070
I think all of these things
aligned telescopically in the way

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.110
that she teaches, the way that she
thinks, the way that she writes,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.110
the way that she models
the life of the mind,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.630
the intensity, and
the honesty of it.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.780 position:56%
She often says that your job as a
fiction writer is to write sentences

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.020
that are true, which is the
contradictory because of a lot

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.700
of the anecdotal thing that fiction
writers get on stage, and they say,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.250
"I have to become a fiction writer
because I'm a pathological liar."

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:26.950
Then, over the years, I had
never considered religion.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.570
I grew up innocent of religion,
I would say innocent just

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.990
in a strict sense of I
did not go to church.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.650
My family was neither
antagonistic toward religion

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.050
or sympathetic with it.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:46.100
A certain point though, admiring
Marilynne as much as I did,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.130
it occurred to me that if I
were to ask her what the source

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.830
of her artistic and
intellectual sophistication was,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.830
she would say her religion.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.910
Being inclined to respect her,
I thought, "Maybe I better look

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.840
into this theology
business and faith."

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.480
I also wanted to be able to have
something to talk about with her

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.690
when I cornered her for
coffee, which is another story.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.070
So, I read Calvin's Institutes.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.550
And I started reading Karl
Barth's Church Dogmatics.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.760
We started having these
wonderful conversations

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.190
that haven't ended yet.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.720
I think the theologian, Karl Barth,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.220
says that we are all
ordained to fellowship.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.510
I think that's one of the things
that has really struck me deeply

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.460
and has never stopped resonating.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:49.160
I'd say that the intersection of
her faith and the imagination,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.230
I don't know that she'd
make a distinction.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:57.750
Just in terms and she's written
about this, but I think she thinks

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.420
of her faith, and I'm
paraphrasing, so it's not like,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.810
"I just think she might," but
I think she thinks of her faith

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:07.540
as a given of experience,
one of the great given.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.320
It's "phenomenological"
to put in secular terms.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.760
It's a gift.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.280
She cites William James with that.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:27.290
She says she takes an
exalted view of experience.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:33.090
She never openly proselytizes
in class or anything

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.280
but she embodies the
virtues of the best parts

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.860
of her own faith and of grace.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:44.520
By embodying them, it
inspired her students.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.830
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Good, thank you.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.130
That's a terrific tribute.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.840
I do want to say that as a
sometimes scholar of Milton,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.520 position:56%
you would not have enjoyed a seminar
with John Milton quite the same.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.660
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: It shows
poorly a parodistic quality

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.420
of mind, maybe not personal.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.260
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: That's bad,
yeah, if you're talking to her.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.670
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: Shakespeare maybe.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.850
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: I'm really
struck by what you said about,

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.490
and maybe she can comment
on this at some point,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.510
about Marilynne Robinson's
not really drawing as much

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.190
of a distinction between
faith and panel ...

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.990
We could start with anyone who's
interested in taking this up.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:26.620 position:56%
How do you think about the
imagination as one might anticipate?

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.460
I'm curious what each of
the panelist has to say

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.440
about that question, and that
is how close the relation

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.180
between faith and imagination?

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.880
How do each of you
sort of experience

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.620
that because one could
say that in these novels,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:45.770
one has an extraordinarily intimate
engagement with the consciousness

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.510
of the characters she depicts.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.580
Sometimes, that line becomes a
little bit difficult to draw.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.270
I mentioned the prophetic
moment at the end of Home

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:57.770
where Glory imagines decades in
the future when a fulfillment

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.320
of this story of grace will occur.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.720
Who knows whether it
actually will or not.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.500
That, in a way, is
a gesture of faith.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.890
In another sense, it is
a moment of imagining.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.200
I just wondered if maybe
each of the distinctions

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.500
and similarities overlap
inner penetration

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.800
of faith and imagination?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.730
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: I actually
feel very sorry for people

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.990
who don't have any
religious education.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.680
I've had two separate ones.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.070
Possibly, even three.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.650
I was raised Roman Catholic

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:35.840
in a very traditional baroque
Irish style, educated by nuns.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:44.310
And I think that the great
gifts of that time were capacity

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.610
for abstract thought because
when you tell a seven-year-old

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:53.960
that there are three persons in
one God, you are really opening

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.750
up the idea of abstract thought
in a very particular way.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.560
And the other thing I'm
grateful for is the sense

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.150
of metaphor that you get.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:11.650
I remember Benediction, and the
Litany of Mary, and the long list

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:17.090
of ways that you can evoke
Mary as the Lily of the Valley,

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.240
the Star of the Sea,
the Mystic Rose.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.150
I think that religion opens
you up to imagination.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.260
In later life, I've
embraced Judaism,

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.020
which some would say is a much
more hardheaded piece of business.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.360 position:56%
I also studied Islam very closely
in my years a foreign correspondent.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.840
Living among the women of Islam who
had made a very different choice

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:49.200
to my own, which was to embrace
an orthodox version of faith

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.000
that I found very confounding.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.350
I wanted to explore
why they had done that.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.440
But, I love what Marilynne once
said when somebody asked her

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.800
if she'd had an ecstatic
religious experience, and she said,

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.990
"That would be wasted on me,"

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.850
because she finds the
ordinary so numinous.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.950 position:56%
And I think that that is what a
religious imagination gives you is a

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:19.030
sense of noticing the
divinity in the ordinary.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.150
That's why I like Jewish press
so much because most of it is

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:27.760
about being grateful for
noticing the dew on the grass,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.020
the first sliver of the new moon,
blessing the bread, and the wine,

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.100
and your children every
single Friday night.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.200
That is a good habit of
mind to get into, I think.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.500
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: What else?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.320
Do you want to pick
that up at all, Alan?

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.460
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I think of
faith as belief in the unseen.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.820
To me, that's very
close to the imagination

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:06.160
because in the imagination, we
are creating things in our minds

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:15.550
that may not be concrete, that
may not be visible; and yet,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:27.650
they are ideas that motivate us,
that provoke us, that stimulate us.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:37.780
And so that's a connection that
I see at a really low level

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.870
between faith and imagination.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.180
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: I think
the act of creating art,

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:50.260
and the act of cultivating your
imagination, the discipline

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.510
of observation, and the discipline
of being able to observe things

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:00.140
as intensely and as closely
as possible, and render them

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.240
on to the pages aesthetically,
to put aesthetic pressure on them

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:08.010
in the case of writing
fiction is an act of devotion.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.320
It's an act of obedience.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.140
It's an act of prayer.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.690 position:56%
With that beautiful kind of
commerce between, it's in your mind.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:21.230
There's this onto-epistemological
state

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.850
where your mind is generating these
aesthetic productions and working

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.860
with metaphors that are so bound.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.160
They build up.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.460
Then, they topple.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.760
You build them up again.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.960
But, then, you end up with this
book that goes out into the world.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.980
As a writer, you understand that
this book is going to interact

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.840
with other people and their lives,
and it's going to have this ...

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.260
Again, back to fellowship,
but also the act of faith.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:53.630
These works of art have to be made
in good faith because they're going

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.770
to go out and affect
other people's lives.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.600
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: It occurs
to me that one of the ways

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.780
in which the interplay of
faith and imagination works

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.270
in Marilynne Robinson's
fiction, in particular,

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.940
has to do with the way
persons engage each other,

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.800
and try to understand each
other, and that it's the mystery

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.070
of other persons becomes
an occasion for.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.690
It's almost like you can only
gauge other people through an act

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.290
of solitude, an act of
faith, and a measure.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.290
I'm thinking of the various
efforts that characters make

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.650
to understand each other,
whether it's John Ames trying

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.740
to understand his slightly mad
grandfather and the relation

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.490
between his father
and his grandfather.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:31.160
Lila trying to understand this
new world, and feel her way

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.010
into the alien world of
John Ames, and his theology,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.340
or everyone is trying to understand
Jack, and what makes him work,

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.440
and he doesn't seem to quite
understand himself, and almost has

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.310
to engage himself in the same way.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.940
There's this constant sense
of engagement with mystery

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.240
when you're dealing with persons.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.900
It's not just the supernatural
realm.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.470
It's actually the everyday
interchange of human relations

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.900 position:56%
that becomes this occasion for faith

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.530
and imaginative engagement
with others.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.650
There's another element to
this, which we haven't brought

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.840
into that's been at the edges of
what we've been talking about.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.440
I think this is something,
Geraldine,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.370
you said you might have
an issue talking about it.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.040
We've been talking about pretty
ponderous and grand subjects here,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.820
but there's also an element of wit
and humor that I think you wanted

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.180
to make sure you didn't ignore,
if you could maybe take us

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.500
in that direction a little bit.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.800
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: Yeah.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:32.450
I think everybody is so odd by
the grandeur, and the achievement,

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.540
and the penetration into
soul that Marilynne achieves,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.140
but they're very funny books.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.650
In places, extremely funny books.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:46.620
I think of some of the
characterizations in housekeeping

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.010
where everybody is struggling
to understand each other.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:59.490
It's just a wonderful sense
of the essential unknowability

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.380
of even the people that you're
closest to, and you love the most,

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.010
and why did they do that?

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:12.450
Since that just made me smile
and chuckle, the good women

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:18.460
of Fingerbone coming to see about
the children with the best will

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.700
in the world is so
deliciously invoked.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:25.030
Then, my other favorite scene is
in Gilead, the characterization

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.400
of Ames' father and his
grandfather when they're very,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.710
very angry at each other.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:39.280
Every sentence ends with
Reverend, thrown as a javelin.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.670
Yeah, I think the wit is something

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.950
that should not be either
overlooked or underestimated.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Does that also come

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.160
through the classroom
would say, Paul?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.020
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: Absolutely, yes.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:39:01.290
Just wicked isn't the right word
but pry, understated profound.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:07.240
Yes, yes. I'll just leave it there.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.460
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Another, I
talked about the thing of grace,

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.610
but there's another biblical theme
that runs through these novels.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.180
It has to do with an
interest in outsiders.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.670
I think, Paul, you had mentioned an
interest in the biblical emphasis

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:24.160
and social justice, and especially
as it's figured as the commitment

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.160
to care for the stranger, the
widow, the orphan, and so on.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.460
Can you talk a little about it?

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.760
I know you're interested in
that element of the fiction,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.520
if you could talk a little
bit about that perhaps.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.290
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: I think it
begins with just the lives

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:42.310
that she has taken the time
to devote her attention to.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:47.410
As you say that, I'm particularly
thinking about Lila in this case

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.240 position:56%
where she is poor, she is an orphan,

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.920
she's Ruth weeping
in the alien corner.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.750
That's a line from the Keats poem.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.990
Just by the act of devoting and
lavishing that quality of attention

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.890
on lives that would otherwise
go unremarked of a piece

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:13.190
like the active obedience,
the act of faith,

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:17.530
the act of your imagination
being a gesture

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:23.290
of fellowship towards these lives
that would not be otherwise noted,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:29.350 position:56%
and the kind of lives that get swept
into the corners by because all

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:35.970
of the kings and the princes,
and the judges are up to no good.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:43.350
This is another thing about if
one thing makes the Lord angry,

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.570
it's not taking care of
the widow and the stranger,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.440
and the hungry, and the orphan.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.200
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: In the trilogy,
there's an absent version of this

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.660
that nevertheless haunts
all the narratives

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.360
and only really surfaces
explicitly at moments.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.400
That's the racial division of
the country, which, obviously,

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.100
is something that everyone is

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.260
so strongly focused on
in our culture today.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.900
Of course, it comes in and out,
but it's always in the background,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.100
and even going back to the
tension between the father

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.480
and grandfather in Gilead.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.700
It's a diversion of this
question of otherness.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.030
I wonder if anybody would like
to say anything about their sense

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.710
of how the racial dynamics
play out in all these writings?

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.030
Maybe you want to comment on that.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.330
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: I think

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.330 position:56%
that that's perhaps the most
magnificent achievement of Gilead is

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.990
that it is a story about love,

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.180
and it's a very intimate
portrayal of love that does this.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:50.270
It's managed to digest this
elephant, which is who are you

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.490
when conscience demands
something of you.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:58.090
There are so many different
answers given to that question.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.420 position:56%
As Ames is writing to his young son,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.730
he talks about that
fierce old urgency.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:08.150
That is a such a great
characterization of the question

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:11.110
that the Civil War
asked of everybody

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.660
that was required to
live through it.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.960
Who are you?

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.260
How did you respond?

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.690
I lived for a while not far from
here in a Quaker town in Waterford,

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:25.810
Virginia, which was
settled in 1733 by Quakers,

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:30.610
and was one of the few places where
free blacks could live unharassed

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.400
in Virginia before the Civil War.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.180
When the war came, a
number of young men

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.540
in that town faced
the terrible choice,

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.580
which was the greater
evil violence or slavery.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:47.840
Some of the young men in that town
made the choice to take up arms

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.820
and fight against slavery,
but that meant

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.700
that they were rid out
meeting in the town.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.870
And I think that those
choices that we make

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:06.960
as individuals are
really what Marilynne is

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.440
so exquisitely gifted at exploring.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.370
Who makes what choice?

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.700
What are the ramifications of it?

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.280
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Someone mentioned
earlier this numinous character

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.730
of the ordinary that
I think comes through.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.280
You mentioned it coming
through in the teaching

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.760
and coming through in the fiction.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:34.970 position:56%
We haven't talked very much about
the rather pervasive role of weather

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:39.740
or seasonal change, the
interface of the things happening

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.050
on the edges of the town.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.560
The town is already
in the rural setting.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.570
Then, the way characters move
through that landscape and so on,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.410
and what happens to them in
their engagement with nature.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.630
I think you had an
interesting saying about nature.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.450
I think you talked about
Calvin's interest in nature

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.590
as the shining garment of which God
has both revealed and concealed.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.380
It's a little bit related to what
we're saying with the physical

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.030
but a slightly different
angle on it, I think.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:08.470
Maybe talk a little bit about
the role of the natural world,

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.990
not as a physical universe,
but specifically the landscape,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.470
the climate, the weather,
the seasonal change.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:22.520
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: I think
the description of the lake

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.300
in Housekeeping, the lake is
almost as important a character

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.970
as any of the human beings.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.270
The lake has a voice.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.130
The lake has a presence.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.750
The lake will come, and
infiltrate your life,

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.430
and change how you can live.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:43.320
I think that that modesty in
the face of nature is something

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.660
that we all need to be a little
bit more ready to concede.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:58.430
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: I think of it
in terms of, partially anyway,

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.000
the transcendentalist tradition.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.300
I think of Emerson.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.390
I think of Wallace Stevens as well

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.480
who I consider an honorary
transcendentalist,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.780
and Emily Dickinson.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.010
It reminds me of a line in
Housekeeping that I always think

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.690
of when Ruth is in the
bottom of the boat.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.750
She bought him a boat, and
they're going across the lake.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.050
She's very tired.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.140
She closes her eyes,
and allows her mind

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.820
to become coextensive
with the darkness.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.800
I think, when I read
landscape, I just read it

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.510
as a projection of character.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.040
It's coextensive with character.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.070
Again, it's a phenomenological.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.610
It's experiential.

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:42.320
Landscape does not exist
independently of the perception

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.620
and the experience of it.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.160
So, there's a refractive
quality to it.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.720
The objective landscape
is being refracted

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.850
through an experiencing subject.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.310
It becomes another
numinous, luminous,

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:01.360
beautiful way of rendering
character.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.930
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: Also, I think,
another really indelible moment

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:13.380
for me is the description of Ames
and his father at the grave site.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.610
It's an ugly piece of land.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:22.810
Then, in a moment, when it's decked
with light, it becomes beautiful.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.960
Again, it's a little bit Thoreau,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.740
"Only that day dawns
to which I am awake."

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.880
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: The sun is
setting, and the moon is rising,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.440
and they're creating
schemes of light.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.740
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yes, I think too.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.960
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Yeah,
it's an amazing moment.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.100
Alan, as a scientist, how do you
think about the role of landscape?

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.710
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I
think our relationship

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:51.940
to nature is extremely
interesting and complicated.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:47:04.420
I think there's one metaphor
of nature, of Mother Nature

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.230
that nature is going
to take care of us.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:16.870
The maternal feeling
that nature comforts us.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:25.870
Then, on the other hand, we have
earthquakes that kill thousands

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:31.690
of people, natural disasters.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:37.890
I remember being out on the ocean
in a small boat for the first time

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:44.350 position:56%
by myself with my wife, and looking
around, and seeing nothing but water

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.610
in every direction,
no land in sight.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:59.940
I felt like I was in a vast place
that didn't care about me at all.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:06.430
There was no sense of
some consciousness there.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:13.750
And so I think there's a tension
between these two different views

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.270
of what nature is and our
relationship to nature

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:21.580
that can be found in our
literature, and our history,

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.090
and anthropology, and
everything else.

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.570
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: At
least, you were there

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.670
to notice that nobody noticed you.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:33.760
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: That's
really important.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.060
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.210
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: You
may have noticed

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.970
that we have an empty
chair on the stage here.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:45.350
It's actually not for Elijah, which
is what you may have been thinking.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.810
I was certainly honored.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:53.430
I think we all would be if perhaps
Marilynne Robinson herself might

00:48:53.430 --> 00:49:23.970
join us on stage for a few moments.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.270
[applause]

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.570
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: I think the
idea now is that we'd invite you

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.950
to react a little bit to what
you've heard, or add whatever you

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.780
like to add, or take us in whatever
direction you want to take us.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: First of all,

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:40.430
I have to say that this the
most self-indulgent fantasy I've

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.260
ever had.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.270
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: We try
to do that in Washington.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.780
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
This is better than most.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.080
It's just fascinating.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.780
I couldn't be more pleased.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:06.560 position:56%
I think that Paul had said something
very descriptive, which is that I'm

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.630
so immersed in my own particular
habit of thought that I do tend

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:20.250
to try to do variations on it, look
through it as a prism or a lens.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:30.760 position:56%
I have become deeply immersed in
theology that I basically inherited,

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.060
although I wasn't aware of it.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.550
A little Presbyterian
knowing nothing

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:37.700
about what I was being taught.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:42.630 position:56%
Then, I began to realize that it was
a serious theology highly available

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:50.830
to me, and that I felt as if,
if you grant it its terms,

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.070
it can tell you certain
kinds of things.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.540
Another theology might
tell you other things.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:51:00.950
This was the one that I
found myself engrossed by.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:06.280
And it has this certain emphasis.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.920
One of them is the idea, which you
find very much in writers of this,

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.500
tradition especially
the earlier ones,

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:21.820 position:56%
that the beautiful is a signature of
God, and that it's almost a question

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.600
of individual consciousness whether
or not you perceive the beautiful.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:32.960
And the assumption is more or less
that it is always there one way

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.150
or another to be perceived.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:41.320
The beauty of creation is implicit.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.790
People have to learn how
to see in order to see it.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.250
The further you go into seeing
it, the more the richness

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.700
of it becomes apparent to you.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.380
I find this to be a very, very
fruitful way for me to think,

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:04.210
in any case, in the moment of
interaction between two people,

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:08.710
what passes between them that
could be called beautiful.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:15.780 position:56%
And another thing that I like very
much about it is the humanism of it,

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.360
the assumption that every
encounter between two people,

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:26.470
between one's self and another,
is a question being posed by God.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.330
And your question is, what does
God want from this interaction?

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:33.620
The way in which it's
articulated as an idea is

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:39.560
that the other being an image of
God virtually is God because all

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.100
of interactions have that
degree of theological weight.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.410
The other is God.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:49.050
The other is Christ.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:54.160
Again, from the point of
view of making inquiries

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.910
into your experience as
a mortal human being,

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:05.220
there's almost no more radically
illuminating question than,

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.910
"What would God want
from this situation?"

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:14.600
because as it's articulated,
God either is the other person,

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.310
or is very deeply sympathetic
with the other person.

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:25.440
I think that's kind of an
aesthetic, an ethical aesthetic

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.690
that is very moving to me.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:34.030
These are probably the
two assumptions that come

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:38.640
out of my own religious
background or theology that I find

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.170
to be most useful to
me as a novelist.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.470
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Very good.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.660
Are there elements of what you
heard from the panel up here

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:52.980
that you wanted to push
back on in any way?

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.280
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
Dr. Lightman is going

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.690
to know that I'm going to ...

00:53:55.690 --> 00:54:00.940
No. It comes down to a
question of what you call real.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:06.470 position:56%
For example, if you look at
something, and trying to saturate it

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:11.610
with an aesthetic value,
including the reality of the level

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:15.120
of plank lengths, if
that is beautiful,

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.320
then the beauty is a
thing that exist also.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.970
Do you know what I mean?

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:24.470 position:56%
There's that level of comprehension,
or understanding, or a perception

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.570
that complicates the
idea of reality, I think,

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.710
in an incredibly rich way.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:37.210
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Do you
want to say anything?

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:41.840
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I agree
that nature is beautiful,

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.110
but you mentioned reality.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:54.580
Scientists don't really
know what reality is.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.880
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I know.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.180
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Wait.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.480
[laughter]

00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.780
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
They say beautiful things

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.830
about it all the time.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.720
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: They say
beautiful things about it.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:10.050
I think philosophers, if
anybody knows what reality is,

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.210
it might be philosophers.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.060
Scientists certainly don't
claim they know what reality is.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:22.730
Scientists, what we know as
scientists is the readings

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:31.610
of volt meters, and what science
is about for us is the ability

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.590
to predict where that needle
is going to go when you hook it

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:38.180
up to a certain electrical circuit.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.290
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I
think you're too modest.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:42.590
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: We have theories,

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.920
and I would say even
beautiful theories.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: There you go.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.520
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Mathematically
beautiful theories that try

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.790
to predict where that
needle is going to go.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:57.040
Those theories have
internal beauties.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:01.760
Ultimately, we're not saying
anything about reality.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.620
Reality, to me, is a
very abstract conception

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:14.470
that all we really know is
our experience with the world.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:19.380
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I agree
that reality is a very elusive ...

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.700
It depends on the scale at which
your attention falls on it,

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.820
what it appears to be, et cetera.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:32.790
If that is true, then ...

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:38.140
For example, if you show a theory
to another scientist, and he says,

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.900
"That is not elegant,"
he's made a statement

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.140
that he thinks has something
to do with reality, right?

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:49.040
If you say it's beautiful, that
has something to do with reality.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.340
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: No.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.360
I'm totally in agreement with you

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.530
that scientific theories
can be beautiful,

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:03.100
as well as the objects
they described.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:09.130
What science has found remarkably
is that the theories that we,

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:14.440
human beings, deemed elegant
happened to be the ones

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.240
that agree most closely with
where that needle is going

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.100
to point on the volt meter.

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:26.190
When a scientist says
to another scientist

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:31.410
that that theory is
inelegant, it's not elegant,

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.420
I don't think that she means

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:37.300
that the theory doesn't
correspond a reality.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.620
I think that she means that the
theory probably is not going

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.620
to agree with experiment because
we have found that elegance

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:52.970
and our aesthetic judgments seem to
accord with the behavior of nature,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:57.050
which is a miracle in itself.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:59.940
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
I love your language,

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:09.120
but if you can use the word beauty,
and be mutually intelligible,

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:13.530
and it has a predictive
power in terms of meters,

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:20.090
if that's what you want to
say, then beauty exists.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I certainly agree.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.670
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
Part of reality.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:32.850
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: It exists in the
sense that various people can look

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:39.910
at a painting, let's say the
Mona Lisa or some other painting

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:44.030
that we know, Picasso Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon,

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:49.160
and all feel that it's beautiful;
or read one of your novels,

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:56.030
and you get a consensus that
is beautiful, whether or not

00:58:56.030 --> 00:59:00.610
that means the beauty exists
as an abstract concept

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.960
out there in the universe.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.280
That's something that I
don't know, but certainly,

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.970
if a lot of different
people can agree

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.670
that a particular thing
is beautiful.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:17.780
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: If
it disciplines thought.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.940
For example, "That
theory won't work.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.280
It is not beautiful."

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.190
That's not just an
aesthetic statement.

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:27.350
It's a prediction about
the utility of-

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:28.650
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: It is.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:33.120
Again, I think it goes
back to the remarkable fact

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.600
that our aesthetic sense, which
is related to what we consider

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:43.000 position:56%
to be beautiful, seems to accord
with the workings of nature because,

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.820
by and large, the theories that we
have thought were beautiful turned

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.920
out to be the right ones.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.820
When I say right, I mean in a
sense that they're able to predict

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.670
where the needle goes
on the volt meter.

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.440
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Apart from
the question of predictability

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.230
and so on, there's another
way in which philosophers

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.600
of science talk about, I think,
this conversation we're having.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.150
That's the question of what
are called emergent properties

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.100
and emergent reality.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.830
And maybe that's another
way to get at this.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:15.500
That is from the phenomena that as
they occur in the natural world,

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.370
there arise things like beauty.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:19.950
There arise things
like consciousness.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:24.930
There arise open all mind, which
on some accounts are just illusory.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:28.830
And that's a certain version of an
emergent theory as it plays itself

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:32.060
out in philosophy debates about
science, philosophical debates.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.190
On another account,
those are realities.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.120
They're real properties that emerge

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.280
from the actualities
of physical processes.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.890
Are you an emergentist just by any
chance, Alan, or anti-emergentist?

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:54.900
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: I agree with that
that there are properties of nature

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:59.170
that cannot be understood
in terms of the workings

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:01.180
of the individual pieces.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.920
When you put all the pieces
together, you get something

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.180
that is qualitatively different,
not just quantitatively.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Might
you agree with Marilynne

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.530
that beauty might be one of
those emergent properties?

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:16.830
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.130
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Okay.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.810
[laughter] That's the other
way we do things in Washington.

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.030
[laughter] I'm glad
to say, at this point,

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.610
I think this might not be a
very good moment to do this.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:38.000
We actually have microphones set
up in either of the two aisles.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.820
For the interest of time, what we'd
like to do is find out if those

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.250
who would like to ask questions
of Ms. Robinson or the panel,

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.340
if you line up behind the
two mics that we have here.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.900
We'll go back and forth
between the two aisles.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.270
Anyone who would like to make
a comment, pose a question,

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.890
we'll be delighted to have
lined up at this point.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.240
Again, they're a third
all the way up the aisle.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.580
I will get through as many as
we can in the next 20 minutes

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:09.260
or so if anyone is
interested in doing that.

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:13.980
If anyone wants to come down,
I think we have a couple

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.280
of people who are approaching.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:24.460
I'll just start over here, house
left, stage right, here you go.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.760
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Hello.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.060
This is loud.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.030
Hi. I've really been
enjoying this conversation.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:31.350
Thank you so much.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:35.360
I wanted to go back to something
that Paul said about Marilynne

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:43.820 position:56%
as a teacher, Ms. Robinson, that she
embodied the virtue of her beliefs.

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:49.270 position:56%
And I wanted to connect that to what
you were just talking about beauty.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:54.950
Do you feel that experiencing
beautiful objects,

01:02:54.950 --> 01:03:00.940
things makes us better people?

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.250
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I think
that we made better people

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.790
by being attentive to beauty
perhaps in forms that have not

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:11.160
yet been perceived as beautiful.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.580
I think it's much more a habit
of mine that is called for rather

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.980
than disciplining one's
attention to what has already,

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:22.470 position:56%
by consensus, been called beautiful.

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:25.700
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Very good.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.000
Sir.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.220
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: In terms of the
relationship between the spiritual

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:40.180
and writing, when I was in high
school, one of my papers was

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:47.110 position:56%
about Robert Graves and the White
Goddess, this whole concept that art

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:53.020
and artists are merely
conduits for the spiritual,

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.940
and that either we work
at it or we're chosen.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:06.750
How much do feel that the
spirituality in this ...

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:15.930 position:56%
When I would write music, you used
to be a drummer in a band and so on,

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:19.630
things happen that
you don't plan ahead,

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:23.240
and they come out in the
story, and it takes on a piece

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.870
of its own, and you lose yourself.

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:29.570
You don't start off with, "This
is what I'm going to say,"

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:31.570
but you lose yourself in that.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:37.860
How much does that happen in terms
of, let's say, your view of the art

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.100 position:56%
of writing that you're dealing with?

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.290
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
It happens a lot.

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:48.220
I don't trust what I'm
writing unless it surprises me.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:57.230
The thing that has been
really amazing to me is

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:01.220
that I've written two
books, at a minimum,

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:07.690
that I considered deeply
personal, deeply private books.

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.150
Until I got a letter from my agent,

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:18.140
I didn't think I would
ever publish Housekeeping.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:23.770
Then, you put these things out into
the world with luck, with health,

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.340
and you find out that you
have actually said something

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:32.770
that resonates among many people,
which is a very striking thing.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.170
It's one of those things I
wish we articulated better.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:41.510
I feel as if I write something
that I don't truly control.

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:44.400
I can just feel that
there's a rightness

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.910
that is emerging out of what I do.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:51.400 position:56%
And then, to have other people
recognize it when the whole point is

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.590
that I'm writing something
that you haven't read before.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.890
Do you know?

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:57.570
It's an astonishing thing.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:01.320
I think that that feeling that
you have of having something pass

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:06.470
through you is very much
a result of the fact

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:09.790 position:56%
that you lived very much more deeply
in a culture than you realized

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:12.940
that you do or that you live in
a human community more deeply

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.140
than you realize, and that
you really can talk to people

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:23.490
in a way that's much more inward
than you would ever anticipate.

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:24.790
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: All right.

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.100
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.800
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: This is going
to be a tough one, I think.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.110
I have a friend of
mine who's an atheist.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:34.710 position:56%
He says that the entire bible can be
boiled down to "Thy will be done."

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:36.810
Everything else in the
bible is people trying

01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:39.800
to discern what God's will is.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.920
I'm thinking about the way
you talk about science.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.750
It sounds like you don't make
a heck of a lot of distinctions

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:50.800
between how much you apply beauty
to good and evil, and to tragedy

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.470
and perseverance in your novels.

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:56.080
So, my question is, how
do you discern God's will?

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.180
[laughter]

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.480
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Wow.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.770
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: 15 minutes.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.070
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: You're
on the clock.

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.050
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: Exactly.

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:09.290
I cling to basic prohibitions.

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:13.010
No idolatry, no killing,
no stealing.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:20.250
You know what, again,
this is what I just ...

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:24.560
My life surprises me all the time.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.640
There are things that attract my
interest, things that I want to do.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.940
I do them.

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.610
They satisfy my do-no-harm ethic.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:35.020
Then, they have another
content beside.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.150
I hope they're consistent
with the will of God.

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:41.670
I would find that to be
a very pleasing idea.

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:44.040
Who knows?

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.660
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: Did I
imagine this or did you boil

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:51.690
down the bible somewhat differently
at one point into cut it out?

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:52.990
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:57.550
Exactly. Why did the nation
so curiously rage together?

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:03.060
Stop doing that.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:07.030
&gt;&gt; GERALDINE BROOKS: While
we're on discerning God's will,

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:11.720
we haven't talked about your
book about Sellafield at all.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.640
I just wondered if you might
say a few words about that.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.350
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: My
main book of my entire career,

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.170
from my point of view, is a book

01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:25.180
that nobody else has read
called Mother Country.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.040
Thank you for your attention.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.660
It's about a plutonium reprocessing
plant on the coast of England

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.780
that has made the Irish Sea,

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:39.510
the most radioactive body
of water in the world.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:44.560
It's a whole elaborate
hideous industry

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.670
that involves building
reactors that have waste

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:51.480
that cannot be stored over time.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:54.160 position:56%
They're graphite-moderated reactors.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.080 position:56%
They've sold them all over the world
or they're built all over the world.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.270
Then, these things come back to
the coast of England to be stripped

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:07.510
down into a form that
will not combust, or burn,

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:10.240 position:56%
or whatever as this wastes would do.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.210
Otherwise, they can't be stored

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:18.350
like pressurized water reactor
wastes have been so far.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:27.390 position:56%
In any case, to strip these things
down requires nitric acid and so on.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:31.120
A great deal of what is derived

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.100
from this wastes are bomb-grade
plutonium, bomb-grade uranium,

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:41.950
et cetera, other salable
isotopes, whatever.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:45.550
Out of this very inefficient system
of stripping down that's been going

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:51.330
on since the '50s, it goes down
the pipeline in the Irish sea.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:55.740
This has happened for
so long at such scale

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.940
that it has affected the
Scandinavian countries,

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.130
Iceland, so on.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:04.760
I hardly mentioned Ireland itself.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.320
I wrote about this because
I was living in England,

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.410
and I got information from
various respectable sources

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:15.020
like the London Times
that this was going on.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.830
So, I wrote the book about it.

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:19.530
People in England read it.

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:20.830
They talk to me about it.

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.370
They're not shocked
because, of course,

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:25.580
it does come from places
like the Times.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.190
People in the United States are
not attracted to the subject.

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.360 position:56%
They don't want to know that this is
going on so very near Dove Cottage.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.600
What if they do?

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.380
So, that's Sellafield.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.850
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Gosh, wow.

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.150
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I did feel

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:47.090
that I was religiously
obligated to write that book.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:49.280
&gt;&gt; ALAN LIGHTMAN: Okay, good.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.600
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Each of you has used
the word belief more than once

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.800
in this really lovely
and lively conversation.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.330
In a rather straightforward
orthodox, if you will,

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:03.590
understanding belief is
an intellectual ascent

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:05.420
to a propositional statement.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.670
I believe in God, the Father
Almighty, maker of heaven

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:09.060
and earth, and so on and so forth.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.810
I wonder if you can say something
more about the relationship

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:18.840
between belief and story, or
perhaps faith and narrative

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.260
that complicates belief
a little bit more?

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:32.930
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I
don't have a credo belief.

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:37.480
Yes, I can recite the Apostles'
Creed without difficulty.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.070
At the same time, I
don't feel belief at all

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.780
as if it were itemized,
and if there were boxes,

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.110
I have to check, or
anything like that.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:51.660
For me, it's basically a
posture of questioning.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.430
What is in this moment?

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:56.040
What is in this event?

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.810
With the assumption that
everything is incredibly precious,

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:06.240
that nothing that happens,
however inexplicable,

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.910
is done with that reference
to the fact

01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.050
that everything is very precious.

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:18.700
It's not a state of repose for me.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:26.820
The credo statements, I find that
they are human origin, I would say,

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.310
and maybe some of them are
not exactly on the point.

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:33.160
That's fine with me.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.460
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.760
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON:
You're welcome.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.060
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: We'll
go to this side.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.600
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: First, I just like
to say that it's an honor to be

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.090
in the presence of so many
of my favorite writers.

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:47.210
Thank you for bringing
this conversation together.

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:56.430
Marilynne, I've read Gilead more
than once and deeply love the book.

01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.370
And I think one of the
most powerful aspects

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:04.130
of Gilead is the complicated
relationships between fathers

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:06.260
and sons in a general sense.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:13.670
I think, a lot of times, readers
focus on one of those relationships

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:15.970
between a father and a son.

01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:19.710
For me, it's the trio

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.180
of the grandfather, the
father, and the son.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:29.290
I think, history is so
pervasive in Gilead.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:32.910
I think it's so important
in the three generations,

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:38.800
and the message is that
Gilead is conveying.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.780
I like you to speak more
about that relationship

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.870
between history and fatherhood.

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:50.510 position:56%
In this moment in time, I just can't
help but think about the importance

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:55.300
of abolitionist history, and
the moment that we're in,

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.360
and that the narrator aims.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.100
He thinks so much about
his grandfather,

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:05.210
and the abolitionist moment that
he lived in, and he's living

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:08.100
in the Civil Rights moment.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.320
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: Yes.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.620
When I went to Iowa, I'd
always live either in Idaho,

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.780
or Massachusetts, or Rhode Island.

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:22.970
I was always one end of
the country or the other.

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:27.210
Then, I found myself in Iowa.

01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:29.900
I wanted to know what the
history of the place was,

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.490
the culture of the place was.

01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:36.670
Inevitably, Iowans would
say it has no history.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:43.530
Of course, you can't have two
people in one room for three hours

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:48.960
without having a history.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.100
So, I started doing all
kinds of primary research

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.880
in the 19th century writers
of various sorts and so on.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.030
I found out that there's this
beautiful forgotten history

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:05.420
of these little towns that
what was on the frontier

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:12.120
that were established in order to
inculcate an ethic of abolitionism

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:16.210
in the middle west,
very successful at that.

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.690
They tend to be based
around colleges.

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:21.690
One of the things that
struck me when I moved

01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:24.980
in to the middle west is
that the oldest buildings

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.990
on the landscape are
typically little colleges

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.360
or churches, and/or churches.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:35.050 position:56%
These people would buy land from the
government, which was very cheap.

01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:36.840
They would build a college.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.330
They had patrons.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.630
They would build a college.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.510
Sub-congregation from Massachusetts
or somewhere would come

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.280
out there and settle a place.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.390
Then, when people moved west,

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:49.480
they wanted to be near
a college or a church.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.780
The property values would go up.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.670
Then, they would use it
to underwrite these things

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.640
that they had built, and
also to start new towns

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.410
with new colleges, new
churches, and so on.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:04.260
And so, you got what was crucially
important for American history,

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:10.250
a very anti-slavery middle west
that produced people like Lincoln,

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.270
and Grant, and Sherman, and so on.

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:17.570
And also, a tremendous portion
of the union army in the period,

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:19.900
the later stages of the war.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:28.770
I saw for myself a
remarkable history of very,

01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:34.070
very great importance
that was forgotten

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:36.430
within a very short period of time.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.650
Here, the people are still
living among these things,

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:42.410
going to these schools, and
so on, and still have many

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:47.340
of the cultural qualities that
came from them like, for example,

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.540
no segregation in schools,

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:54.510
no anti-miscegenation laws,
these kinds of things.

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:59.330
So, anyway, the phenomenon
of historical forgetfulness

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:04.500 position:56%
at that level with all the loss that
has suffered because people were

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.510
out there doing admirable
things that if we have persisted

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:11.040
in them would have saved
us all kinds of misery

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.860
and reinventions of
wheels and so on.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.800
People actually thought,
when I was a child,

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.820
that integrating schools was
a novel idea when these parts

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.670
of the country had integrated
schools before the Civil War.

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:33.430
The cultural forgetfulness can
be just a devastating loss.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:38.550
That's one of the things that's a
major subject of the Gilead novels.

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:39.850
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Okay.

01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:41.810
Let me say that we're down
on our last few minutes.

01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:45.520
Perhaps, what we can do is I'll
take half of the room in turn.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.140
We have three on this
side, two on that.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.760
Perhaps, if we could take the three
folks that are lined up over here,

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.290
and if you could each just
ask your questions in turn.

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:55.590
We'll store them up.

01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:59.210
Then, see what parts of them either
Marilynne Robinson or any members

01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.510
of the panel might respond to.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.420
We'll start with you.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.720
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.020
Yeah, thank you all
for being here tonight.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.410
This is lovely.

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:09.460
Early on in the conversation,
someone mentioned the setting

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.670
of Gilead not being able
to imagine Gilead in a time

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:15.850
after Time Magazine could have
a cover asking, "Is God Dead?"

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:21.780
As someone whose consciousness
doesn't exceed too far back

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.420
through the distance,
I wonder in a lot

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:31.170
of these conversations what
spiritual consciousness has been

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.480
if it has been lost?

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.630
How do we articulate
that as something more

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:37.230
than maybe just declining
church attendance?

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:38.790 position:56%
Then, following on to that question,

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:40.890
where do you all find
the most interesting

01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:44.960 position:56%
and compelling articulation of faith

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.200 position:56%
and imagination moving forward
especially in our public conscience?

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.500
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Thanks.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.800
Yeah.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.350
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I actually wanted
to ask about Mother Country.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:56.560
I'm glad someone else brought up,
definitely Ms. Geraldine Brooks.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.260
It's a very striking book.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:04.490
I was very intrigued by the
premise of Mother Country or one

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:08.520
of the premises that America has
a more generous social ethic than,

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.530
at least, Great Britain
in certain respects.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:13.420
The book delves into not only
the actual nuclear power plant,

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.980
but also the history of
British social reform,

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.280 position:56%
and the principles that informed it.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.850
I was wondering whether
you could comment

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:23.560 position:56%
on how you interpret current
political events in America in light

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.410
of the principles of
British social teaching,

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:31.030
and then American social norms
that you investigated in that book.

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:33.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:39.810
This has been a really enlightening
conversation in many ways.

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:42.620
My question is really prompted
by the gentlemen who asked

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.830
about belief and by your response.

01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:50.510
It's motivated because in my
own life and in my own research,

01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:53.170
I think much more about
religious practice

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:55.850
than I do about religious belief.

01:19:55.850 --> 01:20:01.790
When you speak about belief
as not a static place,

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:03.220
I'm wondering about practice.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.170
I'm wondering about
moments when belief falters.

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:16.850
I'm also wondering about the ways
in which people enact and live

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:21.790
out their commitments
and those actions.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:25.730
Just what kinds of
connections you would make

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.710
between belief and practice?

01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:30.920
What practice might look
like sometimes in the absence

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:36.720
or the faltering of belief?

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:44.380
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I don't
think that belief is faltering.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.600
I think of myself as faltering.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.190
It happens to be true that
the fusion of the aesthetic,

01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:59.140
metaphysical, and the
scientific so far

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:04.130
as I understand is
very satisfying to me.

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:08.570
It seems pretty standing to me.

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:14.140
If I find myself not sufficient
to it, I don't blame it.

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.850
Do you know what I mean?

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:20.010
I think that any religion
teaches practice.

01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:24.260
I think that certainly
Judeo-Christianity teaches

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.350
generosity and compassion.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.850
And that that is the
essential practice,

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:33.090
I think, in both of those faiths.

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:37.130
I think also that faith is
rejuvenated by the practices

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:40.230
that are central to
it like compassion.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:45.840
As far as England and America,

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.430
there's always been a very
complex relationship between them.

01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:52.570
That is economic, as
much as anything.

01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:55.470
If you look at laws that
control the working class

01:21:55.470 --> 01:22:02.120 position:56%
in 19th Century England and you look
at the laws that enslaved people

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:08.800
in the south, they're
almost identical.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:14.930
There is a history of exploitation
of the working class in England.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.740
People used to talk
about wages slavery.

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.570
That was the term for it.

01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:25.000
They had every reason
to call it that.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.110
The movement, the impetus behind
the economics that I criticized

01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:35.030
in Mother Country as being British
is simply the idea that everything

01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:39.300
at best is reduced to liquid money.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.600
That's capital.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.070 position:56%
That means you squeeze the money out
of here, and you can put it there,

01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:47.780
and squeeze the money,
and put it there.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:52.750
If we, for example, start selling
national assets, we will be taking

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:56.610
on economic assumptions that are
very close to our British origins.

01:22:56.610 --> 01:23:02.580
The idea that actually
capital, to use Marx's word,

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:07.600
is the ultimate form of property,

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.110
and that anything else
is basically reducible.

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:14.340
It has the value of
what can be reduced

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.180
to in terms of liquid wealth.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.190
That's why you get
things like Sellafield.

01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:21.970
That was certainly my conclusion.

01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.710
It generates a great deal of money.

01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:29.240
The cost of it is not a cost
that is felt by the people

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.590
who appreciate the wealth
that is generated by it.

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:39.210
When you have that assumption,
all sorts of barriers go down.

01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:42.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: The first question,
I just want to pick up one element

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.160
of it, which I thought
was intriguing.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.800
Do you feel having set your novels,
as we said, the three has said,

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:54.260
in the distant but not too distant
past at a time before the death

01:23:54.260 --> 01:24:00.240 position:56%
of God entered the culture, have we
lost a spiritual identity since then

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.660
or is it just a continuation
of the same story?

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:04.940
Do you see a discontinuity there?

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:08.910
Where do you see the
seeds of hope in terms

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.420
of what might be a spiritual
element in today's culture?

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:17.180
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: I have
traveled around quite a bit

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:20.100
in Europe, as well
as the United States.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.400
Especially in Europe,
interestingly enough, and Britain,

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.080
I'm asked about theology.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.210 position:56%
I've given long newspaper interviews

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:30.230
about theology in Italian
newspapers.

01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:32.530
It's really quite striking.

01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:37.390
I have come to the
conclusion that the secularism

01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:41.740
of the western world is about
an eighth of an inch deep,

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.150
and that thinking in other terms,
thinking in spiritual terms,

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:53.320
in terms of faith comes
profoundly naturally to people,

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:59.020
and that they're simply
embarrassed to engage thinking

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:08.750
that people will call naïve
were so terrified of that word.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:12.420 position:56%
There's this other conversation that
goes bubbling along at the circus.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.960
God is dead and all this stuff,

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:20.820
which of course is
in one of Luther's.

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.880
To speak of the radical
event of the crucifixion,

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.060 position:56%
he uses the sentence, "God is dead."

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:31.700
It has even a religious
context before Nietzsche made it

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.280
into something else.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.160
In any case, there
was no such event.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.910
All of this is simply saying
to the public we're supposed

01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:43.950
to pretend we don't
believe that stuff anymore.

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:48.070
But, I just think it's
contrary to human nature

01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:53.300
to say faith was something that
kept us going while we were young

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.600
and impressionable.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.330
Then, it just vanished away.

01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:59.490
I don't think that's
descriptive of it at all.

01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:00.790
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Thank you.

01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:02.090
So, quickly, just the
last two questions,

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.390
if we could just get those uttered.

01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:04.690
Then, we'll see if we have time

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.670
to maybe say something
very briefly about them.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:07.970
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:09.270
I hope I can take just a
second to thank you all

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:11.710
for a wonderful and
enlightening talk.

01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:13.010
You, Marilynne, especially,

01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:16.690
for a series of just
powerful moving novels.

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:24.510
I heard you all talked quite a bit
about some of the visionary aspects

01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:26.630
of faith and belief,
and the role of beauty

01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:28.490
in Calvin's thought, in particular.

01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:30.490
One of the things that
was striking to me

01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:36.510 position:56%
in the Gilead trilogy is a different
strain of Calvin's thought.

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:41.070
It's the use of the
doctrine of total depravity,

01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:45.600
the way that Jack Boughton
conceives of his own experiences,

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.050
fears that he might be dammed,
and the raw difficulty that,

01:26:52.050 --> 01:26:59.450
especially Ames and
Boughton's father have in trying

01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:05.060
and not quite succeeding at
forgiving him, and not being able,

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:09.010
perhaps, to play the role of
the father, the prodigal son

01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:10.310
in the way that they want to.

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.540
I was wondering if you could
speak a bit to the relationship

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:18.010
between those visionary
aspects of religious thought

01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:20.870
and the moral drama
that we find especially

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:24.330
in the second half of Gilead?

01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:27.470
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Okay, thank you.

01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:28.770
&gt;&gt; MARILYNNE ROBINSON: Yes.

01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.770
Robert Boughton does
nothing but forgive Jack.

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:36.310 position:56%
Moment to moment, his whole
theology is based on forgiving Jack.

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:43.280
Jack doesn't forgive himself.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:56.410
Every theology has
complex working parts.

01:27:56.410 --> 01:28:08.970
The idea of falling short is, I
think, intrinsic in every theology.

01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:16.340
To see, to experience beautiful
demonstrations of belief,

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.640
and the forgiveness,
and all the rest

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.730
of it doesn't necessarily
mean that you're alright.

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:22.510
Do you know what I mean?

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:27.020
I'm talking basically about what
I considered to be a phenomenon

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:33.380
of faith that is very general
in religious traditions.

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.570
At least, Jack has
the ultimate benefit

01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:42.200
that it's really not up to him.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.270
He can know, and it's a new roll

01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:51.880
of the dice every time
someone goes to his reward.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.180
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Thank.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.480
Thanks so much.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.480
For the last question, briefly.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.940
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: This question
is for anyone on the panel.

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.220
The way everyone has been
speaking this evening

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.280
about beauty reminded me of a
radio story that many people

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.510
in the audience might have
heard recently about a man

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:20.900
who lost the ability to
produce testosterone.

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.980
And he describes going
for these few months.

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:31.340
He experiences everything
as being beautiful.

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:37.470
He describes it as a
completely objective way.

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:40.790
He just stops judging things.

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:43.020
He would see a crack
in the sidewalk,

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.590
and think that's beautiful.

01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:47.040
I, maybe, should add at this point

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.100
that women also have
testosterone as well.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:57.100
At the same time, he also lost all
motivation to do anything as well.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:03.080
I was just wondering if maybe
this presents a kind of metaphor

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:08.390
about a certain attention
between not judging things,

01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:12.860
and experiencing them as
beautiful as they are,

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:19.800 position:56%
and at certain attention with acting
and imposing your will on the world

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:27.280 position:56%
in a way where you might have a
certain vision of beauty of your own

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:35.540 position:56%
that you maybe also want to interact
with the material or outside world.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:38.070
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: So, your concern
is, what effect duty might have

01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:41.100
on agency, it might be, in
some ways, debilitating?

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.100
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Or not,
a lack of judgment.

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.400
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Yeah.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.700
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:52.250
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: Anybody
wants to take that?

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:55.160
Got a quick response there, Paul?

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.460
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: Why me?

01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:05.200
No. I think it's easy
to become habituated

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.510
to a culture-rated thinking.

01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:13.970
So, I think it's easy to
become habituated to thinking

01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:18.010
that what you think is thought,
when in fact it is not thinking.

01:31:18.010 --> 01:31:24.250
I think I got that three
negatives to make a positive.

01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:28.080
At least, in the context of
how we've been talking about it

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.590
up here is that, on a certain
level, it's a technical skill

01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:38.460
or it's almost like a muscle,
you have to habituate yourself

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:44.270
to the discipline of seeing beauty,

01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:50.880
but it's a beautiful paradoxical
discipline because what it is,

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:56.560 position:56%
it's cultivating the ability to stop
imposing your will on what you see.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:03.830
That's very anecdotal, but
just reserving judgment,

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:08.540 position:56%
not acting as if you know what
you're looking at, and really trying

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:11.800
to cultivate the habit of
being, as I stated earlier,

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.960
but in that strict
sense, being innocent.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.120
You don't know what
you're looking at.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.350
Then, a crack in the pavement
is likely to be quite beautiful,

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.610
and have its own little
ecosystem or something.

01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:27.530
The idea too that the closer

01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:31.390
and the more sustained attention
is, the more depth of ...

01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:36.660
The universe observation will
almost accommodate whatever depth

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.290
of observation you
choose to lend to it.

01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:43.130
It will always come into more
and more beautiful resolution.

01:32:43.130 --> 01:32:46.900
I think that's one of the
things that we talk about a lot,

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.380
just the position and
you how you read it.

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:52.810
It becomes a dialectic between the
infinite and the infinitesimal,

01:32:52.810 --> 01:32:58.020
and the way that you can go down
to the smallest, tiniest detail.

01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:59.320
It's just so beautiful.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.620
Then, suddenly, it
just will open back

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.610
up onto the whole universe
in a certain way.

01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:06.830
It's almost like a
feedback loop or something.

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:09.550
That's just my ...

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.940
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: I
think that sounds really

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.660
like the right balance
of testosterone.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.560
&gt;&gt; PAUL HARDING: That's
what you're shooting for.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.970
&gt;&gt; STEVEN KNAPP: That's
a little strike.

01:33:17.970 --> 01:33:20.170
All right.

01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:23.380
We are actually at
the end of our time

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.910
because we have a couple
of things to do.

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:28.960
I want to turn the program
back to the Director

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:46.860
of the John W. Kluge Center, Before
I do so, let me ask you to join me

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.160
in thanking our guest
of honor and the panel.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.760
&gt;&gt; TED WIDMER: What a
wonderful inspiring evening.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.060
Thank you so much for coming out.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.140
