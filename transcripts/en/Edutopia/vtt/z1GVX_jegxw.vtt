00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:03.246
&gt;&gt;Lora: In Cleveland's
metropolitan school district,

00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:06.336
four out of ten high school
students don't graduate.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.326
&gt;&gt;But there's one school where
ninety-five percent graduate

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.136
and eighty-four percent
of those go to college.

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:15.936
&gt;&gt;Lilly: We get mentors
and real world experience

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:17.766
through volunteering and internships.

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.856
&gt;&gt;Y'von: And when we graduate, we're
prepared to succeed in college,

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:22.666
in our careers and in life.

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.766
&gt;&gt;Lora: It's called M C
Squared STEM High School.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.416
Take a look at what they
do for their students.

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:30.976
It might change what
you do for yours.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.966
&gt;&gt;Gary: I think when we look
at a program like STEM School,

00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:51.056
they've laid out a very good program.

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:54.906
The hands-on projects, the
industrial collaboration,

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:59.006
the university collaboration,
is a wonderful environment

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.336
in which the kids can excel.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:06.306
Each kid has to have their fuse
lit for that rocket to take off.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:09.616
So you can get them out
on the launching pad,

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:12.596
but if you don't light the
fuse, they're not gonna go.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.046
&gt;&gt;Tim and I started out
mentoring about a year and a half,

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:49.786
almost two years ago, when
he was entering sophomore.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:53.636
He has become a tremendously
different person.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:56.596
He's now a very confident young man.

00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:58.596
This is really remarkable.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:01.956
We brought kids in from the
neighborhood, basically--

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:05.566
they're not handpicked from
premium high schools in the area--

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:11.056
and gave them a rich experience
in working with role models.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.786
&gt;&gt;Tim: What's rewarding about
working with professionals here

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:19.626
on GE campus is getting
to know how their life is.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:23.906
It makes me think at least that, you
know, hey, if I go into this career,

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.646
that's gonna be me, you know.

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.506
That's gonna be me
working really hard.

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:30.696
That's gonna be me using all these
math that my math teacher's me.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.756
That's gonna be me
using all the science

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.496
that my science teacher's
teaching me.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.816
&gt;&gt;Gary: This real world experience
that they get really grounds them,

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:42.796
so school is no longer for
them a theoretical hypothesis

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:44.176
for what life might be like.

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:46.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're gonna be
working with multi-meters.

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:49.766
Okay, so your training is
actually on equipment today.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.536
&gt;&gt;Gary: So it's very reality based.

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:53.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, what does
that K mean, by the way?

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.396
&gt;&gt;Thousand, kilo, thousand.

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:55.426
&gt;&gt;Tim: Thousand means K.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:57.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so
that's two thousand--

00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:59.896
&gt;&gt;Tim: So, since we're
at two thousand K ohms...

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:04.096
&gt;&gt;They're teaching us from experience
and when the professionals come in,

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.736
it's like, wow, I need
to pay attention.

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:24.446
&gt;&gt;Mastery based grading is
different from the ABC scale.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.066
We get graded on M which is mastery.

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.446
Reaching mastery and incomplete.

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:33.516
&gt;&gt;Catherine: It's a negative slope
and it's less than or equal to--

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.956
&gt;&gt;Assessment in mastery
in math is done two ways.

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:40.806
One, through the testing of the
mastery of the paper pencil skills,

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:43.196
but then any project
we do has a rubric.

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:45.106
So the students know
exactly what they need to do

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:47.506
to perform to reach mastery.

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:49.866
&gt;&gt;Before we did the quadratic
formula, what did we do?

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:53.526
&gt;&gt;The kids have to show that
they've learned the content,

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:54.966
and I feel really comfortable
about that.

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:06.826
&gt;&gt;Lilly: Every summer
in our three week break,

00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:08.696
I've gotten the chance
to do an internship.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:11.366
&gt;&gt;When I came to STEM, I
wanted to be an astronomer,

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:16.256
so I got my NASA internship,
and I build hydrogen sensors

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.106
for the International Space Station,

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.586
but I found out I don't
want to be an astronomer.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.846
My second was in the
injury prevention center

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:25.316
at University Hospitals.

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:27.346
I found out, I don't
wanna do anything

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:28.746
that has to do with hospitals.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:32.156
My third one, which is the
one I'm currently in is

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:34.776
at American Civil Liberties Union.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:39.986
I think I'm gonna end up doing
something with political science

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.446
that has to do with
protection of our rights,

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:43.976
'cause I'm very passionate
about that.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:50.126
&gt;&gt;Y'von: Engineering is in my family.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:52.556
My father was a building
engineer for Cleveland Thermal,

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:54.266
so I was always interested,

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.806
but I needed guidance
going into high school.

00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:03.676
At STEM, everything was based
on projects with other people,

00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:07.086
not just science, technology,
engineering and mathematics.

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:08.886
It goes beyond that.

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:11.726
It goes to character, teamwork.

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:16.296
At my internship, my main
duty is document control.

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:19.896
I started in March
and maybe around July,

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:24.256
I started to understand
the stuff I was folding.

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:26.456
I started to understand
the stuff I was typing.

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:34.356
This internship is more school
to me than high school right now.

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:42.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Science
and math, pretty much.

00:05:42.706 --> 00:05:42.836
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Okay.

00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.416
&gt;&gt;We should talk about,
instead of coming back here

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:45.546
for your other classes, maybe going

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.446
to health careers like
Melissa's doing.

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:52.846
&gt;&gt;Gary: They're not only getting from
us an insight into, how do you get

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:54.476
through high school to
prepare for college?

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:55.786
How do you choose in college?

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:57.656
But, what does it look
like beyond that?

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.166
What are you really
getting ready for?

00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:03.896
So the message to the kids is, it's
not a linear path through school

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.756
or grad school or med
school or law school.

00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:08.356
It's really that emotional guidance.

00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:11.776
What are you feeling in here
that makes sense to you in life

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:13.796
where you think you can contribute?

00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:16.216
That emotional guidance
I think is really key.
