00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.660
This episode was proudly made possible by
the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.870
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.350
Can you see everything on the screen without
moving your eyes?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.760
Look at me did you see that?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.300
Didn't think so.[a]

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.019
Howdy lookers, thanks for tuning into DNews,
I'm Trace.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.710
Eyes are little 1 inch diameter balls (2.54
cm) tucked in your head, and though they're

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.929
magnificent, human eyes aren't even CLOSE
to the best in the animal kingdom.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.550
In fact, your brain is tricking you into thinking
your eye is seeing things that aren't there

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.640
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.230
We've all got blind spots that we can't see,
and huge sections of our vision are just…

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.230
wrong!

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.940
Take a piece of paper with a dot and a plus
on it.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.270
Close one eye, hold the paper close to your
face and look straight at the dot, pulling

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.270
it away slowly.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.260
Eventually, the plus should disappear!

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.260
That's your blind spot.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.490
If you switch eyes, the dot should disappear.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.280
You might have to try it a couple of times.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.330
To understand WHY this happens, we have to
go inside the eye.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.610
If you could fly into the pupil and inside
the eyeball to look around you'd be floating

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.720
in vitreous humor of the inner eye.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.030
It's a clear, gel-like material.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.260
On the walls of the eye, you'd see blood vessels
streaming everywhere, and spread across the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.570
back of the eye you'd see the rod and cone
cells of the retina.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.740
Rods are for low light, cones are for color
and visual detail.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.820
If you got closer to the retina, you could
spot the macula right in the middle with only

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.210
cone cells -- that's the only part of your
vision that you can see clearly.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.560
If you look at my face here, you can see it
clearly, but while still looking at my face

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.470
pay attention to the walls around me, or my
shirt.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.510
It's VERY difficult to comprehend the rest
of your visual field.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.750
The macula is truly the only point of visual
clarity!

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.540
From there, you could follow the nerves of
the retina, like following a bunch of extension

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.820
cords to the wall.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.760
Eventually, you'd get to the optic disk; a
part of the eye with no rods or cones.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.369
That's where the optic nerve enters the eyeball!

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.509
It's kind of like where your eye plugs in.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.289
And it causes a blind spot.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.870
There's nothing there for your eye to perceive
since there are no rod or cone cells!

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.200
My eye doctor was nice enough to send me a
picture of the inside of my own eye.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.599
You can see the macula here, and the optic
nerve here.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.800
That is my point of clarity, and my blind
spot!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.340
If it seems stupid to have a blind spot, you're
right.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.090
Cephalapods don't have one, because their
optic nerves run BEHIND the retina rather

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.390
than in front of it.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.000
Think of it this way, cephalopods have their
wiring inside the walls, but because of an

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.990
unfortunate evolutionary mutation, mammals
didn't and thus we all have blind spots.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.390
The reason you don't see this spot all the
time is because your brain fills it in.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.599
Try doing the dot and plus experiment with
a piece of colorful paper and your brain will

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.709
fill it in with color.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.950
That's your brain tricking you into thinking
your vision is perfect, when it's really not.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.630
Silly brain, tricks are for non-scientists.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.569
Blind spots are very important to be aware
of - especially when you’re driving!

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.000
That’s why we wanna thank Subaru for making
this episode possible.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.210
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.100
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.260
It’s not just a sedan.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.400
It’s a Subaru.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.280
If you could have the eyes of another animal,
which would it be?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280
Cats?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280
Eagles?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280
Cephalopods?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.280
Mantis Shrimp?!

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.900
We're watching for your comments, so leave
one.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.240
Thanks for watching DNews.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.300
Here's looking at you, kid.
