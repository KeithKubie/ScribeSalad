00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.753
Wow, this
thing is nice.

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.505
MAN: This is
the cat's meow.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.049
This is like one
of the holy grails

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.342
of American coins.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.677
I'll do $95,
and that's it.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.845
No, I don't
think so.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:12.721
I think I'm going
to take it home.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:18.560
This is
what a muscle

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.813
car is supposed
to look like.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:22.689
This is the
real thing.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.773
Not a clone, huh?

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.733
SELLER: The
real deal.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.608
This is it.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.903
Only 1175 made total.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.072
It was originally
a Ford, as

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.532
all Shelby's were.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.783
There was
right around 100

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.285
modifications
that Shelby

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:39.038
did to a Ford Mustang
to make the GT350.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.291
This is one of the
quintessential cool

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.585
cars of the
1960s, and I would

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:44.627
love to have it.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.420
So much are
you looking

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.755
to get out of it?

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.591
SELLER: My asking on
the car is $125,000.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.176
I've done my
homework on this car.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.427
I feel it's a fair
price what I'm

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.553
asking for the car.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.556
I rarely do
this, but I'm not

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.599
going to negotiate.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:58.683
I will give
you $100,000.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.018
All right, so
that's the max

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.562
you're going to go?
- Not one dime more.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.481
[sighs]

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.940
You got a deal.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.983
Sweet.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:07.984
Let's go do
some paperwork,

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:09.027
and um, we
can figure out

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.153
if my dad's
going to yell

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:10.779
at me for driving
for a week.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:11.863
[chuckles]

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.281
My name's
Uncle Phil.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.491
OK, Uncle Phil.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.785
I have a 1932
Lincoln convertible.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.869
A V12.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.329
Um, yeah,
that's a cool car.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:19.913
Yeah, it is, yeah.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.083
This is a
classic car, Rick.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.710
RICK: The '30s
was the golden age

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.836
of cars.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:27.962
It was when
cars really

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.672
began to have style.

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:30.965
It's crazy that
Lincoln made

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.967
this bad ass ride
at the height

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.260
of the Great
Depression.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.428
But think about
it, since there was

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.930
fewer buyers
for luxury cars

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.181
back then,
automakers had

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.682
to go all out
to compete

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:40.809
for their business.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:41.976
In perfect
condition,

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.603
this could sell as
high as $170,000

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.604
at auction.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.396
RICK: But
this is not in

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:46.564
perfect condition.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:47.899
So buying this is
a little scary.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.192
And how much do
you want for it?

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.903
- I want $100,000.
- OK.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.614
I'll give you
$85,000 for it.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.574
No.

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.993
I'll do $95,000,
and that's it.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.537
I'll tell you what.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:01.913
I know you have
a lot of gold,

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.414
and I'd like to
trade it for gold.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.707
Legally, I can't
swap the gold

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:05.708
for the car.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:06.751
But once I
give him cash,

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.752
he can turn
right around,

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:08.586
and buy the
gold off me.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:09.754
We could do gold.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:10.839
Will you
take $95,000?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.173
OK.
RICK: All right.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.091
OK.
RICK: Deal.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.300
Here we
go, one more.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.593
RICHARD: One
more time.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.679
RICK: I deal in gold
here all the time.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.721
Coins like
Krugerrands

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.515
and $20 gold
pieces, I'm

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.225
always stocked up.
- Here you go.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.935
OK.
Thanks again.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:24.978
Thanks a lot.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.187
I appreciate
the business.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.272
I can't believe
I just spent

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.732
$95,000 on a car.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:31.317
I'm psyched, but
I've got to admit,

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.652
I'm a little nervous.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.822
Got a 1922
proof high-relief

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.782
matt finished coin.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.576
Where did
you get this?

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.952
SELLER 2: I won it
at a poker game.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:41.536
RICK: Whoa.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.791
The 1922 high-relief
piece dollar

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.209
is one of the
rarest coins

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.460
in American history.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.296
But the more
demand for a coin,

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.589
the more it's faked.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.923
I definitely
want this thing,

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.759
but I have to make
absolutely sure this

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.261
is the real deal.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.138
So I called up Dave
to check everything

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.598
out for me.
- This is it.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.390
Oh.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.517
[laughing]

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.686
RICK: Now, what
exactly is the story

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.021
with this coin?

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.355
This was the coin the
government minted,

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.815
but no one knew
they minted it for

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.442
like 15 or 20 years.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.443
DAVE: That's correct.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:14.861
Now, a
high-relief design

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.738
was sort of a
triumph of art,

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.656
and a failure
of technology

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.533
because although
they were beautiful,

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.868
they couldn't
strike them

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.162
with enough pressure
to get a lot of them

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.204
out.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.414
So I assume your
main concern

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.791
is, is it real?
- Yeah.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:29.709
RICK: OK.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.585
Definitely.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.545
[chuckles]

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.422
DAVE: The coin
is perfectly

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.715
legitimate.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.176
So the big thing
is what's it worth?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.594
I think
this coin is

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.763
worth something
north of 50

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.098
but less than 100.

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:45.725
OK.
Thanks man.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.726
DAVE: Super rare.
No problem.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.144
OK.
DAVE: Thank you.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.271
RICK: I'll give
you $65,000.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.314
What about $90,000?

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.815
I think
$90,000 is fair

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.901
I think
$75,000 is fair.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.861
Meet in the
middle at $80,000,

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.279
and you've
got a deal.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.697
It's a deal.
SELLER 2: All right.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.740
OK.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.200
I made $80,000
on the coin.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.660
Super excited
about it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.787
Definitely going to
keep playing poker.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:06.871
Hopefully, I
get another coin

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.123
like this sometime.
