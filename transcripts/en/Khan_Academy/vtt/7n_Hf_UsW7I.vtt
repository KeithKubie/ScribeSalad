00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:04.354
- When you think about what the
field of economics is about,

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:06.766
it is quite daunting.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:10.933
An economy is made up of millions
or even billions of actors

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:16.392
organized in incredibly complex ways.

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:19.559
Write down, this is complex real-world

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.015
and each of the actors, human
beings or organizations,

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:26.594
these are incredibly complex.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:27.537
A human brain.

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:29.700
I can't predict what you're
going to do the next second

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.372
much less what you're going to do

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.134
the next day or the next year

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:35.217
and imagine trying to make insights

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:39.266
about what millions or
billions of people will do

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.408
but the field of economics
has borrowed an idea

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.799
from other fields.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.216
So for example, in chemistry,

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:52.536
chemists have tried to
understand at a high level,

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:56.257
well, how do molecules
in a container behave?

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:59.284
Let's say molecules of gas.

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:01.615
Well, you could imagine if
you have a container here

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:04.672
with trillions upon
trillions of molecules,

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:07.415
this is incredibly complex

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:10.915
but by making some simplifying assumptions

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.633
about the type of interactions
these particles will have

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:19.141
or don't have, they
can come up with models

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.652
like the ideal gas law which
you might be familiar with

00:01:22.652 --> 00:01:24.448
or not from your chemistry class

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:26.818
that relates the pressure to the volume

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:28.940
to the number of particles you have

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.151
to the actual temperature

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:32.340
and so this right over here

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.907
where you're taking something
that's hairy and complex

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:36.747
and making simplifying assumptions

00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:38.320
to help you understand it,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.403
this thing right over here is a model

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.876
and this is in other fields as well.

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.004
Sometimes, it's not an equation.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.504
Sometimes, it might be a simpler organism.

00:01:51.352 --> 00:01:53.352
For example, in biology,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.183
human beings are incredibly
complex organisms

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:01.878
and not only are they incredibly complex

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.845
but certain forms of experimentation

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:08.012
would also feel fairly unethical
to our modern moral ethos

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:11.072
and so what do biologists do?

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:15.321
Well, they make simplifying
assumptions or they pare down,

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.137
they say, okay, we can't do
that study on human beings

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.528
but maybe we can simplify the problem

00:02:21.528 --> 00:02:23.779
by looking at simpler organisms.

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.227
Maybe you can look at an
individual cell right over here.

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:31.415
Maybe you can look at
things like fruit flies

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:35.090
which are famous in the study of genetics.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.709
Maybe you can even look at
fairly complex organisms.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.934
Even a mouse is a very complex thing

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.893
but it's still simpler than a human being

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:45.781
and at least to our modern ethics,

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.780
we're willing to do certain things to mice

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.311
that we aren't willing
to do to human beings

00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.215
and so that's why in a biological context,

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:57.519
you will hear people talk
about things like a mouse model

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.635
where they will test a drug on a mouse

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:02.488
or try to understand how
something happens in a mouse

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:05.022
and then say, well, that's
a pretty good indication

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:07.185
that might be happening to human beings.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:09.645
In fact, when they do
drug trials in medicine,

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:11.154
they often will do it on mice first

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:13.238
and when they have good
confidence that it works there

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:14.586
and that it's fairly safe,

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:17.159
only then will they start
to do the experiments

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.835
on human beings.

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:20.962
Well, economists are doing the same thing.

00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:24.801
Even before the advent of
computers and computer models,

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:28.134
economists make simplifying assumptions,

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:32.282
assumptions like all of
the actors in an economy

00:03:32.282 --> 00:03:36.452
are rational which we already
know is not exactly true.

00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:37.763
I'm not always rational

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:40.500
and I definitely know people
who aren't always rational.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.139
They're simplifying assumptions

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.755
that all of the people in an economy

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.162
have the same access to information

00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:49.410
or that they all even
have perfect information

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.843
which we also know isn't
necessarily true in a real economy.

00:03:52.843 --> 00:03:54.151
So depending on the model,

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.235
there are going to be these
simplifying assumptions

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.339
that take this large,
complex real-world thing

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.796
and try to break it down
into simple equations

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:03.433
or lines or charts.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.417
We have models early on
in our economic study.

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:10.597
We will see things like the
production possibility frontier

00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:13.016
where it assumes that
you're only trading off

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:16.530
between two things and
everything else is equal,

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.780
this notion of ceteris, ceteris paribus

00:04:21.797 --> 00:04:24.691
which means all things equal.

00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:26.633
In a real-world, you're
not gonna be able to say,

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.494
hey, let's just pick
between these two things

00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:30.534
and then hold everything else equal.

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:32.123
There's hundreds or thousands

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:34.133
or millions of variables are operating

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:35.276
but if you wanna make a model,

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:37.038
maybe we can make these assumptions.

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:40.386
Same thing with famous price equilibria

00:04:40.386 --> 00:04:42.226
that we're going to study later on

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:44.844
where you have supply and demand

00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:45.829
and then you have these notions

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:49.055
of equilibrium prices and quantities.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.286
These also make similar
types of assumptions

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:56.036
about rational actors
and perfect information

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.208
and these economic
models can be very useful

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.051
and that's why most of your study

00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:06.481
in a first year economics
course is of these models.

00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:08.109
Now, with that said,

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:10.480
you should also take
them with a grain of salt

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.949
and you shouldn't just accept them

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.978
as the absolute description of reality.

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:18.295
In fact, that's when economic
models can get dangerous.

00:05:18.295 --> 00:05:20.163
You always have to be conscientious

00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:22.382
of what are those assumptions you made?

00:05:22.382 --> 00:05:24.752
In fact, Nobel Prizes
have been won in economics

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:28.022
by revisiting some simplifying assumptions

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:30.270
and coming up with new models.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.009
The other difficulty about economics

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.992
is it's hard to test
it in as absolute a way

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:39.229
definitely as something
like chemistry or physics

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.292
but even in biology

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.870
where you're dealing with
similarly complex systems,

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.546
a human body and an economy,

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.364
these are both extremely complex systems.

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:48.998
If I wanna see in medicine

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:50.921
whether a certain medication works,

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:52.477
I can do a clinical trial.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.028
I could take hundreds
or thousands of people

00:05:55.028 --> 00:05:58.034
and give maybe half of them the drug

00:05:58.034 --> 00:05:59.195
and I could try to control

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:01.029
for a bunch of different variables

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:02.193
but in economics,

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:05.140
you can't take a thousand
different economies

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.932
that look very similar
in what you think matters

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:12.166
and then apply some type
of economic prescription

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.572
to half of them and then see what happens,

00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:17.713
to see whether your model is exactly true

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:19.231
or whether your prescription

00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:22.903
for what makes an economy
grow faster actually works

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:24.826
and so the big takeaway,

00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:28.668
models are valuable across
the various sciences

00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:30.546
including in economics

00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:33.692
but economics straddles
between a social science

00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:37.499
and the sciences like chemistry or physics

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.031
because you can't run
experiments in the same way

00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.951
and we often make simplifying assumptions

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.776
that even though we know
aren't exactly true,

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:47.142
they're the only way that
we're able to make sense

00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:49.642
of an incredibly complex real-world.
