[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:07.920
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thank you
guys so much for having me.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.628
SPEAKER: Yeah, we're
excited to have you.

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:12.160
So would love to just learn
a little bit more about

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Mike, the kid from
Pittsburgh, turning

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.170
into Chef Michael Solomonov,
the James Beard Award winner.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.000
Did you always know
that this was something

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.085
that you were going to be?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.460
Did you always
want to be a chef?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.060
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: No, I was a
really, really difficult eater

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.340
as a kid, ironically.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.770
And I was going to be--

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.390
I wanted to be an
actor when I was a kid.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.110
I wanted to be a photographer.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.520
I went to college
briefly with the intent

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.130
of getting into photography.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.544
And then ended up only
smoking pot, and snowboarding,

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:47.710
and dropping out of college.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.320
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.445
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: And then
I moved back to Israel.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:51.760
My family and I had moved--

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.230
I was born in Israel,
grew up in Pittsburgh,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.063
and then we moved back
when I was, like, 15.

00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:59.570
So I dropped out of school,
and moved back to Israel,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.289
and walked up and down the
main street in the town

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.830
that we lived in, in this little
town called Kfar Saba, which

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.600
is north of Tel Aviv.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.760
And just asked people in very
broken Hebrew and English

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.130
if they needed somebody
to work for them.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.110
And I got a job in a bakery.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.790
And that's where
I started cooking.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.580
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.580
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.290
SPEAKER: And from
that bakery, what were

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.840
your biggest lessons learned?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.160
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Well, I wasn't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.650
used to working and working
hard or working legitimately.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.570
So I learned a lot about--

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.390
I mean, probably the most
important lessons of my life

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.170
happened there.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.320
I couldn't talk my way into
anything, because nobody there

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.270
cared where I really came from.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.810
They were happy at that
time to have not only

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.650
an immigrant worker, but also
an immigrant American worker.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.020
It was like a twofer for them.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.880
It was like this status
symbol that they had this guy.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.680
And it was right around the
Clinton, Monica Lewinsky

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.610
scandal thing.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.011
So they would be like,
yeah, Bill Clinton, huh?

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:14.510
You know?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.010
And I was like, I don't
know him personally.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.300
And I don't speak any Hebrew.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.905
Can you just tell me what to do?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.050
I learned a lot about
myself and about what

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.900
it was like to really
have to work hard.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.210
And everybody there was
from somewhere else.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.830
And culturally, it was
just really exciting.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.350
And it was at the lowest level--

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.830
literally, I was taking out
garbage bags full of trash,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.400
scrubbing sheet trays
for 10 hours at a time,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.340
chasing rats around
with a pizza cutter,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.750
and occasionally would
get to do cool stuff.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.979
And I learned Hebrew, and I
learned a little bit of Arabic,

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.270
and I learned a bit of Russian.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280
My family's from
Bulgaria before Israel,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.290
or like half of my family is.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.180
And I learned what the
sort of social cues

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.492
of Bulgarian Jewish
immigrants as it

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.200
related to everybody
else-- because there

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.600
were Venezuelan immigrants.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.330
There was Muslim Arabs.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.980
There were Christian Arabs.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.380
And it was just awesome.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.360
And I remember the owner of the
bakery took me to his house.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.510
And I thought he was making
me lunch or whatever.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.045
And he made me
clean up his garden.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:43.260
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: And then
afterwards, we drank coffee.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.900
And he was asking me if I
wanted to close the bakery,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.460
if that would be my new
task that I would enjoy.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.160
The word for bakery in
Hebrew is "ma'afiyah,"

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.180
which I thought was "mafia."

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.650
So he was having a conversation
with me for 45 minutes,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.772
and I was like, am
I being in the mob?

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:05.480
Like, is that what's
happening right now?

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.460
SPEAKER: Is that my
next career move?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.320
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Because
I didn't know that ma'afiyah

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.070
meant "bakery."

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.602
So I thought I'd
left there with--

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:11.310
SPEAKER: New job.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.476
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: --status.

00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:17.550
But really, I got a 20-agorat
raise, which is like $0.07.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.850
So I was making the equivalent
of $3 an hour there.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.750
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.500
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
And it was amazing.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.260
I loved it.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.530
I fell in love with
the camaraderie

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.900
and the legitimate work.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.410
And I'd come from this
sort of upper middle class,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.930
middle class background
in the States.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.110
And my values were skewed.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.060
So it was really cool to do
that and to learn something.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.890
And at the bakery, we made
a bunch of cool things.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.490
Challah.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.059
Everybody eats challah.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.850
First of all, nobody
in Israel gives a shit

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.590
about carbohydrates at all.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.067
So they don't know
what Atkins is.

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.150
Anytime you go over to
someone's house over there,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.775
and they're like,
come over for coffee,

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:02.100
it is like platters
of cakes, right?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.370
And regardless of how
religious you are,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.400
everybody eats challah,
basically, on Fridays.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.870
So I was used to this
alternative subculture

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.480
of being a recluse
pothead in the States.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.610
But in Israel,
working in a bakery

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.950
means that you're basically
the center of town on Friday.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.720
So we'd go in Friday
morning at 2:00 AM

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.480
and make challahs
for like 14 hours.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.260
And every single
person in the town

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.900
would come and participate.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.670
So you were part of
something, right?

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.650
And then my grandmother,
who was probably like--

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.970
I know this is super cliched--

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.990
but the reason I
probably love food

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.420
or love the heritage of
the food that I cook,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.600
would make bourekas, which
are this Balkan pastry that

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.610
come all the way
from medieval Spain

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.310
through the Ottoman
Empire to Israel.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.880
And I got to make
thousands of them a day.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.445
And it was like the one thing
that I loved eating as a kid.

00:05:57.445 --> 00:05:59.820
And it was the way that I
could relate to my grandmother.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.830
So to be part of something on
this hyper social, but also

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.320
hyper spiritual
level was something

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.910
I had never really experienced.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.630
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.230
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.188
SPEAKER: Real question.

00:06:11.188 --> 00:06:14.100
Boureka is filled with spinach,
with cheese, with potato.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.315
What's your favorite filling?

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.340
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Feta cheese
with a shitload of sesame

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.881
on top--best.

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:18.770
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.910
Awesome.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.368
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: But all of
them are really, really good.

00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:26.160
And they tell the story
of real Israeli cuisine.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.117
And it's fascinating.

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:28.700
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.940
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Do you guys
want to hear the real story?

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.700
SPEAKER: Let's hear it.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.380
You're tempting us.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.452
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: OK, good.

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:32.952
And then I'm done
after this, right?

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:33.760
No.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.660
So my grandmother, her
maiden name before Solomonov,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.620
was Toledo, which is
from the town in Spain.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.340
Post-Inquisition, they
peaced out of Spain.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.350
And they brought with
them this laminated dough.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.683
And everyone thinks that the
French puff pastry actually

00:06:48.683 --> 00:06:53.130
comes from the Sephardic
Jews in medieval Spain.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.710
So they brought
with them this dough

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.560
to the Balkans,
where they settled.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.240
And the Ottomans came
in and took over,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.700
like they did a lot of
the world at that time.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.520
And they started stuffing this
laminated pastry with what

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.160
we think is Bulgarian feta.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.690
And then the Bulgarians
overthrew the Ottomans

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.040
using Russian
families to help arm

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.910
them, which is why my last
name is Solomonov, actually.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.320
Everyone thinks I'm Russian.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.240
I don't speak any Russian.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.550
And in fact, the
last name was Bahar.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.820
But to honor the
Russian families that

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.750
helped arm these
Bulgarians in Varna,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.730
they all took
Russian last names.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.710
And then in 1948, they
all moved to Israel,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.950
bringing with them this
savory pastry, which is now

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.155
on every single street
corner in Israel,

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:47.980
which is awesome, right?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.100
SPEAKER: Yeah, great story.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.370
So given that you had
a stint in Israel,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.840
came back to the
States, how do you

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.489
think that kind
of back-and-forth

00:07:56.489 --> 00:07:57.780
has influenced your food today?

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.280
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
I actually think,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.140
going back-- so I didn't move
to Israel to become a chef.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.390
I just ended up working there.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.700
And then I worked at a
little cafe after the bakery.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.380
And I was like, wow, creating
things with my hands is fun.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.700
I like the intensity.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.370
I like the people-pleasing.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.700
I'm going to become a chef.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.700
And it wasn't my intention
to cook Israeli food.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.550
I moved back to the States,
and went to culinary school,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.961
and then worked in a bunch
of European restaurants

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:23.460
or whatever.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.350
And I thought that's what--

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.340
at that time in the '90s, or
the late '90s, early 2000s,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.679
everybody would go to school
or work and then go to Europe.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:40.690
And it was either San
Sebastian, Spain or France.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.610
That's kind of where
everybody was going.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.700
And that's just what
I thought I would do.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.230
And then I ended up not.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.170
I ended up going back to
visit my family in Israel.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.330
One of many things happened.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.050
And I just sort of was--

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.896
I don't know.

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.520
Sitting down at a
restaurant and having

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.740
20 different little
dishes come out

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.050
that represent 20
different countries,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.940
and the sort of music of it
all, and the choreography,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.850
and the live fuel, and
everything over charcoal,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.320
and spices that
you've never heard

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.020
of that represent the
spice trade, the Silk Road,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.850
2,000 years of
post-Babylon diaspora,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.930
Palestinian cooking from the
West Bank, from the Levant,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.740
from Gaza, the
Shabbat dinners that

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.330
include 100 different
cultures all mushed together,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.580
it was like, why do I
need to go to France?

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.320
Why do I need to go to Spain?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.610
At that time, ironically, tapas
was a big thing in Philly.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.130
And I was like, well, people
understand small plates

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.240
because of tapas, which is
funny, because mezze predates

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.499
tapas by, like, 2,000 years.

00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:54.040
But whatever.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.730
And I think that while that was
happening, people in Israel,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.760
instead of cooks in
Israel going to Europe,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.520
or going to Asia or the States,
and then coming back to Israel

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.320
to open up French restaurants or
whatever, they were like, well,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.850
going to have Shabbat dinner at
my grandparents' means Polish,

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.157
Moroccan, Yemenite,
and Romanian.

00:10:19.157 --> 00:10:19.990
It's all right here.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.090
I don't need to go
anywhere else for it.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.670
So we decided to open
an Israeli restaurant.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.640
And we didn't know
what that meant,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.110
because everyone was like--

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.860
what do you think?

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.526
When somebody says
there's a restaurant,

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:35.132
they're like, falafel, right,
or shawarma, or hummus, which--

00:10:35.132 --> 00:10:37.090
we would have made a lot
more money had we just

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.910
opened up those places.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.194
So we had to convince people
and answer the question--

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:46.735
everyone was like,
isn't it political

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:47.985
to open an Israeli restaurant?

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:49.590
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.880
I'm Israeli.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.550
I think that's kind of
a big, broad question.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.340
So we decided to
open what people call

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.720
a modern Israeli restaurant.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.780
Even though we cook
everything over charcoal

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.940
and make bread in a
wood-burning oven.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.370
The cooking methods
are quite primitive.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.315
But the idea of this
global Israeli food

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:12.690
going to different places and
being sort of reinterpreted

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.196
is what I think makes it modern.

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:15.070
SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.200
Love that.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.180
So not only did you have
an uber-successful Israeli

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.680
restaurant.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.740
You also have a donut empire.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.960
You have a few cookbooks.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.470
How do you decide what
ideas are worth sticking

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.050
to or really worth pursuing?

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.670
I'm sure you get,
in your head, a lot

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.320
of different concepts, ideas.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.674
What makes something
worth pursuing to you?

00:11:37.674 --> 00:11:39.840
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I think
that's a really difficult

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.920
question to answer, because
I think that as much as one

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.860
can strategize-- the secret
to any of this success

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.600
is having a brilliant
business partner or partners,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.940
which I've been lucky to have.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.207
I think that you have to make
a lot of really bad decisions.

00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:01.290
You don't wake up in the
morning, and you're like,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.880
we're going to have
a donut empire.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.600
What really happened is Zahav
almost closed its first year.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.640
We opened another restaurant.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.720
So we opened a modern Israeli
restaurant in 2008 right

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.740
after Wachovia, AIG went under.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.690
I was in drug rehab.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.210
And the Phillies were
winning the World Series,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.210
which is awesome if
you have a restaurant

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.540
or bar with a TV in it, not if
you have an Israeli restaurant.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.380
And the elections
were happening.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.880
Nobody wanted to go out and eat.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.420
And the economy
was falling apart.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.070
And when you're doing chopped
Israeli salad in February

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.440
in eastern Pennsylvania,
it's a little bit

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.656
difficult for the
customer, I guess,

00:12:46.656 --> 00:12:48.030
to understand what
was happening.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.770
So we almost went under.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.350
It was an awful year
for many reasons.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.810
And then we decided to
open a barbecue restaurant,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.379
thinking that it would be low
labor, low cost, low tech.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.670
All of those things were wrong.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.730
We opened, brisket
was $1.90 a pound.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.360
When we sold the restaurant,
brisket was at $5.00 a pound.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.929
Smoking meat is
very difficult. We

00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:10.470
were doing it like
Texas style, which

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.930
is closer to the Jewish
brisket that we grew up with.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.330
Most people don't like that.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.880
Most people, actually,
go anywhere in the South,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.180
have barbecue once, and think
that that is what barbecue is.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.719
So we didn't have pulled
pork for the first two years

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.010
even though everyone was like--

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.580
SPEAKER: Where's
the pulled pork?

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.520
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
--where's the pulled pork?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.330
I love pulled pork.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.790
And we're like, no, no,
no, they don't know.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.330
The reality is
you need to listen

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.340
to what your customers want.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.910
And it doesn't matter what the
tradition is, because tradition

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.550
in Texas is different
just like it

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.010
is when you make
pasta in Piedmont,

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.765
depending on what side of
the street you live on.

00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:51.060
And the other thing is we
weren't emotionally invested

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.120
into what it was.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.280
It didn't mean
the same as Zahav.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.940
So we started a donut
empire because we

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.220
had two restaurants that
were going to go under,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.040
that were huge.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.910
My partner, Steve, and I
met three other people.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.780
We all threw in a very small
amount of money, whatever

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.240
we were kind of willing
to lose at that time,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.910
because we wanted to do a new
project, and we were bored,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.020
and the big-box restaurants in
Philly were going to kill us.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.720
So we found a
600-square-foot restaurant

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.700
with three other people.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.840
Two of them brought the first
wave of fancy coffee to Philly.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.090
The other person was
a social media whiz.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.470
Steve and I knew food.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.730
And we opened Federal
Donuts with, like, $30,000.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.591
And then on day two--

00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:40.500
well, day one and day two, we
ran out of donuts in an hour,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.870
and we had people standing
in line for chicken

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.110
at 11:00 AM, when
we started at noon.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.500
And we were like, oh, we might
actually be on to something.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.960
So it was kind of like we had
nothing else left to lose,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.262
and we ended up with a donut
empire a few years later.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:56.970
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:01.464
And what made you decide to
do donuts and fried chicken?

00:15:01.464 --> 00:15:04.019
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
[LAUGHS] I don't know.

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:04.560
But the two--

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.430
SPEAKER: Just sounded good.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.220
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah,
donut, fried chicken, coffee

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.350
are the three major food
groups in Philadelphia.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:13.120
So no, the guys that
we had partnered with

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.660
wanted to do donuts, because
nobody was really doing donuts.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.710
And I think at the
time, I was just

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.750
eating a shitload of
Korean fried chicken.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.660
And we were like, we'll have
one piece of equipment, which

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.570
will be a fryer, and we could
do donuts and fried chicken,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.560
which it turns out
that donuts don't

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.980
taste very good after you've
fried a bunch of chicken

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.630
in them.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.150
So we bought another
piece of equipment.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.930
SPEAKER: Got it.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:35.430
Got it.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.180
So how was writing a cookbook?

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.960
What does that
process look like?

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.460
How do you decide, this
is what I want to do?

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.384
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Well, it is rough.

00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:47.050
Again, this is where
it's very important

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.170
to have an intelligent
business partner that

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.660
can write a cookbook.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.150
But I think for
the Zahav cookbook,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.900
it's something that we
wanted to do for years.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.680
And it took us about
five years to figure out

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.510
what our role was in being this
conduit from Israel to the US,

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.210
or to the Western
market, or whatever.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.470
Or figure out what our--

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.410
to be comfortable with the role
that we had in Israeli cuisine.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.270
So it took a long time.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.890
And there were a lot of moments
where we could have done it

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.630
differently or maybe a little
bit easier, which we didn't do.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.270
Thank god.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.320
And my business partner, Steve,
who had never written anything

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.990
professionally ever, after
toying with the idea of ghost

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.430
writers, was like,
I'm just going

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.760
to try to write a head
note, which he did.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.940
And then he was like, I'm
going to write a chapter.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.972
And then two years later, he
won two James Beard Awards

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:44.680
for writing this book,
which was awesome,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.190
including Book of the Year.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.250
So Zahav was a
very personal book,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.470
and it was a book that
the restaurant deserved,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.950
the movement that we
were a part of deserved.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.750
And it was something that was
a very-- it's a personal book.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.570
It's not just an
Israeli cookbook written

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.240
by an Israeli cookbook author.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.819
It's sort of like
our heart and soul.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.940
And it's like my family
and this sort of look

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.230
into Israel with your toe
in Israel and in the States.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.380
The Federal Donuts book
was just kind of fun.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.410
And we wanted to do it.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.829
And it's a little bit
silly, and there's

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:20.950
a workout routine in it.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.700
SPEAKER: There is.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.484
I did see it.

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:24.400
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I
work out at a boxing gym.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.900
And my trainer is
part of the cookbook.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.750
So it's great.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.210
You do exercises with fried
chicken, squats and stuff.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.344
And they work.

00:17:37.344 --> 00:17:39.010
And then we're working
on our third book

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.760
right now, which is the next--

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.420
it's like the prequel to Zahav--

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.250
SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.708
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
--which required

00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:49.479
us to be in Israel, shooting
and eating for like 10 days.

00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:50.020
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.730
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: We had 82
meals in, like, eight days.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.530
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.195
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:56.820
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: So we needed
to do a lot of chicken exercise

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.480
after that.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.160
SPEAKER: I was going to say--

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.260
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
And that is good.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.150
I'm hoping that we
don't have to do anymore

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.900
cookbooks after this.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.900
SPEAKER: Three and done.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.316
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
But it's great.

00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:08.640
It's amazing to
publish something.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.070
We always thought that
the digital cookbook

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.480
would be the thing.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.600
There is something about
sitting in your bathrobe,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.150
reading a cookbook at your
coffee table that is amazing.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.780
And there is something
about your kids

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.350
seeing it and recognizing
it, and having

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.220
coffee stains, or hummus
stains, or whatever variety

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.530
of food stains that you
have on the cookbook that

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.637
is special and personal.

00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:34.470
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.970
Definitely.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.675
I know I can say I do
like reading my hardcover.

00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:39.550
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: What
kind of food products

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.085
do you have stuck on your book?

00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:43.562
SPEAKER: You know, tea.

00:18:43.562 --> 00:18:44.520
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Tea?

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.480
SPEAKER: On the inside.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.380
But that's about it.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.650
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That's
a really safe answer.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.040
SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.410
Any other good food products
stuck on your cookbooks

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.100
in the audience?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.600
Good idea?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.304
No?

00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:52.090
AUDIENCE: Lemon-garlic paste.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.430
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Lemon-garlic
paste is a good one.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.340
SPEAKER: We should do stain
removers for cookbooks.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.060
Next product.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:57.680
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I don't know.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.510
Or we should do bookmarks that
are like a piece of steak that

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.980
you just, like--

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.750
SPEAKER: Yes, exactly.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.710
So you're a busy guy.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.102
You have multiple restaurants,
multiple cookbooks, traveling.

00:19:08.102 --> 00:19:09.060
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yes.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.867
SPEAKER: How do you
keep it all in balance?

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.450
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
I am not the person

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.590
to talk to about balance.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.670
SPEAKER: OK.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.700
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I don't think
that there's ever an ideal.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.630
I don't think that
there's ever perfect.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.940
I think that you always
have to prioritize.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.120
And I think that could be
hour to hour or day to day.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.680
I don't think looking
too far ahead--

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.060
we write these--

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.920
I have these goals
for the next year.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.330
And then after
day two, I'm like,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.360
this is the stupidest
freaking thing ever.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.170
And it doesn't really
work like that.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.410
And I think that there's
always short-term and long-term

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.130
happiness, and that these
long-term goals that we have

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.910
are--

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.780
they're important to have,
but they are never accurate.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.490
And I think they always
should be changing.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.052
I don't know.

00:19:50.052 --> 00:19:51.260
Not very good about balance--

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:51.740
SPEAKER: That's OK.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.550
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: --to
answer your question.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.550
SPEAKER: We're always
striving here at Google

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.110
to have better balance.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.030
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: There's
no such thing as perfect,

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.220
yet we're always
trying to achieve it.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:04.280
And I think that going
into it and being cognizant

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.530
of the whole thing and being
cognitive about the way

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.960
that you try to attain it
is the most important thing.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.460
You know?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.120
SPEAKER: Totally.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.619
Totally.

00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:12.510
Very cool.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.180
Well, we'll start opening
up the floor to questions,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.584
but before we do, I have a
little quick-fire for you.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:18.500
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.810
SPEAKER: But you kind of
already answered my first one.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.580
What is your 2018 New
Year's resolution?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.329
I know you said you
don't really have one.

00:20:24.329 --> 00:20:25.854
But if you had to pick one.

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:27.770
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I
want to drink more water.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.353
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.970
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I want to
sleep closer to seven hours

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.840
a night.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.620
I want to read more
and meditate more.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.024
I want to land a
backflip on a snowboard.

00:20:42.024 --> 00:20:44.000
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.636
Very cool.

00:20:44.636 --> 00:20:45.760
I like-- they're all great.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.942
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: One of
those things might not happen.

00:20:46.942 --> 00:20:49.154
SPEAKER: I was going
to say, very ambitious.

00:20:49.154 --> 00:20:51.070
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah,
I want to get my kids

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.980
to eat more decent food.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:21:02.160
And we have a couple of
very exciting projects.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.630
One of them is super
personal, and I really

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.450
want that to open well.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.220
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.910
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.000
And how do you pick where
you want to expand to?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.760
I know you have
restaurants in Philly.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.060
You have restaurants in Miami.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.852
You have Dizengoff
here in New York.

00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:19.310
What kind of process do you go
through when you're thinking

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.601
about where you want to expand?

00:21:20.601 --> 00:21:22.070
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Well, I think we

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.480
have these sort of grand plans.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.230
But I think that a lot
of what we depend on

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.620
is our human resource and
the way that our team grows.

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:36.380
In hospitality,
you need to accept

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.410
that you are a slave to your
employees, and your team,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.130
and to your customers.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.310
And if you don't
find joy in that,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.350
it's not a good
business to get into.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.330
And basically, we
just have to listen

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.150
to our customers, and
our guests, and our team,

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.070
and kind of figure out--

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.640
the convergence of
those two relationships

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.170
determines kind of
where we go next.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.050
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.480
No, I like that.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.735
So what's your biggest cooking
or kitchen hack, or trick?

00:22:05.735 --> 00:22:08.220
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Trick.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.623
I mean, I have a lot of tricks.

00:22:10.623 --> 00:22:11.660
SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.836
What's your favorite?

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:13.270
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That's
a very mysterious answer.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.650
I don't know.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.420
Be more specific.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.500
SPEAKER: Is there a way to
cut an onion that no one knows

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500
that you've figured out?

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.685
Or turning on a
certain temperature

00:22:22.685 --> 00:22:24.000
for a certain sauce?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.470
Like, any hacks
or tricks that you

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.800
could share with the broader,
non-professional chefs?

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.110
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Well, we
refer to this in our book,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:36.356
but the secret of our hummus
is very fluffy tehina.

00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:40.260
We blend whole bulbs of
garlic with lemon juice

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.690
and let it sit for,
like, 10 minutes,

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.190
so it mellows the garlic.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.070
And then pass and
strain the whole thing.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.370
So it's kind of a step.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.160
You don't have to peel garlic.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.220
And the bulb and the skin are
actually pretty delicious.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.600
We add that to raw tehina and
then whip it with ice water.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.710
And you end up with
this amazing sauce.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.780
The other trick is
that when you puree

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.940
whole bulbs of garlic
and lemon juice

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.750
for about 10 seconds, the way
that all the product suspends,

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.520
it looks like a milkshake.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.790
And if you're working next
to somebody that you dislike,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.331
you're like, try this
milkshake I made.

00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:18.330
And then they drink it--

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.420
[BLOWS MESSY RASPBERRY] [GROANS]

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.827
SPEAKER: Great hack.

00:23:21.827 --> 00:23:22.410
Perfect trick.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.659
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: So you
decide which trick you like.

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:26.410
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.410
So if you had to pick
one, donuts or hummus?

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.110
[LAUGHS]

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.989
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Cut, cut.

00:23:34.989 --> 00:23:35.530
I don't know.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.000
They're both fantastic.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.720
SPEAKER: OK.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.560
The one food you
can't live without?

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.950
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
I love raw carrots.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.720
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.680
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: But
I think that legumes are

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.600
pretty delicious and healthy.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.350
Peanut butter,
have to have that.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.990
Oh my god, I have to
have peanut butter.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.470
Cucumbers are really good.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.460
But when I cook,
I need a shitload

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.950
of parsley and lemon
juice on everything.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.027
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:24:16.027 --> 00:24:17.860
What's your favorite
restaurant in New York?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.210
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
It's kind of a toss-up.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.170
Eleven Madison Park
is obviously amazing.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:34.700
Shuko, which is a great
sushi restaurant, is awesome.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.290
A restaurant in Williamsburg
called Traif, which is great.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.750
One of my good friends runs it.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.150
Where else?

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.175
Momofuku Ssam Bar
is still amazing.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.080
L&amp;B Pizza in Brooklyn.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.800
Really good tomato pie.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.395
I don't know.

00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.370
It's kind of hard.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.390
This is terrible.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.360
But I'm up in New York
once a week or whatever.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.430
And there's a pizza
place in Penn Station

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.160
that I eat out at the most.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.910
SPEAKER: All right,
pizza in Penn Station.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.480
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
You can wash it

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.270
down with a lukewarm cup
of coffee from the kiosk

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.207
next door.

00:25:14.207 --> 00:25:15.915
SPEAKER: You're just
missing the hot dog.

00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:18.248
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: [SCOFFS]
There's something in Philly.

00:25:18.248 --> 00:25:21.420
I can't remember what it's
called, and I've never had it.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.740
And you take a cheesesteak
from Jim's, which

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.360
is on South Street, and put
it inside of a slice of pizza

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.490
from Lorenzo's, and you
roll it up and eat it.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.050
So you were saying hot dog.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.800
But I guess you could wrap a
hot dog with a slice of pizza

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.320
and eat it.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.700
SPEAKER: Yeah, the
New York version.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.116
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: You got to
make sure the coffee is hot,

00:25:41.116 --> 00:25:43.290
so you can shoot it down
your throat, you know?

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.220
SPEAKER: All right.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.290
Food competition.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.309
So what's your favorite food
destination besides Israel?

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:51.600
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I think
that we live in this great--

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.310
this is a frustrating,
stupid-ass answer

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.434
that I'm going to give you.

00:25:54.434 --> 00:25:56.070
But I think that
everywhere right now

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.580
is like a foodie town.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:03.680
And I think that we are
on the cusp of people

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.810
really getting a chance
to express themselves

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.010
and where they're from.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:11.420
And although there's tons
of xenophobia and alienation

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.550
happening all over
the world, people now

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.354
have this grassroots way
of telling their story.

00:26:17.354 --> 00:26:18.770
And I think that
everywhere you go

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.830
has got these
immigrant populations.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.540
Everywhere you go
in the world have

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.790
got people that have
made this living

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.460
generation after generation from
preparing food and hospitality.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.000
So I like going anywhere.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.230
I like going anywhere.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.200
I like going in holes in
the walls in any city.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.130
I think it's amazing.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.838
We were just talking
about South Florida.

00:26:38.838 --> 00:26:41.980
And when I learned
how to cook, I

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.200
went to culinary school
in West Palm Beach.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.900
And there were three kinds
of restaurants there.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.530
And now you can go
anywhere and figure out

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.970
where people are from.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:56.740
You can go to any
random road in Florida,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.110
and just take it, and
find a little place

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.020
that has arepas, or
the best Cuban coffee,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.230
or great Thai food.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.430
And it's just--

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.090
I don't know.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.760
I don't think there's a place
in the country that doesn't

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.100
have a great food scene.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.370
I don't often eat at
fancy restaurants,

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.620
mostly because I can't sit
for more than 45 minutes

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.540
without having an
anxiety attack.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.259
But I think that--

00:27:23.259 --> 00:27:23.800
I don't know.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.390
I think anywhere
is pretty great.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.110
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.568
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Anywhere Queens.

00:27:27.568 --> 00:27:30.910
I just get on a
train and go out.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:35.562
And god, what is the stop that
has got the great Indo-Paki--

00:27:35.562 --> 00:27:36.270
do you guys know?

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:36.690
Or what?

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:36.974
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:37.971
AUDIENCE: Jackson Heights.

00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:39.845
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yes,
Jackson Heights, man.

00:27:39.845 --> 00:27:42.100
And then there's
amazing dumplings.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.787
I mean, it's freaking awesome.

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:44.370
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:44.860
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.790
SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.750
So last question.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.110
Proudest moment of your career.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.800
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
That is a good one.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.340
Do you want to actually hear it?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:52.830
SPEAKER: Yeah, let's hear it.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.746
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: OK.

00:27:53.746 --> 00:27:55.860
So we've won a bunch
of great awards.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.220
I won the James Beard
Award for Best Chef:

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.910
Mid-Atlantic on Israeli
Independence Day in 2011

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.510
and then Outstanding Chef
again on Independence Day.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.030
And it was amazing, amazing.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:13.302
But I received a letter--

00:28:13.302 --> 00:28:14.010
I'm going to do--

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.307
I'm doing this right now.

00:28:15.307 --> 00:28:16.640
I'm going to read something, OK?

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:16.870
SPEAKER: Do it.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.940
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I've
got to find it on my phone.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.243
Are you guys ready?

00:28:19.243 --> 00:28:20.050
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.390
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
So here it is.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.760
"Dear Michael, my
name is Reem, and I'm

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.100
the author of the book you
are holding in your hands."

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.850
And the book was "The
Palestinian Table."

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.490
"I still remember
eating at Zahav

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.810
back in 2008 when I was
a student at Wharton.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.000
There was a dish of
freekeh topped with chicken

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.900
at the time, and I felt so
satisfied and so nostalgic

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.370
when I tasted it."

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.100
And then in parentheses, she
writes, "maybe also a little

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.600
jealous that the
best Arabic food

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.330
I had tasted since
arriving in Philly

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.100
was at an Israeli restaurant."

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.299
And then she did the
"semi-colon smile" thing,

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:03.090
which is weird when
somebody writes it out.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.771
But I liked it.

00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:07.377
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:07.377 --> 00:29:08.960
Because Palestinian
and Israeli, we're

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.970
all insecure line cooks
at the end of the day.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.420
And I was like, yeah, we won.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.365
So, "It's been almost
a decade since,

00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:17.900
and I just moved back to Philly
with my family from London

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.010
this past year.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.260
It's amazing to see what you've
done since I was here last.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.260
To be honest, I wanted
to reach out for a while,

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.940
but I hesitated.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.522
Yet when I watched 'In Search
of Israeli Cuisine,'" which was

00:29:28.522 --> 00:29:30.800
a documentary I was
in, "this past week,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.000
I realized what a genuine,
fun, curious person you are.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.340
And it reaffirmed my
desire to reach out to you

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.790
and get to know you.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.960
I believe food can help
start a conversation where

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.720
nothing else has been able to.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.991
And I hope my book is a
testament to that fact.

00:29:45.991 --> 00:29:47.990
As it happens, the
photographer who shot my book

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.532
is Israeli, Dan Perez.

00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:53.240
And the whole process
of working together

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.550
reaffirmed to me how the
human spirit can rise

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.370
above our muddled politics.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:03.460
So I just wanted to
share my book with you

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.969
and say thank you for the
inspiration you've been.

00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:07.510
You certainly don't
need my cookbook,

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.940
but I do hope you enjoy
looking through it

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.080
and maybe find a small piece
of our shared home inside it.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.580
Until we meet in person, I leave
you with my warmest wishes.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.461
Reem."

00:30:16.461 --> 00:30:16.960
Yeah.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.530
SPEAKER: That's pretty amazing.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.620
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That was
the best part of my career.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:18.850
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.320
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yup.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:22.860
SPEAKER: Applause for that.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.720
Amazing.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.840
And now you have
it on your phone

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.980
and you can always find it.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.980
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Or I
can struggle to find it.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.160
But it's there.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.660
Yeah, I think that
that is the best.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.180
I think that that is by far
the most important thing.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.470
And we have goals in
2018, which may or may not

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.890
be harder than landing a
backflip on a snowboard,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.689
but we'll see.

00:30:41.689 --> 00:30:42.480
SPEAKER: Who knows.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.180
TBD.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.840
That's awesome.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.260
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thanks.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.780
SPEAKER: Well, we'll open
up the room for questions

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.162
from the audience.

00:30:48.162 --> 00:30:49.610
Yeah.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.589
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Hi.

00:30:50.589 --> 00:30:51.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.682
I've eaten at Dizengoff next
door, and it was fantastic.

00:30:54.682 --> 00:30:55.890
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thank you.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.139
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Not only
is the hummus really good,

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:00.855
but the pita bread
is also the best.

00:31:00.855 --> 00:31:02.480
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Thank you very much.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.240
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
the best that I've had.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.420
I haven't been to Israel.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.700
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Your check
is in the mail, my friend.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.533
Thank you very much.

00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:07.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.940
You took off your
Dizengoff shirt

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.350
before coming over here, right?

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.999
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:12.540
I don't know.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.414
I just snuck in here.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.060
I like making hummus at
home, but it's hard for me

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.430
to make a pita
that's that great.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.600
Do you have any tips?

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I do.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.070
Actually, in the book, we have--

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.412
I'm not just saying
this so you buy a book.

00:31:34.412 --> 00:31:35.120
Who wants a book?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.900
No, uh--

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.800
SPEAKER: You get a
book, you get a book.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.370
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Here's what you do.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.530
Just steal hers, take a
picture of the recipe, and go.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.920
We have an easy way to
make it using a home oven,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.430
and using the
broiler, basically,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.150
and a cookie tray upside down.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.010
Good pita is a few things.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:52.500
It is not overworking
the dough, and it

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.740
is super hot
contact with an oven

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.532
to get good oven spring
to make the pocket.

00:31:57.532 --> 00:31:59.115
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
kind of like-- it

00:31:59.115 --> 00:32:01.720
sounds like, basically, pizza
but no toppings, in a way,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.220
right?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.840
Like, I think about the same
thing when baking a pizza.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:03.966
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:05.260
Like, a less marketable pizza.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.390
But pizza, you've got
a little bit more,

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.390
because you need a
little bit of crust,

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.400
whereas the perfect
pita, despite a lot

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.370
of the store-bought pita that
we have here in the States,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.660
should be really pliable,
so you can scoop and wipe,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.420
and also needs to
hold up, so you

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.460
can make a sandwich with it,
drive a car, talk on the phone,

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.610
and smoke a cigarette
at the same time, which

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.273
is the test of a perfect pita.

00:32:34.273 --> 00:32:35.040
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.830
I will test for that.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.121
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: In the
book, we have a great recipe.

00:32:38.121 --> 00:32:40.560
AUDIENCE: With trends like
Yelp, Instagram, and podcasts,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.060
what are some of
the pros and cons

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.247
that you see in these,
as a restaurant owner?

00:32:45.247 --> 00:32:47.580
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I think
that every industry is always

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.050
changing.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.508
I think the restaurant industry
is definitely no exception.

00:32:50.508 --> 00:32:54.170
And I think that people
hate on Yelp, for example.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.920
And everyone-- it's
like, ooh, Yelpers.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.650
But I mean, if I go
to a table at Zahav,

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.530
and I'm like, hey, covered in
flour, bringing the pita over,

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.120
and I'm like, what do you think?

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.120
You're going to be like,
oh, my god, it's great.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.910
Thank you so much.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:06.870
And then you're going to
leave and you're going

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.130
to be like, that place sucks.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.050
You know?

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:13.320
And the good thing about Yelp
is even though sometimes I

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.310
lose sleep over
how brutally honest

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:21.120
it can be, it's one of the
only ways to get real feedback.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.900
So a lot of people hate on Yelp.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.250
The truth is we read--

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.570
I read-- everybody in my
company reads our Yelp reviews

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.810
every single day.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.230
And we respond to every
single one of them.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.980
And we take them
all very seriously.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.160
So it's annoying when--

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.190
it's annoying, because I want
people to like everything

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.720
that I do.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.120
The reality is we're in the
most subjective industry,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.300
and we're trying to
please, I don't know,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.790
like thousands of people a week
that all have different taste

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.440
buds.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.154
And there's no real
way to do that.

00:33:56.154 --> 00:33:57.070
But the other things--

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.510
I mean, it's just a function of
what it is that we do, right?

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.000
The industry and
environment that you're in

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.900
is only about
progressive ingenuity.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.790
And I think restaurants
are exactly the same.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.800
And trends are happening
now because people

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.330
are interested in food.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.469
And media and communications
are just out there.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:24.232
And having an Instagram account
with thousands of followers

00:34:24.232 --> 00:34:26.190
coming to the restaurant,
and taking a picture,

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.940
and posting it is sometimes
just as important as a review

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.659
from a critic, which
is crazy a little bit.

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.670
But it's just the way it goes.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.417
So I think that it's
kind of exciting.

00:34:38.417 --> 00:34:40.500
I can't wait to see what's
next and the way that--

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:43.830
I don't know.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.929
There's a lot of things
happening at the same time

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:46.429
right now.

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.550
We've got environment,
labor, all these sort

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.750
of topics and issues.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.929
And the way that technology
and ingenuity, I think,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.240
are going to help put things
in the right direction.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.630
And to be part of it in one way
or another is pretty exciting.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.662
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:35:02.662 --> 00:35:04.620
AUDIENCE: I watched the
documentary on Netflix,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.745
and my husband and I were
grinning from ear to ear,

00:35:06.745 --> 00:35:07.807
because it was so great.

00:35:07.807 --> 00:35:08.890
You guys have to watch it.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:10.720
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thank you.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.160
AUDIENCE: Question, though.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.710
We noticed that falafel
wasn't really mentioned.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.460
And it's such an
iconic food of Israel

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.500
and that region of
the Middle East.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.310
So I'm curious if there was a
specific reason it was omitted

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.220
or you guys just had so many
other good subjects it couldn't

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:27.720
be included.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.050
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah, I
mean, come to think of it,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:29.924
I guess you're right.

00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.480
We ate so much falafel.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.900
I just don't know.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.790
I don't actually know.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:40.360
The filmmaker Roger
Sherman would probably

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.890
answer that better.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.880
But I don't think
there was a reason.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.255
I don't think we
were like, well,

00:35:45.255 --> 00:35:47.689
we can't do falafel,
because that's too much--

00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:48.730
SPEAKER: Too [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:49.480
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
--too much or whatever.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:49.850
AUDIENCE: Too controversial.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:50.629
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:35:50.629 --> 00:35:52.420
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: What
you saw on the film

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.340
was like 20% of what we shot.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.140
And we were there for
three and a half weeks,

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.710
eating seven times a day.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.050
It was crazy.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.980
So I don't know why there
wasn't a falafel documentary.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.349
There should be.

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.890
Only falafel.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.849
AUDIENCE: Is there enough
footage for a Part 2?

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:12.056
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: There
could be footage for Part 2.

00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:13.410
I mean, it could go on forever.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.090
And what's funny is that we
shot that five years ago.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.000
I go to Israel at
least once a year.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.030
I obviously go to visit family.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.620
But it's like my job.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.540
I eat all the time.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.700
And most of the places
that we went to I

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.820
had not even heard of.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.000
And a lot of places that I
go back to, I don't even--

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.750
the country is the
size of New Jersey.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.580
And it's just like you could
not skip a meal or a cuisine

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.750
for weeks.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.812
It's just so
gastronomically rich.

00:36:44.812 --> 00:36:47.270
But I think that was kind of
the point that we were making.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.978
But I don't know about
the falafel thing.

00:36:48.978 --> 00:36:51.858
We should definitely
make a complaint on Yelp

00:36:51.858 --> 00:36:53.172
to the filmmaker.

00:36:53.172 --> 00:36:54.700
AUDIENCE: It was still great.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.270
Thank you.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.710
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thank you.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.370
If you're a falafel fan too,
you should come to Philly.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.750
We have a good
falafel shop there.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.374
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:00.374 --> 00:37:02.909
We've actually been talking
about taking a little day trip.

00:37:02.909 --> 00:37:03.950
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Do it.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:09.500
Get the Google bus, or airplane,
or helicopters, and come down.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.490
Yeah, the copter.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.990
AUDIENCE: So first of all, thank
you so much for being here.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.620
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Thanks for having me.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.203
AUDIENCE: My mom is
Israeli, actually,

00:37:16.203 --> 00:37:18.910
and I definitely connected
with the kind of eclectic food

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.460
that I grew up eating,
like from hummus,

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.345
obviously, to
schnitzel, to borscht,

00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:26.110
to blintzes, to you name
it, by the way of Poland,

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.460
I should say.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.890
So obviously, Dizengoff is
kind of a different kind

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.450
of hospitality than Zahav.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.684
It's more of a
takeout spot for me.

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:36.100
I'm curious what you think
just in terms of the restaurant

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.810
industry about delivery?

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.282
Do you think delivery
is the next great thing?

00:37:40.282 --> 00:37:41.740
Do you think it's
a necessary evil?

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.902
Do you think it's kind of
the downfall of restaurants?

00:37:44.902 --> 00:37:46.360
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
And we were sort

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.484
of touching on this before.

00:37:47.484 --> 00:37:49.060
I definitely think
it's the future.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.630
I think that takeout--

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.790
I mean, especially in
metropolitan areas,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.442
are the way that we
sort of work, I guess.

00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:59.650
I think that delivery makes
the most amount of sense.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.920
And I think figuring out
the way to do that is

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.110
sort of the next big thing.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.547
And for us-- and this
goes back to the reason

00:38:07.547 --> 00:38:08.630
that we cook Israeli food.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.730
It's my food memories,
the reasons that I cook,

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.530
are not because
of a seven-course

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.220
or 12-course tasting menu
at a Michelin restaurant.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.820
It's about having the perfect
pita and hummus that make

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.220
me want to explode with joy.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.200
And I think that you have
that opportunity with takeout,

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.170
with fast casual.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.110
And it definitely is.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.330
And I think, actually, a lot of
places are doing it quite well.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.010
I think there still is
a lot of room for that--

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.555
the Dizengoff partnership
here with you all could work.

00:38:38.555 --> 00:38:40.680
But I think that that is
definitely the next thing.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.638
AUDIENCE: I guess to
maybe be more specifically

00:38:42.638 --> 00:38:44.310
around the actual
kind of texture,

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.110
flavor, heat, temperature,
all those things

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.980
around the perfect
pita, for example--

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.100
how that travels and some of the
challenges that go with that.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.820
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I know.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.210
We're working on that too.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.860
And I think that the
perfect pita, for us,

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.510
goes in Styrofoam, sealed.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.960
So we're waiting for somebody--

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.590
and maybe in your
free time, guys,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.340
you can start working on this.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.850
There are people using
fungus, actually,

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:15.150
sort of like plastic-esque
fungus that sort of simulates

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.250
airtight plastic.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.912
So we need that, because that
is what the perfect pita is.

00:39:19.912 --> 00:39:21.120
It is soft, and it is fluffy.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.340
And it doesn't even
have to be warm.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.540
But sealing it is good.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.470
And we do that now.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.970
When we dropped
off pita here, we

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.845
brought over these giant
Styrofoam containers

00:39:28.845 --> 00:39:29.960
that we reuse.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.400
But as much as I think it would
make a great Instagram video,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.770
we can't drop off one pita with
a giant Styrofoam container,

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.260
and open it up.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.280
You know?

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.690
What we should do is put a
human being inside of it,

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.010
so when you open it up, they
jump out and they're like,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.450
here's your pita,
and they run away.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:53.000
So that's what we're
going to work on next.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.820
I do think it's kind
of the next big thing.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.580
But I think that goes
for every type of food.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.480
There's so many different
kinds of iconic street food

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.810
that people are used to eating
in the street and standing up.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.230
And delivery of it
kind of messes it up.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.120
So yeah.

00:40:10.585 --> 00:40:12.070
Hey.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.070
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.050
You briefly mentioned
your business partner.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.540
I think his name was
Steve, and how important it

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.620
was to have a good one.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.760
It makes perfect sense.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.150
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yes.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.608
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:40:21.608 --> 00:40:24.950
about how you guys
came to work together,

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.510
where you experienced the most
friction with one another,

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.375
and how you make decisions
when you inevitably disagree?

00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:33.250
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Those
are great questions.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.040
And those are things that we,
after being in business for 10

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.295
years, becoming best friends
after being business partners,

00:40:39.295 --> 00:40:41.174
you always have to re-examine.

00:40:41.174 --> 00:40:43.090
And sometimes they can
be super uncomfortable.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.480
And we're opposite
people, which I

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.860
think makes a better product
for our guests and for our team.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:58.840
He was an investment banker
that hated it from day one.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.820
He was here, working for
Blackstone in the late '90s,

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.360
then decided to go to
culinary school at night,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.510
and then opened a
restaurant in Philadelphia,

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.540
and then after a short period
of time, got really burned out.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.170
And his wife and I grew
up together in Pittsburgh.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:22.390
So we met and hung out, and
then started opening restaurants

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.960
together.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:32.170
And I think that the way that
we contradict one another,

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.580
it forces a conversation.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.510
And I think that we
ultimately take ourselves

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.340
out of the equation,
because you have

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.000
to change the narrative if
it's like the two of you that

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.760
have everything that you've
ever worked on or invested--

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.260
you know, we invest everything
together all the time.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.670
So we have to make
decisions that

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.520
are super subjective
but also very objective,

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.970
because we're
considering so much.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:00.460
And I think the back-and-forth
friction is actually

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.060
a good thing.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.730
We have to adjust,
basically, and we

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.190
have to remember that
we're not the only people

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.080
making decisions all the time.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.290
And sometimes they
can be dragged out,

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.500
and sometimes they can
be funny and ironic,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.100
and then sometimes
they can breed

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.200
probably a very low
level of resentment

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.690
until we talk it out.

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:33.710
But I think that we're always
consciously disagreeing

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.000
on things.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.620
And I feel like that ends up--

00:42:40.202 --> 00:42:43.290
we sort of always have
our eye on the prize.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.020
I don't like it.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.380
I don't like confrontation.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.300
And I am really animated.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.320
And when I get pissed off,
I yell and throw things.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.810
And he is very quiet
and will stare at you

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:59.340
for an hour and a half
until he gets what he wants.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.450
And he's also super intelligent.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:09.210
And I am what I like to call
emotionally intelligent.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.260
I think that we're
sort of forced

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.250
to come up with decisions
together because of that.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.040
And when you have everything
collateralized for bank loans,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.690
you can't just walk away.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:28.960
And I think that
also, what's been

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.260
really funny is, because of
the nature of our industry,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.064
people see me as the guy
that does everything.

00:43:35.064 --> 00:43:36.730
Because people like
chefs, because we're

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.050
on TV, because we have tattoos,
and because we drop F bombs.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.620
And people love that, and
they think we're creative.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.210
The reality is everything
that I've ever done

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:47.530
has been with Steve.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.960
Like a lot of our
restaurants-- because I

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.270
tend to work at Zahav a lot.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.100
We have 14 restaurants.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.970
I don't make decisions
for all of them.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.576
He's got a finance background.

00:43:57.576 --> 00:43:59.450
Obviously, when we're
writing business plans,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:05.005
I'm not the guy that's
like, fuckin' whatever.

00:44:05.005 --> 00:44:07.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:13.670
Loan officers don't love
that sort of discussion.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.050
So a lot of what we've had
to do is check our egos.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.970
And every time an
article gets published

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.960
that's like Michael
Solomonov's restaurant empire,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.610
I get offended by it.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.910
And I need to sit and
be like, Steve, I'm

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:32.800
so sorry that that has
happened, because it's bullshit,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.500
because we have 250
people that work for us.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500
Steve and I come
up with everything.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.610
Steve has written three books.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.350
One of them won
two Beard Awards,

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.810
including Book of the Year.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.140
And people still look
at my name as the thing.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.080
So a lot of it has to be that
emotional sort of checking.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.680
And in the office,
people go to Steve

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.300
and want him to make decisions.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.480
And I'm like, hey, dude,
I'm like a 50% owner

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.220
of all these things.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.380
And although I
get lippy and loud

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.410
and don't have
business experience,

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:08.500
we've built this together.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.780
So on one hand,
my ego gets hurt.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.460
On the other hand,
his gets hurt.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.430
And we have to sit
and do kumbaya often,

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.670
or trust falls with one another,
which are not effective.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.050
You need more than two people.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.450
I think it's awesome.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:29.900
And I think that he's, for
all intents and purposes,

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.710
like my brother.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:35.870
And we've been to hell and
back and through hell and back

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:36.470
together.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:40.640
And I love the idea of what--

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.530
we've been partners
together for like a decade

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.760
and built so much together.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.080
And I think a lot of that
has to do with our resilience

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.370
as a team.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.044
So it's good.

00:45:50.044 --> 00:45:51.710
But it's hard to work
with other people.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:52.910
It is not easy.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.710
Most relationships fall apart.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:55.940
Most egos fall apart.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.730
And the moment you start
believing everything positive

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.600
written about you
and take it to heart

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.670
is when things do fall apart.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.674
So don't get into the restaurant
business is what I'm saying.

00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:08.090
Thanks for your
questions, though.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.230
They were really-- I
hope I answered them.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.730
Hey.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a
lighthearted question.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.890
You mentioned one of your
New Year's resolutions

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.400
was to have your
kids eat better.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.360
AUDIENCE: As a new mom
of a young daughter,

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.100
I'm just curious--
like, real talk,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.980
I'm guessing your kids
don't eat dino chicken

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.780
nuggets on a random Tuesday.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.590
Maybe they do.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:28.829
But what is the before?

00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:29.870
What are they eating now?

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.330
What do you hope
they would eat later?

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:33.110
I'm just curious.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.917
What's the before and
after in your world?

00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:36.500
I'm guessing it's
different than mine.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.041
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
It always changes.

00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:40.590
And I think the one constant
is that there is no absolute

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.020
and that whenever
you think you're

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.970
onto some thing with your
kid, it always changes.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.250
So the things that
they've always enjoyed,

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:51.440
though, have been Asian
noodle soup, which I'm lucky,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.520
because we can do pho.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.320
We can do ramen,
that kind of thing.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.950
Greens and herbs and stuff
are a little bit tricky.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.860
But I think that
bribing them with candy

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.690
is what you should do.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.400
And I'm also not above--

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.110
I get a little--

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.900
I fly off the handle
and will sometimes

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.530
border on being a crazy parent.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.740
And like a little pat on
the back, grab on the neck,

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.360
and I'm like, you're
going to eat this.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.570
But I think it's
always a victory.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.030
My oldest son will not eat
a peanut butter and jelly

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.745
sandwich, but will eat head-on,
shell-on shrimp tail first.

00:47:32.745 --> 00:47:34.120
And I'm like,
dude, you're eating

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.830
Szechuan shrimp that are so
spicy, no adult will eat that.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.720
But why won't you
eat Wonder Bread?

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.630
And I think what you have to
do is celebrate the shrimp

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.570
and then find shrimp all
over the city to go eat.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.640
And then you do it.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.900
But bribing with candy is
definitely the only way

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.270
to actually make it work.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.610
And M&amp;M's have these
caramel ones right

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.610
now that the kids love.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.817
And that will get them--
they'll eat anything.

00:47:57.817 --> 00:47:59.650
SPEAKER: Do you cook
at home a lot for them?

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.441
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That
is the other thing.

00:48:01.441 --> 00:48:04.870
I think having them
participate is a huge thing

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.800
and being part of it.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.160
And even baby fingers
picking cilantro

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.310
leaves that they will
never eat, still exciting,

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.320
and they're still
part of that, too.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.620
But I've found smoothies,
you can do a lot.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.761
If you start with a banana
and strawberry, you can--

00:48:20.761 --> 00:48:21.760
AUDIENCE: Throw in kale.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.570
Throw in whatever.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.695
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Or like
eye of newt or whatever.

00:48:24.695 --> 00:48:26.380
You can put anything in there.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.420
As long as it's red and
smells like a banana,

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.322
you could put anything in there.

00:48:31.322 --> 00:48:32.155
AUDIENCE: It's true.

00:48:32.155 --> 00:48:32.410
Yeah.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.326
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Like,
gravel if you wanted.

00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:37.581
It wouldn't make a difference.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.080
Any other--

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:38.395
SPEAKER: Good to know.

00:48:38.395 --> 00:48:40.054
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Any other questions?

00:48:40.054 --> 00:48:40.970
SPEAKER: Good to know.

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:41.340
Oh.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.256
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh.

00:48:42.256 --> 00:48:44.818
Oh, here we go.

00:48:44.818 --> 00:48:46.309
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mike.

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:48.964
So you've done a lot of
research for your food, right?

00:48:48.964 --> 00:48:50.130
You've been to Israel a lot.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.830
Do you feel you have a
lot more digging to do,

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.250
like find all the recipes, going
through all the genealogy, as

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.560
much as the food and
recipes have traveled?

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.602
Where are you in your
satisfaction level on that?

00:49:01.602 --> 00:49:03.434
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That
is a great question,

00:49:03.434 --> 00:49:04.829
and I am not satisfied.

00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:05.870
We have a long way to go.

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:08.330
And I think that--

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:17.456
god, I remembered this middle
school social studies teacher.

00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:19.830
I think it was the first--
maybe it was the first history

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.310
class I ever took.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:24.525
And they were like, bullet
point was like, why is it

00:49:24.525 --> 00:49:25.650
important to study history?

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.590
And it was like, so you can
understand or at least shape

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.980
the future, which we've all
come to terms with is bullshit.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:38.930
But the idea of being able to
do it and figuring out your role

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:41.380
and the sort of continuity
of it is so important.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.460
So I think that, to me,
it's part of my heritage.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.550
And I'm fascinated by the
country and what opportunities

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:53.660
the food ways and the
cultural food ways,

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.737
sort of how they
have been presented

00:49:56.737 --> 00:49:57.820
and how they can play out.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.520
I think it's very stimulating.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.390
I never get bored of it.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:03.954
I spent most of my life here.

00:50:03.954 --> 00:50:05.370
The moment I get
off the airplane,

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.940
and I smell the orange
blossoms, and hear

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.920
the country and the
people, and taste the food,

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.190
and smell the spices, and
discover something new, which

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.990
happens every single trip.

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.630
I went five times last year.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:23.617
There were 30 points in those
five trips where I was like,

00:50:23.617 --> 00:50:25.450
I can't believe I've
never seen this before.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.850
I am so excited
about this thing.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:28.810
That never ends.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:36.690
And as much as I sometimes
feel so not Israeli there,

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:40.860
I feel a sense of
peace in the bolygon,

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.910
in the craziness that is Israel
that I will never get tired of.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.610
I was born there, which
means that even if I travel

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.710
in the Middle East on
my American passport,

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.890
it still says I was born in
Israel, which doesn't get you

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.960
very far in the Middle East.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.160
But I'm really hoping--

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.660
this is super cliched, but I'm
hoping that, through food, we

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.930
can start to open up the
borders a little bit,

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.230
figuratively and literally.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.290
It would be really amazing.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:12.120
I would love to be able to go
to, which I can do, go to Spain

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.150
and make that sort of trek.

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:20.790
But I would also like to be
able to go to Aleppo, what

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.320
is left of it, and see
it; or go to Damascus;

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.860
or to go to Beirut; or
travel through the Beqaa

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.000
Valley in Lebanon.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.220
Those countries are
super important.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.100
And the fact that I
don't have access to them

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.470
is infuriating, quite honestly.

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:38.622
So hopefully, through
food, we can do it.

00:51:38.622 --> 00:51:39.580
Thank you guys so much.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.180
Thank you so much.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.221
SPEAKER: Well, thank you.

00:51:41.221 --> 00:51:44.730
[APPLAUSE]
