Institute for large-scale innovation
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.940
Institute for large-scale innovation
based in San Francisco we look at

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
based in San Francisco we look at
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.160
based in San Francisco we look at
innovation as a societal issue and our

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
innovation as a societal issue and our
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.200
innovation as a societal issue and our
principal activity is running a global

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
principal activity is running a global
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.379
principal activity is running a global
network of currently about 31 national

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
network of currently about 31 national
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.570
network of currently about 31 national
chief innovation officers and trying to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
chief innovation officers and trying to
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970
chief innovation officers and trying to
set some standards for innovation at a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
set some standards for innovation at a
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.640
set some standards for innovation at a
national and societal also global level

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
national and societal also global level
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130
national and societal also global level
so I just finished chairing the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
so I just finished chairing the
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.830
so I just finished chairing the
organization revolution in session which

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
organization revolution in session which
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230
organization revolution in session which
have a lot to do with innovation in the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
have a lot to do with innovation in the
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870
have a lot to do with innovation in the
European and Central Asian regions I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
European and Central Asian regions I
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.810
European and Central Asian regions I
think the most important priority is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
think the most important priority is
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850
think the most important priority is
simply to be clear about what innovation

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
simply to be clear about what innovation
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030
simply to be clear about what innovation
is and what one can expect from it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
is and what one can expect from it
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.580
is and what one can expect from it
whether one is a corporate private

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
whether one is a corporate private
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.720
whether one is a corporate private
sector player or a public sector player

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730
sector player or a public sector player
 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.799
sector player or a public sector player
generally speaking I think there's a lot

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
generally speaking I think there's a lot
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.830
generally speaking I think there's a lot
of vagueness and machinist and kind of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
of vagueness and machinist and kind of
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410
of vagueness and machinist and kind of
emotion around the term innovation and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
emotion around the term innovation and
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029
emotion around the term innovation and
what we need is clarity and crispness

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
what we need is clarity and crispness
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.450
what we need is clarity and crispness
which ultimately will translate into

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460
which ultimately will translate into
 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.340
which ultimately will translate into
management best practices and metrics

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
management best practices and metrics
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.090
management best practices and metrics
and and so on I also think that in my

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
and and so on I also think that in my
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.130
and and so on I also think that in my
view innovation is always about purpose

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
view innovation is always about purpose
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980
view innovation is always about purpose
i define innovation as creativity

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
i define innovation as creativity
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.179
i define innovation as creativity
applied to some purpose to realize value

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189
applied to some purpose to realize value
 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.740
applied to some purpose to realize value
and to help define a desired future so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
and to help define a desired future so
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080
and to help define a desired future so
what is that desired future for European

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
what is that desired future for European
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820
what is that desired future for European
countries for Europe is a region for

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
countries for Europe is a region for
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859
countries for Europe is a region for
Central Asia is kind of an open question

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
Central Asia is kind of an open question
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.490
Central Asia is kind of an open question
and what you believe the purpose will be

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
and what you believe the purpose will be
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.819
and what you believe the purpose will be
will drive the execution and then

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
will drive the execution and then
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740
will drive the execution and then
finally I think there's a wide variety

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
finally I think there's a wide variety
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.950
finally I think there's a wide variety
of approaches to innovation execution I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
of approaches to innovation execution I
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870
of approaches to innovation execution I
don't think there's any one size fits

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
don't think there's any one size fits
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090
don't think there's any one size fits
all there's no textbook there's no

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
all there's no textbook there's no
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.670
all there's no textbook there's no
three-ring binder there simply a lot of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
three-ring binder there simply a lot of
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219
three-ring binder there simply a lot of
knowledge currently and growing that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
knowledge currently and growing that
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560
knowledge currently and growing that
people who are running companies and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
people who are running companies and
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109
people who are running companies and
running governments need to study think

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
running governments need to study think
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.630
running governments need to study think
about an experiment with any interests

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
about an experiment with any interests
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.880
about an experiment with any interests
of creating a really effective

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890
of creating a really effective
 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.159
of creating a really effective
innovation agenda
