00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.160
All around us, engineers
are creating materials

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.620
whose properties are exactly
tailored to their purpose.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.910
Fiber composites in
pole vaulting poles

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.010
are flexible and light,
yet strong enough

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.040
not to break while bent.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.000
Sandwich panels
in sailboat hulls

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
give a lightweight structure
that is stiff and strong.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.170
And alloying elements in metals
can increase the strength

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.840
of the metal by
more than 10 times.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.050
Together in 3.032x: Mechanical
Behavior of Materials,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.330
we will explore materials from
the atomic to the continuum

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.230
level.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.920
We'll understand why materials
have the properties that they

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.761
do and how they
respond to loading.

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:44.260
And you'll see how to apply
this understanding in the design

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.012
of engineering materials like
composites and metal alloys.

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:50.220
We'll also take a look beyond
traditional engineering

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.250
to look into nature to further
explore the principles that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.860
are the basis for the
way our world works.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.318
Have you ever wondered how
woodpeckers avoid brain injury?

00:00:59.318 --> 00:01:02.260
Or how cattails stand so tall?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.185
By exploring these
questions and more,

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.060
you'll see the natural
world through the eyes

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080
of an engineer, and you'll
see how engineers design

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.530
materials inspired by nature.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.530
I'm Lorna Gibson.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.960
I'm a professor at MIT.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.990
I've been here since 1984.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.000
I study the mechanical behavior
of porous, cellular materials,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.520
things like engineering
honeycombs and foams,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.740
natural materials like wood,
cork, plant leaves and stems

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.790
and bone, and medical materials
like tissue engineering

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.670
scaffolds.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.390
I also love natural history,
and I'm a bird watcher.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.060
I love using
engineering principles

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.740
to understand the natural world.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.570
In this course, I
put these interests

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.090
to work to cover the
fundamentals of how materials

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.450
deform and fail.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.440
We'll see why some materials
deform instantaneously,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.782
while others deform
gradually over time.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:49.740
We'll understand why some
materials can undergo

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950
large deformations
while others break

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.290
without any visible deformation.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.790
To get the most
out of the subject,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.060
you'll need some background
in physics, calculus,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.460
and chemistry.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.280
By the end of the
course, you'll understand

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.365
how materials
deform under forces,

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:04.740
and you'll be able
to predict how

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.680
forces applied to objects
translate into internal

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.919
stresses that cause failure.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.335
You'll also discover
how engineers

00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:14.050
can control and modify
the mechanical properties

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.290
of materials, and you'll learn
to appreciate efficient designs

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.930
in the natural world.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.940
Join us to explore the
mechanical behavior

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.540
of materials and
to see how this can

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.870
be used to understand materials
in engineering, nature,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.600
and medicine.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.250
