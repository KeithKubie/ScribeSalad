00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.480
- [Instructor] Perhaps
the most mind-blowing idea

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.190
in all of biology is the concept

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.450
that all living things we know of,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.070
based on current evidence that we have,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.540
all originated from a common ancestor.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.420
So it doesn't matter
whether we're talking about

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.750
a simple bacterial cell, which actually,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.730
in reality, isn't so simple after all,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.290
a tree made up of trillions
and trillions of cells,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.370
a hairy primate made up of
trillions and trillion cells,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.600
or seemingly well-dressed
agriculture kittens,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.820
which are also made of trillions
and trillions of cells,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.340
that they all share a common ancestor.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
You might have seen things
like these evolutionary trees.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.720
This is an example right over here.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.180
This is saying the same thing.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.300
That everything that we
see in the world today,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.860
all living things, regardless
of what domain they're in,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.980
and we would be a subset of
animals, right over here.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.850
There's so many animal species.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.040
That they all share a common ancestor

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.860
several billions of years ago.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.220
But you should be skeptical.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.540
We are scientists here.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.760
How do we believe this, what
is the evidence for that?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820
And one piece of evidence is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.840
by looking at the cellular level,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.370
and look at commonalities
amongst different groups,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.640
and realize that it would
be unlikely for them

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.990
to develop independently of each other.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.990
For example, all lifeforms
that we know of have DNA.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.250
They all have RNA.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.330
And it isn't just how the
encode information, it's also

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.200
processes, biochemical processes,
that occur in the cells.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.760
They all have some form of glycolysis.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.620
But this seems, and these
aren't the only things

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.330
that we've observed are
common to all lifeforms,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.140
they're all based on
cells as the basic units,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.550
which are bound by a membrane.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.290
And so, in theory, these things, I guess,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.700
could have developed
independently of each other,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.480
without having a common ancestor,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560
but having a common ancestor
is the best explanation

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.470
of why we see these different processes.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.060
Some of these are quite complex for these

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.030
different structures
throughout life as we know it.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.880
And so you're saying all
right, I can maybe buy that,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.270
that there's this common
ancestor right over here,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.650
but how do we constuct this tree?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.220
How do we know when things branched off?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.280
Because some of these
branches off of these trees,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.720
once again, these would have occurred

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.820
hundreds of millions or
billions of years ago,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.690
and none of us were around
to observe that happening.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.430
And once again, that goes
to more structural evidence.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.360
So, for example, amongst what
we now classify as eukaryotes,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.240
so everything in this brown color,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.320
this branch of the tree right over here,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.763
we see that all of them have
membrane-bound organelles.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.540
Membrane-bound organelles.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.390
These are things like a
nucleus, or mitochondria

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.320
that we study in many other videos.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.623
They all have linear chromosomes.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.680
So, in other groups in this tree of life,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.290
in this evolutionary tree,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.020
you might have circular chromosomes.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.710
But common to all eukaryotes
are the linear chromosomes.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.390
And they all have chromosomes
that contain introns.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.381
Introns are sequences of DNA
that don't code for genes

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.850
that will then code into proteins.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.510
And we're still exploring
what the point of introns are.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.250
But the reason why all of these have been

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.080
classified together is that
they have these similarities.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.420
And so we believe that they

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.760
would've formed their own branch.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.900
And based on how similar
things are, that's where

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.940
we theorize when things
might have branched off.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.610
And now that we have more sophisticated

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.960
tools of sequencing DNA and RNA,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.490
we can look at how different
those sequences are

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.823
to construct more and more
precise trees like this.
