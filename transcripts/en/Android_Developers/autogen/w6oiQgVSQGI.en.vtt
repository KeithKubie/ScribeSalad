would like to invite you to think about

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
would like to invite you to think about
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650
would like to invite you to think about
the next billion users and where they're

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
the next billion users and where they're
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.090
the next billion users and where they're
going to come from particularly with

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
going to come from particularly with
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670
going to come from particularly with
regards to user growth so we've seen

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
regards to user growth so we've seen
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350
regards to user growth so we've seen
astounding development in the last

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
astounding development in the last
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360
astounding development in the last
couple of years I'm sure we all have

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
couple of years I'm sure we all have
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.819
couple of years I'm sure we all have
highly capable devices in our pockets we

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
highly capable devices in our pockets we
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680
highly capable devices in our pockets we
have high speed data connections that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
have high speed data connections that
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990
have high speed data connections that
are always on and the data you pay for

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
are always on and the data you pay for
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240
are always on and the data you pay for
today is pretty much a lot cheaper than

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
today is pretty much a lot cheaper than
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.360
today is pretty much a lot cheaper than
it was just two three or four years ago

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370
it was just two three or four years ago
 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.099
it was just two three or four years ago
but every now and again it's important

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
but every now and again it's important
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860
but every now and again it's important
to really take a moment and reflect what

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
to really take a moment and reflect what
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.180
to really take a moment and reflect what
has happened over the last couple of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
has happened over the last couple of
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520
has happened over the last couple of
years that got us to this point and see

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
years that got us to this point and see
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.929
years that got us to this point and see
how we can take those learnings to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
how we can take those learnings to
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.570
how we can take those learnings to
really continue and accelerate that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
really continue and accelerate that
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030
really continue and accelerate that
growth over the next coming years again

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
growth over the next coming years again
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.200
growth over the next coming years again
particularly with regards to user growth

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210
particularly with regards to user growth
 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.910
particularly with regards to user growth
so again today we will be talking about

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
so again today we will be talking about
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.429
so again today we will be talking about
building high quality games and apps

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
building high quality games and apps
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.980
building high quality games and apps
that work effectively not only for the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
that work effectively not only for the
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800
that work effectively not only for the
user of today but for the users of the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
user of today but for the users of the
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.630
user of today but for the users of the
next coming years and so we've seen

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
next coming years and so we've seen
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819
next coming years and so we've seen
tremendous growth from emerging markets

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
tremendous growth from emerging markets
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740
tremendous growth from emerging markets
and we projected about 80 percent of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
and we projected about 80 percent of
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929
and we projected about 80 percent of
smartphone growth globally it's going to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
smartphone growth globally it's going to
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.620
smartphone growth globally it's going to
come from emerging markets by 2010 2019

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
come from emerging markets by 2010 2019
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.010
come from emerging markets by 2010 2019
and as more users get access to these

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
and as more users get access to these
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840
and as more users get access to these
devices they get connected for the first

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
devices they get connected for the first
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.999
devices they get connected for the first
time and the first time making any

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
time and the first time making any
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.649
time and the first time making any
experiences with the web they will be

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
experiences with the web they will be
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.440
experiences with the web they will be
looking for new ways to experience the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
looking for new ways to experience the
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359
looking for new ways to experience the
internet to shop to entertain themselves

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
internet to shop to entertain themselves
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.999
internet to shop to entertain themselves
to communicate and that itself is

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
to communicate and that itself is
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039
to communicate and that itself is
bringing up a massive opportunity for

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
bringing up a massive opportunity for
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109
bringing up a massive opportunity for
all of us in this room so again 80

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
all of us in this room so again 80
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209
all of us in this room so again 80
percent of smartphone growth up until

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
percent of smartphone growth up until
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980
percent of smartphone growth up until
2019 will be coming from emerging

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
2019 will be coming from emerging
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.789
2019 will be coming from emerging
markets so what's important here is to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
markets so what's important here is to
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.919
markets so what's important here is to
then look at the challenges this users

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
then look at the challenges this users
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.960
then look at the challenges this users
face and to start designing it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
face and to start designing it
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.490
face and to start designing it
theory answers that will cater to these

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
theory answers that will cater to these
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.590
theory answers that will cater to these
challenges I'm backing this up with

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600
challenges I'm backing this up with
 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.850
challenges I'm backing this up with
numbers from google play that Mark

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860

referenced in this early keynote today

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
referenced in this early keynote today
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.790
referenced in this early keynote today
we see a tremendous increase in an

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
we see a tremendous increase in an
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520
we see a tremendous increase in an
accelerated growth in downloads as well

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
accelerated growth in downloads as well
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.930
accelerated growth in downloads as well
as in consumer spend for emerging

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
as in consumer spend for emerging
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.600
as in consumer spend for emerging
markets and we don't see any indication

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
markets and we don't see any indication
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.490
markets and we don't see any indication
that this is going to stop anytime soon

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
that this is going to stop anytime soon
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.250
that this is going to stop anytime soon
so if you compare emerging markets with

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
so if you compare emerging markets with
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.680
so if you compare emerging markets with
developed markets we see significantly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
developed markets we see significantly
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.870
developed markets we see significantly
faster growth just about four times as

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880
faster growth just about four times as
 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.330
faster growth just about four times as
fast while consumers spend is double and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
fast while consumers spend is double and
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.280
fast while consumers spend is double and
we expect us to further grow it's an

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
we expect us to further grow it's an
 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.460
we expect us to further grow it's an
exciting trend and it's important to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470
exciting trend and it's important to
 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.330
exciting trend and it's important to
realize that this is happening yet put

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
realize that this is happening yet put
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.430
realize that this is happening yet put
this in context and see where this

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
this in context and see where this
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.980
this in context and see where this
growth is actually coming from so first

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990
growth is actually coming from so first
 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.500
growth is actually coming from so first
we all know fast networks are awesome we

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
we all know fast networks are awesome we
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.540
we all know fast networks are awesome we
all have instant information instant

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550
all have instant information instant
 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.940
all have instant information instant
capabilities in our pockets today but if

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
capabilities in our pockets today but if
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830
capabilities in our pockets today but if
you look at the reality of today still

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
you look at the reality of today still
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.620
you look at the reality of today still
just about half of mobile internet usage

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
just about half of mobile internet usage
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.880
just about half of mobile internet usage
is coming from a 2g connection and I'm

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
is coming from a 2g connection and I'm
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.020
is coming from a 2g connection and I'm
sending out an open question into this

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
sending out an open question into this
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.790
sending out an open question into this
room when was the last time you were in

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800
room when was the last time you were in
 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.949
room when was the last time you were in
a 2g connection when was the last time

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959
a 2g connection when was the last time

you actually opened your own game or app

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180
you actually opened your own game or app
 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.140
you actually opened your own game or app
from a 2g connection if you extrapolate

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150
from a 2g connection if you extrapolate
 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.550
from a 2g connection if you extrapolate
this out and project what's going to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
this out and project what's going to
 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.310
this out and project what's going to
happen until 2020 we'll still expect one

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320
happen until 2020 we'll still expect one
 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080
happen until 2020 we'll still expect one
in three users to be or just about one

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
in three users to be or just about one
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.320
in three users to be or just about one
in three users to be on 2g and that that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330
in three users to be on 2g and that that
 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.720
in three users to be on 2g and that that
resembles about 1 billion users so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730
resembles about 1 billion users so
 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.240
resembles about 1 billion users so
definitely a massive opportunity but

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
definitely a massive opportunity but
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.310
definitely a massive opportunity but
again with different challenges that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320
again with different challenges that
 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.199
again with different challenges that
need to be addressed accordingly for

issue of developing an app in the game
 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.460
issue of developing an app in the game
that can really run on all of these

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470
that can really run on all of these
 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.550
that can really run on all of these
devices so you should look at what

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560
devices so you should look at what
 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.040
devices so you should look at what
competitor what capacity your app is

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050
competitor what capacity your app is
 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.200
competitor what capacity your app is
actually invoking and then optimize for

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
actually invoking and then optimize for
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.510
actually invoking and then optimize for
that keep in mind that a lot of these

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520
that keep in mind that a lot of these
 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.950
that keep in mind that a lot of these
devices that we're talking about are

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960
devices that we're talking about are
 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.379
devices that we're talking about are
still one megabyte in ROM and below and

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:47.389
still one megabyte in ROM and below and
 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.050
still one megabyte in ROM and below and
so and you should think about how your

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.060
so and you should think about how your
 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.580
so and you should think about how your
app actually runs in these kind of

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.590
app actually runs in these kind of
 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.439
app actually runs in these kind of
environments and games should be

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:53.449
environments and games should be
 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:55.480
environments and games should be
optimized to render smoothly in those

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:55.490
optimized to render smoothly in those
 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.310
optimized to render smoothly in those
kinds of environments then look at

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320
kinds of environments then look at
 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.060
kinds of environments then look at
screen sizes as I mentioned these are

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.070
screen sizes as I mentioned these are
 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.499
screen sizes as I mentioned these are
these devices that are coming on and are

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:05.509
these devices that are coming on and are
 

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:07.600
these devices that are coming on and are
likely to be low cost and they are

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:07.610
likely to be low cost and they are
 

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.610
likely to be low cost and they are
likely to be longer in there in their

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
likely to be longer in there in their
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.800
likely to be longer in there in their
life cycles and you want to make sure

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:11.810
life cycles and you want to make sure
 

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.020
life cycles and you want to make sure
that you have your your exposure tested

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.030
that you have your your exposure tested
 

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.850
that you have your your exposure tested
on different screen sizes screen

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:15.860
on different screen sizes screen
 

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.570
on different screen sizes screen
resolution and pixel densities and any

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:19.580
resolution and pixel densities and any
 

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.909

mentioned before that the new emulator

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919
mentioned before that the new emulator
 

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:24.939
mentioned before that the new emulator
in Android studio is vastly improved

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:24.949
in Android studio is vastly improved
 

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:26.950
in Android studio is vastly improved
it's increased in speed and it allows

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960
it's increased in speed and it allows
 

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.899
it's increased in speed and it allows
you to test very quickly for these

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:28.909
you to test very quickly for these
 

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:30.820
you to test very quickly for these
elements so changing the device

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:30.830
elements so changing the device
 

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.069
elements so changing the device
resolution and the device size just as

00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:33.079
resolution and the device size just as
 

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.810
resolution and the device size just as
an example why would you load a

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.820
an example why would you load a
 

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.579
an example why would you load a
high-resolution image on a low

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:36.589
high-resolution image on a low
 

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:38.889
high-resolution image on a low
resolution device that's just you know a

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:38.899
resolution device that's just you know a
 

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:43.610
resolution device that's just you know a
lot of waste in a many different factors

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620
lot of waste in a many different factors
 

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.240
lot of waste in a many different factors
moving on to efficient memory usage and

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.250
moving on to efficient memory usage and
 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.620
moving on to efficient memory usage and
users see that screen at all time they

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:48.630
users see that screen at all time they
 

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.270
users see that screen at all time they
can get a push notification when the

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.280
can get a push notification when the
 

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.980
can get a push notification when the
memory is running out and they can

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:51.990
memory is running out and they can
 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.430
memory is running out and they can
actually see a sorted list of how much

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440
actually see a sorted list of how much
 

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.830
actually see a sorted list of how much
memory and how much storage your apps

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:57.840
memory and how much storage your apps
 

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.130
memory and how much storage your apps
are actually using and so here's the pro

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140
are actually using and so here's the pro
 

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.200
are actually using and so here's the pro
tip for this one you can use the API

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.210
tip for this one you can use the API
 

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.930
tip for this one you can use the API
call of is low ramp and actually get

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940
call of is low ramp and actually get
 

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.780
call of is low ramp and actually get
feedback in real time to figure out if

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:08.790
feedback in real time to figure out if
 

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.730
feedback in real time to figure out if
this is a highly capable device or a low

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740
this is a highly capable device or a low
 

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.770
this is a highly capable device or a low
capable device and then change your

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:12.780
capable device and then change your
 

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.830
capable device and then change your
processes accordingly also background

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:15.840
processes accordingly also background
 

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.870
processes accordingly also background
processing background processing is

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880
processing background processing is
 

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.550
processing background processing is
typically what drives up a lot of the

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560
typically what drives up a lot of the
 

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.850
typically what drives up a lot of the
storage live and in it on the user's

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860
storage live and in it on the user's
 

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.460
storage live and in it on the user's
device and that's perfectly fine many

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:25.470
device and that's perfectly fine many
 

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.350
device and that's perfectly fine many
apps may invoke processes in the

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360
apps may invoke processes in the
 

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.030
apps may invoke processes in the
background but you should be good

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040
background but you should be good
 

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.510
background but you should be good
stewards of your users device memory and

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:32.520
stewards of your users device memory and
 

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.400
stewards of your users device memory and
you want to start up your background

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.410
you want to start up your background
 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.440
you want to start up your background
processors finish them try to bundle

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.450
processors finish them try to bundle
 

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.870
processors finish them try to bundle
them into one round and then shut down

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880
them into one round and then shut down
 

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.810
them into one round and then shut down
the process in order not to drain and a

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820
the process in order not to drain and a
 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.800

user's memory as well as the battery
 

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.630
user's memory as well as the battery
moving on to smart storage think about

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640
moving on to smart storage think about
 

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.670
moving on to smart storage think about
installing or just running this one line

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680
installing or just running this one line
 

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.220
installing or just running this one line
of code that allows users to push their

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.230
of code that allows users to push their
 

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.010
of code that allows users to push their
apps onto their SD card then this can go

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.020
apps onto their SD card then this can go
 

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.720
apps onto their SD card then this can go
a long way for for devices with

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.730
a long way for for devices with
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.450
a long way for for devices with
expandable storage and as I mentioned

00:09:59.450 --> 00:09:59.460
expandable storage and as I mentioned
 

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.060
expandable storage and as I mentioned
before users can actually sort how much

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.070
before users can actually sort how much
 

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.760
before users can actually sort how much
them data is consumed in how much space

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.770
them data is consumed in how much space
 

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.820
them data is consumed in how much space
is consumed on your phone and can see

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:07.830
is consumed on your phone and can see
 

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.970
is consumed on your phone and can see
the list of the most draining apps on

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980
the list of the most draining apps on
 

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.120
the list of the most draining apps on
top which will then drive a lot of the

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.130
top which will then drive a lot of the
 

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.340
top which will then drive a lot of the
uninstall and install rates up so you

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:16.350
uninstall and install rates up so you
 

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.100
uninstall and install rates up so you
want to keep your device consumption low

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.110
want to keep your device consumption low
 

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.710
want to keep your device consumption low
and make sure that you are frequently

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
and make sure that you are frequently
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.090
and make sure that you are frequently
clearing the cache that you're creating

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100
clearing the cache that you're creating
 

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.520
clearing the cache that you're creating
and this one is a tip that I'm sure

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:28.530
and this one is a tip that I'm sure
 

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.710
and this one is a tip that I'm sure
you're not going to hear often today so

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720
you're not going to hear often today so
 

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.900
you're not going to hear often today so
this is the one and only time I guess

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:32.910
this is the one and only time I guess
 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.670
this is the one and only time I guess
you will hear this today but think about

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680
you will hear this today but think about
 

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.540
you will hear this today but think about
backwards compatibility think about and

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:37.550
backwards compatibility think about and
 

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.950
backwards compatibility think about and
these new users coming online with

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:39.960
these new users coming online with
 

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.720
these new users coming online with
slightly older devices and not

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:41.730
slightly older devices and not
 

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.430
slightly older devices and not
necessarily always on the latest version

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440
necessarily always on the latest version
 

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.420
necessarily always on the latest version
of Android so I'd invite you to run your

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:47.430
of Android so I'd invite you to run your
 

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.330
of Android so I'd invite you to run your
apps with the minimum SDK 14 about the

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:50.340
apps with the minimum SDK 14 about the
 

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.639
apps with the minimum SDK 14 about the
target SDK 23 in order to really care

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:52.649
target SDK 23 in order to really care
 

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:55.340
target SDK 23 in order to really care
to a wide variety of users that are

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.350
to a wide variety of users that are
 

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.759
to a wide variety of users that are
being kept with the latest features also

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:58.769
being kept with the latest features also
 

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:00.920
being kept with the latest features also
think about integrating the Google Play

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:00.930
think about integrating the Google Play
 

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.889
think about integrating the Google Play
services API because we will ensure that

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899
services API because we will ensure that
 

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:05.929
services API because we will ensure that
users get updates on time and make and

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:05.939
users get updates on time and make and
 

00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:07.699
users get updates on time and make and
we will make sure that the users are

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:07.709
we will make sure that the users are
 

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.319
we will make sure that the users are
catered to with the features that

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:09.329
catered to with the features that
 

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:13.400
catered to with the features that
actually work for their devices moving

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.410
actually work for their devices moving
 

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.069
actually work for their devices moving
on and I'm already finishing off so if

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079
on and I'm already finishing off so if
 

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:16.879
on and I'm already finishing off so if
you go get ready

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:16.889
you go get ready
 

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:19.519
you go get ready
well it's your it's your time to speak
