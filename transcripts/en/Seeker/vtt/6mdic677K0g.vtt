00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.510
We’ve already talked about what would happen
to you if you dove head first into a black

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.510
hole.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.830
The coles notes answer: nothing good.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.050
But here’s something that’ll put a wrench
in even the most gruesome black hole death

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.680
scenarios: What if black holes don’t exist
at all?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.990
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.840
We have learned a lot about black holes over
the years.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.689
Through observations and calculations, scientists
have told us that black holes form when a

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.089
dying star collapses to a point under its
own gravity, and that the resulting high gravitational

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.329
environment produces a black hole from which
nothing, not even light, can escape.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.870
And it gets weirder.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.790
Time slows down the closer you get to a black
hole, and some can even contain full galaxies.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.730
But Dr. Laura Mersini-Houghton, a theoretical
physicist at the University of North Carolina

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.680
at Chapel Hill, has a different opinion.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.530
She’s done the math behind collapsing stars
creating black holes and says it just doesn’t

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.530
add up.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.879
Specifically, she points to the so-called
"black hole information loss paradox” that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.449
allows black holes to exist in Einstein’s
theory of relativity but not in quantum theory.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.429
The problem in the quantum theory world is
that "information" can never completely disappear

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.450
from the universe, which is essentially what
happens when something is sucked into a black

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
hole.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.360
According to Mersini-Houghton, a collapsing
star actually sheds mass as it shrinks, so

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.159
instead of collapsing it shoots its mass out
and explodes.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.970
There’s no superdense core left behind to
become an all-consuming black hole.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.980
A universe without black holes is slightly
simpler to explain.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.470
No black holes means no singularities, those
bizarre points where the density of matter

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.479
becomes infinite, the fabric of space-time
tears, and laws of physics cease to have any

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.479
meaning.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.840
A universe without singularities means living
in a universe of certainties about stars,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840
matter, and the physics that govern it all.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.939
But physicists aren’t entirely convinced
by the “no black holes” idea.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.009
Because while the math might point to a universe
without black holes, we have observational

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.700
evidence that they do exist, like light and
star’s orbits bending around the strong

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.229
gravitational environments.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.950
But that’s one of the greatest things about
space: we know a lot, but there is so much

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.110
more to find out!

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.509
So what do you guys think: is it possible
that the observations are wrong and we actually

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.500
live in a Universe without black holes?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.049
