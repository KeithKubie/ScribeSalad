00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.940
My grandfather who is kind of the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.649
intellectual in the family, a very

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.960
learned guy, also very active guy, always

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.700
taking me out ballroom dancing.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.179
He started to show changes right around the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.520
time I decided to go back to school.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.420
No one really thought about Alzheimer's, this is

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.300
back in the kind of mid 80s, but as

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.150
I start to learn more about what was

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.769
going on I start to realize this is probably

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.250
Alzheimer's disease and at the time I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.960
went to medical school and he actually

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.239
passed away during my second year of

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.460
neurology residency.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940
Like many people who

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.500
are young, I had never heard of Alzheimer's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.780
disease, but it only takes somebody you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.850
really love to see what it can do to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420
make it very important.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.930
Alzheimer's disease is amazing in that it

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.540
really robs you of who you are: your

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.150
memory, your personality, your higher

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.040
level things, and leaves everything else

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.409
intact. So most people with Alzheimer's

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.009
disease can still talk and walk and feed

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.990
themselves, at least in the beginning, and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.360
they look normal, but they are losing who they are.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.880
The A4 study is really the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.960
first of its kind to try to treat

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.770
Alzheimer's disease in its silent phase.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.429
When the brain is beginning to build up

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.170
the changes we associate with

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.060
Alzheimer's disease, in particular this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.460
amyloid plaque buildup, but before they

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.399
have any symptoms and that seems very

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.830
crazy in Alzheimer's disease because it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.050
hadn't been done, but this is exactly what

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.179
we do in heart disease: we find people

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.100
with high cholesterol and treat them to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.080
try to prevent a heart attack or in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.929
cancer we detect through colonoscopy or

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.810
mammography, cancer before there are symptoms

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.709
The Harvard aging brain study which we've

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.300
been now working for about six or seven

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.640
years, the very first thing that we saw

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.310
is that people had high amyloid in their

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.870
brains, even though they're still normal,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.239
had a faster rate of memory decline and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.760
that meant you could see if there was a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.500
drug effect because we could look at

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.720
this rate of cognitive decline and say

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.819
could we bend that curve, could we

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.069
make people who have high amyloid levels

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.290
or amyloid positive look more like

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.209
amyloid negative people if we give them

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.640
a drug? If we treat people before there's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.370
irreversible brain damage, can we prevent

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.440
the cognitive decline associated with

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.800
Alzheimer's disease?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.860
If the amyloid plaque hypothesis is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.250
right or partially right, we're now doing

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.920
trials at the stage of disease where

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.080
that's relevant and we also now have

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.470
some pretty biologically active drugs so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.570
I don't know for sure if we will have

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.190
prevention or cure but looks like if we

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.790
can get just one hook in and make a dent

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.760
it will really change the field and so I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.230
think we're going to see a glimmer.
