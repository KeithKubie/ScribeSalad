00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.900
The Joe Rogan experience.
I've been coming out as transgender.

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.360
When you're straight,
I'm straight transgendered,
so I fancy women's.
I'm,

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.200
I want to be lesbian.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.420
So if you come out you could stay in the closet and I look down the millennia.

5
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.140
If we go back to the ancient Egyptians and further,

6
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.240
there's probably a lot of guys said,
I don't have to tell anyone about this.

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.980
I just,
I fancy women.
I'll just go with it.

8
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.810
I just won't mention this kind of feelings in my head and I thought I should

9
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.370
mention it because if people shout and scream at me in the streets,
I will,

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.350
I will fight that.
At least verbally fight that.
Or you know,

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:35.161
if they start going through,

12
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.400
I have had one fight in the streets and I landed one punch.
I,
yeah,

13
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.810
I taught myself to geography on the streets because of this.
Yeah.
Yeah.

14
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:47.730
The guy was,
was just giving me,
Ooh,
Tracey,
oh,
what are they all dressed up?

15
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.580
And,
and I,
and I was,
I've been a street performer for four years.

16
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.210
It common garden.
So I was living on the street,
you know,
and living,

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.990
I was working on the streets and you know,

18
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.000
just knew a lot of people going around and just said,
man,

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.140
you don't have to be like this.

20
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.010
We can all the space enough for everyone live and let live kept giving me stuff.

21
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.220
It was a bit drunk,
Arista.

22
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.320
So he was just going to stay on that wicked keep saying and I said just chill

23
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.910
out,
chill out.
And then the third time I just said,
oh just fuck off.
And I went,

24
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.380
no I am,
I am loaded load of swear words on him.

25
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.760
And then he swung for me,

26
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.020
which was the handy thing cause that came up in court and then I swung back and

27
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:23.010
I landed one punch,

28
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.350
which I was pleased but and I was doing the wipe on wipe off stuff.

29
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950
I was doing this,
you're blocking.
Yeah,
from the Jujitsu.

30
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.830
I taught myself Jujitsu form a book.
If you could believe that,
which you know,

31
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.170
you'll get these books with the different moves and then you can't teach

32
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.630
yourself that.
But I did Julia when I was six actually as well.

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.490
So I liked the idea of doing these things,

34
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:40.290
but I felt Jew there was always at the bigger kid,

35
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.190
you all get in pajamas and the bigger kit just throws you around a bit.

36
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.070
I can never quite get the hanger.
I couldn't throw the bigger kids.

37
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.040
I could do it now,
but I've never,
anyway,
yeah,

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
this is a fantastic video online of a very old judo expert in,

39
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.440
I think he's in his seventies or his eighties and he's working out with these

40
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:05.441
young men and you see his mastery of judo as these young,

41
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.460
powerful men try to manipulate him and throw him around and he effortlessly

42
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:14.360
watch this,
this old man and he see him.
He's very,

43
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:19.361
very old and he's throwing these guys around me as a martial arts expert.

44
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.690
These,
these men are not doing this willingly.
This is legitimate.

45
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.230
Like even that guy tries to throw him and this is a black belt who's trying to

46
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.900
throw him,
but he's so good and his,

47
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.280
his use of balance and leverage is so amazing.
He just knows where to be.

48
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:38.060
Like see how,
yeah,
yeah.
That just throws himself into a perfect position I made.

49
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.650
It's really stunning to watch.

50
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.350
And this looks like it was from the fifties or something like that cause it's

51
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.550
really old.
But yet as it say,
just has 75 year old judo master.

52
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.930
I mean this is an old man and the,
the young man is much larger than him.

53
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.460
Significantly like 25% larger than him.
At least.

54
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.020
Maybe even look up.
He looks at,

55
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:02.020
he's twice as big as him and he throw this old man.
It's really amazing.

56
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.910
Juno was a beautiful art.
Oh,
he's getting more and more full on these guys.

57
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.240
I gotta get this.
He's trying,
I mean he knows that this guy is a master,

58
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.780
but it's just look at that like it's incredible.
I mean,

59
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.810
the way that guy's body can toss these people through the air and yet they,

60
00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:22.960
they are helpless.
They can't do anything to him that way.
That look at that boom.

61
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.950
Three times,
75 years old.
I mean,

62
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.850
that hurts my hips.
Just looking at that you,

63
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.750
you can have many different martial arts than you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

64
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.810
Which ones you Jujitsu and striking martial arts.

65
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.670
My background was in striking,

66
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.120
which is in taekwondo and then eventually kickboxing and Muay Thai.

67
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.050
And then I got really into Jujitsu when I got older.
And what on Jujitsu's,

68
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.680
what's the difference from Jujitsu is a grappling tall,
her choking people.

69
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.700
It's like you,
it's not throws like judo.
There are throws in Jujitsu,

70
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.950
but there it really comes from judo.

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.580
It comes from the ground fighting aspect of Judah,
which was not as emphasized,

72
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.550
but the Brazilians really,
really emphasized it and sort of,
uh,

73
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.700
they,

74
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.700
they figured out what the best way for a smaller person defeat a larger persons

75
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.960
through leverage.

76
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:18.961
And Jujitsu is really the only martial art that I can think of that works like

77
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.780
you think of a martial art in a movie,
like in a Bruce Lee movie.

78
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.900
Like there's all these people and they were always bigger than Bruce Lee.

79
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.400
Bruce Lee fucked him all up.
But in the real world,
that doesn't usually work.

80
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.760
Like the bigger people have such a giant advantage when it comes to like

81
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.800
striking.
Like you know,

82
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.980
you're never going to see a like a heavyweight in the UFC.

83
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.810
A fight,
a bantamweight fight,
a person who has 135 pounds just wouldn't,

84
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.840
it's just too much of an advantage and Jujitsu,

85
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.870
it's legitimately possible for 140 pound man to strangle a 200 plus pound man

86
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.570
and do it relatively easily if they're talented.

87
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.990
I I saw a documentary on very slowly and he had the way of no way.
Yeah.

88
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.200
Which really appealed to me.
I mean it's like a philosophy,

89
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.300
quite a map from fighting philosophy but um,

90
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.120
to be so trained up in so many things that the,

91
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.910
they do not know what you're going to do.
And I kind of adopted that.

92
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.400
He had to overcome significant prejudice,

93
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.640
prejudice to adopt that perspective because when he was studying martial arts,

94
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.400
you were supposed to be loyal to your style.
So if you learn Kung Fu,

95
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.630
you were supposed to be a Kung Fu man for life.
Yup.

96
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.980
You weren't supposed to also dabble in boxing and wrestling and all these

97
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.540
different things that he wasn't interested in.

98
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.320
He was interested in taking what's useful from all different martial arts and

99
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.250
applying them.
So in a sense,
he was really the founder of mixed martial arts,

100
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.200
which you see today in the UK.

101
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.460
They have cage warriors and the u s is a UFC and you know,

102
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:50.110
there's this worldwide now the,

103
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.470
the art of mixed martial arts of putting all the different styles together and

104
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:58.330
you can do whatever you want within the rules.
Now.
I liked the attitude of that.

105
00:05:58.331 --> 00:05:59.690
I still have a life attitude though.

106
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.210
I mean there's obviously the fighting attitude of it and then there's the life

107
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:06.760
attitude of just be prepared for anything and everything.
Yeah.
And be,

108
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.760
and be like water.
Like that was his other thing.
Yeah.
Just to go around things,

109
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.940
move through things.
Yeah.
Don't,
don't head butt things.

110
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.990
Figure out what's the best way,
what is the,
what's the best,
best path.
Yeah.

111
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.470
You know?
Yeah.
I just,
um,

112
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.810
I haven't
learned.

113
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:30.140
When I said I think I'm waiting for someone to give me a really hard time.

114
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.170
Then I say,
now I am checking in and I am learning in my shot.

115
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.430
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
