[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.860
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Welcome,
everyone to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.150
I am Juliet Ehimuan Chiazor,
and I am the country manager

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.970
for Google in Nigeria.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.460
We have a special guest today.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.797
And that is the extremely
beautiful and special Mo Abudu.

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:23.630
MO ABUDU: Thank you.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.816
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.440
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Today is
a special international events

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.970
day edition.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.250
The theme for this
year is being bold

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.270
for change-- be bold
for change, actually.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.620
We've taken
inspiration from that,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.730
and the theme of
this particular talk

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.850
is being bold in
entrepreneurship.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.710
And I think Mo exemplifies
boldness in entrepreneurship.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.970
So once again, thank
you for being here, Mo.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.322
MO ABUDU: Thank you for
inviting me, Juliet.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:53.754
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
It's so great to have you.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:54.186
MO ABUDU: It's good to be here.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:54.620
It's good to be here.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.380
Thank you for the invitation.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.796
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:57.534
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:00:57.534 --> 00:00:58.230
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: So I'm going

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.420
to start by reading her
profile, and then we'll

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.150
get into the conversation.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.020
So, Mo Abudu has achieved
success in various fields,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.300
first as an executive in
ExxonMobil for nearly a decade,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.360
as the promoter behind the
Protea Hotel, Oakwood Park,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.870
as well as the founder of
Vic Lawrence and Associates,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.360
one of Nigeria's leading
outsourcing firms.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.300
She entered the world of media
as the creator and hostess

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.950
of "Moments with Mo," earning
the accolade of Africa's

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.275
first lady of chats.

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:34.858
MO ABUDU: Yay!

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.850
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: The
show was the first of its kind

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.090
to be syndicated across Africa,
with an impressive guest

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.140
list that includes Hillary
Rodham Clinton, President

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.780
Mohammad Buhari, and Christine
Lagarde, amongst others.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.860
Three years ago, she
launched EbonyLife TV,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.660
which is Africa's first
global black entertainment

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.490
and lifestyle network
for premium homegrown

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.050
entertainment.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.856
And in 2014, she
started EbonyLife Films.

00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:13.910
Her debut film "Fifty," and
her second film "The Wedding

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.640
Party"--

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.267
MO ABUDU: Yay!

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.600
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: --in
partnership with the ELFIKE

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.750
Film Collective both premiered
at prestigious international

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.665
film festivals and
broke box office records

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:24.701
nationwide. nationwide.

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:26.450
I think that deserves
a round of applause.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.125
Mo is highly sought-after
for her in-depth knowledge

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.820
on the African and
global creative industry.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.770
She has spoken at the University
of Cambridge, Judge Business

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.560
School, Wharton School of
Business, Harvard University,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.050
and New York University
Stern School of Business,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.890
amongst others.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.510
Mo has received
international recognition

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.200
by "Forbes" as the
first African woman

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.540
to launch a
Pan-African TV channel,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.222
as well as Africa's
most successful woman.

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:03.805
MO ABUDU: Hey!

00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:06.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.400
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: She has also

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.430
been recognized by CNN as
Africa's queen of media

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.950
who conquered the continent.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.530
So once again, welcome Mo.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.070
MO ABUDU: Thank
you for having me.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.420
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: It's
really great to have you here.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.140
MO ABUDU: It's great to
be here in the hot seat.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.196
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: In
the hot seat, absolutely.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:21.779
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.050
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Switching roles.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.700
So, a lot of people
have dreams, right?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.760
And a lot of people
struggle to make that jump

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.710
required to achieve
those dreams,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.596
especially when it involves
going into a new space.

00:03:36.596 --> 00:03:38.720
Now, that's something you've
done quite a few times

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.100
in your career.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.200
From the early days, you left
the security of paid employment

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.520
so set up a HR consultancy
firm, Vic Lawrence Associates.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.120
Subsequently, you started a talk
show, "Moments with Mo," which

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.700
was new territory for you.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.210
What inspired you and
gave you the courage

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.085
to take those initial steps?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.750
MO ABUDU: When I decided
to leave ExxonMobil,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.290
it was a really big jump for
me, because, yes, there's

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.330
nothing like working in
oil and gas in Nigeria.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.420
I mean, it's a job
for life, so to speak,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.380
unless you do the undoable.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.050
But if you just go to work
and do the normal things,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.830
you get paid well,
you get a pension,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.750
you build a nice house,
and everything really

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.530
is going to be just fine.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.220
But I think that as an
entrepreneur, or for me, for me

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.980
there was this
unsettling feeling

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.220
that there were certain things
that I felt that I had to do.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.730
And I think when that feeling
comes, it can be obsessive.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.720
It can almost be as if it's
an addiction of some sort.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.680
You just feel that you
have to do everything

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.740
within your power to achieve
that particular obsession.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.650
So, yes, I had a great job.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.960
And the other day,
it was actually

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.070
the birthday of the PA to
the old MD of ExxonMobil.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.980
So she had invited me to come,
and it was just last Friday.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.780
And I went along to Exxon, and
I saw all my old colleagues

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.280
there.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.380
And I was thinking
to myself, wow.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.910
It could have been a
really comfortable life.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.300
But then I decided otherwise.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.820
And the thing is that
when you decide otherwise,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.330
there are no guarantees
about that decision that you

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.990
have taken.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.300
You don't know how
it's going to turn out.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.350
So at times, I'm like, my god.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.840
What about if it had gone wrong?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.210
But I think sometimes you
need to take those steps.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.260
Because what really
happens if it goes wrong?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.640
What is the worst-- so
for me, I'm always like,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.050
what is the possible worst
thing that can happen?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.800
The possible worst
thing that could happen

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.430
is go and get another job.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.080
So I think once you
understand that you are not

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.370
afraid of what's the
worst outcome can be,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.710
and you then look at
the positivity of what

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.410
the upside can be, and
then once you are prepared,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.920
I think preparation
is important.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.080
You can't just go into wanting
to leave paid employment

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.410
without having had a
secure plan about what

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.830
you're going to do once you
have left paid employment.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.980
So before I left, I was
kind of like walking

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.440
on two sides of the
street at the same time.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.946
I had started Vic
Lawrence already.

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.320
Working with
ExxonMobil, you have

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.570
to declare absolutely
everything.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.230
So I declared that I did have an
interest in a consulting firm.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.090
We were doing some business.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.540
I did employ some staff to
look after the business for me.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.610
So when I could see that there
were many more possibilities,

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.980
and I can't achieve those
possibilities by staying

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.970
in a 9-to-5 job, I then had
to decide about resigning.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.400
And I was warned
about resigning.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.540
I was told that, Mo, listen,
you can go to Houston, a project

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.010
that I'm going to Houston on
three-month, out-of-station

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.340
work opportunities,
some shorter.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.840
So I had all this
opportunity there.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.750
And I was told, Mo,
you can grow here.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.120
Why are you-- my MD
said, Mo, don't leave.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.500
And I just said,
I have to leave.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.270
And I just took that
plunge, knowing that, OK,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.160
once I'm out of ExxonMobil,
I have no alternative now

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.450
than to do absolutely
everything within my power

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.420
to make that transition work.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.270
So I gave plenty of notice,
about six months' notice.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.220
And once I was doing
that, I was trying

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.830
to build up on the
outside, find an office

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.420
and find staff and get Vic
Lawrence on the right footing.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.030
So it can be scary.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.320
You can't just leave.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.850
You do have to plan.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.520
There are no guarantees
that it's going to work.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.270
But I always believe
that with a great plan,

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:03.680
if you're ready to work hard,
and if you put God first,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.444
I do believe that you will
get the results that you need.

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:09.110
Of course you're going
to be challenged.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.860
You're going to go to
many, many meetings,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.955
and people are going
to say no to you.

00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:14.900
But for each time I
hear no, I'm like,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.959
I'm one notch closer to a yes.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.000
Because I totally believe
in the law of averages.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.160
Everybody cannot say no.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.500
At some point, we're
going to get to that yes.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.640
Is that yes going to help
me break even that month?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.650
Am I going to be able to
pay my salaries that month?

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.110
At some point, you
have to understand

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.640
that you can't go
into business thinking

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.181
that you're going to make a huge
profit as soon as you set up

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:34.820
that business.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.450
That business has to grow.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.116
You're going to have
to look at the fact

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:40.520
that you may not be able
to take extensive holidays.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.061
Or you may not be able to do
all the things you could even do

00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:44.492
whilst you were fully employed.

00:08:44.492 --> 00:08:45.950
What are the
sacrifices that you're

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.550
ready to make to make
that business work?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.040
Because sometimes, we're
not ready for the sacrifice.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.540
You want to continue
living the life

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.174
that you led when you
were being paid 9 to 5

00:08:56.174 --> 00:08:58.340
and there was a big company
car, and there was this,

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340
and there was the other.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.384
You may have to just
sort of take a step back

00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:03.050
to see what those
things are that you're

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.670
going to have to just say,
well, I can't do that for now.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.499
So yeah, I believe that's
answered the question.

00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:12.790
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Absolutely, So very, very well.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.430
And you're talking about
making it work, right?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.330
With Vic Lawrence
Associates, that

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.590
was an area of your expertise.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.280
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.180
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Because you were head of HR

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.930
at ExxonMobil.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.460
MO ABUDU: Yes, yes.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:22.980
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
That's the part

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.990
that is a bit more familiar
for a lot of entrepreneurs,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.990
setting up a business in
your area of expertise.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.390
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.020
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: But
that does not guarantee success.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.670
MO ABUDU: It doesn't.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.003
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: So
what were the things that you

00:09:33.003 --> 00:09:34.359
put in place to make it work?

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:35.900
MO ABUDU: Well, the
first thing I did

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.540
was to get a small
office, make sure

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.790
that I employed a
few experts that I

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.124
could afford at the time.

00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:44.540
Because one thing I find about
going into entrepreneurship

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.270
is that sometimes the
best people that you want,

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.704
you can't really afford them.

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:50.870
Because they themselves
want to become entrepreneurs

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.940
and they want to
do other things.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.580
So you have to comb the
market to find the best

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.950
people that you
can and offer them

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.140
the necessary
incentives for them

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.880
to come on board as
part of your team.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.449
So that was really
important for me.

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:05.990
And being a HR
person, I knew that it

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.350
was important to have
the right team in place.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.070
So it's about having
the right team.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.370
It's was about having
a work environment

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.280
that I thought was
attractive enough for clients

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.900
to be able to visit.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.110
It was about setting up all
those processes and procedures,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.980
making sure you have a
phone that's working,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.010
making sure you have letterhead,
making sure you have an email

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.700
address.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.010
I mean, in those days,
there was only Hyperia.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.970
So our e-mail address
then was vic@hyperia.com.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.720
It's not like today,
where you can sort of

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.810
do all-- it's incredible
how things have changed.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.280
But at one point,
all you could do

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.696
in Nigeria to get
an email address

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:40.280
was you had to go to Hyperia.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.020
So we had vic@hyperia.com.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.550
Set up all the paperwork.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.890
And then you start
the cold calling.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.920
You then start
running your business.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.070
You then start going out
for business meetings.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.740
You then start trying
to persuade everyone

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.967
to come on board and to
do business with you.

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:58.550
And what I used to
say to my team then

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.376
was that you can't go in
there day one expecting

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.250
that they're going to
give you that business.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.580
We're going to have
to find-- there

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.410
has to be a period through which
you're going to have to go out

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.500
there, find out what their
needs are, and keep going back

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.200
and keep going back
until at some point,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.510
you're going to pick up maybe
some small, small crumbs.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.860
And then they turn into--

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.520
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Prove yourself.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.470
MO ABUDU: Prove
yourself, and then

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.480
they're going to trust
you more, and they're

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.640
going to trust you more.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.790
And I think that's basically
what we started doing.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.260
We just made sure.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.600
We were just out
there every day,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.300
covering every
possible opportunity

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.960
that we found, with all the
banks, with all the telcos,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.900
with all the FMCGs, with
absolute-- even in those

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.560
days, even public
sector, government work.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.770
So we were just
basically just out there,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.490
just reaching out to everyone.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.300
And what I noticed was that
it was important for me

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.180
to be the chief marketing
officer of the company.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.170
You can employ someone
to do that role,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.990
but ultimately, a
lot of it boiled down

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.059
to what you were also
doing, in trying to make

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:57.350
things happen at the same time.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.206
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:11:58.206 --> 00:11:58.634
MO ABUDU: Yeah.

00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.342
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Very interesting.

00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:02.680
And I see your point as well
about as an entrepreneur,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.650
you own the vision, right?

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.650
And you're the chief marketer.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.610
MO ABUDU: Yes, yes.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.240
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Especially in the early days.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.490
MO ABUDU: Yes, And you've got
to get everyone else to buy in--

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.790
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Into it.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.560
MO ABUDU: Into that
vision and own the vision

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.930
and take responsibility for
the achievements of the vision.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:15.400
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Perfect.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.510
MO ABUDU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.160
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
And then you set up

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.839
"Moments with Mo," which was--

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.380
MO ABUDU: No, before then, there
was the Protea Hotel Oakwood

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:21.660
Park.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:21.980
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Yes.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.300
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.390
It was Oakwood Park.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.130
So whilst I was busy with Vic
Lawrence, what I had found

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.500
was that there weren't really
any purpose-built training

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.630
or conference
facilities in Nigeria.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.190
We'd use the Sheraton
Hotel in Ikeja,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.850
which is the [INAUDIBLE] Hotel.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.690
We did use a place
called TCC Ogere, which

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.920
is outside of Lagos
on the way to Ajabu.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.635
And in those days,
there were no phones.

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:45.510
There were no phones.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.930
I mean, today the
world has changed.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.420
People don't know how lucky
they are at times setting up

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.610
a business in the Nigeria
of today versus what

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.530
it was like back then.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.220
So I would have a
team in TCC Ogere.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.930
I would be dialing the number
to get through to them.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.145
Maybe after 100 tries,
I would get through

00:13:03.145 --> 00:13:05.300
to some landline that
started with 860,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.980
whatever it was in those days.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.990
So we did a lot
of training there.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.817
So for me, the
challenge then was, OK,

00:13:10.817 --> 00:13:12.900
you're going to focus on
training and development,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.479
but where are the
purpose-built centers for this?

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.770
[INAUDIBLE] there could be
a wedding going on next door

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.960
or you have a training
event going on.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.430
People can't concentrate.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.930
Pretty much the same happened
at the Sheraton Hotel.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.780
TCC Ogere was really far.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.780
I started thinking about
putting together a center.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.170
So it started pretty
much as just a center.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.610
You could sleep there.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.400
You could also have the
training center there.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.387
And then one fine day,
I was at a cocktail--

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:42.470
which is why it's important
to go out and network.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.930
And then I bumped into Dick
[? Kramer. ?] Dick [? Kramer ?]

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.440
is a lovely old man that's been
in Nigeria probably for about

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.070
50 years.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.079
He's actually set
up a center in KPMG.

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:53.120
And he's been like a mentor
to me over the years.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.550
And I said, Dick,
I've got this project.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.000
And I really want to start
my own sort of TCC Ogere.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.040
He said to me, but Mo,
why don't you brand it?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.640
Why not get a group at the
Protea Hotel involved to brand?

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.470
So that now got me off
on another trail of,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.610
OK, let's see if we
get them involved.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.610
And eventually,
initially, they said no.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.000
But sometimes people say no.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.882
You have to ask why
are they saying no.

00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:15.590
So I went back again
and again and again.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.330
Eventually they said yes.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.670
We had done some
plans initially.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.300
We had to change the plans to
be more suitable to a hotel.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.700
The cost of investment of
building the Protea Hotel

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.710
went up like
tenfold from it just

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.340
being a nice little
training center to it now

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.760
having some sort of
three-star standard.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.400
Of course, I was invested in it.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.030
And I found that my investment
in terms of my shareholding

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.600
was dwindling,
because I couldn't

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.562
afford to take on the huge
investment that it was.

00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:47.770
I mean, I was 35 at the time.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.728
The project cost in those
days was $10 million.

00:14:49.728 --> 00:14:51.976
And I just wasn't going
to be able to do it alone.

00:14:51.976 --> 00:14:53.350
So I had to say
to myself, do you

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.790
want to see this
become a reality,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.927
even though you may end
up owning a smaller share?

00:14:58.927 --> 00:15:01.010
Or do you just want to sit
back and say, well, I'm

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.340
just going to build a
little center, which

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.220
may not get all this branding?

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.500
Or do you want others to
come in and be a part of it

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.175
so that it can be a
much bigger dream?

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:12.300
And I said to myself, I'm
going to go the route of,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.650
let me get other investors in.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.760
So we got UBA trustees involved.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.610
We also got [INAUDIBLE]
involved and SA, Inc.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.750
And that's basically how we got
that project off the ground.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.660
So that was my
second major project

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.390
after having left ExxonMobil.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.640
And then it was a few
years after that that--

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.980
yeah, I don't know.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.480
Sometime--

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.860
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
The idea came from?

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.110
MO ABUDU: The ideas just come.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.040
And I think that
sometimes for me--

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.400
when I'm invited to speak or I'm
being asked what inspires you,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.220
where do the ideas come from,
I have to just say it's God.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.310
And it may sound a little bit
basic, and it sounds simple,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.190
and it sounds, yeah,
right, but it's the truth.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.540
Because what I find often
happens to me is that--

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.970
I will say this to anyone.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.707
Never go to sleep without a
notepad by your bed and a pen.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:00.290
Because for me, any
idea that I've had

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.789
has come in the
middle of the night.

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.400
That aha moment just--

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:03.730
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Really?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.313
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:16:04.313 --> 00:16:05.800
And those ideas come.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.830
And I find that if I
haven't noted it down,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.560
by the time you wake up,
you may have forgotten it.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.320
So I find that
the clarity for me

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.630
is always at some point in
the middle of the night.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.790
And I instantly just
wake up, and then

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.490
I just write and write
and write and write.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.500
And then I transfer
that into some sort

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.000
of PowerPoint presentation.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.240
And then I'm able to go out
there and sell the idea.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.361
So that happened one night,
the Inspire African dream just

00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:32.860
came.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.750
Even the name
Inspire Africa came.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.240
The name "Moments with Mo"
didn't come for a while, but--

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.115
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Had you been thinking

00:16:40.115 --> 00:16:41.850
or was it like literally
out of the blue?

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.190
Because it looks like you're
very good at finding gaps

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.440
in the market, opportunity.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.145
So was that sort of
in the space and you

00:16:50.145 --> 00:16:53.800
were thinking then you got a
clarity, or it sort of just

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.720
came like a light, like a flash?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.750
MO ABUDU: The thing is that
leaving ExxonMobil and setting

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.894
up Vic Lawrence
was easy, because--

00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:03.310
well, it wasn't easy, but
pretty much it was the same line

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.720
of what I'd been used to.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.210
And then doing
the hotel project,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.130
I wasn't going to run
the hotel, so, again, I

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.630
could see that,
OK-- and also, there

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.619
was some sort of-- you could
see the alignments between Vic

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:18.369
Lawrence and us servicing
the Protea Hotel at the time.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:23.140
So this move into "Moments
with Mo," when that one came,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.030
I was concerned.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.130
I was concerned because--

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.140
you know how you're like,
who are you going to tell?

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.970
What are people going to think?

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.670
And we live in a society
whereby sometimes people

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.540
get the wrong end of the stick.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.291
And I remember telling
a particular person

00:17:40.291 --> 00:17:41.040
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.750
All the person could
say [INAUDIBLE],

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.430
you want to become a
presenter, to be a presenter?

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.572
But for me, it was
more than that.

00:17:47.572 --> 00:17:49.030
It was about the
fact that in order

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.790
to be able to have a
conversation around the things

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.060
and the issues that
are important to us

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.490
as a people within the
continent and within Nigeria

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.770
more specifically--

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.250
I mean, yes, I have watched
the "Oprah Winfrey Show."

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.002
I have watched the
"Ellen DeGeneres"--

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:06.460
I mean, I can't do
the Ellen thing.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.419
I mean, she's so funny.

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.626
I'm like, how does she do it?

00:18:08.626 --> 00:18:09.187
I don't know.

00:18:09.187 --> 00:18:11.270
At the time, there was
also the "Tyra Banks Show."

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.140
So all these shows were
on the Mnet platform.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.020
So I went in to have
a discussion with Mnet

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.040
about the fact that--

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.300
when I gathered the courage
and had done the presentation.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.800
At this point, I hadn't told a
lot of people about the idea.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.570
Went in to do a
presentation to them just

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.909
to see what they would think.

00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:28.450
And the initial
response at that time

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.670
was, why do we need this show?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.620
We already have a
lot of talk shows.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.770
And it's incredible how
the need for local content

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.950
has changed in the
last 12 to 13 years.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.890
Because then, we
didn't seem to have

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.426
an appetite for local content.

00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:44.550
We didn't seem to crave it.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.950
We didn't seem to want it.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.658
We didn't seem to care
if it [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:47.658 --> 00:18:48.860
It didn't even exist.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.950
So I kept saying
to them, I think

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.830
there's going to be a
need for a show like this.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.220
And my reasons are--
but yes, I am traveled.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.325
I can relate to
some of the topics

00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:01.970
and the things that have
been said on those shows.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.930
I mean, if maybe
that particular day

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.670
Oprah is talking
about weight loss

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.010
and they're going to be
talking about eating asparagus

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.660
or carrots or
whatever it may be.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.060
But how is that
relevant to a Nigerian

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.400
that wants to lose weight?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.910
Where is she going
to find asparagus?

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.590
For me, it was about
bringing this message home

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.610
and saying, how do we deal
with issues in our environment?

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.030
If a man is beating
his wife and she's

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.680
a victim of domestic abuse,
how is that show in America

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.420
going to help her overcome
that battle in Nigeria?

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.900
Meanwhile, there are so
many associations that

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.840
are dealing with domestic
abuse who you can call out to

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.540
in Nigeria, who are
having no face time,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.050
about having that conversation
with people that they could

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.810
say, listen, if this
is happening to you,

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.020
I'm here to help you.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.900
I was a victim.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.300
Now I'm a victor.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.910
There were no
opportunities for that.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.300
How come we're not celebrating
our own people that

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.440
are achieving certain things in
the world of fashion and music

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.617
and so on and so forth?

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:02.700
Now we have all the blogs.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.533
We have all of that.

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:05.398
We didn't have those
things 12 years ago.

00:20:05.398 --> 00:20:07.064
All we had [INAUDIBLE]
was "City People"

00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:09.860
if you wanted to know
what was happening to XYZ.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.250
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.292
MO ABUDU: It's totally
come to life in the last--

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:16.416
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Especially with online now.

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:18.900
MO ABUDU: In the last
decade, it has exploded.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.290
So it was really about telling
them that there was a need.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.370
Thank god, eventually Joe Hunda,
who was then the MD of Mnet,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.250
eventually said, OK, Mo,
I'm going to buy this idea.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.219
But I cannot fund it.

00:20:31.219 --> 00:20:32.760
I don't have money
to commission you.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.650
But I will license your show.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.800
So he now suggested that
you go look for sponsors.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.440
I'd never been in
the sponsors game

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.085
prior to starting
"Moments with Mo."

00:20:42.085 --> 00:20:42.960
I didn't have a clue.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.590
But I though, OK, in
England during the summer

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.550
I'd done all these
sort of sales jobs.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.420
And I'd been told you can
sell sand to the sheiks.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.980
So go out there and sell.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.730
So I went around.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.180
I went to the banks.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.580
I went to the telcos to try
and sell "Moments with Mo,"

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.760
looking at what
would the benefits be

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.020
and opening billboards,
saying, brought to you

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.100
by XYZ company, adverts in
between the show, product

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:07.912
placements.

00:21:07.912 --> 00:21:10.370
And if your color is red, we'll
have red in the background.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.720
So I had to now start
thinking about, OK,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.178
what are all those
things I'm going

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.130
to do to get them to commit?

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.100
Because you can't just
keep saying to somebody,

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.430
be a sponsor.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.990
What is the value?

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.602
What is the value we're
give to the sponsor?

00:21:22.602 --> 00:21:24.060
I mean, it happens
to us every day.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.768
People come and say,
be my media partner.

00:21:25.768 --> 00:21:26.640
Media partner how?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.440
You want exposure
on the channel.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.060
But what are we
getting in return?

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.820
So we need to get value
so that we can give you

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.690
some value as well.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.640
So that sort of
opened up my eyes

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.070
to the world of
sponsorships and how

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.150
to close those sort
of sponsorship deals.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.930
And I'd gone to one
particular bank at the time.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.210
And they were like, oh, yes.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.590
The MD had said we
were going to do it.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.930
And then this particular
MD a month later hired

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.690
a new head of corporate who now
said, we're not going to do it.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.730
And I was totally
like devastated.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.460
But I thought to myself, I'm not
going to let that get me down.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.587
I said, Mo-- I had
to pick myself up.

00:21:58.587 --> 00:22:01.170
I called a good friend of mine
at the time called [INAUDIBLE],

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.660
who runs a small
incubator consulting.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.912
[INAUDIBLE] I said, [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:06.870
No sponsor [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.117
What do I do now?

00:22:08.117 --> 00:22:10.450
And at the time, I was looking
for huge amounts of money

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.510
to start the show.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.097
He said, Mo, break it down.

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:14.680
Why don't you just
see if you can even

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.600
do one season of the show?

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.980
If you do one
season successfully,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.770
then you can start
going from there.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.260
And that advice basically
is was happened.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.960
He took me along
to have a meeting

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.120
with then the MD if [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.204
I did my usual
presentation to him.

00:22:30.204 --> 00:22:31.870
I'd never met the man
in my entire life.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.390
And I walked away thinking,
I wonder what he thinks.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.900
And eventually, he said,
we're not going to sponsor,

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.920
but we're going to
invest in your company.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.230
And then they had
the SME scheme.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.930
And they bought
into Inspire Africa.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.880
And that basically gave
us the seed capital

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.760
we needed to go
build our own studio.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.634
Because we had to
build our space where

00:22:50.634 --> 00:22:52.300
we were going to have
this conversation.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.200
It didn't exist.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.575
It's not like in
the States where

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:58.180
you can just walk into a
studio, dry hire the studio,

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.050
and record.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.280
We couldn't do that.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.300
So we then had to
get our studio space.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.076
And we were then in City Mall.

00:23:05.076 --> 00:23:05.950
Found an empty space.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.794
We sort of did it up
as best as we could.

00:23:07.794 --> 00:23:09.460
And that's where we
started [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.720
And before that, I went
on a training course.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.544
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Yeah, I
was actually going to ask that.

00:23:12.544 --> 00:23:13.380
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.132
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Because
that's good [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:16.210
Because that was new territory.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.240
MO ABUDU: Yes, yes, yes,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.656
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: And I
recall hearing you say that.

00:23:19.656 --> 00:23:21.073
You had no prior
media experience.

00:23:21.073 --> 00:23:21.697
MO ABUDU: None.

00:23:21.697 --> 00:23:22.640
Never done it before.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.679
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: So it
was going into a new space.

00:23:25.679 --> 00:23:26.470
MO ABUDU: Yes, yes.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.053
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: So how did you

00:23:28.053 --> 00:23:33.730
develop your own capacity and
also position yourself in a way

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.007
that you and the show
could be taken seriously?

00:23:36.007 --> 00:23:36.590
MO ABUDU: Mhm.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.430
Yes.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:39.730
Well, before we started,
thank god we had Sky Bank.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.120
So they came on board as an
investor and also as a sponsor.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.000
And luckily, eventually I was
able to persuade [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.620
to come on board as a sponsor.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.170
So I had two strong
brands that were

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.870
associated with the
"Moments with Mo" brand.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.560
And the very first
interview I did,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.950
it was Professor Wole Soyinka.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.835
And I chased and chased
until he said yes.

00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:04.210
Because I thought, I need to
start this show with a bang.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.490
I need to have a
really special guest.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:11.290
And that gave the show the
credibility that it needed.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.620
I went on a training course to
learn how to be a presenter.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.570
At the time, Oprah had
launched her 25 years

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.860
in those video DVD box sets.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.660
I bought the entire thing.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.450
I would watch and watch.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.960
Running a training
consultancy firm,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.460
I got one of my instructors,
[INAUDIBLE] at the time,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.120
to train me.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.210
So we would train every
weekend at the Protea Hotel.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.460
He would record me.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.610
We'd play it back.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.950
We'd look at, Mo, you
need to improve on this

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:39.790
and improve on that.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.525
So I did all those things
before I got started.

00:24:42.525 --> 00:24:44.650
So that kind of gave me a
little bit of confidence.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:49.800
I was still very nervous.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.700
But I just found that
once I got into the flow

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.522
of the conversation--

00:24:55.522 --> 00:24:58.550
and once I was researched--
it's important to prepare

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.290
for your interviews.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.962
So I say a lot of
advice to young girls

00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:04.670
out there that want
to become presenters.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.450
It's not really about how you
look or the shoes you have on.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.830
Yes, that's nice, too.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.340
But it's really got to be about
the quality of the conversation

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.230
and the questions
that you're asking

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.450
and the topics that
you're selecting.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.890
Because I found when I
launched "Moments with Mo,"

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.670
I kept saying, we need to
have topics that are exciting

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.360
and people are going
to want to watch.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.820
So one of my episodes
was this lady

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.270
that said that she was the
parent to seven children

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.570
that she claims she
had in seven months.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.070
So we did lots of
research about,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.480
OK, you went for the blood test.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.560
We interviewed her.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.860
She said she was the parent.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.318
At the end of the day, it turned
out she wasn't the parent.

00:25:43.318 --> 00:25:45.600
I had another crazy episode
with an armed robber.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.570
This guy was an ex-armed robber.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.270
And he sat and told me
entirely how he got into it

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.040
and how he got out of it.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.962
Another crazy episode was
the snake-eating episode.

00:25:54.962 --> 00:25:56.420
There actually are
places where you

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.634
can go and buy snake meat
in Nigeria and eat snake.

00:25:58.634 --> 00:26:00.550
I'm thinking-- and the
lady came to the studio

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.810
with the snake meat--
looks like chicken.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.730
And I said to her, I'm like,
I'm not trying this one today.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.850
So it was really about
finding those topics that

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.070
would engage, that
would be interesting,

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.660
rather than just another--

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.700
domestic abuse we covered.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.799
Of course we celebrated
lots of people on the shows.

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.340
I mean, I probably
did 1,000 episodes

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.220
before I decided that I wanted
to take a back seat before we

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.462
started on this journey
of EbonyLife television.

00:26:25.462 --> 00:26:26.712
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Right.

00:26:26.712 --> 00:26:31.070
Still on "Moments with Mo"--
so you had several moments

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.880
in the course of--

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.530
I think it's over 10 years now.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.970
MO ABUDU: Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.770
2016, yes.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.626
2006 to 2016-- yeah,
10 years-- yes.

00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:41.500
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
From the discussions,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.560
were there personal lessons
that you learned that really

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.720
had a profound impact on you?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.960
MO ABUDU: The thing is, when
people that you don't know

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.690
open up to you, you find
yourself in a situation

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.165
whereby you think you really--

00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:00.140
I mean, they're
sharing things with you

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.690
that you may otherwise
not have known.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.820
And one of the
episodes that I did

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.460
for me that was very
early on in my career

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.700
that I found really
touching was when that plane

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.500
crashed in Port Harcourt.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.580
And it had all those children
from the school in Abuja

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.690
on the flight.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:23.152
And I had Mrs. [INAUDIBLE],
who lost her own daughter

00:27:23.152 --> 00:27:25.130
in the studio.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.890
And it was sitting next to a
woman that not only does she

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.915
come on the show, but she
was able to share her pain

00:27:33.915 --> 00:27:38.870
and how she dealt with the
fact that her only child has

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.700
been killed in a plane crash.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.480
And you find that those
intimate moments are just

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.076
moments that you can
never just get them back.

00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:51.510
And people are sharing
things with you that

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.440
are really, really private.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.130
And you're the custodian
of that information.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:01.570
And how you treat it and how you
treat them I've found to be--

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.770
I had to find my
own way of dealing

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.090
with those kinds of issues.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.410
You would leave a show at times,
and you're like, oh, my god.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.790
And I used to do like
four shows a day.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.271
Because in the
world of production,

00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:14.270
that's the only way it
can make financial sense.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.560
You can't be doing one a day.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.140
You use the crew--

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.970
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.150
MO ABUDU: Use your crew
till they're tired!

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.567
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: [LAUGHING]

00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:20.983
MO ABUDU: Even
when they're tired,

00:28:20.983 --> 00:28:22.320
they would still be recording.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.500
So at times you would have to go
from doing a very happy episode

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.230
to doing a very sad
episode to doing

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.430
a different sort of episode.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.982
And at times your head is kind
of like in different places.

00:28:35.982 --> 00:28:37.356
And I'm coming
from a world where

00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:38.910
I haven't done this before.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.380
So having to deal with all
of that was kind of yeah--

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.172
had its challenges.

00:28:45.172 --> 00:28:46.713
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: And it sounds

00:28:46.713 --> 00:28:48.082
like it was a lot of hard work.

00:28:48.082 --> 00:28:48.790
MO ABUDU: It was.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.300
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
I think people--

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.670
when you say an
entrepreneurial success story,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.240
it's very easy to
celebrate it and to think,

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.674
oh, it's all glam, et cetera.

00:28:55.674 --> 00:28:57.340
But there's a lot of
hard work-- genuine

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.190
heard work that goes into
making anything successful.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.540
MO ABUDU: Very much so--
a lot, a lot of hard work.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.150
You've got to be well-researched
on whoever the guest is.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.430
And for me, when I was doing
Professor Wole Soyinka,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.140
I thought, you know
what he's like.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.515
You can't sit on
the set with him

00:29:09.515 --> 00:29:11.150
and not know what
you're talking about.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.626
So I was petrified of
that particular one.

00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:15.250
I must have read and
read and read more

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.800
than I would need
for the interview.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.300
But you just have
to be prepared.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.282
And for every single
interview that I did,

00:29:21.282 --> 00:29:22.490
I have to be well-researched.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.250
I had to have my
questions with me.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.920
And sometimes the
response you get

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.292
has no link to
the next question.

00:29:29.292 --> 00:29:31.000
So you have to be very
quick on your feet

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.730
about how you're now going
to sort of go back to them

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.479
and get the necessary
answers that you wanted.

00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:39.020
And at times, you're going to
have technical problems on set.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.120
Something isn't working.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.620
A generator has broken.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.720
We're dealing in an
environment whereby

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.220
your counterparts
in another country

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.945
doesn't have to think
about these issues.

00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:48.820
Nobody cares-- I mean,
who cares about power?

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.730
Who cares about some
of those things here?

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.380
But here you are dealing
with those realities.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.200
Those are my realities every
day that I have to deal with--

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.650
find a space that I could
convert into a studio,

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.600
find staff that would
understand the vision that

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.750
could get me the look and feel.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.177
Because at the time,
as easy as it is--

00:30:06.177 --> 00:30:08.260
I mean, now that we do
1,000 hours of programming,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.840
a talk show is the easiest
format in the world.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.380
But no one has still
been able to replicate

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.700
the "Moments with Mo" format.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.870
In 10 years.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.900
I've not seen another
talk show that replicated

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.860
the look and feel of talk.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.540
And for us, talk is the simplest
thing for us on EbonyLife TV

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.170
today.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.960
We've taken talk to a completely
different level from things

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.190
like "Moments."

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.094
Now we have "Moments Z,"
which is with a much younger

00:30:33.094 --> 00:30:34.510
crop of young girls
who are having

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.760
a conversation around things
that are important to them.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.801
We have "Love Lounges,"
which is about love, sex,

00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:39.634
and relationships.

00:30:39.634 --> 00:30:41.800
We've got "Men's Corner,"
which is talk about things

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.200
that men are fascinated
about that women also

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.580
want to know about them.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.990
We have [INAUDIBLE],
which is [INAUDIBLE] doing

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.960
his own crazy thing.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.270
It's all talk.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.220
So we've taken the
talk, and we've kind of

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.010
given it its own twist.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.870
So it is a lot of work.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.000
It is a lot of work--

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.890
even convincing sponsors
to come on board.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.070
After you convince
them, oh, yeah, pay me,

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.370
you're going to be chasing
them around to get payment.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.650
Remember, you have
salaries to pay.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:05.940
You have crew.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.830
You have everybody else to pay.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.871
They're not going to wait
for clients to pay you.

00:31:08.871 --> 00:31:10.039
You're talking to the bank.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:11.830
You're facilitating
overdrafts [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.840
You're doing all
kinds of things just

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.192
to keep the business going.

00:31:15.192 --> 00:31:16.400
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.190
So talking about
EbonyLife TV, that's

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.340
one of your more recent
bold moves [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.050
And I remember the tagline--

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.510
everything you think
you know about Africa

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.770
is about to change--

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:27.540
MO ABUDU: Forever.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.130
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Forever.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.560
MO ABUDU: Yes.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:28.880
Yes.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.580
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Can you
share the vision behind that?

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.070
MO ABUDU: The vision
behind that was that--

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.230
I remember a few
years before when

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:38.650
I'd interviewed Hillary Clinton,
and one of the key questions

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.600
that I said to
her was, how do we

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.210
change the stereotypes
about how we

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.400
are perceived across the world?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.250
And she said to me,
we have to have people

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.190
like you speaking
on behalf of Africa

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.180
and putting a different image
out there about the continent.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.120
Because even with Google,
if you Google Africa,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.520
what are the first
images that come up?

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.589
It's going to be poverty.

00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:02.630
It's going to be despair.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.460
It's going to be destruction.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.475
It's going to be all these
images that the world

00:32:06.475 --> 00:32:09.340
view have of our continent.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.500
How do we change that worldview?

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.590
It's by creating the
reality, the other reality

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.180
that the world needs to see.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.630
And that other reality is
showing people like you

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.200
and I in Nigeria, showing that
there's this audience here,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.450
showing that we are capable.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.080
And that was how we came
up with the tagline--

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.940
everything you think you
think you know about Africa

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.780
is going to change.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.060
Because we put a positive
spin on everything.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.950
We didn't create these people.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.510
These people already existed.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.400
We just didn't have a
platform so that you

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.720
could engage with them.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.630
So we gave that platform for
engagement, from let's make

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.340
comedy, let's make
reality, let's make talk,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.070
let's make scripted programming.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.430
Let's do lifestyle.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.880
Let's do everything that we can
to show the world that this--

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.040
and we have a tag.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.700
We have this stamp that we put
on everything saying, EbonyLife

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.150
TV, made in Nigeria
for the world.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.270
So good things can
come out of our content

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.940
and out of our country
and can be exported.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.140
And that really was
what it was all about.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.340
I mean, we go out to
international exhibitions,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.132
and people ask us--

00:33:15.132 --> 00:33:17.089
I don't know if it's a
compliment or an insult.

00:33:17.089 --> 00:33:19.080
They say, was this
really made in Nigeria?

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.535
Yes, it was made in Nigeria.

00:33:20.535 --> 00:33:21.160
How about that?

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:21.810
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Yes, we can make things.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.520
MO ABUDU: And yes, we can
make things like that.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.830
Because they're so used
to just all kinds-- and we

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.232
have to be careful about
what we put out there.

00:33:28.232 --> 00:33:30.690
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: And
actually, interestingly, that's

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.690
one of our priorities
as Google in Nigeria,

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.370
encouraging-- having
local content online.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.990
Create amazing
[INAUDIBLE], business,

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.680
educational content
[INAUDIBLE] here.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.560
So that's one of our priorities.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.400
MO ABUDU: I mean, look
at this conversation

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.191
we're having today.

00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:47.170
I mean, you're having it.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.770
So thank you again.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.650
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
What are the challenges

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.275
that you encountered
in trying to set--

00:33:51.275 --> 00:33:55.760
because that's a really big fit,
setting up your own TV channel.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.465
Everything you've
mentioned prior to that,

00:34:00.465 --> 00:34:02.340
I know they were very
challenging, et cetera,

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.880
but this, I think, was,
in order of magnitude,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.444
probably another level.

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:07.610
MO ABUDU: [LAUGHING] It was.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.780
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
So what are the challenges

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.986
that you went through in setting
up and running EbonyLife TV?

00:34:13.986 --> 00:34:19.330
And what support systems and
opportunities assisted you?

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.179
MO ABUDU: I woke
up one day, and I

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.429
decided that I wanted
to launch a TV channel.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:27.179
And I had no idea how
I was going to do it.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:29.179
But I just knew that
deep down in my spirit,

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.142
deep down in my soul, God
said, Mo, go and do this.

00:34:32.142 --> 00:34:33.850
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Did it scare you?

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.670
MO ABUDU: [GASPS]

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.086
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: [LAUGHING]

00:34:36.086 --> 00:34:36.962
MO ABUDU: Very scary.

00:34:36.962 --> 00:34:37.461
Very.

00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:39.659
And I think sometimes,
the scarier the dream,

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.340
the more you need to pursue it.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.989
Because I think there's a
message in there somewhere.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.455
Because if it's not scary,
then what's the challenge?

00:34:46.455 --> 00:34:48.987
And for me, I'm like, OK, try.

00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:50.070
All you have to do is try.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.570
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.400
So the idea came.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.520
And one of the first
people I called was my mom.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.690
My mom is always--

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.239
she's my prayer partner.

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:00.780
And she says she's
my number-one fan.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.050
[LAUGHING] So I said,
Mommy, I'm doing this thing.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.630
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
as she always says.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.640
But that means that
she's praying about it.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.460
So the next person
I told was a friend

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.770
of mine in South
Africa, Sandra Admadio.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.071
Sandra was one of our
producers then on "Moments."

00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:17.445
Because when we
did "Moments," we

00:35:17.445 --> 00:35:20.230
used to have a Pan-African
spin to all of our shows.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.780
And she would go
around Africa, sort

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.980
of shooting similar stories
for the show at the time.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.240
So I said to Sandra, I
want to start a TV channel.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.760
And Sandra's like, oh,
that sounds really cool.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.460
And what do we do now?

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.538
So I thought, how do
you start a channel?

00:35:35.538 --> 00:35:36.750
I couldn't get a license.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.166
There was no opportunity to
get a license for [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:41.300
They'd all been taken, all gone.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.260
But I also felt that it
was important to create

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.530
a platform that could travel
and one could use technology

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.390
to drive and would be
Pan-African at the same time.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.370
So I have a show on DStv.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:54.449
I said, let me have a
conversation with DStv.

00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:56.990
So Joe Hunda, that had approved
the "Moments with Mo" I said,

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.884
Joe, I want to
start a TV channel.

00:35:58.884 --> 00:36:00.300
And he's like, Mo,
love, you know,

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.700
we don't just do
channels like that.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.460
I'm not sure we need another
channel, but you can try.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.740
So I said, who do I contact?

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.300
And [INAUDIBLE] used a contact
later called [? Alexa ?]

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.680
[? Alberts. ?] I said, can
I have her email address?

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.166
So he gave me her email.

00:36:12.166 --> 00:36:13.290
And this is how it started.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.700
I didn't know her from Adam.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.410
Sent her an email, and
eventually she responded.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.940
She sent me a form that's longer
than anything else, hundreds--

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.120
I mean, not hundreds,
but several pages of,

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.220
what is the name of the
channel, what is the--

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.070
I mean, questions that
I did not even know.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.639
It made me think about, wow,
you want to start a channel,

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:33.180
but did you know
you're going to have

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.660
to know this much before you
can actually start the channel--

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.110
the schedule, the types
of programs, the budget.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.020
I mean, there were
so many questions.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:47.040
Eventually, I did the best I
could to answer the questions.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.780
And I sent the form back to her.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.850
And then I kept chasing
her and chasing her.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.080
And she wasn't answering me.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.680
Because they get requests
at least 10 to 20 a day

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.170
from people that want to set
up TV channels-- from Nigeria.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.740
So eventually, I said, I'm
going to be in South Africa.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.460
Because I was shooting an
episode of "Moments with Mo."

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.130
And could I please
come in and see you?

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.490
So that was my hook of
getting in the door.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.480
So I went in, and
I had a meeting.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.550
So before having
the meeting, I then

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.985
hired someone that was
already in the world of media

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.860
to do me a beautiful
presentation around this

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.230
is the sort of content we
would have on the channel.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.740
Went in and did the presentation
and left the meeting.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.632
They said, well,
this isn't quite it.

00:37:26.632 --> 00:37:28.340
So I was devastated,
because I'd actually

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.710
paid someone quite
a large sum of money

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.660
to do that presentation.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.410
It wasn't working.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.390
So they were like, if
you want this channel,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:39.710
you have to go back and do XYZ.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.190
And we had workshop after
workshop after workshop,

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.930
deciding on who was going
to be our [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.790
Who do you really want to
speak to across the continent?

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.260
What is the conversation?

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.190
What are the genres?

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.792
What are the hours?

00:37:53.792 --> 00:37:55.500
How are you going to
produce these hours?

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.544
Who is going to
produce these hours?

00:37:57.544 --> 00:37:59.210
Who is going to do
your post-production?

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.209
How are you going to clear
things through legal?

00:38:01.209 --> 00:38:03.110
I mean, there is a
battle and a half

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.040
of things you need to clear
to create one hour of content.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.280
So eventually after
several months

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.120
of now having gone back,
having left them and gone back

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.640
to do another presentation
with all of this--

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.076
I had to engage a consultant.

00:38:19.076 --> 00:38:20.450
I couldn't find
anyone in Nigeria

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.060
to do it, because the
skill sets don't exist.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.092
I found someone in
South Africa, again

00:38:26.092 --> 00:38:27.800
had to invest a huge
amount of money that

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.980
could have gone into maybe
a nice bag and a holiday.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.920
Let's just get this
presentation done.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.560
Let's do the strategy
session, after which we then

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.610
did the presentation.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.540
We now went back into
[INAUDIBLE] to present.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.230
Then they bought the idea.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.250
But now they gave us conditions.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.840
This is a beautiful
presentation,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.040
but you need to raise
XYZ amounts of money.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.309
You need to have a studio
before you can do all of this.

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:56.850
Which is why I say
sometimes you need

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.842
to pray hard and work hard.

00:38:58.842 --> 00:39:00.550
At the same time, a
good friend of mine--

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.030
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: You had
to raise the money on your own?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.488
MO ABUDU: I had to
raise the money.

00:39:03.488 --> 00:39:05.190
And the story about
how that raised

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.450
is what I'd like to share.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.370
At the same time all
this is happening,

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.120
a good friend of mine,
[INAUDIBLE], says to me,

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.490
you need to go to Cross River
and interview the governor.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.879
And I was like, I'm trying to
raise money for my channel.

00:39:17.879 --> 00:39:19.420
I'm trying to do
all of these things.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.280
I don't really--

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.910
But eventually, he persuaded me.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.210
And I also had wanted to do that
interview for the longest time.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:31.940
Went on a plane on New Year's
Day about five years ago.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.250
Went to Calabar to go
and do this interview

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.705
with His Excellency then
at the time, Governor Liyel

00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:41.410
Imoke, and his wife
Obioma at the time.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.840
But at the same
time, I had a sponsor

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.700
for my show "Moments with Mo."

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.120
And the sponsor had
threatened to pull out

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.310
unless I started having a
presence on social media.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.531
Because I wasn't tweeting.

00:39:51.531 --> 00:39:52.780
I didn't know anything about--

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.390
I was just doing my thing.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:59.520
So I got a PR person, registered
me on Twitter, do my Facebook

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.580
and do all of that.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.830
So then I got to
Calabar that evening.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.440
I sent a message
saying, happy new year,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.300
lots of love from Calabar.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.360
And someone said to me,
what's happening in Tinapa?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.710
I've never been to
Tinapa in my entire life.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.534
So I was with a
friend in the car who

00:40:14.534 --> 00:40:15.700
said, let me take you there.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.690
Let's drive around.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.780
We went there--
beautiful place--

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.310
beautiful but empty, as
in, nothing was in Tinapa.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.560
So the next day when I was
going to interview the governor,

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.960
[INAUDIBLE], who was
his special assistant,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.280
said, come in and
have a conversation

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.620
with His Excellency before
you start your interview.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.640
I never met him.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.050
I didn't know what
to say to him.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.633
The first thing I said was, Your
Excellency, we went to Tinapa

00:40:40.633 --> 00:40:41.980
yesterday, but it's very empty.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.240
What's going on?

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.280
That is how that
conversation started.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.680
That is how we got the support
we needed for the channel.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.870
Now, I didn't know--

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.021
I mean, on one hand, you're
looking to set up a channel.

00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:54.520
On another hand, a
friend is saying,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.150
come and interview
the government.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.483
The other sponsor is saying,
you need to start tweeting.

00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:01.520
You put all of that together,
you send a tweet message out,

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.140
and Bob's your uncle.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.620
Somehow a couple of years
later, about 18 months later,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.850
Cross River State came
on board as our partner.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:14.710
We promised to use that Tinapa
studio as our destination

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:16.030
point for media.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.810
And that was the catalyst for
getting EbonyLife TV started.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.940
And they also supported
us in the fundraising

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.380
for EbonyLife TV.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.540
So [INAUDIBLE] putting all
those elements together.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.520
So when people say to
you, what is your recipe?

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.346
I can't say to you, go
tweet or go to Cross River

00:41:31.346 --> 00:41:32.470
and interview the governor.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.844
You're going to
have to just work

00:41:33.844 --> 00:41:37.390
hard enough for the universe
to conspire fire to say,

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.700
OK, I am going to
give you your break.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.860
I believe that there are
dream-makers for all of us

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.570
out there.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.134
We all have to meet
our dream-makers.

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:46.300
And on the other hand, there
are your dream-killers,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.640
those that cannot wait
to kill the dream.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.150
So you have to balance
the dream-killers

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.864
and the dream-makers and see
how you get out of that cycle.

00:41:53.864 --> 00:41:55.280
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: The lesson

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.760
I hear as well from
just listening to this

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.350
is also having your radar on.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.920
MO ABUDU: Sometimes you
think it's going nowhere.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.860
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: Yes.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.651
MO ABUDU: And sometimes
for the hell of it,

00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:05.290
just go along with
whatever it is.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.020
Because you never know
where it's going to lead to.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.000
You never, ever know.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.191
It could be one night,
you're out having a drink.

00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:11.440
You could be in a supermarket.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.832
You could be absolutely
anywhere when

00:42:13.832 --> 00:42:15.040
the opportunity comes to you.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:15.650
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Absolutely.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.510
MO ABUDU: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.050
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Another thing

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.466
I think you're
very good at, and I

00:42:18.466 --> 00:42:20.950
think that's really critical
in entrepreneurship,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.200
is finding the right talent.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.350
Where do you source talent?

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.700
And what are the things
you look out for?

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.536
Because when I think about
EbonyLife TV and everything

00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:31.410
you've done, actually,
you have a great team.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.140
MO ABUDU: We have
a fantastic team.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.039
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
How do you find them?

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:36.580
MO ABUDU: Again, I
think the universe

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.746
will conspire to sort of
bring you the right people.

00:42:38.746 --> 00:42:41.650
But I think maybe being
an HR person I think also

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.560
has helped a great
deal in understanding

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.780
what the processes are
that you need to go through

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.390
to find the right talent.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.070
I can't work with
anyone on my team

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.040
that isn't ready to be replying
email at 3:00 in the morning.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.300
I know it sounds crazy.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.810
But you must be
able to work hard.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.960
You've got to be able to
identify where they're coming

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.610
from, the things they've done.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.401
Someone is here with
me today. [? Eunice ?]

00:43:05.401 --> 00:43:06.580
is there with me today.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.050
And [? Eunice ?] was
based in America.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:12.550
And I had to plead with
her to come back to Nigeria

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.630
to work with us.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:17.200
Because even before she joined
us as a member of our team,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.210
as I had a strategy,
we had already

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.680
started working together
on little bit of things--

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.064
not officially.

00:43:23.064 --> 00:43:24.730
Like if I was going
to go to the States,

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.310
she would even
proactively volunteer.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:30.940
She'd proactively help me do
things without me even asking.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.450
And I'm thinking, this
is the sort of person

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.710
you want on your
team, to be there

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.560
for you in your own corner.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.230
So eventually I pleaded
and said, please come back.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:45.454
And she packed up her bags,
and she's come back to Nigeria.

00:43:45.454 --> 00:43:47.870
So for me, it's really about
just putting your feelers out

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:48.590
there.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.710
And you need to have
that fifth sense.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.575
You need to be able
to say to yourself,

00:43:53.575 --> 00:43:55.890
is this person going to
be a part of your team?

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.840
And you can pretty much suss
out people that work hard

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.670
and people that are just BS-ing.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.850
I'm sorry to say that.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:03.850
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
No, absolutely.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:04.790
MO ABUDU: I mean, there
are a lot of people,

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.120
they're all talk, and they're
just not going to do the work.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.650
And I can't deal with that.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.730
So immediately, I'll-- at
times you're going to make

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:13.834
recruitment errors.

00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:15.750
And when you do, you
say, thank you very much,

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:17.041
but it's not going to work out.

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:18.120
Bye-bye.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.490
And then you move on
to the next person.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.970
And that's pretty much
how I've built the team.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.800
But I think more
than anything, it's

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.821
really just about finding
people that can plug in.

00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:29.570
And we have a lot of
young people with us.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.682
[INAUDIBLE], head of
social media, is here.

00:44:31.682 --> 00:44:33.890
She joined us-- I don't
know-- three, four years ago.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:39.050
And it's incredible how
she has grown into her job.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.730
And it's really
just about finding

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:45.350
the right team of people
and then sharing the dream

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.090
and then just
being conscientious

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.840
about the things
that they need to do

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.040
and you not having to say it a
million times before they do it

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.350
and micromanage them, for them
to practically say, OK, what

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:58.910
about this and what about that?

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.829
And we're all learning together.

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:02.620
And I like to have lots
of people around me

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.744
that even know more than
I do about certain things.

00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:06.417
Because we don't know it all.

00:45:06.417 --> 00:45:07.250
I don't know it all.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.124
So my daughter is working
with EbonyLife now.

00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:10.480
She's got some crazy ideas.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.980
She's like, Mom,
we need to do this.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.845
And I'm like, OK, we're
targeting your age.

00:45:13.845 --> 00:45:15.330
OK, I will listen to you.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.080
So for me, it's
about making sure we

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.235
have an inclusive team that
they can tell us about things

00:45:21.235 --> 00:45:22.610
that they think
are going to work

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.980
for the channel of
whatever business is it,

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.160
and we just fly
with those ideas.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.000
And because we're
small, for us, we're

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.720
able to just get things
done very quickly.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.470
We don't have to get
10 levels of approval

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.210
before we do them--
maybe like you guys.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:38.254
I mean, Google is such
a massive organization.

00:45:38.254 --> 00:45:39.920
But with us, we can
pretty much say, OK,

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.270
we're going to run with this.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.080
So we can execute
things really quickly

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.946
as a small organization.

00:45:44.946 --> 00:45:46.446
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: So I'm going

00:45:46.446 --> 00:45:49.866
to open it up very shortly to
questions from the audience.

00:45:49.866 --> 00:45:52.890
But I'll ask one more
question before I do that.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.130
What gives you inner
joy and fulfillment

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.770
from all your engagement?

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:03.780
MO ABUDU: I think for me, the
highlight of my existence--

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.990
number one, my children.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.300
I think that for me, they
are the most important thing

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:10.800
in my life.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.800
If I had to give up
everything I have for my kids,

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.870
I would do so tomorrow, really.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.100
And I say that 100%.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.140
I would.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.060
My mom is my everything,
and my sisters.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.670
I put God before everything.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.940
I absolutely do.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.490
I just think it's
so important for me

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.346
to have that sense of direction.

00:46:30.346 --> 00:46:34.560
And what I find interesting is
that people don't often know

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.980
their relationship with God.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.869
And they make
assumptions about how

00:46:38.869 --> 00:46:40.160
you've achieved certain things.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.250
They don't even know
how you've achieve them.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:45.030
And what I find interesting
is that it's my secret.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.490
I share it a lot, but I
think sometimes they're

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.790
not listening to the fact
that if you put him first,

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.400
if you listen to him
truly, it doesn't matter

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.800
I've got these six-inch
heels on, I've got my lashes

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.780
or whatever.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.530
In my moment when I'm on
my knees praying to him,

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.650
it is between him and I
having that conversation,

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.500
and he is saying, Mo, do this.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.458
This is the most important
thing for you to do.

00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:09.082
So he guides my every,
every move that I do.

00:47:09.082 --> 00:47:10.540
And he just gives
me the confidence

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.150
to go out there
and say, there is

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:16.220
nothing that is real too
much that we can't achieve.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.040
Because with him, we know that
all things are truly possible.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.550
And that's what I
continue to believe in.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.050
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: So I'm going

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.270
to pause with my
questions and see

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.804
if there are any questions
from our very lovely team.

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.770
MO ABUDU: I think
for me, the skills

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.103
that I struggle with most are
probably my people skills.

00:47:41.103 --> 00:47:44.114
Because I'm so impatient
to get things done at times

00:47:44.114 --> 00:47:46.280
that I'm sure I'm driving
everybody around me crazy.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.010
Because I kind of like
want it to happen now.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:50.930
Because at times, I'm
like I micromanage--

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:53.630
I would do it myself if you
can't give it to me now.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.550
I'm the kind of person.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.950
But I think that's
as we grow, I think

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:04.020
skills are something that, with
age, you get better at them.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.720
Because I know I'm a
much better person now

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.600
than I was 10 years
ago or 20 years ago.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.580
So I think it's gradual.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.290
And I think it's also
important to keep

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.050
learning about the skills
that you have that you need

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.250
and to practice.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.010
I find I practice the
skills that I need,

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:21.770
even public speaking.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.220
At times I practice, because
I'm not the best public speaker.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.680
I want to be, and I'm constantly
challenged by the fact

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.260
that I'm not going to say
no to going out and speaking

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.040
in public.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.410
But I'm going to learn to
be a better public speaker.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.640
So it's really about teaching
yourself those skills

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.700
that you need.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.570
And I think skills
come with habit.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.075
Once you practice it
enough times, then

00:48:45.075 --> 00:48:46.457
it becomes a reality for you.

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:48.540
So whatever skills that
you think you are lacking,

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.290
just work at them.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.248
If it's that you're not
smiling, you know what?

00:48:51.248 --> 00:48:51.987
Keep smiling.

00:48:51.987 --> 00:48:54.570
Smile enough times, you're going
to find yourself just smiling

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:55.530
without even thinking about it.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.252
Because the mind is
a very funny thing.

00:48:57.252 --> 00:48:59.460
It just kind of just takes
over and does those things

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.918
without you even
thinking about it.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:12.850
From my own personal
experience, it's

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.710
pretty much been about
the fact that you

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.580
need to share the dream.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.885
If you have a big dream, you
can't do the dream by yourself.

00:49:19.885 --> 00:49:21.760
You're going to have to
look for other people

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.360
that you can invite in to
make the dream a reality.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.190
When I was setting
up Vic Lawrence,

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.450
I didn't need support.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.940
Because I started very small.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.294
But when I moved on to do the
Protea Hotel Oakwood Park,

00:49:33.294 --> 00:49:34.210
it was a $10 million--

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.251
I don't have $10 million.

00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:40.650
I had to now go out there and
do a proper placement info memo

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.090
and get people to
buy into the project.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.410
And it takes time.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.220
You're not going
to say to someone,

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.300
come in and invest $10
million, and they're

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.500
going to just sign
the check tomorrow.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.100
No.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:48.750
Some would say yes.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:49.530
Some would say no.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.562
So there was a
process of engagement.

00:49:51.562 --> 00:49:53.020
Pretty much the
same thing happened

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:53.660
with "Moments with Mo."

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.368
I had to go out there,
as I said earlier,

00:49:55.368 --> 00:49:57.930
and engage and get people
to buy into the dream.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:00.040
EbonyLife TV was the same thing.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.590
I didn't have the required
capital to set up a TV channel.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.820
So I had to find a partner.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.010
And those dreams can sometimes
take time to become a reality.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:12.220
Because cash is--
you need the cash.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.800
But you just have to just keep--

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.570
once you stay focused that you
want to achieve this dream,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.170
those things will
come into the play.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.630
And with "Moments with Mo,"
I started with one season.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.670
But initially, my
whole idea was I

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:27.030
was looking for money to get
me comfortable for a year.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:28.900
And when I couldn't
find money for a year,

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.260
I decided to seek Mack's
advice and just do one season.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.730
So if you can find ways to start
small, then you start small.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:39.810
And then once people
can see success,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.920
like now, everybody in
Nigeria wants to do a film.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.220
After the success of "The
Wedding Party," they're like,

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.390
can we come and
partner with you?

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:47.140
Do you want money?

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.420
People are offering
us money to partner.

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:53.115
So success has
it's own successes

00:50:53.115 --> 00:50:54.490
in that others
will come and say,

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:57.200
can they come and be
part of your own success?

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.070
So once you can achieve
some level of success,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.840
then you just have
to just invite.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.700
But never be afraid
of inviting people

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.891
in to share in your dream.

00:51:05.891 --> 00:51:07.766
I mean, you've got to
be careful, do your due

00:51:07.766 --> 00:51:08.849
diligence and all of that.

00:51:08.849 --> 00:51:11.160
But all things
being equal, I don't

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.276
think there's anyone that
owns anything 100% anymore.

00:51:14.276 --> 00:51:15.725
It doesn't happen.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.960
That is a tough one.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.330
Because there are
some women that

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:30.380
decide that when it's time
to raise the kids, I'm out.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.614
I'm just going to focus
on raising my children.

00:51:32.614 --> 00:51:34.280
And then there are
some people, like me,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.150
who are a little bit
more selfish, who believe

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.400
that they can have everything.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.540
So you need to be
singlminded about the fact

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.300
that I love my children,
but at the same time,

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.552
I have this dream.

00:51:45.552 --> 00:51:48.010
So how am I going to be able
to juggle all of those things?

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:50.315
You need to have a great
support system around you.

00:51:50.315 --> 00:51:53.340
You need to spend quality
time with your children.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.920
Because I find a
lot of housewives

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.655
that call themselves housewives.

00:51:56.655 --> 00:51:58.280
They're not even at
home half the time.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.330
They're probably out
having lunch or doing

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.340
their nails or somewhere.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.360
But they have deceived
themselves that they are there.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.290
So in that regard, you,
that you are working,

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.200
you therefore make it--
it became part of my day

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.330
to say that I'm going to
spend XYZ amount of time

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:15.554
with my children.

00:52:15.554 --> 00:52:16.970
We're going to go
out on this day.

00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:18.040
We're going to
take this holiday.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.100
We're going to do those things.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.766
And when it's really
time for me to take

00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:22.664
myself out of work 100%--

00:52:22.664 --> 00:52:24.080
[INAUDIBLE] my son
was going to go

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.670
do his A-levels and my daughter.

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:27.860
I had to physically take
the time out and say,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.090
I'm not working for a month.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:29.510
I'm going to go.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.572
We're going to have to
search for a way you're doing

00:52:30.572 --> 00:52:31.714
to do A-levels in England.

00:52:31.714 --> 00:52:32.380
And that was it.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.171
And you close down shop
until you come back

00:52:34.171 --> 00:52:35.120
to do those things.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.820
So it's really
about prioritizing.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.060
And I think what happens with
working mothers is that I

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.760
think your kids become strong.

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.390
I hope so.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.590
Mine have.

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.700
Mine have.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.290
They become strong knowing
that my mom is working.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.300
You are also a role
model to your daughter,

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.550
that she's going to know
that her mom has worked.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.522
Your son-- my mom
has worked hard,

00:52:57.522 --> 00:52:59.855
so that when he marries his
wife, he's not going to say,

00:52:59.855 --> 00:53:00.590
sit at home.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.340
Because he sees his
mother that's working.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.630
So I think we're also
preparing our kids for the fact

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:09.800
that it's OK to have--
your dreams are valid.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.040
Please, don't let me be
sued for plagiarism here.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.580
Your dreams are valid.

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.360
You can take that on to
know that you can go out

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.860
there and achieve your dreams
the same way that your husband

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.780
is achieving his dreams, right?

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.520
So why can't you achieve yours?

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.340
So I think it's just about
finding the fact that you need

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.400
to find the happy medium,
the happy balance,

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.032
and have a good
support system and let

00:53:31.032 --> 00:53:33.240
the kids know you really
love them when you're there.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.620
That's what has worked for me.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.480
But I can't say that same
recipe will work for everyone.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.325
Because everyone is different.

00:53:40.325 --> 00:53:41.720
We're not all the same.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.120
So my DNA will be different
to the next person's DNA.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.505
But that is pretty
much what I have done.

00:53:46.505 --> 00:53:48.630
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
That's interesting as well.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:49.838
And you touched on something.

00:53:49.838 --> 00:53:53.850
You believe that it's
possible to have it all.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.720
MO ABUDU: Hm.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.330
Not all the time.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:58.910
I think something will give.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:00.680
You can't have it
all all the time.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.025
You cannot.

00:54:02.025 --> 00:54:03.360
It's not possible.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.664
So you have to decide on
what is important to you.

00:54:06.664 --> 00:54:08.330
It's like the woman
that decides to stay

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.290
at home with her kids
that wanted a career

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.370
but couldn't have it.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.250
She's had to give
certain things up.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.310
So I don't think
anyone can have it all.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:19.820
I think we just have to try
and do the best that we can.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:24.320
And just try and be as
good as we can, really.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.190
And be honest with ourselves
about the capabilities

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:30.530
and the capacities that we have.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.050
Because we can't do everything.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:35.751
There are only certain
things that we can do.

00:54:35.751 --> 00:54:38.000
And I think we need to just
look at ourselves and say,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.860
this is who I am.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.760
Yes, when I am in this mode
of work, I can be obsessive.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.560
My friends can think
I'm selfish, because I

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.643
don't want to see anybody.

00:54:46.643 --> 00:54:51.440
But if that's what gets me to
get the results that I need,

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.640
then I'm going to
do those things.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.460
And when I'm done,
then I will find a way

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.440
to just go back and get back
into the swing of things.

00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.440
And-- yeah.

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:08.210
MO ABUDU: I think we have
a lot of talent in Nigeria.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.050
And if I look at the success
of EbonyLife Television,

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.504
it has been based on
the fact that we--

00:55:13.504 --> 00:55:14.920
I mean, one of my
biggest concerns

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.980
at the time when we actually
started the channel was, where

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.410
am I going to find the talent?

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.650
Because I looked at
the TV landscape,

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.860
and I was pretty much appalled
by the talent that I saw.

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.920
So I don't understand the
hiring decisions or how

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.610
people decided to put certain--

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.250
I look at TV.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.479
I'm like, why is
this person on TV?

00:55:31.479 --> 00:55:32.520
What skills do they have?

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.540
Why do they look this way?

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.760
So for me, it was really
important to understand

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.830
the look and feel
that we were after

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.824
and then find the right people
that we could put into that

00:55:41.824 --> 00:55:43.240
look and feel,
even if they didn't

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.644
have the necessary experience.

00:55:44.644 --> 00:55:46.060
I mean, [INAUDIBLE]
is here today.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.432
Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:48.432 --> 00:55:49.390
She does a lot of work.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:51.250
She's one of our
presenters on the channel.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.830
And I remember how she--

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:54.850
I mean, she's tenacious.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:57.360
I mean, I remember how she
hounded me down at the time.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.440
And she said, I want to become
a presenter on your channel.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.090
And I was like, we
don't have any spaces.

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:02.840
And then she would
keep sending me emails.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.930
And then I said, OK,
send me your show reel.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.852
And then one day, we needed
a presenter for a show.

00:56:07.852 --> 00:56:10.060
And that's how she became
one of our best presenters.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.580
I mean, she is so off the mark
with just anything [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.610
But prior to that, did
you have any experience?

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.080
Really, she had none.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.140
But everybody knows who she
is today, two or three years

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.020
later.

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.260
So the same applies
to our channel.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.750
Even [INAUDIBLE] that is doing
the "Big Brother" in South

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.750
Africa has been on the
spot and has been with us

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.800
for many, many years.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.930
We have a lot of
talent in Nigeria.

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.840
But I think the reason why
"Big Brother" is being shot

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.352
there is for business reasons.

00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.310
We are also shooting in
South Africa right now.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.660
It is for business reasons.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.390
Also, the world is
a global village.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.040
We can't keep
limiting ourselves to,

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.170
oh, I'm fighting this
cause that everything

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.220
must be done in Nigeria.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.870
No-- I want to do
programs in America.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.420
I want do programs
in the UK that I

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.760
can sell to a UK broadcaster.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.294
Why should my limits be
just in Nigerian markets?

00:56:58.294 --> 00:57:00.460
Especially with the naira
doing what it's doing now.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.290
So, my guys and I are
actually off to England

00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:08.170
to go and shoot some pilots
of some of our very good shows

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:09.167
with a British cast.

00:57:09.167 --> 00:57:10.750
And we're going to
go to America to do

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.041
the same with an American cast.

00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:14.380
Because we need
to widen the net.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.070
Shonda Rhimes is a black
woman, just like I am.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:18.402
She's written "Grey's Anatomy."

00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:20.610
I don't think everybody in
"Grey's Anatomy" is black,

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.110
right?

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:23.340
So she's just a
very talented person

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.230
that is doing great work in
the big, wild world of media.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.200
We have to learn to
take that on as well

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.350
and to understand that we
can go anywhere in the world

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:34.504
and make content and
make programming.

00:57:34.504 --> 00:57:35.920
That's what I think
we need to do.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.630
We need to just
open the blinkers

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.240
and just see the world
widely and what it truly is.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.320
And that's what I want to do,
now that the naira has crashed.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.100
And maybe you
should do the same.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:49.100
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Thank you so much.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.550
[APPLAUSE]
