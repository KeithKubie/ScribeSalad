00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:04.789
- [Voiceover] Partial
pressure is the pressure

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:08.313
that is exerted by one gas when
you have a mixture of gases.

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:13.313
So it's a pressure from
one gas in a mixture,

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:18.496
and we're going to be talking about gases

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:21.538
that behave like ideal gases.

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:25.113
The important thing to
remember about ideal gases

00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:27.203
for this particular application

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:32.203
is that they behave, the gas molecules

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.857
the gas molecules behave independently.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.295
What I mean by that is that

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.874
well, that's exactly what it means.

00:00:43.874 --> 00:00:44.919
They don't care.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.542
If you're a gas mixture,
if you're a gas molecule

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:49.446
in this mixture, you don't actually care

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.374
what the other molecules are doing.

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:53.951
You kind of just do your
own thing no matter what.

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:58.502
So if I were to draw a picture
of what this might look like,

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:02.403
let's say we have this container

00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:07.163
and our container has nitrogen gas in it.

00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:10.925
And the nitrogen gas
is going to be purple.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:15.925
So we have these nitrogen
gas molecules in here.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.540
That's N2 and the gas molecules

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.394
are whizzing around in the
box with some velocity,

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:26.041
and the velocity and
direction of the gas molecules

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.594
I'm going to indicate with these arrows.

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:31.869
And they're flying around,
they're bouncing off the walls

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.982
of the container, and when
they bounce off the walls

00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:37.094
of the container, they create pressure.

00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:40.414
So for this particular example,

00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:44.710
the pressure of our
container, of the gases

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.586
in our container rather
is two atmospheres.

00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:53.527
And so each of these gas molecules,

00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:56.941
it's doing its own thing,
and it's not interacting

00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:01.941
with other molecules, but
let's say we add another gas.

00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:08.553
So we have our container
and we add some oxygen gas.

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:17.127
And I'm going to draw the
oxygen molecules in pink.

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:21.670
Our container has the same volume,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.015
and we haven't changed the temperature.

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:26.291
And there's no reaction going on either,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.144
so we still have our molecules of N2,

00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:32.723
and they're still flying around

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.836
with the same average velocity

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.204
because the temperature didn't change

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:41.152
except now, we also have
additional gas molecules.

00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:44.008
Let's actually make that green.

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:46.771
So now we have these other
gas molecules in here,

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:49.650
and these are the O2 molecules.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.296
So that's O2, and they're also,

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:58.296
they're also moving with some velocity.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.796
So now we have more gas molecules

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:03.048
than we had originally, and our pressure

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:05.741
has gone up as a result.

00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.619
So the pressure of the
gases in our container,

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.498
which I will call the total pressure.

00:03:12.498 --> 00:03:17.498
The total pressure is now 2.5 atmospheres.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.765
We might ask ourselves, "What is

00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:24.805
"the partial pressure of the nitrogen

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:28.033
"or the partial pressure of the oxygen?"

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.098
And that is usually written
with this kind of notation,

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:32.653
with the little subscript for whatever

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.068
you're trying to figure out,

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:38.807
and we said earlier that the gas molecules

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:41.639
behave independently, and because
they behave independently,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.376
we can actually just add
up the partial pressures

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.629
in a mixture to get the total pressure.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.437
So one equation that you'll
see for partial pressure

00:03:52.437 --> 00:03:55.716
is that the total pressure is just equal

00:03:55.716 --> 00:03:58.962
to the sum of all of the
gases in your mixture,

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:02.979
all of the partial pressures
of the gases in your mixture.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.979
Plus dot, dot, dot, and
this is called Dalton's Law

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.805
of partial pressures.

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:15.616
So that is one way that we can

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:17.334
figure out the partial pressure.

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:20.120
If we know the total pressure and we know

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.164
the partial pressures
of all the other gases

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:24.439
in our mixture, we can actually figure out

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.133
the one unknown partial pressure,

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.453
and that's how we're gonna do it here.

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:35.453
So if we write this out
for our particular system,

00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:41.165
we can say P total, which
we know the total pressure.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.480
Here, it's 2.5.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.894
We know that P total must be equal

00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:49.238
to the partial pressure from the nitrogen

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.238
plus the partial pressure from the oxygen.

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:58.898
We actually know with a
partial pressure for nitrogen.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.848
The partial pressure for nitrogen

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:03.960
is actually 2.0 atmospheres.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.423
It doesn't actually change here.

00:05:05.423 --> 00:05:09.811
So partial pressure of nitrogen
is still 2.0 atmospheres

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:12.063
even though we added oxygen gas,

00:05:12.063 --> 00:05:14.478
and the reason why that
is is because well,

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:17.543
the ideal gas law says,

00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:22.543
the ideal gas law says PV equals nRT,

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:25.647
and if we rewrite this
in terms of the pressure,

00:05:25.647 --> 00:05:30.647
it's just P equals nRT over volume.

00:05:31.313 --> 00:05:35.934
And so if our nitrogen gas is
behaving like an ideal gas,

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:38.813
its pressure will only change if we change

00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:42.424
the number of moles of gas,
the temperature, or the volume.

00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:45.001
And since we've done none
of those things here,

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.207
we just added another gas,
since we didn't change

00:05:47.207 --> 00:05:49.529
the moles of gas, temperature, or volume,

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.385
the partial pressure, or the pressure

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.498
exerted by the nitrogen gas molecules

00:05:54.498 --> 00:05:58.561
is still going to be two atmospheres.

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:03.339
So then, we know that P
total is 2.5 atmospheres

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.569
and the partial pressure of nitrogen,

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.218
as we just mentioned, is 2.0 atmospheres

00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:15.117
and then we want to still figure out

00:06:15.117 --> 00:06:16.719
the partial pressure of oxygen.

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.576
But now, we can just
rearrange this equation

00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:21.271
to find P O2.

00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:26.271
So P O2 is equal to our total
pressure, 2.5 atmospheres

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:31.464
minus the partial pressure of nitrogen.

00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:33.345
So we can see that our partial pressure

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:37.687
of oxygen is just 0.5 atmospheres.

00:06:37.687 --> 00:06:41.193
So now, we know how to use this particular

00:06:41.193 --> 00:06:43.794
expression of Dalton's
Law of partial pressures

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:46.325
to find a partial pressure

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:48.275
when you know the total pressure

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:50.662
and the other partial pressures.
