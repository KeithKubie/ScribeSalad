00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.910
I was a freshman at Georgetown University
and was

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.129
fall of nineteen sixty eight i use to 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.659
uh... hangout across the street from John
Kennedy's house in georgetown

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.429
I use to eavesdrop on pierre salinger is briefing
the press at the end of the afternoon

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.609
i was a young democrat

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.740
the election John Kennedy for me a young catholic

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.919
patriotic

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.049
a member of

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:26.519
ROTC

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.689
uh...

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.239
a person sort of schooled in all of the American
beliefs of nineteen sixty it was a dream come

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.910
true you know what's 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.970
not fully appreciated it is it while knowing
how John Kennedy changed united states of america

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.180
by being its first catholic president

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.639
few people understand

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.850
how much he changed the catholic church

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.980
by being so American

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.410
when Kennedy

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.530
told the protestant ministers in Houston that
he would resign his office he didn't say he

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.850
would resign his office if you came in conflict
with the vatican

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.160
he said he would resign as office if he came
in conflict with his conscience

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.360
the primacy of conscience

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.440
was his watchstone

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.140
and uh... what really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.400
strikes you when you look back on that was
he was anticipating the second Vatican council

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.479
which

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.479
can be summed up as the catholic church finally
affirming the primacy of conscience over doctrine

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.640
over church authority even

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.500
John Kennedy was a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.920
uh... a liberal modern second vatican council
catholic before the council
