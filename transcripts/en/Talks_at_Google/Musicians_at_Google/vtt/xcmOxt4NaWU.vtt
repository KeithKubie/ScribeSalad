Craig, would you wave
your hand real quick?

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.680
So one of the first songs
my partner and I, Dana,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.975
wrote was a song
called "Stalk You."

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.850

sing a little bit of it.

couple of songs from the new

y'all hear tonight.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.090

one real quick.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.144

two of those, then

I can't do the other
songs that they--

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.290
you know what I'm saying?

Did you hear him?

So I've got to set
this up really quickly.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.570
So I have to say--
something that we never

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.320
really talk about.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.460
We never talk about
equal love and all that.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.860

into a family where my eldest

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.466
brother is a same-gender
loving person.

00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:47.211
Y'all know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:47.710
Absolutely.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.800
And I felt like I wanted to
address that because he's

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.329
the godfather of my children.

00:17:53.329 --> 00:17:55.995
And I wanted people to know that
one of the best examples that I

00:17:55.995 --> 00:17:59.200
have seen for love had been
with my brother and his partner

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.550
of some 20 years.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.740

the way I could say

I was on the radio

worked on-- I never

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.750
thought I was
gonna be an artist.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.280
I didn't think I
sang well enough

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.090
or I was talented
enough to be an artist.

Let's just start writing
and see what happens.

So the first song we wrote-- and
we're going to sing it tonight.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.060
The song was called "Stalker."

And I know, I know, I know.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.700
But I wrote the hook.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.890
And I said, Dana, I'm
gonna send you this hook.

I can't get you out of my
mind and all this stuff.

00:36:49.194 --> 00:36:49.860
Just good stuff.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.870
And then, I'm not the kind
of girl who'd stalk you.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.500
But I might call you over
and over and over again.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.890
So we wrote the song.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.680
And a good friend of
his was a house DJ.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.000
And he wanted to remix it.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.660
And he did, and it was amazing.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.260
And he said, OK, we're
about to put the record out.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.380
Who do you want to be?

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.990
I was like, what does that mean?

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.998
He was like, well, you
can change your name.

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:17.186
I was like, well, what's
wrong with Denise White?

00:37:17.186 --> 00:37:18.560
And they were
like, well, there's

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.893
nothing wrong with Denise White.

00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:22.390
But if you want to-- you
could do something else

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.430
if you wanted to.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.590
And I blurted out
Avery Sunshine.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.719
And I believe--
and it's so funny

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:31.260
when I tell you I never thought
about being an artist before.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.980
I hadn't.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.830
At least, I didn't think I had.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.220
But I think it comes from
my love of two characters.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.840
The first character is Shug
Avery from "The Color Purple."

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.390
And then the other character is
Sunshine from "Harlem Nights."

and it turns to sunshine.

I'm talking about.

name, just blurted it out.

Because otherwise-- you
know, you have to be.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.640
With kids and keeping
up with what's going on.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.426
With a career as an independent
artist, you'd better be.

00:38:27.426 --> 00:38:29.800
RYAN LOREN: So for those of
you haven't heard your music,

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.105
how would you introduce
people to your music?

00:38:34.105 --> 00:38:35.550
What's your style?

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.490
AVERY SUNSHINE: My
style is R and B soul.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.580
And there's a thread,
that common thread

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.680
of gospel through it all.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:50.812
But I'm still talking about my
baby daddy and life and stuff.

00:38:50.812 --> 00:38:53.180
But I hope that it
makes people feel good.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.960
So I like to call it
feel-good music, to.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.395
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:38:55.395 --> 00:38:57.820
AVERY SUNSHINE: So I hope it
does make people feel good.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.986
RYAN LOREN: I think it does.

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:02.150
And I was a little
surprised to hear

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.150
you say you weren't
planning to be an artist

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.270
or weren't expecting that.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.770
But weren't you involved in
music at a pretty young age?

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:10.936
AVERY SUNSHINE: Yeah, I was.

00:39:10.936 --> 00:39:14.230
Now I started playing
piano at eight.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.690
And I started directing
choirs and playing

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.770
for choirs at the age of 13.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.360
So I was reading music.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.220
And I had an aunt.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.480
Her name was Aunt Tootsie.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.260
And Aunt Tootsie called my mom
one day, said, listen, Ruth.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.500
Listen, I'm working at
the Catholic church.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.960
And I can't be
there this Sunday.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.580
I've got to go to Tahiti.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.250
Can Denise come read this
order of service real quick?

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.380
And my mom asked me, Denise,
do you want to try it?

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.050
And before I knew how much
money it paid, I said sure.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.640
The service was one hour.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.804
And I had been $175.

00:39:51.804 --> 00:39:53.220
Just to go in and
read some music.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.040
I was like, I'm through.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.750
That's my career.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.100
That's it.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.070
But I felt like I was
always behind the scenes.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:07.630
I was directing the choir
or accompanying someone

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.190
but never-- you know, and I
would sing out of necessity

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.194
if somebody didn't
show up to do a solo.

00:40:13.194 --> 00:40:14.610
That's how I would
end up singing.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.960
But never, you know what?

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.940
I'm going to sing a solo today.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.640
I just didn't
think I-- you know,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.809
some people like that
If you go to church

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:23.850
you know that one person.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.980
Yeah, I'm just gonna sing
the "Star Spangled Banner"

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.920
for the Lord today.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.190
We didn't ask you to do that.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.680
I was not that person.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.990
I tell you, I am such a fan
of that real, real singer,

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.346
the Clark Sisters
and Stevie Wonder.

00:40:40.346 --> 00:40:41.720
And I was like,
if you don't sing

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.970
like that-- that's
what I thought.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:48.490
And you've got a thing, too,
because everybody that can sing

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.570
doesn't have a thing.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.460
And I didn't think
I had that thing.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.370
I didn't know.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.990
And when I tell you
this was so divine,

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.200
I feel like it just fell on me.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.560
And then Dana and I
met, and it was really--

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.310
Dana, wave your hand
so everybody can see.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:04.518
That's my partner, everybody.

00:41:04.518 --> 00:41:05.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.390
Yeah.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.750
Yeah, without him there
would be no Avery Sunshine.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.120
So feel free to
call him Ike Turner,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.725
Rick James, Joe Jackson.

00:41:14.725 --> 00:41:15.635
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:16.630
Well thank you.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.750
So tell me more about the last
album and what it meant to you.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.211
And then-- we'll do
that first and then

00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:23.460
we'll go to the next question.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.584
AVERY SUNSHINE: The last
album, which was my first,

00:41:25.584 --> 00:41:29.260
it marked a point in my life.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.510
I was going through a divorce.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.660
I always say this.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.530
And I didn't go to therapy.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.550
I probably should have.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.790
But the record served
as therapy for me.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.850
I was able to talk about
what I was dealing with.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:46.010
And I'ma tell you--
if you don't know,

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.100
stuff is better on the outside.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.780
I just believe it.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:55.180
And I was able to get it out
and make it to the other side.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.940
So that record marks
that time in my life.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.190
And I'm grateful for it.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.560
I look back on it like, wow.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.080
I'm glad people
liked it because I

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.860
was going through some of that.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.911
One of the songs, I was crying.

00:42:08.911 --> 00:42:10.286
Dana was like, I
don't know if we

00:42:10.286 --> 00:42:11.577
need to put this on the record.

00:42:11.577 --> 00:42:16.210
I was like, no, but, ooh, I
just want people to feel me.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.364
RYAN LOREN: So then what can
we expect for the next one?

00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:22.530
AVERY SUNSHINE: More crying.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.150
No, I'm not gonna
do more crying.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.990
A different place.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.790
You know, this next
record is going

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.880
to be entitled "The Sun Room."

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.550
And if you have a
house, the sun room

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.060
is that place where
you go put up your feet

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.380
and do whatever it is
you feel like doing.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.770
If you feel like talking
on the phone, you do that.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.020
You want to watch a little TV?

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.519
You do that.

00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:47.000
If you want to look out and look
at the lake, you can do that.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.270
Whatever it is you want to
do, that's your sanctuary.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.660
And I want to encourage
everybody to find that place.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.890
So this next record is
called "The Sun Room."

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:01.350
And whatever has been on my mind
as well as Dana's-- our minds

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.942
this last year so, that's what
we're talking about again.

00:43:04.942 --> 00:43:06.025
But it's definitely happy.

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:08.360
RYAN LOREN: Good.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.477
The last one, it's
just interesting to me.

00:43:10.477 --> 00:43:12.060
I've always thought
it was fascinating

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.800
how music is therapeutic.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.240
You said you didn't
go to therapy.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.889
But it sounds like
you sort of did.

00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:18.430
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Thanks to all of you.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.040
If you have the record, you
helped me with my therapy.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.960
Thank you.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.960
RYAN LOREN: I'm looking
forward to the next one.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.260
So before we go, just a
couple of favorites of yours.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.810
What's one of your favorite
places to see live music?

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.390
AVERY SUNSHINE: Oh, one of
my favorite places to see--

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.390
RYAN LOREN: In any city.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.020
AVERY SUNSHINE: In any
city to see live music.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.770
I have to tell you-- London.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.510
Ronnie Scott's.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:42.170
It is really, really tight.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.480
If you haven't been, please make
a trip to London and check out

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.570
Ronnie Scott's.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:51.100
It's half the size of
this room right here.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.030
And the intimacy, it's electric.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.570
I fell in love with
music again in that spot.

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.500
And I hope to play
there one day.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.250
RYAN LOREN: I'm going
to check it out now.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.000
AVERY SUNSHINE: Please do.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.610
Please do.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.430
RYAN LOREN: What's one of your
passions outside of music?

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.805
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Directing choirs.

00:44:10.805 --> 00:44:12.840
That's-- outside of music.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.030
No, my children.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.090
My children.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.670
We, my son and I,
are movie buffs.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.030
So we have dates.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.640
We try to have
dates once a week,

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.490
he and I. And the last date
we had, as a matter of fact,

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:28.630
my daughter was
supposed to come.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.549
And he was feeling some
kind of way about it.

00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:33.090
And he was like,
can you drop her off

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.390
to get her hair done so we
can really have our date?

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.200
But I'm taking it seriously.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.790
I want him to-- my dad and I
used to have dates like that.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:49.470
I want my son to learn how
to treat a woman, or anybody,

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:51.780
by me spending that time
with him and showing him--

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.680
not just telling him.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.960
But we do it.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.490
We do it.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:57.450
And the last one we
saw was Superman.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.064
What's the name of
it? "Man of Steel."

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:00.730
I was a nervous.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.605
It was a little dark.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.410
who did Clark Kent first?

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:06.160
What was his name?

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.730
Michael Reeve?

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.306
Christopher Reeve.

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:12.170
I'm sold out for
Christopher Reeve.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.110
This new stuff-- that's when you
know you're getting older, too.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.850
Like, see this newfangled stuff.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.690
RYAN LOREN: So how
old are your kids?

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.190
AVERY SUNSHINE: My son is
11 and my daughter is 13.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.690
And my daughter,
she wrote a song

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:31.310
that's going to be on--
she and Musiq Soulchild.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.170
Yes.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.370
It's going to be an
interlude on the record.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.620
RYAN LOREN: That's incredible.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.160
AVERY SUNSHINE: It's nuts.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:37.940
And I played it.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.800
Well actually, she
played it for me.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.640
And we listened to
the track on my phone.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.300
And we recreated it for her.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.920
And when she heard it, she
was like, that's not right.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.240
So y'all need to do it again.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.490
RYAN LOREN: That's incredible.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.950
AVERY SUNSHINE: So I'm
excited about that.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:54.940
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.760
Last thing-- what was the
first CD you remember buying?

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.390
AVERY SUNSHINE: The first CD--
I don't remember buying one.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.200
But I remember-- I
tell you, it's strange.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.670
I remember CDs came out.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.400
And I remember
waking up one day,

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.730
and there were three
CDs at the house.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:17.160
There was the Yellowjackets
and my parents

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.090
had the Clark Sisters.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:24.890
And then there was one
more-- Kenny G. It was.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:25.540
What's the one?

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.450
The wedding song?

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:32.770
The sound quality from a tape
to CD made your head pop off.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.169
Am I the only one
that remembers that?

00:46:35.169 --> 00:46:35.710
To hear that?

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.006
Oh, what is it?

00:46:37.006 --> 00:46:38.830
It just felt like water.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.970
You just feel like it's
life to hear that sound.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.100
It was amazing to me.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.460
I remember those distinctly.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.030
I don't remember buying them.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.781
Just one day they
were at the house.

00:46:49.781 --> 00:46:51.530
RYAN LOREN: They have
a way of showing up.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.790
AVERY SUNSHINE:
They just showed up.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.420
But I remember those two
three CDs distinctly.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.120
And the sound was just amazing.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.370
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.690
Well, there's a fourth one
I'm looking very forward to.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.340
It is yours.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.730
So thank you for joining us.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.396
AVERY SUNSHINE: Thank
you so much, Ryan.

00:47:05.396 --> 00:47:06.790
It'd mean so much to me.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.606
Ya'll, I got to-- please
make some noise for Ryan.

00:47:10.606 --> 00:47:14.232
Because for all the artists
that are here tonight,

00:47:14.232 --> 00:47:18.340
it means so much for us to
be able to share what we do

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.910
and the way we want to do it.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.830
And we just don't have
the platform all the time.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.330
And I'm speaking for everybody.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:26.362
We are grateful.

00:47:26.362 --> 00:47:27.820
And we're grateful
that you're here

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.010
to listen and share with us.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.350
And we thank you because
you didn't have to.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.058
You could have said,
let me call Beyonce.

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:35.600
RYAN LOREN: I do sound like her.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.519
And I have her
number, of course.

00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:39.310
But yeah, I didn't.

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:39.940
AVERY SUNSHINE:
But you could have.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.950
You could call anybody.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:41.960
And you chose us.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.300
And I'm grateful.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.342
And we thank you so much.

00:47:44.342 --> 00:47:45.383
RYAN LOREN: And likewise.

00:47:45.383 --> 00:47:47.350
And there's a reason
I choose you guys.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:54.304
[APPLAUSE]
