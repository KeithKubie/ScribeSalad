00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.560
If you got these 2 correct, excellent work. We'll set up our rectangles as

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.372
usual. What we want to be careful about is working with these negative signs. I

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:12.972
know x times negative 4 is negative 4x, so these 2 areas will wind up being

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:17.912
negative. We also want to be careful when computing the last area. We have

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:23.199
negative 4 times negative 4, which is positive 16. If we add up our like terms

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.570
we'll have x squared minus 8 x plus 16. That's the total area or the product for

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.130
the first binomial. If we square the second binomial we'll get 9 x squared minus

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.429
6 x for the like terms, and plus 1.
