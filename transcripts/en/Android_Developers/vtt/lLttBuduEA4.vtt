ROMAIN MARDOT: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.885
So I'm not that great at
public speaking as Sarah.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm working as a
partner development

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.580
manager for the partners that
are based in central Europe

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.510
and Russia.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.640
I'm managing Playix,
Outfit7 Seven, NordCurrent,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.270
and many other guys.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.620
You know, every time I have
to do such a presentation,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.742
I'm like OK.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.200
I hope that the
next round at least

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
is not coming any time soon.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.070
And I'm not talking
only about Playtime.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.009
But then when I'm offered
with the possibility

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.649
I accept the change.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.190
One of the reasons
because I actually

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.400
like competing with myself.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.130
And we all know that
actually inside someone

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.160
by creating challenge
to him, he's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.739
more likely to participate.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.280
This is why actually
the presentation

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
is called there is a
competitor in every person,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.190
in every player.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.490
And we know that we
are managing players

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.200
When you actually
think about it,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.190
you know that the humanity and
people were always competitive,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.150
right?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.381
We always take part in different
contests, tournaments, wars.

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:08.880
actually.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.620
Even the video games,
by their nature,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.160
they are a pretty
competitive product.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.040
There is a challenge
in every game.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.300
They're just all different.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.170
So today, I will
talk about what do we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.220
mean by competitive gaming,
which is a bit more than just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.020
finishing a different level.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.020
Then we'll see how you can make
your game more competitive.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.010
We'll go through three cases--

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.040
is there something
wrong with the text or?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.060
No.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.670
We'll go through three
keys or features,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.882
let's say modes, that were
added to games by our partners,

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:51.090
many of them are in the room.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
Thank you very much for sharing
the case with us every time.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.060
It's really helpful.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.520
Then we'll check three
games that are very

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.220
competitive by their nature.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.490
Here, we have actually some
nice stats on guns and shooting.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.360
That should beat on
eSports, because this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.600
is in everyone's mind,
wrap up the presentation,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.760
and leave you the time to
ask questions if you have.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.730
So competitive gaming,
as I just mentioned,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.220
how is it different
in our mind than just

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.930
finishing a different level?

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.570
So for us, it's
something that is

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.410
more involved form of gaming.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.550
That is part of your
game that includes

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.370
the success, the
progress measurement,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.510
and the recognition
from your game design,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.070
and in many cases, prizes.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.920
We know that the competitive
gaming is actually

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.600
coming on mobile from PC.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.050
PC is still a good example
for many of our titles.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.880
It's still the most
lasting platform

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.020
in time with the most
spread games genres, still

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.300
the one that brings
the most revenue.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.370
It still has freemium and
premium distribution model.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.050
We have a lot of
hardcore titles that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.710
are just being sold without
having any subscription

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.750
or [INAUDIBLE] plans.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380
We know that the popularity
of competitive games

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.470
is still growing, on whether
they're just hardcore titles

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.490
or whether they are part
of the eSports like "League

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.230
of Legends" and other titles.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.310
And we know that thanks to the
strong word of mouth factor,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.180
those games are very popular.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.640
So this is what helping.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.600
Now if we compare it on
mobile, what we have?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.310
We know that this
trend is growing,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.280
but this trend is
having some changes.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.020
They are all listed here.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.870
First of all,
because the biggest

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.960
majority of competitive gamers
are free to play on mobile.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.740
It's pretty hard to balance
your customers spent

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.050
and the feeling that you
are doing something right.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.690
The equal chances to win.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.360
The form factor.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.470
Touch controls, pretty
hard to make them

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.080
really handy and competitive.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.560
Network issues, not always the
best connection to make you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.980
feel very immersed in your game.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.130
The game genres, not
always available.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.350
Not all types of
games are currently

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.149
available on mobile games.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.885
And every session lengths.

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.010
Depending on the game
generally, it's pretty short.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.000
So it's pretty hard to stick
someone to your product.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.280
We've been talking about
retention, all these changes

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.520
that you guys have in general.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.070
However, when we talked
about competitive gaming,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.560
we all know that
the level of mastery

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.630
is something that counts a lot.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.560
The more the player feels that
he's managing the processes--

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.230
the game-- the
more he's engaged.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.160
In fact, for us and in this
case, this is a synonym.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.150
So when brainstorming about
the competitive gaming,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.430
we were actually
asking ourselves

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.640
what additional
features or game modes

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.230
you can add to your game to
make them more competitive,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.980
considering the fact
that they are already

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.140
a competitive product.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.330
Making something competitive
more competitive, nice.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.680
OK then the captain
obvious jumps into the room

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.110
and says that's, OK the
more hardcore is your title,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.730
the more competitive It is.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.060
So one of the solutions that you
have is just simply designing--

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.280
if you don't have
a project yet--

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.960
a product that is more hardcore.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.780
The more hardcore it is,
the more competitive it is.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.160
Thanks, Mr. Captain.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.110
But then if you
already have a product

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.580
on whether it's casual or ready
mid-core or hardcore game,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.170
you can actually
improve it and make

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.860
it more competitive for the
players by adding features.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.920
Here it's just a
simple slide that

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.400
goes from the more
soft core features

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.450
that you can add to your
product to the most hardcore.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.910
We all know that league,
ladders, achievements,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.220
single PvE missions
are really good.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.930
They usually actually
help your players

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.780
discovering the content.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.620
You remember they
are not developers,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.660
they just play your game.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.660
Contests and co-op PvE can
be online for the contests,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.930
offline as well.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.080
co-op PvE there is
more engagement.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.300
This helps players
to socialize, to have

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.220
common goals to achieve.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.494
Then single player
and team player PvP

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:32.910
is one of the best
things that you

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.860
can do to engage your
players even more,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.050
to make them compete even more.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.690
And then when it's a single
player or team player

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.460
direct PvP because
we know that there

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.680
are a lot of games currently
running a sync PvP modes.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.920
This is in more hardcore.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.070
eSports, I'm just putting
it here for the moment,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.620
because obviously, then people
are asking, why you are not

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.060
talking about eSports.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.300
I will touch a bit on that
later in my presentation.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.400
So those are the modes, the
features that you can introduce

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.440
if you are lacking of ideas.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.970
So now I will go through
three cases of features

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.550
that were added to casual
mid-core games by our partners

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.920
and see what results
it has produced--

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.150
like kind of case studies.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.790
So here again,
thank you very much,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.980
guys for sharing the
information with us.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.810
We have three titles.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.130
One is "Cooking
Fever" by Nordcurrent,

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.640
"Talking" Tom Gold
Run by Outfit7,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.420
and "Nonstop Knight"
by Flaregames.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.020
I decided to put the three
products side by side,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.310
because I'm focusing on features
rather than on game design.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.740
We believe that
some ideas can be

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.140
easily interchangeable
between the products

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.430
if you want to make
them competitive.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.370
So what happened is
that in "Cooking Fever"

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.260
the partner has
other tournaments.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.210
Tournaments is a
feature where people

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.890
have to complete biggest
number of levels.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.620
And then the results
are being compared

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.420
between different players.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.840
In "Talking Tom Gold Run",
they introduced a PvE racing

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.490
contest.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.530
This game is a runner.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.450
And in this case, instead of
running against just the timer,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.000
you're running
against the machine.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.530
And then again, your
results are being compared.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.600
And what happened in
the "Nonstop Knight"

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.700
is that developer introduced
a massive boss fight

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.140
event, where people
have to come in groups

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.909
to fight different bosses.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.690
So they have to
plan accordingly.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.850
This feature is a
bit more hardcore.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.470
So what happened in the
end is that actually

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.870
all of these changes
had a great impact

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.960
on players' engagement
and the increase

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.950
of the daily active
users and people

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.880
who take part in the tournament
and the monetization metrics.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.080
We can see, for example,
that almost 300,000 people

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.260
took place in the mode
introduced to "Cooking Fever".

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.570
And actually 50% of
people get back to it.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.410
We can actually see that the
impact it had on the revenue

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:22.440
was of the same importance of
some level-ups and sales that

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.130
were conducted in
the game before.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.480
And actually, the developer
has reported that this event

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.710
can be recreated.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.640
And with time, producing
the same effect.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.720
In "Talking Tom Gold Run" here,
again, very successful case

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.085
where the users started
playing the game more,

00:09:39.085 --> 00:09:41.460
actually increasing the average
time spent by one minute.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.320
It's a lot.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.360
And they find a way on how
to oblige users to spend

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.670
more of their in-game currency.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.680
I know that
sometimes some of you

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.650
are having trouble actually
with how to wash out

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.250
this extra currency that
players managed to accumulate

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.690
and, therefore, are not
spending real money anymore.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.030
In the "Nonstop Knight",
the results actually

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.520
were pretty spectacular.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.370
The number of daily active
users has increased a lot.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:17.430
And the daily customer
spent has followed as well.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:23.370
So now if you are a
casual game developer,

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.850
and we take the pros
and cons and the data

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.120
that we have seen before, we
know that going casual gaming

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.620
is good.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.780
Because the games
have simple mechanics,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.910
because they have mass appeal,
low barrier of entry-- people

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.020
understand them easily and
they have good replay value.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.780
It's a lot of content that
people can play again.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.640
But in the same
time, you're probably

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.450
facing challenges like
the fact that they

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.100
are pretty easy to copy--

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.580
I'm not pretending that any
game can be copied but still--

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.490
that you are fighting with
other companies that probably

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:04.950
fight for the same customer as
you, and low conversion rate.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.660
So overall, if you
help people and players

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.120
with bringing them more common
challenges, socializing better,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.180
and track all the
progress, it should

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.350
help you increasing your
engagement and metrics overall.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.386
Well, this is at least what
our partners have tried.

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:27.510
This is in what we believe.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.330
And this is what we
decided to share with you.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.170
OK so this is for
the casual segment.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.640
Next part is about
mid-core, hardcore gaming.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.290
And as I mentioned, those three
titles I'll be talking about

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.020
are really about competition.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.400
The game design is
competitive by nature.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.750
So first product is
the one that people--

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.920
a lot of people are
currently staring at,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.410
because it's actually
pop up from nowhere.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.170
It is showing
incredible performance.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.740
And it's actually a very,
very cool game beyond all.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.000
So called "Last Game on Earth",
zombie PvP slash survivor,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.600
slash RPG crafting.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.030
Actually, this game
has everything in it.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.810
And when it was released and
started performing incredibly,

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.160
it was actually and is still
in the beta stage, kind of.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.150
Beta, beta is, you
know, a very handy term.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.710
So actually beta
is important here

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.010
because when the game was
released four months ago,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:40.370
it had only like 20% of features
that the partner managed

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.500
to implement, because
they were actually

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.930
a bit surprised by success
but at the same time, having

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.430
great plans.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.000
And just with this
20% of features

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.310
but with a good overview of
what is coming next in the game,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.150
they were able to obtain
incredible results.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:05.765
So those are like the first
metrics and actually thank you,

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:09.342
the partner never
minded actually sharing

00:13:09.342 --> 00:13:10.550
the full information with us.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.010
You will see actually the next
slides are pretty incredible.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.580
So currently, the
developer is working

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.940
on the introduction
of these modes that

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.200
are still not in the game.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.630
And they will be
actually focusing

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.150
a lot on the competition
and more players.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.200
And you can see that we have
a good range of different PvP

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:38.860
scenarios, co-op scenarios,
and direct PvP confrontation.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.860
So remember that I
just said that only 20%

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.470
of what was planned was
introduced to the game.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.100
And this is actually how
the daily active users

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.750
curve is behaving right now.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.470
So this is the real data
provided by the developer

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.580
since the game launch.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.100
So as you can see, the
number of daily active users

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.457
is pretty impressive.

00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.040
But what is actually
more impressive--

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.380
this is like the cherry
on the top of the cake--

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.190
is that revenue that this
currently generated by Android.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:14.540
And here again, this is
actually their achieved results.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.240
There is one key
takeaway actually would

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.980
like to take from this case.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.380
This is actually, as
I just mentioned it,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.390
what you actually show and
what you allow players to plan

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.680
can actually help you a lot
in terms of your further game

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.797
development choices.

00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:40.380
Even though if you
don't have the time

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.779
to implement everything
that you have planned,

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:46.570
try to work with the
community to show them

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.410
that this is coming by
any means that you have,

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.550
because this is important.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.280
Because if players they know
that this kind of content

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.330
is coming, they will gather
resources, invest their time,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.930
and plan accordingly.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.470
And this helps you actually
engaging them on a longer term.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.100
Two next cases.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:16.050
So during many
years, no one dared

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.430
to make a true first
person shooter mobile.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.490
But then we actually had
an industry veteran--

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.920
which is not presented
on this slide--

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.070
but somehow came up
with a crazy idea.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.680
I'm naming Mud Fingers and
their game called "The Trigger".

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.340
They decided to put out a
shooting in the first person

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.190
shooters so that we
don't have to fight

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.780
against your mobile phone.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.740
Every time you have an
enemy in your scope,

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.340
it shoots automatically.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.820
And actually, based on that, we
have two incredible developers

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.020
that made two really cool
first person shooters

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.630
and released them on Android.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.105
On the left, we
have "Monostrike"

00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:00.480
with actually a
pretty big number

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.990
of installs and "Guns Of Boom".

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:10.140
Both games feels differently,
but they feel very immersive.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.460
And they have
different settings.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.610
The left arm feels more
like "Counter-strike"

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.700
The right one feels to me
more like "Team Fortress."

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.555
Then it depends on what
kind gamer you are.

00:16:22.555 --> 00:16:24.180
Obviously, those
games, as I mentioned,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.690
they're competitive by nature.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.110
So they're already
inciting players

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.930
who love first person
shooters coming

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.000
to mobile to try them out.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.200
But in their current
development stage,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.120
both partners have chosen a
slightly different strategies

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.880
to people working
with their community.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.220
On one side-- actually, sorry.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.430
There is one slide missing.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.240
On one side,
"Monostrike" is keeping

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.310
on increasing the deepness
of the mastery of the weapons

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.579
and the feedback the players
get from the progress they

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.109
have in the game.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.690
Whereas, on the other
side, gaming side

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.579
are focusing a lot on
the work and the feedback

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.109
they get from the community.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.119
They put a big stress
on the tournaments

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.260
and the interactions the
players might have together--

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.440
how they compete
against each other.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.180
Besides, that,
actually, I would like

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.210
to put a special stress
on the whole work that is

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.040
being done with the community.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.070
Actually, you have
all the channels

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.920
that allow you to
broadcast your content

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.430
and share it with the players
that the partner is currently

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.330
using.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.880
The Video Hub section
is, for instance,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.070
introduced in the game.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.410
There is a lot of content
that is being created

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:59.030
on a daily basis by the
players using YouTube Gaming,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.930
YouTube overall, and
popular YouTube vloggers.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:13.080
Here again, different focus
but good results for both.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.740
While Azure Games
are focusing, as I

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.670
said, on the feedback
the players got

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.990
and the deepness
of their weapons,

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.600
they have pretty decent results.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.990
Every time they introduce
those features to the game,

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.610
they can be seen the left.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.700
While working hard
with the community,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.310
Game Inside have something--

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:37.670
that in my opinion-- is
very precious nowadays.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.850
We all know that the competition
is actually really strong

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.910
and the user
acquisition are growing.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.490
But designing a game that
can be promoted through other

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.700
means than just standard
user acquisition channels,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.190
and in this case, a
strong word of mouth.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.440
And this we mentioned
in our session

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.860
before, YouTube videos, that
can sometimes actually promote

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.750
your product much
better than any campaign

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.220
that you can design is
actually driving a lot of users

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.820
to this product, making it
overall very successful,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.150
creating stable users'
behavior, good retention,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.380
and overall, good revenue.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.540
So here again, if
we do the same size

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.760
as we did for the
casual games, we

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.310
know that if you haven't
decided that you decided

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.060
to go hardcore,
you should go there

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.230
because those kind
of games allow

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.580
you to attract different users.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.190
Because they are
more impressive,

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.180
they have more complex
control schemes,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.480
they allow you to
add more deepness.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.480
In the same time,
don't forget that you

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.500
will be always actually
competing with other platforms.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.840
As I mentioned at the
beginning of my presentation,

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.200
PC is still the one that is
the most hardcore and that

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.620
attracts the attention
from a lot of players.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.650
And then using the examples
that they have just given,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.030
you can use those tips to work
better with your community.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.170
The most important key
takeaway is the way

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.180
you work with the community.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.960
I know that on mobile,
it's pretty hard

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.960
to move your player from the
gaming process to a forum page

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.830
or to wherever else where you
have a message tailored to him.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.560
However, if the players know
that you care about them

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.951
and you tailor those messages
and constantly working on it,

00:20:29.951 --> 00:20:30.450
they come.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.658
They listen to your feedback.

00:20:31.658 --> 00:20:34.380
And they work with you,
which allows you much better

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.460
interactions.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.570
So never give up and
listen to you community,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.140
and share your information
about your plans.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.800
So we were talking about
competitive gaming.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.300
And actually, there is
the E-sports subject.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.190
You know, the eSports
on mobile reminds me

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.620
about like flying saucers.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.840
Everyone is talking
about, them but no one

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.470
has ever seen it, kind of.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.150
So what's the challenge
for eSports on mobile?

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.920
First, it's a good opportunity.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.840
We know according to
the super data stats--

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.630
and we actually don't even
need to get the statistic--

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.110
that this subject has an
enormous outreach potential.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.800
There are a lot of people
who watch tournaments.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.890
They take part in them,
they watch and play.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.880
They are like separate
and different groups.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.230
But on mobile, it's not
truly effective yet.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.310
Actually, I haven't heard anyone
like giving a proper definition

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.460
on what is eSport
on mobile so far.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:47.740
Probably because eSports on
mobile have these challenges.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.150
And they need to comply
with these things.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.440
So the game needs
to be free to win.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.070
Right?

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.630
If you want to have
a truly eSport title,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.340
it has to be free to win.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.750
Synchronous battles, I
think it's an obvious point.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.270
Actually, if you can make a
game that is playable in team,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.220
it will be a big plus.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.500
Show a certain level of mastery.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.850
Well, I guess we're
talking about eSports.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.700
So if it's just a
casual title, you

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.250
can't make it really
an eSport title.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.190
Last in time, we know that
once you create a community,

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.960
you have to always
feed with new content,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.770
new plans for tournaments,
new prizes, and so on.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.700
So if your product is not
respecting this point,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.050
you cannot call it
an eSport title.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.690
And one of the most
important things

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.950
is to get spectators'
attention, because if I offer

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.830
you like football tickets
to to a match of two teams

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.310
that you have never heard
about, you will probably

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.290
never go to see the game.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.380
But if it's Brazil
playing against France

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.660
and if you're not
even a football fan,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:56.420
you will probably go and see it
just for the check-box point.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.890
So here is the
challenge with which

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.130
the mobile game, in my
opinion, is fighting against.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.320
It's making sure that
the product that you're

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.410
designing for
being an eSport one

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.260
is interesting to
watch while being

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.895
played from a mobile device.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.490
If I would stop here, I think
I would leave an empty spot.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.800
But again, in my opinion, the
right games that are already

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.180
kind of switchable and
respect those rules,

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.700
I came up here with
three examples.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.110
But actually, if we looked
for them, we can find more.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.550
So those three titles
respect all the rules

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.025
and can potentially
become true eSport titles.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.960
What is also
interesting to know is

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.570
that we have a
couple of developers

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.540
that are working
on titles that will

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.320
be really interesting,
at least in terms

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.480
of the competitive gaming.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.580
I'm not sure on
whether they will

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.620
be able to put them
to eSport level.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.590
But I just wanted to share
with you on what is coming.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.640
I actually am gamer myself
and watching into this subject

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.690
very much.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.220
So we have at least
two cool titles

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.600
coming from War Gaming, which
one is "World of Tanks",

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.284
a World of Warships blitz.

00:24:22.284 --> 00:24:23.450
It's a big franchise coming.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.700
We have Wargaming in the room.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.780
Having actually seven versus
seven team battles, which

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.360
is pretty exceptional
immobile and this title

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.370
will be very
competitive by the way.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.650
And "Warfre" this
game is actually

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.920
coming in "StarCraft"
like ish setting,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.410
having direct PvP battles,
which is also kind of cool.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.950
And then we actually have two
really exceptional titles,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.080
one by the veteran
that I mentioned

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.310
at the very beginning.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.000
Those guys actually
doing an amazing job

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.640
in terms of bringing
triple A class

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.710
title on mobile,
where people will

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.470
be fighting in big MMO world.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.590
And actually, even the
most successful PvP players

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.620
will get statutes inside
the capital cities

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.820
as one of the factors
to motivate them.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.770
And then we have a very cool
"Second World War" title.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.610
So what can I tell more?

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.540
Actually, you know, we've
talked about competition.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.300
We talked about eSports.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.010
And we actually all know
that the augmented reality

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.660
is really trendy.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.220
And here again, we have partners
that are doing exceptional work

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.280
in this turn.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.130
And actually, I want
to share with you

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.580
a video that showcases
an ER mode that allows

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.370
you to spectate game matches.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.200
So if we can run
the video, please.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:31.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.875
Was supposed to be removed, OK.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.430
Well.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.210
So yeah.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.580
I hope that you were
inspired by this presentation

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.550
because I believe that
working a lot of with figures

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.590
and conversions, life is
a matter of conversion.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.730
So if by my speech I
converted to you today

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.800
to start to work on a
more competitive feature

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.150
in your game, we'll
get results soon.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.630
And the hardest part
is to go to start.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.780
Just to wrap up
the session, those

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.690
are, in my opinion, the
five most important points

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.360
that you should take away.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.150
Is that it's important to build
competitive modes in your game,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.790
but you have to choose the
level of competition that

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.740
depends on the player.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.740
Allowing-- and as I
mentioned-- the progress

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.300
showing the progress to
players is very important.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.950
Players, even on mobile, like
direct PvP if PS is trendy--

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.930
first person shooters--
there is still

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.300
some Room because there
is less competition.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.930
But a big pool of
partners are coming.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.630
When designing competition
features, still bear in mind

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.480
the montenization.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.080
Because if you
increase engagement

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.162
but it doesn't have
an impact on the way

00:27:47.162 --> 00:27:48.870
you monetize your
players, you will still

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.330
have some homework to do.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.110
And the cool game design
and cool game features

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.090
nowadays will allow
you to promote

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.910
your game through other
channels than just

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.900
paid user acquisition.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.130
So I hope that this
was interesting.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.650
And now I am ready to answer
your questions if you have

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.200
any.
