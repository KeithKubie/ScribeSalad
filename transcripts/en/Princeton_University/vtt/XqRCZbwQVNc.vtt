00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200
TV REPORTER: Princeton
University, in Princeton, New

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.010
Jersey, today announced the
end of it's all-male

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.880
educational tradition.


00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.680
SUSAN CRAIG SCOTT: They made
the final decision to admit

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.730
women to the university, not
just to admit women to the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.680
university, but to do it within
the next eight months.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.190
MARSHA LEVY-WARREN: Arriving on
campus in 1969, there was a

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.510
tremendous amount of hubbub.


00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.920
SUSAN CRAIG SCOTT: And as soon
as we heard that that was what

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.290
was going to happen, we among
ourselves decided that we

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.730
would apply.


00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.290
MAE WONG MILLER: When
we arrived on campus

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.490
there was no housing.


00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.410
MARSHA LEVY-WARREN: It felt like
a small group of women on

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.370
a male campus.


00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.110
CAROL BROWN: The university was
ready for co-education but

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.830
still adjusting.


00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.060
MARSHA LEVY-WARREN: Most of the
precepts I was in, I was

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.950
usually the only female
in the room.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.060
I say in the room because, of
course, there weren't a lot of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.700
female faculty members, either,


00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.330
although there were some.


00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.230
And they were very
important to us.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.770
NANCY MALKIEL: They had systems,
if you will, for

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.460
understanding what to do about
spouses who were women, but

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.320
the, what do we do if it's a
woman faculty member with a

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.320
male spouse, nobody knew how
to reckon with that.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.360
MARSHA LEVY-WARREN: The impetus
was to have a place

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.480
for us that felt
defined by us.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.950
It was extremely important to
just meet and talk-- and talk

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.270
from the heart--


00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.720
about what it was like to be
a woman, for it to be 1969,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.500
1970, 1971.


00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.450
The Vietnam War was about and
feminism was really taking

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.410
hold in a different way, and
we wanted to talk about

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.830
politics and personal
lives and how we

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.710
envisioned our futures.


00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.190
JUANITA JAMES: So much happened
in a relatively short

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.460
period of time from us coming
in as the vanguard to being

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.800
involved with every aspect of
the fabric of university life,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.050
and in leadership roles.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.860
CAROL BROWN: We were definitely
a class of women

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.200
who were there ready to
take on the world.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.610
The active female athletes were
a mix of what might have

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.400
been labeled feminists, but most
of us were just saying,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.340
hey, I want to do this and
there's no reason I shouldn't

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.470
be allowed to, and
I'm not going to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.000
take no for an answer.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.440
ANNE CHENG: I think the reason
why my works focus so much on

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.380
race and gender and how they
intersect is because not only

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.080
do they intersect, they're
very parallel.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.430
You know, this question of, how
does a woman come to find

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.100
her own voice and a place in
the world, is to me very

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.590
intimately tied into the
question of how you go from

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.080
being an immigrant
to a citizen.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.440
think that the difficult thing
is to assimilate, but to do so

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.340
in a way that you can still
hold on to who you are.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.400
JESS DEUTSCH: I think that the
male-female ratio was moving

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.490
toward more balance while I was
an undergraduate, so as

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.210
women I think we felt
we could pretty much

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.460
do anything on campus.


00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.300
We certainly hoped for more
female administrators,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.320
faculty, and coaches as mentors,
but basically, I

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.020
think we knew that we belonged
to Princeton and that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.040
Princeton belonged to us.


00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.890
PATRICE JEAN: For women in the
sciences, especially in the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.280
department of molecular
biology, it was

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.040
actually quite fantastic.


00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.570
There were several very young
established and accomplished

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.510
professors, including at the
time Professor Shirley

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.280
Tilghman, now President
Tilghman.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.440
JUANITA JAMES: I don't think
I would have imagined as an

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.410
undergraduate that in my
lifetime I would live to see a

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.240
woman become president of
Princeton University.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.300
MALE SPEAKER: To the
best of my ability.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.400
SHIRLEY TILGHMAN: To the
best of my ability.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.980
NANCY MALKIEL: To have a faculty
member like that so

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.800
admired and so well known across
the campus be selected

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.550
as president was simply
exhilarating.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.760
And to have it be a woman.


00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.460
SHIRLEY TILGHMAN: Well, I think
the significance for me

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.660
was not as a woman or even
as the first woman

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.370
president of Princeton.


00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.240
I was really focused from the
instant I knew that I was

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.230
going to be president, and I'm
trying to be the very best

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.770
president I could be.


00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.590
But I do understand completely
that for many others it had a

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.750
deep significance.


00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.990
We had a long and storied
history in which we were

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.450
largely a male institution.


00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.290
Women had, as you know, had
arrived on campus relatively

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.390
recently, given our long
history, and therefore I think

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.190
for many there was a
significance to having the

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.480
first woman president.


00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.240
CAROL BROWN: We knew we'd
been picked to lead.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.650
We weren't sure what we were
going to lead or where we were

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.250
going to lead, but we were ready
to take on anything.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.020
JUANITA JAMES: I credit my
Princeton experience for

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.000
turning me into a leader.


00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.930
MAE WONG MILLER: Life on an
all-male campus was easier

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.190
than going into a male-dominated
work world.

ADDIE MICIR: Princeton is full
of women who are very set in

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.210
what they want and their ideas,
and it's great to see

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.920
them in leadership positions
all throughout campus.

NORMA LOPEZ CAMPOS: My favorite
thing about Princeton

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.690
has been its people.


00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.600
And yeah, a lot of those people
have been women, and I

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.660
don't think I would have stepped
up to the leadership

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.640
positions that I have if it
had not been for the past

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.360
leaders that came before me.


00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.380
ADDIE MICIR: The women speak
their mind here on campus, and

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.110
it's been a great experience
all around.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.250
SHIRLEY TILGHMAN: I think
Princeton is a place that has

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.850
the capacity to empower
students.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:40.010
We want students to arrive on
this campus already prepared

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.540
to be stimulated, to be
challenged, but for me the

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.200
most important thing is when
they graduate they feel

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.870
empowered, ready to take on
the world, ready to make a

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.990
difference in the world.


00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.520
And I hope that as much for our
women students as I do for

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.150
our male students.


00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.800
We're going to need them all in
the future, and that's what

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.260
our job has to be going
forward at Princeton.
