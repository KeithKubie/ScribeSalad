00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.329
- [Voiceover] In a previous video,

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.716
we gave an overview of the
light dependent reactions

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:07.346
which are essentially occurring
across the thyla or within

00:00:07.346 --> 00:00:10.089
or across the thylakoid membranes,

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.081
right that we zoomed in on one

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:14.777
and we saw okay we have
some energy from light

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:18.500
exciting the electrons
within that chlorophyll pair,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.540
that P680 chlorophylled A pair.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.211
That electron, that energized electron

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.865
will then be transferred
from one molecule to another

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.904
and as it does so it will go to

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:30.583
lower and lower energy states.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.728
And that released energy,
some of it will be used

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.412
to transfer hydrogen
protons across the membrane.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.993
And then eventually that
electron will make it's way to

00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:43.948
Photo System I where it
can get excited again.

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:45.829
If we think of it as the same electron.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.197
It doesn't necessarily have
to be the exact same electron.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:50.539
But we can think of that same electron

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.123
as being excited again by light energy

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:54.706
and then it can once again go to

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.128
lower and lower energy states

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.164
and this time it's going to be used

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:00.664
to reduce NADP+ to NADPH.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.141
Now NADPH itself is an
input into the Calvin Cycle.

00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:10.001
But ATP is another input we
need for the Calvin Cycle

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.965
and the way that we produce ATP

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.016
is that hydrogen ion concentration

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:16.756
that increases on the inside due to it

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:19.406
being essentially pumped
across the membrane,

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.938
as well as the leftover hydrogen ions

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:24.791
from the water after it's
stripped of electrons,

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:27.862
to replace that originally
excited electron

00:01:27.862 --> 00:01:31.099
in that P680 chlorophyll pair.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.728
Well that increased
hydrogen ion concentration

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:37.144
can be used to drive ATP synthase

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:41.341
which creates ATP from phosphate and ADP.

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.705
And we saw it, we saw that over here,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.907
without seeing the different components.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:49.260
You get light, excite the electron.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.440
The electron goes to lower
and lower energy states.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.253
As it does so it's going from

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:55.528
Photo System II to Photo System I.

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:57.018
Some of that energy is being used to

00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:00.685
pump hydrogen ions into
the thylakoid lumen.

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.997
Then that electron can get excited again

00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:05.813
and then as it gets transferred

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.768
and goes to lower and lower energy states,

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:11.144
it can be used to produce NADPH

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:13.071
where once again it's electrons

00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:14.691
are still at a fairly high energy state

00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.800
so it's a strong reducing agent.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.780
And so that's why it's
valuable in the Calvin Cycle.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.688
That energy from acting
as a strong reducing agent

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.631
can be used to, or help in the creation

00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:28.947
or the eventual creation of the sugar.

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:30.614
And once again where as an electron,

00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:32.414
once it gives it away,
how does it get replaced?

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:35.011
Well it snags it from the water.

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.014
What I have here is a
more detailed diagram

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:40.196
that labels some of the actors

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.793
and the important thing is
really what we just covered

00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:44.914
and what we covered in more
detail in the previous video.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.112
The conceptual idea of what's happening

00:02:47.112 --> 00:02:48.983
in the light dependent reactions.

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:50.879
But a lot of times in your biology class

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.079
or in your biology book,

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.728
you'll see talk of things
like a cytochrome complex

00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:58.964
and plastoquinone and things like that

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:02.012
and I want you to look at that right now

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:03.731
so you're not intimidated when you see it

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.852
and that you see that these are

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.078
just the actors that we talked about.

00:03:07.078 --> 00:03:10.056
So right over here,
this is Photo System II,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.556
and what you have,

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.302
and I give credit for where
this image comes from.

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:17.133
It's modified from The
Light Dependent Reactions of

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.392
Photosynthesis Figure
8 by OpenStax College.

00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:24.225
But this right over here,
we see the light is,

00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:28.523
the light is interacting
the way it's depicted here,

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:30.988
not directly with the chlorophyll pair

00:03:30.988 --> 00:03:35.155
within Photo System II that,
that P680 chlorophyll A pair.

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:40.989
We see it acting on some of
these neighboring molecules

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.917
as their electrons get excited

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:44.523
and then go to lower energy levels,

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:47.636
that energy can be used to
excite neighboring electrons.

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:49.052
This kind of keeps happening.

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:50.917
That energy gets transferred eventually

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.334
to excite the electron in that P680 pair

00:03:56.484 --> 00:04:00.352
and then that electron, the
first electron acceptor,

00:04:00.352 --> 00:04:02.173
you'll see this sometimes spoken of

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:04.872
in your biology textbooks, is pheophytin.

00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:09.847
And that can then transfer
the electron to plastoquinone,

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:12.530
and that plastoquinone is interacting

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.295
in this cytochrome complex

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:17.143
which transfers the
electron from plastoquinone

00:04:17.143 --> 00:04:20.694
to plastocyanin and as it's doing it

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:23.193
you see the hydrogen
ions being transferred

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.510
from the outside of the thylakoid

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.976
to the inside of the thylakoid,

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.007
which is exactly what
we've been talking about.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:32.491
And then as we go to Photo System I.

00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:34.960
Well that electron can
be transferred from the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.127
plastocyanin to the chlorophyll
pair, the P700 chlorophyll.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:44.681
That can get excited again.

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:46.346
Once again, it doesn't have to be

00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:47.959
the light directly exciting it.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:50.919
It can be exciting other molecules within

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.502
the Photo System I,

00:04:54.948 --> 00:04:57.041
but that energy eventually
gets transferred

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:00.797
to that chlorophyll,
excites it's electrons

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:03.476
and then it goes from
one molecule to another.

00:05:03.476 --> 00:05:06.426
Eventually goes to ferredoxin

00:05:06.426 --> 00:05:08.796
which is being used in conjunction.

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:12.037
It's one of the actors that the

00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:16.204
enzyme NADP+ reductase
needs along with NADP+.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.045
So it's essentially just reducing NADP+

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:23.995
along with this electron that's

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:26.912
on the ferrodoxin to produce NADPH.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:29.879
And once again what's going on here?

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.536
Well this is the ATP synthase

00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:34.696
that is using all this increased
hydrogen ion concentration

00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:36.571
on the inside of the thylakoid

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:39.071
to pump or to power the motor,

00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:44.529
or the ATP synthase is
the motor that is powered

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.726
as these hydrogen ions go down
their concentration gradient.

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:51.692
And that energy is used
to jam the phosphate

00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.546
on to the ADP to produce ATP.

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:56.575
So I've said essentially the same thing

00:05:56.575 --> 00:05:59.798
two or three times already in
the last two or three videos

00:05:59.798 --> 00:06:02.224
but I was doing it because
when you first see this

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:04.711
it seems very very intimidating
and very very complex,

00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:06.543
and it is complex, and
frankly it's amazing

00:06:06.543 --> 00:06:08.059
that things like this are happening

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.056
on the plant that I'm looking at

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:11.826
outside my window right now.

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:15.314
It boggles my mind that this kind of

00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:17.525
thing is happening in nature.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.848
And there are bits and pieces of it

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:21.861
that aren't fully understood yet

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.945
and still need to be discovered.

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:26.191
But at the same time the general idea

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:28.871
is not as intimidating
as these diagrams appear.

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.879
So hopefully you find this
awe inspiring, like I do.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.991
And not as intimidating as what

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:36.872
some of these words might
make you feel initially.
