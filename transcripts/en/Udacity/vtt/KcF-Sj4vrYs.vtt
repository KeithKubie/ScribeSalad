00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.820
So far, we've been talking about taking
over part of the user's home screen

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.750
with widgets.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.970
Meaning that they trade their
precious home screen space for

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.742
more information from Sunshine.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.280
A useful trade off for me, and maybe for

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.350
many others but there's another element
on the home screen we haven't looked at,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.580
the background of the home screen,
called the wallpaper.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.430
Could we use the wallpaper as a passive
way to bring weather information

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.730
to the user?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.580
Yes, we can.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.350
Now, the type of information
we can provide for

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.940
wallpaper is somewhat
different from a widget.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.380
Colored icons and text don't exactly
scream most beautiful background ever to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.815
me but what we can do is make beautiful
backgrounds into the weather.

00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:46.960
A sunny picture for a sunny day,
a snowy picture for wintertime fun,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.356
and some ominous rain clouds for
when an umbrella's a good idea.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:54.460
Sounds neat but
how would you actually do it?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.410
What about pictures that are too bright,
making the text or icons hard to read?

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.480
How can we build something like
this without becoming an expert

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.060
on dynamically changing wallpapers?

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.670
Sometimes, you do have
to become an expert but

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
just as many times, some good Google
fu might reveal the perfect library or

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.710
the perfect app that makes
your job much, much easier.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880
It just so happens,
this is one of those cases.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.560
There's already a live wallpaper
app out there called Muzei

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.640
that provides an extensible
system Sunshine can plug into

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.110
to build our dynamic weather wallpapers.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.120
So how does that even work?
