00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
He's tall, I'm short get over it. *laughs*

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.480
'Sup guys? I'm King of Random.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm Collins Key

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.400
And today we're making RAINBOW instant ice

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.800
So a lot of people have seen my video on

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.300
making instant ice, I did it about 4 years ago on my channel.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.380
It blew up on my channel, a lot of people have done it since.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.000
But I've never seen anybody try using food coloring to change the color of the water itself.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.100
So that's what we've got here today, we've got five different colors of the rainbow.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.300
The challenge is, can we make colored water, get it to the right temperature, and freeze it all at once?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.600
That is the question, what do you think?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.680
Yeah, I think we can.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm here with The King Of Random, bro. Like if anyone can do it, this guy can right here, so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.400
I couldn't do it but I'm pretty confident.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.880
The first time I saw the instant ice it reminded me of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.220
real magic, and for me, like I'm a magician I do magic

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.040
and stuff and it blew my mind I thought at first

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.980
it was a trick, I'm like, "How does this work?", and then

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.060
when I saw your video, I'm like, "Oh, I want to do this!".

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.420
Well, I did it and I could not get it to work, it was literally

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.620
just water or as an icicle every single time.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.280
So today, I think we're actually gonna be able to like,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.260
figure out this sorcery and be able to do it.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.960
one thing i never told to you guys that this trick was inspired

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.660
inspired when I was working in the airlines.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.200
There was an airport we used to park at and one of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
the pilots would put water bottles on the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.380
dashboard of the cockpit and leave them overnight and

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.760
when we'd come back in the morning, he'd flick them,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760
and the whole water bottle would freeze, and that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.680
began the journey into figuring out how we can make

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.580
this happen at home.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.380
Now you know. *GYAH* *laughs*

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.100
So here's the plan guys.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.680
We just went down to the grocery store, we picked up

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.980
a couple of water bottles,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.260
now these are just regular water bottles

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.180
you get right off the shelf.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.620
They haven't been opened yet but we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.200
did take the labels off.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.420
Not sure if that takes the magic out but

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.840
we wanted you to see the full effect.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620
Now we also went to the store and picked up a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.520
variety of food colorings here,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.240
we're going to be filling the waters with to create create the rainbow effect.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.520
So here's the thinking guys, originally we thought it was because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.440
the water was so pure that it would crystalize.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.619
But, after I made this trick with soda,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.760
inspired by a vending machine in Hong Kong,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.200
I thought maybe we should try adding food coloring

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.800
to to see if that would have any effect.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.340
So here's the premise of our experiment today.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.460
We're gonna take one of these beautiful water bottles, from the store,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.900
unopened, we're gonna crack the caps, add 4 drops of food coloring to each one

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.840
of these bottles, set them in the freezer, for anywhere from 3 to 4 hours, because apparently,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.900
that's how long your freezer takes.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.860
My freezers weak man, his freezer takes 90 minutes, mine takes

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.180
like 4 hours, fam.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.660
Then we're gonna bring them out, pour them in a tray of crushed ice, and see if we can achieve the effect

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.240
comparable to an ice rainbow, forming right before your eyes.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.700
Never tried this before, not sure it will work,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.980
but we're putting it to the test today for you.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.100
So here we go Collins, let's grab some water bottles and bust some caps.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.500
*music*

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.600
Oooh, it made like a, purple ink ring

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.200
and then the second one shot straight through it.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.660
(counting) 1,2,3,4

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.320
*music continuing*

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.660
*laughing*

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.060
All we need to now is just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.940
toss these in the freezer, for about 3 hours, and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.980
just see the magic that happens.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.202
Hey guys real quick intermission,

00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:00.960
we filmed a video over on Collins' channel where we took gallium

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.100
and we made liquid metal fidget spinners.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.180
So if you wanna see that, it was crazy, we lit them on fire,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.380
we spun them, you can guess what happened next

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.880
but you're gonna have to go to his channel to check it out.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.000
I got a link for you down in the description, go check it out.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.580
Collins Key everybody.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.820
He's got a channel you don't wanna miss.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.860
Family friendly, good fun content.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.300
As of this moment in time right now,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.880
his channel is actually the number one, fastest growing

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.400
on youtube. It's absolutely amazing.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.660
Go check him out, go subscribe, ring the bell

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.800
and while you're at it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.080
if you haven't subscribed to this channel,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.680
subscribe to this channel, and ring the bell. Okay?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.080
So quick update guys,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.260
we just checked the bottles

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.140
and they are starting to freeze.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.720
So, we're gonna go grab some and bring them over here

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.180
and carefully take the tops off.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.640
and pour them in this bin of crushed ice

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820
and see who can actually draw

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.140
a frozen rainbow.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.280
Almost like literally. *laughing*

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.580
Let's go get the bottles!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.520
Let's do it!

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.220
Okay, we got the bottles out of the fridge,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.860
here we go

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.080
we only got about 30 seconds

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.880
because they're warming back up, we have to be

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.080
very careful taking these tops off so we dont

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.520
accidentally freeze them .

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.740
You can see bottles are actually well below the freezing point of water right now.
