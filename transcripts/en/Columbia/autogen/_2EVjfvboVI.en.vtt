and that's where we find ourselves in a
 

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:18.630
and that's where we find ourselves in a
more difficult position if we were to

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640
more difficult position if we were to
 

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.240

the surrounding countries it's there but
 

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:36.100
the surrounding countries it's there but
not in Turkey so we have this this

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:36.110
not in Turkey so we have this this
 

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:38.740
not in Turkey so we have this this
dependence on importing energy

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:38.750
dependence on importing energy
 

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:42.520
dependence on importing energy
ninety-eight percent we import some of

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:42.530
ninety-eight percent we import some of
 

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:50.530
ninety-eight percent we import some of
the gas we import comes from Iran now if

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:50.540
the gas we import comes from Iran now if
 

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.910
the gas we import comes from Iran now if
we were to go beyond the UN sanctions

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920
we were to go beyond the UN sanctions
 

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.640
we were to go beyond the UN sanctions
and were to become part of those other

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:57.650
and were to become part of those other
 

01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:00.790
and were to become part of those other
sanctions then the situation that will

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:00.800
sanctions then the situation that will
 

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:07.960
sanctions then the situation that will
arise will be such that we will have to

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:07.970
arise will be such that we will have to
 

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.980
arise will be such that we will have to
pay ten billion dollars to Iran and

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:11.990
pay ten billion dollars to Iran and
 

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:14.440
pay ten billion dollars to Iran and
before the gas that we get but Iran is

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:14.450
before the gas that we get but Iran is
 

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:16.780
before the gas that we get but Iran is
going to pay nothing back on the one

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:16.790
going to pay nothing back on the one
 

01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:22.720
going to pay nothing back on the one
hand we will have import and no export

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:22.730
hand we will have import and no export
 

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:26.170
hand we will have import and no export
and our foreign trade deficits will

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:26.180
and our foreign trade deficits will
 

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.210
and our foreign trade deficits will
stand then at ten billion dollars and

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:28.220
stand then at ten billion dollars and
 

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.750
stand then at ten billion dollars and
beyond it could be more because guess we

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760
beyond it could be more because guess we
 

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.300
beyond it could be more because guess we
have an increasing demand for guests

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:34.310
have an increasing demand for guests
 

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:36.040
have an increasing demand for guests
because we have a growing economy and we

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:36.050
because we have a growing economy and we
 

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:38.380
because we have a growing economy and we
get our gas not only from Iran we get it

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:38.390
get our gas not only from Iran we get it
 

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:42.000
get our gas not only from Iran we get it
from Iraq from other countries too so

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.010
from Iraq from other countries too so
 

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.710
from Iraq from other countries too so
these also have to be taken into

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720
these also have to be taken into
 

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:51.940
these also have to be taken into
consideration our policies must also

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:51.950
consideration our policies must also
 

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:53.650
consideration our policies must also
take into consideration our national

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:53.660
take into consideration our national
 

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.470
take into consideration our national
interests as well having said that

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480
interests as well having said that
 

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.310
interests as well having said that
however this does not mean that we take

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:00.320
however this does not mean that we take
 

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.560
however this does not mean that we take
the nuclear issue lightly because if

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:02.570
the nuclear issue lightly because if
 

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:06.670
the nuclear issue lightly because if
your neighbor has nuclear weapons I'm

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680
your neighbor has nuclear weapons I'm
 

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.880
your neighbor has nuclear weapons I'm
not saying that Iran is definitely

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:08.890
not saying that Iran is definitely
 

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:11.440
not saying that Iran is definitely
making nuclear weapons weapons but this

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:11.450
making nuclear weapons weapons but this
 

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.850
making nuclear weapons weapons but this
is an issue on the discussion there are

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:12.860
is an issue on the discussion there are
 

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.680
is an issue on the discussion there are
concerns about this and that's why we're

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:14.690
concerns about this and that's why we're
 

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:16.600
concerns about this and that's why we're
having all this discussion about Iran

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:16.610
having all this discussion about Iran
 

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:18.640
having all this discussion about Iran
what I'm saying is that if there is

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:18.650
what I'm saying is that if there is
 

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:20.980
what I'm saying is that if there is
nuclear weapons in any neighboring

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:20.990
nuclear weapons in any neighboring
 

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:23.250
nuclear weapons in any neighboring
country then the greatest threat

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:23.260
country then the greatest threat
 

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.430
country then the greatest threat
emanating from that presence would be to

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440
emanating from that presence would be to
 

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.750
emanating from that presence would be to
neighboring countries and not two

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760
neighboring countries and not two
 

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.970
neighboring countries and not two
continents far away it's like two

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980
continents far away it's like two
 

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.190
continents far away it's like two
friends if one of them has a pistol and

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200
friends if one of them has a pistol and
 

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.990
friends if one of them has a pistol and
the other one doesn't you wouldn't feel

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000
the other one doesn't you wouldn't feel
 

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.160
the other one doesn't you wouldn't feel
comfortable if you're the one who

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.170
comfortable if you're the one who
 

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:38.990
comfortable if you're the one who
doesn't have the pistol

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000
doesn't have the pistol
 

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.640
doesn't have the pistol
so that's why turkey has is not a

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:46.650
so that's why turkey has is not a
 

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.050
so that's why turkey has is not a
country that shows any tolerance

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:48.060
country that shows any tolerance
 

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.240
country that shows any tolerance
whatsoever to at the presence of nuclear

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:50.250
whatsoever to at the presence of nuclear
 

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.850
whatsoever to at the presence of nuclear
weapons in its neighborhood to go even

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:52.860
weapons in its neighborhood to go even
 

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.770
weapons in its neighborhood to go even

this is actually a package a

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200
this is actually a package a
 

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.770
this is actually a package a
comprehensive approach and that has to

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780
comprehensive approach and that has to
 

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.970
comprehensive approach and that has to
be taken up once again and we must work

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980
be taken up once again and we must work
