00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
My name is Alex Roberts, and we're at the National Videogame Arcade,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.220
and I'm an engineer here.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.000
So this is "Mission Control".

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.780
This was my first project, when I very first started working here.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.840
Just before we opened last year.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.460
uhm. Its a bit of a monstrosity

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.360
It is a game designed to show people how games are made,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.060
and give, kids the opportunity to interact with

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.500
the game and change the things in the game, whilst their playing the game.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.940
There's two players with Nintendo 64 controllers.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.660
Um.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.180
Its a really simple game where, you're a character

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900
and you have to get pickups, and avoid enemies.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.100
And collect as many, get as many points as you can

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.680
and beat the other player.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.440
Uhm. But whilst you're doing that people can,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.100
draw enemies over here

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.760
and there is a drawing station

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.940
where you can draw a picture with a white board marker.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.160
Sean - Let's have a picture, come on let's have an enemy.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200
Alex - Okay so, we can have an alien.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.600
Uhm.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.400
With a smiley face, and then we can scan it.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.880
Oops, sorry. Scan it like that.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.180
It's come up there, press it again.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.440
That's now in the game.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.480
So when they start the game that will be one of the enemies that appears,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.960
almost immediately.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.620
Uhm.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.800
Then round here, you can change all the effects in the game,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.100
So we've got whether you're screen is wrapping,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.780
or you're going to bounce of the sides.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.620
The background, turn the liquid mesh, On or Off.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.680
You can change the fonts in the game as well,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.980
So there is a bunch of effects there.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.480
Sean - Have you got a Comic Sans?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.140
Alex - We don't have Comic Sans,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.080
don't worry its fine. It's fine.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.820
Uhm.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.140
You can change what you're going to be picking up,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.240
So one minute you're picking up cherries,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.840
the next minute you're trying to collect stars, or cubes.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.840
Or rings.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.400
Uhm, and the rate at which they spawn.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.580
And you can also manually spawn things into the game.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.260
So if your friend is near,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.200
Uh, pick up, you can quickly spawn another one

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.280
they can quickly get that one as well.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.920
Also on the player, you can choose from our

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.040
preset selections, what your sprite is going to look like.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.300
So at the moment you're the white character.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.540
You can change colors so you're the red character.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.440
So we just changed the color of it,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.940
and now we can actually, just go

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.620
Oh, I don't want it to look like that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.080
I'm gonna pick one of the presets

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.540
Now it says: N V A, instead.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.620
But actually I don't want to see that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.880
I'm going to make it say...

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.920
something else.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.400
Ah so.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.560
On Father's day we had "Dad"

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.040
was a popular one

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.660
So you change the D, and then we've got D A.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.560
Then we can change that as well.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.860
So this is the Novation launch pads.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.800
So it's um MIDI controller these.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.660
That we've re-housed

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.780
Behind in our massive console of stuff

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.620
Sean - So you've literally pressed the buttons there

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.680
that'll turn the pixels on and off, yeah?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.040
Alex - So you can see that, that now says D V D, at the moment.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.280
So now it's an alien, and we can change what that aliens going to looks like.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.960
And you have that for both players,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.280
so you have three frames of animation

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.080
So you're showing kids a bit about what animation is,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.860
and kind of just getting them to,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040
consider all of these different things,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.160
all of these things have to be thought about

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.360
when you're talking about making a game

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.280
Uhm.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.480
So this is a really clear demonstration, of those things.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.120
Uhm.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.660
And then you can see if you start playing.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680
The player has gone to manual mode

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.020
and now I'm in control

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.260
Where as Player 2 is still being controlled by the AI.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.580
There's also some sound effects that can be changed around here.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.180
So you can change the sound volume.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.600
And if we start the game, we can change what track is gonna play, while you're playing.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.800
Erm.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.300
You can take a photo, or you can draw

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.680
a picture on our blackboard

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.720
And then take a photo and it'll become the background of the game.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.960
Sean - So hows it work behind the scenes?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
So we've seen some nice interfaces for people,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.540
but what's going on behind the scenes?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.040
Alex - So, it is, um

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.320
a lot of different things, so the main technology,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.560
is actually all connected via MIDI

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.880
Ah, cause' thats kind of what we knew,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.400
when we very first started.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.220
Now, we'd make it entirely different way

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160
and that is eventually going to be the plan.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.940
But like I said this was kind of the first big project

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.680
that we did when we got here.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.560
So each one of these screens

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.140
is a Raspberry Pi.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.700
So that just displaying a webpage

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.340
that's being served from a web server.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.880
Which talks to the Unity game, which is the game running in the background.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.160
Then each of the stations is controlled with a Teensy,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.860
which is a little bit like an Arduino.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.420
And then we've obviously got a PC running the Unity game in the background.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.440
Yeah, people really enjoy playing with it,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.300
but also it's really nice when people come in

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.860
and they get why its there.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.940
When people come in and go

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.980
"Aw yeah, look you can change all the things"

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.200
and see how a game is put together,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.260
in that way. That's what we were trying to do!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.220
Uhm.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.740
So thats really nice.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.760
[Music]

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.880
You must immediately get Gangbeasts,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.120
It's been made in Sheffield,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.460
It's a kind of drunk, jelly babies

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.220
fighting in a car park, physics brawler.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.840
Uh, game, by a company called Boneloaf

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.540
[Changed Voice, others in the background]

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.800
This particular server has four

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Titan X graphics cards, in it.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.920
A Titan X is one of the foremost graphics cards

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.360
there are new generation ten.
