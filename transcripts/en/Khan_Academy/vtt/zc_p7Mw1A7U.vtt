00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:01.771
- [Narrator] We finished the last video

00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:04.218
with the assassination of Julius Caesar

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:07.635
on the Ides of March, March 15th, 44 BCE.

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.122
And you might remember,

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:15.978
it was done by factions
opposed to Julius Caesar

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:18.700
who that one, he had
gotten too much power,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.838
but even more, he was using
that power to, in a lot of ways,

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:22.953
at least from their point of view,

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:26.007
undermine their authority,
that he was a populist,

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.424
and as a populist he was undermining

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:31.485
the power of the aristocracy.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:34.729
And so they get together
and they assassinate him.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.003
Now you can imagine

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.805
that all sorts of turmoil
emerges from that.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.991
At the time of the assassination,

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:46.499
Julius Caesar and Mark
Antony are co-consuls.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.225
You might remember Mark Antony
from the previous video,

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:51.739
one of Julius Caesar's generals in Gaul.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.949
He was also put in charge
of the Italian Peninsula

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.458
when Julius Caesar went to
go and take on his opponents,

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.541
take on Pompey in Greece.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.226
And so Mark Antony is the
remaining consul, and he says,

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.351
"Well, what do I do?

00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:07.859
"Do I immediately try to
punish these conspirators?"

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.224
In particular, you have Brutus,

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:13.995
Brutus and Cassius, who were considered

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:17.081
two of the leaders of the
conspiracy, and he decides

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:20.594
instead of putting the
Senate into further turmoil,

00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:22.947
he tries to have a little
bit of a compromise

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:25.300
and doesn't immediately punish them.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.243
And they're able to go from
Rome and then go to the East,

00:01:30.243 --> 00:01:33.660
where they are the de facto leaders

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.743
of the eastern provinces.

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:39.504
But then in 43 BCE,

00:01:42.672 --> 00:01:45.483
things get a little bit more interesting.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:49.650
Julius Caesar in his will,
he declares that his nephew,

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:55.492
Octavian, or will be
shortly known as Octavian,

00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.818
who's 18 years old at
the time of the death

00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:00.568
on the Ides of March, that he is,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.429
in his will, should be his adopted son,

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.420
and so makes him the natural
heir of Julius Caesar.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.238
Now, Antony, who's also

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:13.832
one of Julius Caesar's
right hand men throughout

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.713
and is one of his strong
supporters as he came to power,

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:19.280
he also, in a lot of
ways, could've claimed,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.699
"Well, I have some rights here

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.697
"to some of the power that
Julius Caesar has gotten,"

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:27.239
and then there was a
third figure, Lepidus,

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.229
and this is a picture
of him right over here.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.568
This is actually a picture of the three.

00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:34.675
This is Mark Antony, this is
Octavian, and this is Lepidus,

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.227
and Lepidus was also a
significant supporter

00:02:37.227 --> 00:02:38.792
of Julius Caesar.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.252
So the three of them get together,

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:42.318
and this is Lepidus's
timeline right over here,

00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:44.215
each of these timelines show the lifespans

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:45.480
of these characters, so you can see

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.940
when they were born and when they died.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.254
You get a sense of their ages

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:51.941
and when they happened to pass away.

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.783
And so these three
characters get together,

00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:57.486
and they form a triumvirate,
and this triumvirate

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:58.916
is called the Second Triumvirate,

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.704
'cause you might've remembered
the First Triumvirate

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:03.673
between Julius Caesar,
Pompey, and Crassus,

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:05.432
and that was an informal agreement.

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:08.410
This one actually gets legal backing,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.989
and not only do they
form this triumvirate,

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.148
but they're given
incredibly powerful power

00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:15.949
over the Roman Republic.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.532
And they decide to go
after the conspirators.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:23.211
So in 68, sorry, (laughs)

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:26.168
so in 42, I don't know
what my brain is doing,

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:30.085
in 43, the triumvirate
is formed, and so in 42,

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.981
they eventually are able
to meet the conspirators

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:34.993
who killed Julius Caesar,

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:37.779
and they meet them at
the Battle of Philippi,

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.726
which is right over, let me do
this in a color you can see,

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:43.226
the Battle of Philippi, where they're able

00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.675
to defeat the conspirators.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.238
So after the defeat of the conspirators,

00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:52.007
they essentially divide the republic,

00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:53.726
although it really is an empire,

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.459
they divide the republic between them.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.749
Antony, Mark Antony, he becomes the ruler,

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.701
the de facto ruler of the East.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.002
Mark Antony becomes the de
facto ruler of the East,

00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:10.986
and then he actually is the
nominal ruler over Gaul as well,

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:13.171
but then he put someone
else in charge there.

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.746
And as we'll see over
the course of this 17,

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:20.279
this tumultuous 17 year
period, Mark Antony really has

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.934
a lot of his control and
influence in the East.

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:26.752
But they've essentially split the empire

00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:28.692
between the three of them.

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:30.233
And right at that split,

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:33.027
Octavian doesn't get
so much of the empire,

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:34.945
but we'll see that'll change shortly

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.791
where he's able to be in control

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.418
of the western half of the empire

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:42.205
in a matter of a few years.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.372
So after that, then in 41,

00:04:45.513 --> 00:04:48.965
and this is where Cleopatra
enters into the picture,

00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:53.023
and she always makes this
a little bit more colorful,

00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:57.954
Mark Antony decides that he
wants to meet with Cleopatra.

00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.459
So he's now leading the East.

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.284
He starts leading it from Athens.

00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:06.497
Then he moves where he
governs from to Ephesus,

00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:09.945
and he calls Cleopatra,
and he already knows her,

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:14.532
he's met her several times, to
come meet him here in Tarsus.

00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:18.024
And here in Tarsus, and then
they go back to Alexandria,

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:22.668
a romance starts between
Mark Antony and Cleopatra,

00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:25.001
one of the most famous
romances in all of history.

00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:26.244
Remember, this is the same Cleopatra

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:30.014
who had a romance and a child
likely through Julius Caesar.

00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:32.417
And Mark Antony and Cleopatra

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:35.276
will actually have
three children together,

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:38.467
and two of which were
conceived in this time period

00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:42.050
right over here, this
period around 41 BCE.

00:05:43.448 --> 00:05:47.615
So this is where we are on
the timeline right over there.

00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:53.221
But then in 40 BCE, the Parthians invade.

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:55.509
And you might remember the Parthians.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.727
This is another very significant,

00:05:57.727 --> 00:06:01.274
you really could consider them
a peer empire to the Romans.

00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:03.582
On this map, you're only
seeing the very left

00:06:03.582 --> 00:06:05.955
or the most westward tip
of the Parthian Empire.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:07.517
They had control of,

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:08.989
when you remember the Achaemenid Empire,

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:11.500
the Seleucid Empire, of most of Persia.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.014
They are a significant empire

00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:15.695
that was really a check on ancient Rome.

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:18.487
And so they decide to invade.

00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:20.320
They decide to invade.

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:24.973
And the Romans already have
trouble with the Parthians.

00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:27.508
You might remember Crassus,

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:29.798
one of the first three triumvirs,

00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:31.287
members of the triumvirate.

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:33.496
He went and, while fighting the Parthians,

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:34.937
that's where he was killed,

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:38.245
and so the Romans had had some
interest in going after them,

00:06:38.245 --> 00:06:39.783
and now you have the Parthians

00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:41.682
who are taking it to the Romans.

00:06:41.682 --> 00:06:43.968
They've taken it on the offense.

00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:47.994
So Antony, he goes from,
when he finds out about this,

00:06:47.994 --> 00:06:50.766
and he's apparently in charge of the East,

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.547
so it's a bit of an embarrassment for him,

00:06:52.547 --> 00:06:54.739
he goes to Tyre, which is the remaining

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:57.200
significant holding that the Romans have.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.407
While he's in Tyre, he
finds out that his wife,

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:02.977
he does have a wife, so this thing

00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:04.927
that he has with Cleopatra
is really an affair,

00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:09.094
his wife is embroiled in
a civil war with Octavian.

00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:13.293
And the civil war, and you'll
see there's this general issue

00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:17.693
throughout especially the later
stages of the Roman Republic

00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:21.499
and even the Roman Empire,
that as Rome expands,

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.416
it needs these armies,
and one of the things

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:25.244
that they promise these soldiers are,

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.304
"Hey, after you serve,
when you're a veteran,

00:07:27.304 --> 00:07:30.614
"we're gonna give you some land
so you can be a nice farmer

00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:35.036
"or at least landlord, other
people might do the farming,

00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:37.240
"and you can have slaves
and all the rest."

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.635
Now, in order to keep doing
that, you keep needing new land.

00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:43.935
So Octavian, in order to make
some of these veterans happy,

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:46.528
was giving away land,
some of which was already,

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:50.490
I guess you could say
owned, by existing Romans.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.657
So Mark Antony's wife was
using that really as an excuse

00:07:55.744 --> 00:07:58.042
to try to vie for power.

00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:00.937
And just to be clear, even
though there was this triumvirate

00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:03.204
between Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus,

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:05.077
things were tense from the beginning

00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:07.281
between Antony and Octavian.

00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:10.266
Both of them, both of them saw themselves

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.011
as natural heirs to Julius Caesar.

00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.517
Antony says, "Hey, this young
little 18 year old upstart,

00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:17.994
"what has he done to deserve this empire?

00:08:17.994 --> 00:08:20.690
"I've been beside Julius
Caesar the entire time."

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.977
Octavian is here saying,
"Hey, I am now officially

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.801
"Julius Caesar's adopted son."

00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:26.755
He takes on the name Caesar.

00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:31.499
"I am the rightful heir
to Julius Caesar's power."

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:35.036
And so sitting here in
Tyre, Antony decides,

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:37.917
"Okay, let me go take on Octavian."

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:41.834
So he decides to go and
lay siege to Brundisium

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.203
in order to defend his wife,

00:08:45.203 --> 00:08:47.385
even though he obviously didn't care

00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:49.931
too much about his wife's honor.

00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:53.725
And it's over there, they're
essentially at loggerheads.

00:08:53.725 --> 00:08:55.715
He tries to go into the civil war.

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:58.974
His wife, Antony's wife, dies.

00:08:58.974 --> 00:09:01.734
Octavian and Antony decide, "Okay, okay.

00:09:01.734 --> 00:09:05.678
"Maybe we should not be
fighting each other so much."

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:09.509
And so they decide once
again to be friends,

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:11.991
and then they really at that point

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:14.204
decide to split the empire more formally

00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:17.936
between East and West,
where, in the triumvirate,

00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:20.748
you have Mark Antony
still getting the East.

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:24.665
You have Octavian being
in control of the West,

00:09:26.474 --> 00:09:29.227
including the Italian Peninsula,

00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:31.933
and then Lepidus gets Africa.

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:36.743
And you have Lepidus getting
Africa right over here.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:39.076
So I'll leave you with that.

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:42.547
There's a little moment of,

00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.081
it looks like a little bit of peace,

00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:46.831
between Mark Antony and Octavian.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.687
But as we'll see in the next video,

00:09:49.687 --> 00:09:51.746
it's about to get a lot worse.

00:09:51.746 --> 00:09:53.490
The big picture from here is that

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.039
they were able to take
care of the conspirators,

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.831
but now they're starting to squabble.

00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.264
The triumvirate is starting to squabble,

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.036
especially Mark Antony and Octavian.

00:10:01.036 --> 00:10:02.665
Lepidus was always kind of the,

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.201
I guess you could say,
the third wheel here.

00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.778
It was always between Antony and Octavian.

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:10.253
Cleopatra has a romantic
relationship with Antony.

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:12.256
She's aligned with Antony.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:14.475
At the same time, and remember, Cleopatra,

00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.032
she's considered the richest woman

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:16.974
in the world at this time.

00:10:16.974 --> 00:10:18.803
She is the pharaoh of Egypt.

00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:21.747
And remember, Egypt, even
though the people were Egyptian,

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:24.220
Cleopatra is part of
the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.764
She is Greek, but what
makes her interesting

00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:28.704
is that she takes on
a lot of the trappings

00:10:28.704 --> 00:10:30.160
and she learns to speak Egyptian.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.748
So she's quite popular from, I guess,

00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:36.217
relatively speaking terms,
with the Egyptian people.

00:10:36.217 --> 00:10:37.392
And the other thing to keep in mind is

00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:38.227
we have these Parthians.

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:41.407
These Parthians have
just laid another insult

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:44.292
on the Romans right over
here when they invaded Syria

00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:45.873
and are able to take over this territory.

00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:48.837
And this is especially
annoying to Mark Antony,

00:10:48.837 --> 00:10:52.504
who is supposed to be
in charge of the East.
