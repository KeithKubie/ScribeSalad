00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.231
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know a system of equation involves two lines. So let's try and graph two

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.394
lines about our problem. Here the x axis is going to represent the number of

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.805
hours, and the y axis is going to represent our money. Knowing that you have $45

00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:17.221
to spend on the car rental, which of these equations represents the amount of

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:19.780
money you can spend? Choose the best answer.
