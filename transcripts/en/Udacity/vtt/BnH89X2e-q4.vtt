00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.569
So the first thing that you should do, in

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.860
order to minimize network latency, is to minimize the

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.480
number of HTTP requests. And a major, major way

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.960
to do this, is to avoid page redirects. each

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.750
redirect can cause a DNS look-up, TCP connect, and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.580
the sending of the actual HTTP request itself all

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.490
over again. HTTPS has even more round trips per

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.500
connection. So you're looking at high hundreds of milliseconds

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.050
per redirects, as a penalty, at least. If you

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.610
have a legitimate need for redirects, for example if

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.290
you've moved a resource, that's great, but use a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.350
301 redirect if you can. Lots of browsers will

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.650
actually update links then. You also want to illuminate

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.250
render blocking resources, like waiting on multiple style sheets

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.830
or fonts of the like. Anything that forces the

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.650
browser to wait for another HTTP transaction to complete,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.660
before it can render the app, is going to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.060
be much more noticeable on mobile. So, combine and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.160
minify those style sheets kits. This also includes avoiding

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.300
blocking rendering by waiting for the download of JavaScript

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.710
files. If you can use async or defer on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.810
script to let the content render as soon as

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.660
possible. In short, you want to prioritize the network

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.740
transactions or whatever you need to render the initial

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.710
page full of content. Make sure you're loading images on that first page first,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.890
before ones that may be down in the bottom of the page. Get that first

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.170
page on the screen as quickly as possible. You should obsess over the network

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.150
page and the developer tools. To make

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.160
sure you're loading items in the correct order.
