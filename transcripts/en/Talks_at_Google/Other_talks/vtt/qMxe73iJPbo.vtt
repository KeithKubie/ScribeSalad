00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.320
&gt;&gt;male presenter:Welcome everybody. It is
my distinct pleasure to welcome Matt Ridley

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:18.370
today to Google. So, I don't know about you
but I've heard the saying, "nuclear fusion

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:25.840
is about 20 years in the future every time
you ask a fusion physicists." It may not be

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.620
true apparently people at Lawrence Livermore
are doing something to change that, but it's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.660
been true for the last 50 years. So there's
a category of people who have sort of the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.930
same saying. They say, "well you know, our
civilization is doomed. You know like in the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.160
next six months we'll see everything collapse
and the world will change as we know it. We

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.489
are over using the planet. We are not doing
the right things." Well, our guest today will

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.850
hopefully disprove this notion. He's written
a great book which I recommend to all of you

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.659
to read, check it out. It's called the, Rational
Optimist and it deals with some of the issues

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.420
of society today.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.799
Matt Ridley is the author of proactive books
on evolution, genetics, and society. His books

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.869
have sold over 800 copies--800,000 copies,
I'm sorry!

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.009
[audience mumbling, laughing]
[audience member clapping]

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.490
Been translated into 27 languages, have won
several awards including: the award for "the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.429
Best Science Book published in 2003" from
the National Academy of Science, and the Los

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.209
Angeles Times book prize.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.170
The Rational Optimist has been categorized
As the trumpet blast against despair. Let's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.599
see if Matt can tip our way of thinking about
the world for the better. Please welcome Matt

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.599
Ridley.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.599
[audience applause]

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.240
&gt;&gt;Matt Ridley: Thank you, Boris very much
indeed, and it's a terrific honor to be here

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.399
at Google. I was thinking the other day that
actually the technology that's changed my

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.010
life as an author most in my lifetime is probably
the search engine. It is truly as revolutionary,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.840
I think, in my life--what I do as--as the
steam engine was in my great--my ancestors'

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.879
lifetimes. So what I want to do today is some,
here's a 20 seconds summary of the talk. First

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.140
of all, I want to to make the case that ideas
have sex and that's where innovation comes

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.329
from; that exchange has the same impact on
economic progress that sexual reproduction

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.290
has on biological evolution. It's a specific
analogy that I will expel out. Uh. The effect,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.480
the reason that progress happens is essentially
because everybody works for everybody else

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.500
which is great theme of human history. It's
a habit that started 120,000 years ago. It

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.159
results in something called "collective intelligence"
whereby the knowledge of how to do things

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.659
to make things is stored across society not
within our brains. The results is that things

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.140
are actually getting better not worse. People
are surprisingly getting nicer and we ain't

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.750
seen nothing yet, and the global pessimists
are wrong. So those are the topics I'll try

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.061
and cover in the next 40 minutes or so.

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:22.060
Very clear-

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.280
I went to be very clear what I'm not saying.
I'm not saying everything is fine in the world

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.200
quite the reverse. I actually think it's because
there's so much still wrong with the world

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.209
that we need to understand how much better
we can make it. I'm not saying nothing's getting

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.121
worse, there are things getting worse in the
world of course there are trends that are

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.220
going in the wrong direction. And I'm certainly
not saying that everything is fine in any

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.120
one individual country. We're clearly in the
middle of the terrible financial crisis in

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.409
the West at the moment. We've managed in this
crisis to actually shrink the world economy

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:57.280
in 2009, but only by 1%. Globally though now
China is growing at 12%, the world at 4%.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.379
So, my focus is global it's not local in this.
And I'm not saying, you know, that you need

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.530
to sort be individually happy or anything
like that. This isn't about individual optimism

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.099
this is about optimism for the species. In
some respects people are too optimistic about

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.080
their own lives, and not optimistic enough
about the species. For example, people think

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.500
they're going to stay married longer than
they do.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.130
I want to end up by having you asked the question,
whenever anybody says pessimist things to

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.670
you, "On what principle is it that when we
see nothing but improvement behind us, we

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.130
are to expect nothing but deterioration before
us?" And that was said 1830, and it's even

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.130
more true today.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.780
So essentially what I want to start by doing
is explaining how we went from making things

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.940
like that to making things like that. These
are both real objects they sit on my desk

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.180
at home they are identical in size and shape
and yet of course a very different. The one

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.010
on the left is made from one material the
one on the right is a confection of lots of

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.410
different substances and has a huge complexity
within it. And the one on the left, which

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.310
is called an Acheulean handaxe, was made to
roughly the same design for nearly a million

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.060
years. Homo erectus made these things, and
he made them incredibly well. He was very

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.460
good at them, but they were the same all over
the world and they were the same for a million

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.680
years. It's quite unimaginable to us that
a technology which stand still in that way.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.060
But during Homo erectus' time his body changed
faster than his toolkit. That's an extraordinary

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.860
idea. We think that when we invented tools
we must invented innovation, too. It didn't

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.210
happen. Technology came before innovation.
The object on the right is obsolete already

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.220
after five years. So let me start by making
the case that exchange is the thing that has

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.910
accelerated cultural change in the way sex
accelerated biological change.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:06.970
Culture is a combinatorial thing. It brings
together ideas, it reorganizes atoms and electrons

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.150
in different combinations. So every technology
we look at is actually a combination of other

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.710
technologies and of other ideas. And its ideas
coming together in changing each other that

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.220
is innovation in a way--is to some of the
things going to making bicycle, they are all

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.690
different. And in order to be combinatorial,
in order to be cumulative you need to have

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.730
process of exchange. And it's the same in
biological evolution. My body is also a combination

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.761
of inventions. Different proteins, different
genes, different cell types that have all

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:39.060
come together. We were all diff--invented
in different places, at different times, by

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.380
different organisms and they've all come together
in me and indeed in you. How did that happen?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.280
Well ,sex was absolutely key to that. The
invention of sexual reproduction. Let me explain.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.550
If you imagine an asexual animal an animal
that simply gives birth mother to son--mother

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:03.300
to daughter rather--without any males forever,
then what's going to happen if you have mutations--good

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.290
ones--is that they're going through in competition
with each other. So if you invent the green

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.870
thing and somebody else invents the red thing.
Natural selection is going to have to decide

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.800
which one is better and make the other one
extinct. So imagine this is an ancestral mammal

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.040
and one of them invents milk and the other
one invents the placenta and we have to decide

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.540
which of these two innovations we want in
the species. But if they're having sex then

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.260
of course at some point you can get an organism
that has both of these. So, the effect of

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.170
sex--the invention of sexual reproduction--enabled
evolution to become cumulative and combinatorial.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.290
It wasn't the case before that.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.760
Now the invention of exchange had the same
impact on cultural evolution. Because you

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.470
can actually have cultural without sex--as
it were, you know--you can have culture without

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:57.540
exchange. And the effect is you get no cumulative
combina--combinatorial. Chimpanzees have culture's,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.870
they have traditions of how to break open
nuts with rocks. And the fascinating thing

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.600
is that if you go to different parts of Africa--indeed
even to different parts of the same forest--you'll

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.160
find different troops of chimpanzees have
different cultures, different traditions of

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.180
how to break open rocks. And they--because
they never trade they never exchange. You

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.930
can't get the ideas coming together and therefore
culture never builds. It's not progressive,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.200
it's not cumulative in these animals. That's
what's different about us, not that we've

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.670
got culture, but we've got cumulative combinatorial
culture. And it's this process of exchange,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:40.710
this process of swapping things with each
other that's had a huge impact on our development.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:48.550
So why is it? Why does exchange cause innovation?
Why does exchange raise living standards,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.650
indeed? And the answer really is a pretty
old one. David Ricardo, a stockbroker, in

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.220
England in the early 19th century coined a
thing called "the Law of Comparative Advantage".

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.480
He was talking about international trade,
but I want to rephrase it in stone age terms.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.460
There are two guys sitting around a fire called
Adam and Oz. Adam takes four hours to make

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.340
a spear and three hours to make an ax. Oz
Is better at making both spears and axes than

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:18.040
Adam. Adam doesn't-so Oz doesn't need Adam
does he? You know, Adams is a waste of space

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.700
as far as Oz is concerned. Well no, because
all Oz has to do is make two spears and get

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.080
Adam to make two axes and then they trade.
And the result is that they've both saved

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.010
an hour of work each. That's the law of comparative
advantage. Now the point is, that if they

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:41.130
do that a couple of times then Oz is going
to get even better at making spears and Adam

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.940
is going to get even better at making axes.
So it's going to be even more true every time

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.980
they do it that there are going to be gains
from trade in it. And that's the story of

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.270
human progress really. It's the specialization
that each of us, we get more and more specialized

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.880
as producers and that enables us to be more
and more diversified as consumers. Because

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.201
in the end what we're doing is we're all working
for each other.

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:10.170
Go back to this image of the stone ax and
the computer mouse. The stone ax was made

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.820
by one man for his own use. We actually know
this because you can find archeological sites

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.150
where they were made and you can find the
chips how they fell from the Boulder as the

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.880
man was chipping it. And you can see that
five people were sitting around after they

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.670
killed a horse. And this is one particular
case in southern England 500,000 years ago.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:33.029
And they each made their own ax to help butcher
the animal. The object on the right was made

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:40.200
for me very kindly by lots of people. Tens
of people, hundreds of people, thousands of

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.550
people I think it's millions of people actually
when you think about it. Because it's not

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:49.630
just the man who assembled the computer mouse.
It's the man who drilled oil well to get the

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.390
oil to make the plastic to house it. And the
man who brewed coffee for the man he drilled

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.120
oil well and so on. Once you start counting
the number of people who contributed to making

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.321
me that computer mouse just when I needed
it, there were an awful lot of them. A million

00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:06.930
people working for me. It's an extraordinary
phenomenon.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:12.800
Here's a rich man, Louis XIV, the King of
France in the late 17th century. And he's

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.660
rich because he had a lot of people working
for him. He had--he could get almost anything

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.720
he wanted because he could ask people to make
it for him or to do it for him. So somebody

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.650
made that silly outfit he's wearing for example
and somebody precious hair in that strange

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:34.120
way and Louis XIV had 498 people to cook his
dinner every night. Which is quite a good

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:42.380
number, but an ordinary modern tourist in
the Palace of Versailles looking at Louis

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:49.960
XIV's possessions today--she's not rich and
yet when you think about it she's got people

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.470
working for her. Somebody made those jeans.
Somebody made the electricity that's lighting

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.410
the room, and she has cut 498 people to cook
her dinner tonight. They're all in restaurants

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.140
and cafés and shops all over Paris but within
an hour's drive she could find at least 498

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.750
people ready to serve her meal at very short
notice. What's the difference? That's essentially

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:17.120
the process of prosperity--is increasingly--that
we've worked for each other.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.720
Now this happens in other animals, too. ”The
division of labor", Adam Smith called it or

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.630
exchange in specialization. And it happens
in, for example, social insects like ants--where

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.430
this is a worker ant feeding a queen ant.
But there's one big difference in all other

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:40.220
examples of animals which work for each other,
they do it within the family. An ant colony

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:47.270
is just a big family. Everybody is the daughter
of the queen, essentially. And so they do

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:54.980
not ever work for strangers. The one division
of labor that always have is a reproductive

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:01.680
division of labor, so that only one individual
reproduces. You get a specialist casts that

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.540
reproduces, the queen. That's the one division
of labor we never do human society. It's the

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.920
one specialization--we don't have specialized
breeders in our society. We have specialized

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.650
producers and everything else that not even
in England in the production to the queen.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.520
[Audience laughter]

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.290
And of course agriculture is same idea. It's
working not just for each other and for other

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:29.310
species and other species working for us.
So, for example, ants also an indulgent agriculture

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:35.780
in the sense that they farm aphids. Here's
an ant on the left taking honeydew from an

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:41.899
aphid and working for the aphid--in the sense
of guarding it--and the aphid is working for

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:46.790
it. But human agriculture is the same. The
shepherd on the right is working for the sheep

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.270
and the sheep are working for the shepherd
and the dog is working for both of them and

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.830
so on. That's what agriculture is. Its species
working for each other.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:14:00.270
Now I'm going to argue that this habit of
working for each other, of specialization

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:07.020
in exchange, began around 120,000 years ago.
And I'm going to present some evidence for

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:13.230
that. And it explains human take off. Explains
how we went from being very clever, very linguistic

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:19.700
all these kinds of things, but still having
no great--what you might call--explosion of

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:27.300
numbers or prosperity to becoming a species
that totally dominates the planet. Because

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:35.000
if you look at a graph of human brain size
over time--from fossils--like this one, you

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.230
can see that it's a pretty gradual process,
the increase in brain size. And if you put

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:44.490
on this--the great things that we think make
us human, that distinguish us from other animals,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.180
they all come at the wrong time to explain
what's going on. So for example standing on

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.470
two legs, well, that happened at least 2 1/2
million years ago.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:15:00.190
Yesterday I was handling a replica of Ardipithecus
ramidus. The 4.4 million-year-old ancestral

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:05.370
species which was pretty well bipedal already
4.4 million years ago. So, freeing

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.800
up the hands had an impact, but it wasn't
the key ingredient. You mention of tools,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.970
stone tools are 2 1/2 million years old. Fire,
we don't know when it happened maybe half

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:20.460
million may be 1 1/2 million years ago. And
it had a big impact because once we'd invented

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.060
fire, we could do cooking, and that's external
digestion which means you don't need to such

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:29.399
a big gut, so you can have a bigger brain
etc. etc. But it comes too early in the story.

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:36.480
Even language, we now know Neanderthals probably
had the same mutations in the genome that

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.890
facilitate language that we did. Which means
that our common ancestor with Neanderthals

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:47.080
400,000 or so years ago probably had incipient
language. So, it doesn't look like language

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.130
had quite the impact we often thought it did.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.020
My argument is that exchange comes at just
the right time. The invention of swapping

00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:00.600
things which was a very difficult thing to
invent because their homicidal relations between

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.610
troops of apes usually. Came around the right
time to explain the sudden transformation

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.899
is just another successful but relatively
rare ape into the creatures that dominates

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:19.330
the planet. It may have been preceded--perhaps--by
an older division of labor which probably

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.620
preconditioned us to this. And this is sexual
division of labor, the division of labor between

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:32.020
males and females. In all extant hunter gatherer
society as a specialization in the way creatures

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.920
forage between males and females. It is usually
hunting males and gathering females but it's

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.980
not always quite that simple. So for example
in the Hadza here, men go out hunting for

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:48.650
things like warthogs and women go digging
for roots. Now it's a beautiful system because

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:53.820
has a wonderful Ricardian gains from trade
in it. All a women has to do if she wants

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.080
protein is dig up some extra roots. So as
to have something to trade for food. She doesn't

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.149
have to go out on an exhausting hunt. And
all a man has to do to have a plentiful supply

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:07.899
of food, even on days when he hasn't managed
to catch anything, is make sure that when

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:12.220
he does catch something it's big enough so
that he can share the meat with a woman. Both

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:18.789
sides benefit from the system. It's a beautiful
invention. And it looks like that it was something

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:26.220
that Neanderthal might not have had. Neanderthals
were--they're an enigma, they're highly intelligent

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:34.940
creatures. They have on average bigger brains
than us. The probably one of the biggest fossil

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.529
craniums that's ever been found was neanderthal.
They, as I said, they had imagination, because

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:46.000
they buried their dead. They had language.
The puzzle--and yet they, their technology

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.200
did not progress. It remained very similar
until the last few thousand years, before

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.539
they went extinct. And their numbers didn't
change. They had nothing like the kind of

00:17:56.539 --> 00:18:01.889
take off that we did. They certainly didn't
invent civilization. And it looks like they

00:18:01.889 --> 00:18:06.450
didn't have a sexual division of labor. This
is the theory of Mary Stein and Steve Kuhner--it's

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:12.480
the other way around--Mary Stiner and Steve
Kuhn at Arizona, who argue that you look at

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.749
Neanderthals sites you can't find the sorts
of toolkits and objects that women would've

00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:24.230
been using if they were like hunter-gatherers.
There's no plant processing tools, there's

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:29.130
no Grindstones, there's no clothes making,
all those kinds of things. So, they're not

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.590
saying that women did nothing, they're saying
actually that women were probably out hunting

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.309
with men and that this was a highly cooperative
species in which everybody helped each other

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:41.989
but they didn't have a distinction between
the roles of the males and females, they were

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:50.159
all hunters. And we know that Neanderthals
did not trade because Neanderthal tools are

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:55.659
always made from local materials. The stone
tools were made from rocks found within just

00:18:55.659 --> 00:19:01.350
a very short distance from where they are.
Whereas, modern human tools after 100,000

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.560
years as ago start cropping up were made from
things a long, long way away. For example

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.059
in the Caucuses there is a site where the
Neanderthal remains on one side of the valley

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:15.499
and modern human remains on the other. The
Neanderthal remains are associated with the

00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:21.419
local chert. And the modern human remains
are associated with obsidian from up to 100

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:29.629
miles away. So the earliest evidence for trade
is when things start moving long distances.

00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:35.200
And in Ethiopia you see stone tools starting
to move long distances around 100,000 years

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:43.700
ago something similar and Algeria where these
marine shells are moving 125 miles inland...

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.320
What happened? Did it go--has it gone a funny
color?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.010
[Mumbling]
Can you see this clearly?--Well the image

00:19:51.010 --> 00:20:00.160
is very dark.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.250
So these marine shells which have been drilled
to make beads and have been worn smooth by

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.639
being worn probably on a string. These date
from at least 80,000 and probably up to 120,000

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:15.470
years ago. And this is the first time were
saying objects moving long distances. How

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:21.330
do we know that moving long distances is trade
and not migration? Well, because in relatively

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.950
modern Stone Age people like Australian Aborigines
he could see the same phenomenon. There was

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:32.730
a quarry called Mount Isa in northern Australia
where the Kalkadoon tribe dug up stone axes.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.820
And they traded them with their neighbors
for things like stingray barbs. And as a result

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.090
of the stone axes ended up all over Australia
in a far larger area than the Kalkadoon tribe

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.860
ever went to.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:52.609
And what happens when you cut a human off
from trade and exchange networks? Well, one

00:20:52.609 --> 00:20:56.389
of the fascinating natural experiments

00:20:56.389 --> 00:21:01.379
… in this is what happened to Tasmanian
Aborigines. They occupied Tasmania 35,000

00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:06.259
years ago when it was firs--when it was a
peninsula of the Australian continent. About

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:10.110
10,000 years ago the sea levels rose at the
end of the ice age in Tasmania was cut off

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:17.090
and became an island. Over the next 10,000
years to 4,000 or so people living on Tasmania

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:24.009
not only experience and no progressive innovations
in the tools that they were making, they actually

00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:29.730
experienced regress. Their tools became simpler
and they lost certain technologies altogether.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:36.230
They lost the ability to make bone tools for
example lost the ability to make fishing equipment.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:41.580
And they lost the ability to make clothing.
What's going on here, is that they can't sustain

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.989
in that small of a number, in that sort of
isolation, they can't sustain the different

00:21:47.989 --> 00:21:53.149
specialized skills even to keep their existing
technologies alive. It's as if the hundred

00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:58.330
or so people in this room were dumped on an
island, how many of the technologies in our

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:04.210
pockets would we still be able to make after
10,000 years? Obviously, not very many.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.309
Tierra del Fuego is a very similar islands,
equally inhospitable, equally cold, equally

00:22:09.309 --> 00:22:14.460
sparsely populated, and yet this didn't happen
here. Why not? Because the Magellan Straits

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.500
is narrower than the Bass Strait, and there
was continuous trading contact between the

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.019
people of Tierra del Fuego and the mainland
of South America, which there was not in Tasmania.

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:31.649
So my argument is this process of exchanges
specialization leads to something called collective

00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:36.190
intelligence which transcends the power of
our brain. If you go back to the image again

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.789
of the hand ax and the mouse. The hand ax--as
I say--was made by one person for his own

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:49.019
use and he knew how to make it. Nobody knows
how to make a computer mouse. Quite literally,

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:52.159
I don't mean that figuratively I mean that
literally. There's nobody on the planet that

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:56.200
knows how to make a computer mouse. The president
of the computer mouse company only knows how

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.649
to run a company. But the person who assembles
it, he knows how to assemble it, but he doesn't

00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:04.529
know how to drill an oil well to get the oil
and turn it into plastic. The knowledge is

00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:10.950
not held in any one brain. And the brain cannot
comprehend that knowledge actually. We've

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.919
transcended the ability of our brains, because
we are able to use brains as nodes in a network,

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:21.419
I hope this is reverberating well at Google,
that's essentially what we're doing. We're

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:26.250
allowing--if I could go back to the analogy
between sex and exchange--we're allowing ideas

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:32.230
to have sex in this network, and come together
and combine and produce something that's greater

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.889
than the sum of its parts.

00:23:35.889 --> 00:23:39.559
"Knowledge", said Friedrich Hayek, "never
exist in concentrated or integrated form,

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:44.059
but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete
and frequently contradictory knowledge which

00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:50.830
all us separate individuals possess." He is
arguing against central planning here and

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:56.239
it's basically the same point. So people are
nodes in a network and that's what lights

00:23:56.239 --> 00:24:04.090
up the light bulb of human achievement. And
here of course, is where we get to the modern

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:12.019
world's where ideas are having sex in a furious
fashion compared with what ever went before.

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:17.499
Ideas can come together and combine and recombine
far faster than before and on a far bigger

00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:23.629
scale than before. And if that is what drives
innovation, as I argued that it does, then

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:30.840
surely were going to see an acceleration of
innovation in this century not a diminution.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.989
So I then want to tie all of this to an argument
that things are actually getting better. Now

00:24:36.989 --> 00:24:41.710
very few people in my country seem to believe
this. Everybody thinks that things are getting

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.700
worse. And I used to be the same. I was brought-I
became an adult in the 1970s when Britain

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:53.669
was a pretty dire place and every one was
pretty pessimistic. I was told that the population

00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:57.840
explosion was unstoppable, an epidemic of
cancer was beginning because the chemicals

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.779
in the environment, famine was going to reduce
the human population, nuclear war was on the

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:08.429
way, various diseases were coming back, the
oil was going to run out, and so on and so

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:13.729
forth. And I actually realized about the age
of 21 that nobody ever said anything optimistic

00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:18.639
to me about the future of the human race at
all. Not in a pub or a television program

00:25:18.639 --> 00:25:23.720
or anything. And I couldn't help noticing
some of these gloomy things just kept not

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.070
happening. And in fact, everything started
getting better. And all sorts of people started

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.039
getting richer and not only my country but
around the world. And I've been going back

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:37.179
and looking at the numbers on what's happened
in my lifetime, and I've astounded myself.

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:43.389
But this happens because we work for each
other we produce things for each other and

00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:48.590
we make it cheaper for each other to achieve
things. So ask yourself how long it takes

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:54.960
you on the average wage in America or Britain,
it's roughly the same it turns out, to earn

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.009
an hour of ever reading light. That is to
say, an 18 watt compact fluorescent bulb burning

00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:05.710
for about an hour which comes to about 1200
lumen-hours. Um. And the answer is that today

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.899
on the average wage you have to work for about
half a second to earn that much liked which

00:26:09.899 --> 00:26:18.490
is not very long. In 1950 you'd have had for
16 times as long to earn that much light.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.580
And in 1880 you'd have had to work a whole
15 minutes to earn an hour of reading light.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.590
That was the cost of kerosene and the amortize
cost of a kerosene lamp. Back in 1800 and

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:36.570
you'd have to work for six hours--on the then
average wage--to earn the price of a candle

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:42.779
that gave you that much light. What that tells
you is that in 1800 the average person on

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:46.659
the average wage could not afford a candle.
And he certainly couldn't afford to sit reading

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:53.169
Jane Austen every night because he had worked
all day to achieve what he want it. And that's

00:26:53.169 --> 00:27:01.080
just a measure of how extraordinarily much
technology has changed and improved our lives.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.559
And here are some numbers: life expectancy
in my lifetime up roughly 30%, it's going

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:11.991
up at five hours per day, life expectancy.
This is global. This isn't America this it

00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:15.889
is a all around the world. It's going up faster
in countries like China.

00:27:15.889 --> 00:27:22.430
Poverty: this is one of several measures of
poverty, but they're all declining and they

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:29.519
all have been declining for at least 30 years.
That's true even in Africa. Africa had a couple

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:33.580
back decades in which the poverty rate actually
increase because population was going up faster

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.799
than economic growth. That's now turned around.
We've seen pretty steady progress in the diminution

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:42.639
of poverty in Africa--a long way to go--but
it's starting.

00:27:42.639 --> 00:27:49.909
Air pollution: air pollution is halved in
the United States since 1980. A Ford Mustang

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:56.860
car in 1970 emitted more hydrocarbons sitting
on his driveway than a 2010 Mustang emits

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.710
try traveling at 70 miles an hour on the freeway.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.260
Even oil spills.
Gasp!

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.109
How dare I say that with a British accent.

00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:09.859
[audience laughs]

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:12.899
This is clearly going to be a terrible year
for oil spills. Its going to be one of the

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:18.460
big green bars on this year. Hopefully it
won't be too big but it it it it could be

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.960
at least half the size of some of the three
big ones. Are they green or yellow to you,

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:31.130
sorry? But notice the context. Which is, over
the past 30 years despite a huge increase

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:36.889
in the amount of oil transported on the ocean
the amount spilled has actually been going

00:28:36.889 --> 00:28:44.269
down. Death rates from water related diseases,
they've virtually ceased to kill people in

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:52.110
the United States. Tuberculosis, scurvy, and
measles, other causes of death are not going

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.169
down as fast as infectious diseases but they're
not going up either. Where is this cancer

00:28:56.169 --> 00:29:00.809
epidemic that we were promised from chemicals
in the environment. Age-adjusted cancer rates

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:05.390
are going down this shows non-age-adjusted
rates in there pretty level Heart disease

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:13.059
is going down. The AIDS epidemic came but
it has--to a degree--retreated. So just to

00:29:13.059 --> 00:29:19.739
summarize, since 1955 life expectancy is up
a third, per capita income rate is up threefold,

00:29:19.739 --> 00:29:24.509
that's corrected for inflation. Food per capita
is that the third, child mortality is down

00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:31.419
two thirds, and population growth rate has
halved. That's in my lifetime. In the world

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:38.830
as a whole. And actually, I think people are
getting kind of less cruel, and less tolerant

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:47.099
of violence, more tolerant of difference and
ethnic differences and so on.

00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:51.710
Some examples, the homicide rate in Europe
this is one of the crimes, one of violent

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.889
crimes can get fairly good data. And this
is Spierenburg's calculation for what the

00:29:56.889 --> 00:30:02.289
homicide rate per hundred thousand people
was in Europe, even if it ticks up a bit it's

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:08.289
a long way short of your probability of being
a homicide victim in the Middle Ages. This

00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:13.379
is an ancestral relation of mine called Bishop
Nicholas Ridley. He was burned at the stake

00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:21.799
slowly--from the feet upwards--as a spectator
sport in 1555 for the crime of believing that

00:30:21.799 --> 00:30:30.019
the sacrament, during the Communion, was figuratively
not literally the body of Christ. You know,

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:35.110
that was fun in those days you couldn't imagine
that nowadays. Of course, terrible horrible

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.090
violent things still happen in the world,
but on most measures they are actually getting

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:44.750
rarer and are getting harder to justify. Even
inequality is falling. Did you know that?

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.320
Most people think inequality is rising and
increment inequality has risen in countries

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.929
like the US but globally it's going down.
Why? Because poorer countries like China are

00:30:53.929 --> 00:31:00.769
getting rich faster than rich countries are
getting rich. So finally, I don't think that

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:06.259
this process is over. I don't think that we're
like the man falling past the second floor

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:09.039
of the skyscraper who says, "So far so good."

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:10.929
[audience light laughter]

00:31:10.929 --> 00:31:15.269
I think we ain't seen nothing yet. I don't
see any why this process of exchange and specialization

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:24.219
which produces new technologies will not continue
to improve people's lives in what comes ahead.

00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:29.249
Just to give you one example of how ambitious
I think we should be about what to do in this

00:31:29.249 --> 00:31:36.749
century to improve human lifestyles. If we
believe in progress, if we don't say we need

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:42.320
to stop now--and that is to say--ask yourself
how much land you need to feed a person on

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.279
the planet. If we were hunter gatherers we
would need a thousand hectares per head. Early

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:54.640
farmers used only about 10 hectares to feed
one person. That's how the density of human

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.960
people human population increased so dramatically
when farming was invented. By the 1950s we

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.190
were feeding people off of about 4000 m².
And today with the average cereal yield you

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:12.969
can produce enough calories on about 1200
m² to feed a person. So here's the global

00:32:12.969 --> 00:32:19.919
cereal harvest over the last 50 years and
it's very nearly traveled over 50 years. And

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:26.349
yet the acreage that we plant in cereals has
not changed at all. And so of course, in increasing

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:31.919
the productivity of cereal growing land around
the world we've actually taken the pressure

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:38.249
off wild habitats. It's the increasing intensity
of farming that has actually save the rainforests.

00:32:38.249 --> 00:32:43.200
And if we were to pull off the trick again--if
we could trebles yields from land again--and

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.479
I think it could be done with existing technology
let alone new ones, because there are large

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:51.980
parts of the world still not getting access
to fertilizers and things like that which

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.909
is what makes the difference.

00:32:53.909 --> 00:33:01.369
Then what can we do in this century? Apparently
we crop about 15,000,000 km² which is almost

00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:05.739
the size of Russia. If we were farming much
less efficiently, like early farmers we'd

00:33:05.739 --> 00:33:09.759
need an awful lot more land. It couldn't be
done. We couldn't feed 9 billion people which

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:16.599
is how many there will be by the middle of
this century, from ah from that kind of agriculture.

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:21.969
Even if we went back to the type of agriculture
used in the 1950s we'd struggle, and even

00:33:21.969 --> 00:33:28.249
with today's average yields we need more land
to feed 9 billion people in 2050 than we use

00:33:28.249 --> 00:33:35.830
to feed 6.8 billion today. It stands to reason.
But if we were to double yields again in the

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.080
next 50 years, and as I say we jolly nearly
trebled them in the last 50 years. Then we

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:47.890
would actually be able to feed more people--that's
9 billion people--on less land than we cultivate

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:54.029
today. That means we can start to think about
rejoining rain forest patches, linking up

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:59.740
nature reserves, setting land aside, re-flooding
marshes that kind of thing. In fact, in some

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.009
of the rich Western countries we're already
doing that. That's the sort of ambition we

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:09.629
should have for technology and progress, and
by then population will be falling on most

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:16.539
projections. So actually if we did it again
in the following half-century we could imagine

00:34:16.539 --> 00:34:22.589
feeding people from a still smaller patch
and giving even more land back to nature.

00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:24.839
[pause]

00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:29.569
So I think people who take a very pessimistic
view of the future are actually not going

00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:30.569
to be right.

00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:35.359
Certainly I'm not ruling out disasters. We
are certainly going to have horrible wars

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:39.270
in this century, I don't doubt it. We're going
to have depressions, we're going to have recessions,

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:45.020
we're going to have natural disasters. Horrible
things will happen. Ethnic conflicts all sorts

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:52.359
of things, just as we had in the 20th century.
But I think, after all population is only

00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:58.640
an increase 1 1/2 times the century. It quadrupled
in the 20th century. It's going to get easier

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.369
and easier in that sense to improve people's
lives. This is what the preamble to Agenda

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:09.510
21, signed by the world leaders in Rio in
1992, started by saying. It said, "Humanity

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:14.690
stands as a defining moment in history. We
are confronted with a perpetuation of disparities

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.810
within and between nations a worsening of
poverty, hunger, ill health, illiteracy and

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:23.780
in the continued deterioration of the ecosystems
of which we depend for our well-being." With

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.450
the partial exception of the last parts of
that statement, everything in that statement

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:32.029
turned out to be utterly wrong about what
happened there for the next 18 years till

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:37.589
today. That is to say disparities within and
between nations got better not worse, poverty

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:41.490
got better not worse, hunger got better not
worse, ill health got better not worse, and

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:49.020
so on. Woody Allen put it this way rather
similarly, "more than at any time in our history,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.270
mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads
to despair and utter hopelessness the other

00:35:54.270 --> 00:36:01.520
to total extinction. Let us pray we have the
wisdom to choose carefully."

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.860
So there's the percentage increased population
in the world's population, it's almost halved

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:12.180
the early 60s, it's continuing to fall. And
why do we--why are we so pessimistic? My think

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.380
part of the problem is there's a conspiracy
to keep the good news from us. We only like

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.700
telling each other the bad news. Here's an
example from the New York Times, recently,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:26.609
which is about an article that appeared in
the Lancet magazine on maternal mortality,which

00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:31.109
is death in childbirth and pregnancy. Which
was falling for a while and then it leveled

00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:35.210
out because of the AIDS epidemic and now it's
falling again. And when this was published

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.730
the editor of the Lancet came under a lot
of pressure not to publish from various pressure

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.559
groups. Because they were in the process of
arguing for funding increases to work on maternal

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:49.309
mortality and they didn't want the good news
out there spoiling their pitch. You can understand

00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:55.450
the motivation of that. But I think it's just
a tiny example of how there is much more vested

00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:00.420
interests in telling us bad news than telling
us good news. Another example, this is the

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.349
data that appeared in the intergovernmental
panel on climate change report in 2007. And

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:09.900
it shows the number of people who are likely
to be at increased water stress as a result

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:16.630
of four different scenarios of global warming
in the 21st century. And in each case it's

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:22.440
over a billion people who are likely to be
at increased water stress. But what they didn't

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:27.920
say in the 2007 report was that the paper
from which they got this data also had the

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.080
number of people that would be decreased water
stress as a result of each of these warming

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.290
scenarios. And not only is a number greater
in every case but its greatness the difference

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:45.080
is greatest in the warmest cases. So again
this is telling us only half the story. The

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.180
intergovernmental panel on climate change
uses economic assumptions to try and work

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:54.090
out how much carbon dioxide is going to be
produce in this century. And they--and this

00:37:54.090 --> 00:38:00.180
is some of the--these are their four scenarios
for what GDP per capita will look like. And

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.140
obviously the highest scenario is the one
that produces the most carbon dioxide. But

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:12.039
it's worth reflecting that these are showing
increases in average GDP per capita of the

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:17.930
citizen's of the world between four and 18
times. And if we went on like we did in last

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:24.880
50 years then the average citizen of the world
would be nine times as rich--corrected for

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:36.530
inflation--in 2100 as he was in 1990. That's
a fairly interesting number, I think. I'm

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:40.470
just going to give you one example of why
I'm not that worried about climate change

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:45.950
one of many and are lots of reasons and lots
of subjects to discuss about this and I'm

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:52.200
not going to go into all of them in the depth.
But A. I don't see that climate change is

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:57.099
happening particularly fast, and I know that's
an un—an exceptional thing to say. And B.

00:38:57.099 --> 00:39:01.430
I see no reason why human ingenuity is not
likely to lead to our ability to adapt to

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:06.770
it. As long as we take precautions and invest
in new technologies. Here's an example, this

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:16.840
is the United States average temperature over
the last century. And the rural data is a

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.980
dark blue line and urban data is the pink
line. So very clearly you can see the postwar

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:29.990
heat island effect. How okay sorry the color
is completely different. The blue line is

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:41.279
urban data and the black line is the rural
data. What a strange projector you have here

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:46.630
[laughs, audience laughs]. It looks quite
different on my screen. So you can see the

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:52.170
urban heat island effect--which we all know--which
is the cities with all the concrete get warmer

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:57.510
than the countryside. But that's the unadjusted
raw data. When that stuff is published and

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:06.859
put into the international record, the rural
data is adjusted upwards rather than urban

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:12.000
data adjusted downwards. I find that very
puzzling. But either way it's not particularly

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.380
fast change in temperature. And here's why--even
on theoretical grounds--I think it's perfectly

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.829
legitimate to be a complete believer in the
greenhouse effect, as I am. And still not

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:28.200
be convinced that were in the face of catastrophic
warming in this century had anything like

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:35.849
a high probability. Everybody agrees on how
much warming a doubling of carbon dioxide

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:41.290
will produce and its about a degree. But the
3° prediction that we're all given from the

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.329
intergovernmental panel on climate change
comes from a water vapor feedback and two

00:40:45.329 --> 00:40:50.900
extra degrees. And that comes about because
the 1° will produce more evaporation therefore

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.570
there'll be more water in the air and water
is a greenhouse gas too, fair enough. But

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:01.740
water also forms clouds and clouds can reflect
sunlight back into space. And some of the

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.170
data that is now coming in a showing that
that water vapor feedback is not likely to

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.740
be so large. And it may not even be positive
in all it may even be negative. In which case,

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.829
the net warming would be less. So there's
no disagreement about the blue bit there is

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:19.880
huge disagreement about the green bits and
therefore there's big disagreement about the

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:25.970
red bit that were facing. Anyway, I didn't
want to get bogged down on climate change.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:29.970
I just wanted to give you a couple reasons
why--after looking at as much of it is possible--I

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:36.690
have come to the conclusion that, yes it's
possible that we face catastrophe but, no

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:44.420
I'm not yet worried that is likely. Of course
all this optimism is no good because optimism

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:50.510
sounds silly and pessimism sounds wise "I've
observed," said John Stuart Mill,"that not

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.160
the man who hopes when others despair but
the man he despairs when others hope is admired

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.789
by a large class of persons as a sage."

00:41:58.789 --> 00:41:59.789
Thank you very much.

00:41:59.789 --> 00:42:00.789
[audience applause]

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:12.089
&gt;&gt;male presenter #2:Alright if you have some
questions just gather at the microphone here.

00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:15.320
Yup, that one there.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:22.619
&gt;&gt;man in audience#1: Hi. I noticed that you
didn't mention anything about the topic of

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:29.520
energy. Obviously it's important questions,
I'm wondering why he skipped that. You know,

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.670
if you have bacteria in a petri dish and a
supply of energy you will see growth. And

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:40.349
a lot of the charts you showed for progress--if
you plot progress--some measure of progress

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:45.460
as a present danger of availability of cheap
energy, some of the commentators have said

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:51.760
that is actually falling if you plot GDP versus
available resources in terms of oil or whatever.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.710
Ridley: Yeah, yeah. It's a very good question
and in the longer version of this talk I do

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:01.420
have some charts on energy. You are absolutely
right, cheap energy made this possible. The

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.630
reason the last 200 years have been so good--we
had improvements before that--but the last

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:11.619
200 years have been so good because the inexhaustible
fossil fuels that did not get more expensive

00:43:11.619 --> 00:43:17.589
the more you used them like wood did, like
charcoal did, coal in particular came along

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:22.559
in the industrial Industrial Revolution in
Britain. It turned out there were--as it were--limitless

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:27.530
supplies of coal at the same price and eventually
the price even fell for most. So, yes cheap

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:32.079
energy makes all the difference. And each
of us sitting here today consumes the equivalent

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:40.079
in fossil fuel energy or at least electricity
and other kinds of energy of having roughly

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:47.900
600 slaves in the back room on exercise bicycles
working for us. Which was how you had a rich

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.220
lifestyle if you were a Bronze Age emperor
of course. You actually literally had the

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.680
600 slaves working for you.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.740
So, in that sense I think the appearance of
cheap energy has made an enormous impact on

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:06.539
our lives. And enabled us to work for each
other in a way that doesn't involve the exploitation

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:10.680
of people to the same extent. So that's one
point. But the second point is will it all

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:19.119
run out? Will all come grinding to a halt
very soon? And I think in terms of the three

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:27.019
big sources of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and
gas which give us about 88% of the world's

00:44:27.019 --> 00:44:33.231
energy use at the moment. Therefore, they're
the big ones to talk about. There's no question

00:44:33.231 --> 00:44:37.140
that there's enough coal to last for many
centuries yet. It's simply a matter of how

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.990
deep you dig. And there are all sorts of ways
coming on stream for getting down to deeper

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.460
seams of coal and getting gas out of them
rather than having to dig out the coal themselves.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:51.010
So, I don't think there's any chance of running
out of coal. At least not before we've invented

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.390
things to take its place.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:57.099
Gas had looked a little more finite until
a few years ago. The shale gas revolution

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:01.029
that has transformed the United States gas
supplies is quite extraordinary. In the last

00:45:01.029 --> 00:45:07.180
five or 10 years America has gone from thinking
it had about 20 to 30 years of gas left to

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:13.490
realizing it's probably got 50 to 150 years
of gas left, because of the ability to get

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.740
gas outs of shale. And that's a relatively
cheap technology, and now they're trying it

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.851
in Europe and they're expecting to find huge
reserves of the stuff in China too. So it's

00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:26.359
not looking like gas is going to run out anytime
soon. And by the way gas is a low carbon fuel

00:45:26.359 --> 00:45:33.420
compared with coal and oil. CH4, you're burning
a lot more hydrogen than carbon when you burn

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.420
it.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.510
Oil looks more finite. It looks like were
going to run out of oil a lot sooner than

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:43.130
we are of the others. Not literally runs out
because there are huge reserves of very expensive

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:49.460
forms of oil like the tar sands in Alberta
and so on. They really will last 100-200 years

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:54.619
at some point but at a price. And I think
there is no question, at some point we are

00:45:54.619 --> 00:46:02.349
likely to see oil getting more and more expensive.
The question is will that actually start to

00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:10.849
pinch off human living standards before we
have invented cheap alternatives? And I don't

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:16.359
think it will because I think for a start
you can substitute cheap gas for a lot of

00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:22.829
the uses of oil. You can make petroleum out
of coal if necessary. You know, we're leaving

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:26.770
aside the sort of climate consequences to
all of this. I'm just talking about the costs

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:34.799
of energy. So I rather support what, I've
forgotten his name, the guy who's just written

00:46:34.799 --> 00:46:38.359
a book called Power Hungry. It says--which
is--this century is going to be "N2N", as

00:46:38.359 --> 00:46:47.779
he calls, it natural to gas and nuclear. That's
sort of the--the source of most of our energy

00:46:47.779 --> 00:46:55.460
in this century. Long answer, good question.
Thanks for the question.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:01.811
&gt;&gt;man in audience #2: You had a good statistic
on homicide rates, but I'm curious about wars.

00:47:01.811 --> 00:47:06.829
Do you have any statistics on say, you know,
per capita the number of people that die in

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:07.829
wars?

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:12.029
&gt;&gt;Matt Ridley: Yeah, that's a really good
question. The answer is, you know the 20th

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:19.369
century deaths per capita in wars were bad.
I don't need to tell you that you already

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:24.819
knew that. 200 million people killed in wars
in the 20th century compared with many fewer

00:47:24.819 --> 00:47:29.519
in the 19th century. But nearly all of that
happened in the first half of the 20th century.

00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:32.680
There were about 20 million people killed
in wars in the second half of the century

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:39.480
about 180 million in the first half. So, you
know, we went to a very very bad 50-year patch.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:47.460
But even if you take that 50 years and you
say this is your probability of dying in war.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.370
It was roughly 1/10 of your probability of
dying in war you lived in a hunter gatherer

00:47:52.370 --> 00:48:00.510
society in Brazil or Papua New Guinea. Hunter-gatherer
warfare is a low grade thing with a lot of

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:05.569
skirmishing and a lot of posturing and the
odd throwing of things that results in a surprisingly

00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:10.410
large number of deaths per head of population,
even compared with industrialized warfare

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:16.930
in the 20th century. So yeah, by 1950 the
trend had got a lot worse on wars over the

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:20.700
last couple of hundred years. It looks like
it's gotten a lot better again in the last

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.059
50 years. Which we will go in this century
I don't know. But it's a you know, it's wise

00:48:26.059 --> 00:48:29.609
to be cautious, about that I agree.

00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:35.690
&gt;&gt;man in audience #3: Do we have time for
one more question...

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:41.990
&gt;&gt;man in audience #3: You say you're an optimist's,
but do you functioned as a futurist as well.

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.599
Do you subscribe to the singularity or anything
like this?

00:48:44.599 --> 00:48:48.849
&gt;&gt;Matt Ridley: Well, it's a good question,
and I'm looking at Stephen because we were

00:48:48.849 --> 00:48:56.440
talking about this earlier. And the answer
is that I kind of duck that at the end of

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.529
the book. In other words, I say I don't see
any reason why these good things can't continue

00:49:01.529 --> 00:49:06.819
but I'm not going to try specify what the
future's going to look like. Why? Because

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:11.339
every futurologists I've ever read is looks
awfully silly 50 years later. I hope that's

00:49:11.339 --> 00:49:16.680
not true of Ray Kurzweil and people like that.
But if you look at HG Wells or Isaac Asimov

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.460
or George Orwell or anything, you know, Aldous
Huxley

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.019
they're writing about their own time. They're
not writing about the future actually. So

00:49:25.019 --> 00:49:30.320
for example the 1950s everyone predicted by
now we would have an incredible transport

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.450
revolution. We'd all have personal gyrocopter's
and space travel would be routine and supersonic

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.069
aircraft would be routine. They were completely
wrong about that transport in the turned out

00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:45.380
to be a technology that stagnate in terms
of rate of speed of transport.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.809
&gt;&gt;man in audience #4: And what about the information
explosion?

00:49:48.809 --> 00:49:54.559
Ridley: Exactly, and what they didn't spot
was that communication was going to have this

00:49:54.559 --> 00:50:01.900
explosion. So I feel at some point this communication
revolution will run out of steam as the transport

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:07.130
one did. Steam is wrong word but you know
what I mean. Some time around the middle of

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:14.539
this century, perhaps. But by than some other
technology will be expanding rapidly. I don't

00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:21.390
know what it will be. It'll probably be biotech
or something related to biology. But all I

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:27.549
know is that as Yogi Berra, the baseball player,
was supposed to have once said, "I never make

00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:29.250
predictions especially about future."

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:36.760
&gt;&gt;male presenter #2: Thank you. So we'll have
some time at the end of the talk if you have

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.440
any other additional questions. But for now
Matt thank you for an amazing talk at Google.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440
&gt;&gt;Matt Ridley: Okay. Thank you.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:41.509
