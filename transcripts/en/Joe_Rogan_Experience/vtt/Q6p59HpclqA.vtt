<v 1>Duncan Trussell ties a falcon on his coat.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.980
<v 0>the Joe Rogan experience podcast has begun.
Bitches.</v>

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.490
We are brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh and,

7
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.860
and I didn't really annunciate the o correctly.
Did you notice that?

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.980
I'll just skip over it,
but I just had a,
I had met,

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.070
I got some slobber my tongue miscalculated.

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.610
That's a frustrating thing when you tongue miscalculates and word comes out

11
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:50.080
wrong.
Yeah,
I feel like a fucking loser.
Especially when it happens on stage.
Oh,

12
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:52.870
that will throw you off on it one.
Yeah,
we can.

13
00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:55.320
And it can happen in the middle of an awesome punchline.

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.930
And even though the punchline is still makes sense,
people like,
Eh,
nope.

15
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.190
Cool nature.

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.080
This business on it.com o n n I t,

17
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.280
makers of Alpha brain,

18
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.760
we all took Alpha and right before the show raise gentlemen and I,
people say,

19
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:16.120
hey,
Joe Rogan,
do you really take all this shit?
Yes I do.

20
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.640
I would not sell it if I did not take it.

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.410
It's really hard to keep it in your butt too.
Yeah.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.340
You can't put these in your butt because they're made out of gelatin and then

23
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:26.620
you have gelatin coming out of your butt for real.

24
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.620
They just found out that your body absorbs it the way your mouth does.

25
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:34.270
If you broke the powder down,
if like you took the capsules out,
what is these?

26
00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:37.450
They make vegetarian capsules too,
which I don't understand.

27
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:42.280
I guess it's like you can make like a gelatin and veggie vegetarian stuff.

28
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.690
What did,
what did we mean?
What the fuck are those?

29
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.480
The outside of the pill made of?
Isn't that like a concern with some people?

30
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.880
Like they don't like swallowing pills.
They didn't want to eat all that gelatin.

31
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.480
Totally,
but gelatin is good for you.
Like Jello is awesome for you,
isn't it?

32
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.360
The vegans don't want to eat it because it comes from hoofs.
Oh,

33
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:59.710
those weak ass bitches.
Yeah,
that's the pro.
Not all of them.
Rich Roll.

34
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:04.240
I love you.
I love you Mac.
Danza you guys are my favorite vegans of all time.
Oh,

35
00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:09.210
and by the way,
Mac Danzig has his own podcast now and uh,
it was,
uh,

36
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.030
first guest,
uh,
was,
uh,
I believe gray Maynard.
Um,

37
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.290
he might've sent me an email that I need to go and review here,

38
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.460
but I would like to promote it because Mac is a very cool guy and a very

39
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.610
intelligent and interesting guy.
And um,

40
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240
I think that his podcast would be bad ass.
Luke Rockhold,

41
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:30.820
who's another interesting cat.
So it's Luke Rockhold,

42
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.500
a gray Maynard end Mac Dansik together for a podcast.

43
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.520
Uh,
so I don't know where you would get that,
but if you go to Mac,

44
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:43.150
Dan's six Twitter,
which is Mac Danzig MMA,
go and check it out.
And a very,

45
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:46.270
very cool guy.
Mac Dancer and one of the nicest vegans you'll ever want to meet.

46
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.010
And he can eat our hemp force protein powder.
Do you know why?

47
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.450
Cause it's totally Vegan.

48
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080
Super fucking healthy for you on it makes the best tasting protein powder on

49
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.010
earth.
The Shit is

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 2>expensive.
And here's one of the big reasons why it's expensive.</v>

51
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.420
We can't grow hemp in the United States of America,
Ladies and gentlemen,

52
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.000
we can grow it in Canada and buy it and then bring it to America.

53
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.030
But you cannot grow it in America magazines because we are really retarded and

54
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.610
2012 the year 2012 but when I say retarded,
by the way,

55
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.840
I'm not going to stop saying that.

56
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.860
You fucking over-sensitive twats you annoying pains in the asses.

57
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.550
Don't say retarded.
I can't believe you use the word retarded.

58
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.620
Retarded is not a medical designation or distinction.
It's not.
It's not.

59
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.800
It means retard or slow or like too slow to catch up unknowingly slow,

60
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.180
retarded,
get it.
You know what it means?
Doesn't mean someone has down syndrome.

61
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.390
Goddammit.
It doesn't mean someone who has some sort of a chromosome disease.

62
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.980
It means you're fucking retarded.

63
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.050
And if hamp is illegal in 2012 that's all it is.
It's fucking retarded.

64
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.520
It makes no sense whatsoever.

65
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.070
Not even a little bit to 100% non-psychoactive.

66
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.470
You will not tap test positive for it.
If you have a drug test coming up,

67
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.920
they'll tell you you have to not eat poppy seed bagels.
You know why?

68
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.920
Cause he'll test positive for heroin.
Crazy.

69
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.310
But you will not test positive for marijuana if you eat all the,

70
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:17.050
the hemp force protein powder in the world.

71
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:20.950
We can only buy 50 pounds of this shit a day.
Yeah,
it's amazingly stupid.

72
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.611
And by the way,

73
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:26.020
the federal government stepped in because Vermont passed a law allowing them to

74
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.080
grow hemp farmers for jobs,
for farmers folks.

75
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.530
And a real legitimate product.
I mean,

76
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.920
it's not a backdoor to get marijuana legalized.

77
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.720
That has absolutely nothing to do with it.

78
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.870
This is just focused on hemp as a commodity.

79
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.820
Hemp makes you see superior paper.
Hamp make superior cloth.

80
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.370
It's much more durable than cotton cloth.

81
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.200
Hemp has essential fatty acids.
You can eat it.
It's high in protein.

82
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.050
You can fuel fucking cars with it.
In fact,

83
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.170
you can make hemp boards to build houses and you can make hemp parts to build

84
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:08.731
fucking cars and it's far stronger than steel and it's lighter in weight,

85
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.910
you know?
Yet Corvettes are made out of fiberglass.
Well,
Lotus made an a hemp car.

86
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.860
Henry Ford's first car that he ever made,
the panels were made out of hemp fiber.

87
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.750
Ms Sounds ridiculous.

88
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.310
It sounds like I it at some point in time I must be making this up.
Yeah.

89
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.740
There's gotta be some negative side of this while this shit shit is legal,

90
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.090
but there's not,
there's no negative side of it.
None.
Zero,
Zilch.

91
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.040
It's healthy.
It's a,

92
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.610
it's an excellent plant and we're being robbed.

93
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.530
We're literally being robbed by pharmaceutical companies,
by chemical companies,

94
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.670
by anybody that would want to keep enough fellow,

95
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.830
but anybody that would want to keep hemp illegal,

96
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:52.120
it's fucking maddening and frustrating,
but you could buy it.
You still buy it.

97
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.540
You go to go to on and.com you,
you buy our hemp force protein powder.

98
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.930
It's the shit.
It's got Maka in it and raw cocoa and it's fucking

99
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.780
<v 3>delicious.
Maka give you a rush.</v>

100
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.030
Take Maka gives me like three cups of coffee.
Kind of weird buzz.

101
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.930
We'll give you a bit of a hard on as well.
Does.
Yeah.
Yeah.

102
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.180
It's supposed to be very stimulating for the system.

103
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:17.260
Get your whole screen can and fat than like drinking a smoothie and then looking

104
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:19.390
down.
You've got a hard cock head.

105
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.960
If you guys heard of hot rod 5,000 no.

106
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.800
It's a natural supplement that you can take that's extracted from aunts and a

107
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:31.190
bunch of fucking other natural shit that just gives you these crazy boners whoa.

108
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.350
Like,
like,
like,
like ti was telling me about it.
It was just amazing.
He said,

109
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.920
I took it by mistake.
I can't see t with a crazy,
crazy boner.

110
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.190
I could see him with like a,
like a whiny boner.
No,
dude.

111
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.110
Have you not followed him on Instagram?

112
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:50.280
It's all shots of his six pack belly and fucking,
he's like,
God.

113
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.010
Like he's like a cheetah,
a male Cheetah.
What is he doing?
Just try and get some,

114
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:55.790
get some blizzards.
Dude,
he's pimping it out there.

115
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.610
He's rocking his 40 [inaudible].
He's got a Bruce Lee.
Bruce Lee.

116
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:03.170
Weird.
Bruce Lee.
Yeah.
Wow.

117
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.140
<v 2>Well when you oh yeah.
Well you don't eat much.
Get skinny.</v>

118
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.390
<v 3>Yeah.
That just should do action that they should do action movies.</v>

119
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.420
Packs it like the next text.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
totally,

120
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.021
totally.

121
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:22.021
That he could definitely be the kind of like a bedraggled detective that's like

122
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:26.530
kind of disillusioned with a force but ends up like die hard in space.

123
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.910
Yes.
You guys are obviously higher than I am.

124
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.220
There's no other explanation for this.

125
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.460
<v 2>[inaudible] dot com we also carry a kettle bells,</v>

126
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.280
the finest kettlebells you can get,
a highest quality.

127
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.370
They will last you a lifetime.
Uh,
there we sell them,

128
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:44.800
we sell everything we sell is cheap as we possibly could sell it.

129
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:46.570
We just started selling Blendtec blenders.

130
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.890
We literally sell them for $200 less than the manufactured suggested retail

131
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:53.980
price.
I'm more,
it's actually more than $200 less.

132
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.430
We try to sell things is the best shit as cheaply as possible.

133
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.540
This BLENDTEC blender is fucking bad ass.
Got a BLENDTEC.
They're,
they're amazing.

134
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.190
And when you get it,
if you buy it from Onnit,

135
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:07.810
you also get a free container of a hemp force protein powder with your order.

136
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.980
The BLENDTEC is,
I started using it to make that bulletproof coffee too,

137
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.630
but cause that Vitamix,
you got to like push it,

138
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:18.280
push it down with it yet it's too crude and stupid.
Yeah.
BLENDTEC is better.

139
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.180
Uh,
I use the Vitamix for awhile.
It's just more mechanical.
A kid's show,

140
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.400
it only has two speeds and you shove the thing in there,

141
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.160
but Blendtec does it all for you.
And it,
it's,

142
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:30.870
it pulses it where it like slows the,
uh,
the,
the,

143
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:34.690
the cutters down so that the stuff settles and then it kicks it back up again.

144
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.280
Like they have it down to a science and a,
I use it for a,
my Kale shakes.

145
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:43.030
I use it to make bulletproof coffee and a,
so we're selling that stuff as well,

146
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.190
<v 3>a rope around and make a smoothie with my Blendtec.</v>

147
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.660
It's scares me like,
it's like so powerful.

148
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:53.240
It feels like it's gonna blow up.
Like I feel like,

149
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.070
I don't know if I should put my hand over the top or like get

150
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.970
<v 4>away from it because it seems,
it's just,
it's really,
it's dangerous.</v>

151
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.610
<v 2>When they did blended,</v>

152
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.610
we showed her on the podcast before we ever got involved with blend tech.

153
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.410
We actually uh,
were just randomly talking about blenders on the podcast,

154
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:10.670
like to make smoothies with,

155
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.540
we had no like business affiliation with them and we started pulling up these

156
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:18.180
videos with Blendtec where they are blending up iPhones.
Yeah.

157
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.850
We take an iPhone attorney the fuck a dust and be like whoa,
that's metal.

158
00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:25.940
There's like there's metal in that in glass.
It just destroys it.

159
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.830
<v 4>I'll just,
you can I make this sounds like we're doing it.
I'm not,</v>

160
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.200
this isn't a commercial,
I'm not sponsored by BLENDTEC in any way.

161
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.210
I eat blend tech made smoothies but you can pour like sometimes I'll go to the

162
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.090
farmer's market and just throw in like random vegetables.

163
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:43.890
You just throw everything in,
blend it and it heats it up to cause the,
the,

164
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.530
I don't know.
I don't know what that is going so fast.
Yeah.

165
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.390
I do vodka orange in ice cube.

166
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.220
<v 2>Yeah,
that works too.
You could totally use it to make alcohol shit.
Yeah.
It's,</v>

167
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.900
it's the ref for making mistakes.
It's a budget.
An awesome blades.

168
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.540
You could use it to get rid of a body.
Yeah,
I don't think so.

169
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.890
I think you need to pick up a corpse.
Need pigs for that.

170
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.790
Did you hear about the guy in Oregon a couple of weeks ago fell on his pigs.

171
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.300
Felons,
pigs.
They just chewed his ass up.
That's the next thing I'm hunting.

172
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.690
I want to hunt some wild pigs.
They have like a real problem in Texas,
man.

173
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.960
I could get into that.
You in the pig hunting?
Fuck yeah.
Okay.

174
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.520
That's what we're doing.
We're going pig hunting.

175
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.220
Not really intense part is butchering it.

176
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.370
That's when it's going to get intense on a.com.
O.
N.
N.
I.
T.

177
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.200
We also have shroom tech sport,

178
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:25.480
which I should have taken with me on my crazy hunting Montana because I could

179
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:28.830
have used it going up those hills.
Shroom tech sport is fucking fantastic.

180
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:32.660
If you're involved in anything that involves endurance like I,

181
00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:33.870
I love it for Jujitsu.

182
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.630
Do it before I had my kettle bell workouts or anything like that.

183
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.220
Shroom tech is a,

184
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.120
it's an incredible supplement made from the quarter sups mushroom and it's just

185
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:44.890
shown to aid in your body's optimization with the oxygen.

186
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:48.840
It's really interesting.
It gives you like a real legitimate endurance boost.

187
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.340
Um,
and uh,
it's also great for people that go into high altitude places.

188
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.360
It helps you to,
uh,
adapt to the altitude quicker.

189
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.840
You if you go from like sea level up to like 8,500,
9,000 feet.

190
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:02.810
So sometimes people can get sick and uh,

191
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.680
we've had many people tell us that they've,

192
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.280
they took shroom tech for this very reason and then it really helped them and

193
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.990
minimize their,
uh,
their,

194
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:14.520
their problems and shifting to the higher altitude a shroom tech.
We also have,

195
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.630
um,
new mood,

196
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:19.290
which is a five HTP and l trip to fan supplement and it's called new mood cause

197
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.180
it literally enhances your mood.
It makes,

198
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.200
it's all the building blocks for Serotonin,
including El trip to fan,

199
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:29.070
which converts to five HTP and five HTP converts to Serotonin.

200
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.280
So there's a bit of a time released a factor in there as well.

201
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:36.180
And it's a really excellent supplement.
And a one that I suggest.

202
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.640
I mean I think everybody can be a little happier.

203
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.420
Everybody could use a little bit more serotonin in your life and make it a nicer

204
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:46.530
fucking person.
So new mood is again,
one of my favorite supplements.

205
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.630
If you use the codename Brogan,

206
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.120
you'll save 10% of any and all supplements from Onnit.

207
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.230
The other stuff like the the and the Kettlebells,

208
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.120
we saw that as cheap as we possibly can and we will continue to sell you the

209
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:02.050
best shit as cheap as possible.
And when you order pills,

210
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.920
if you ordering any of the vitamins or supplements that your first 30 days or

211
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.530
first 30 pills rather,
I fucked that up every time.

212
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.200
It's like you say 30 and you have to say days.

213
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.180
It's like for whatever reason we're locked into this idea.
First 30 pills.

214
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:20.110
When you order one of these fucking things right in front of my hand,
try it.

215
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.180
You don't like it?
There's a 100% money back guarantee.

216

217
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.600
We're just trying to sell you the best nutritional supplements possible and all

218
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:34.120

And if you use the code name Rogan again,

220
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.380
Go to [inaudible] DOT TV and pick yourself up some groovy psychedelic cat shirts

221
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.000
designed and created by our very own Brian red band.
And uh,

222
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:49.720
all the proceeds go to him and the desk squad podcast network,

223
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.720
which now features Kevin Pereira.
Yes,

224

squat network called pointless and he is a bad motherfucker.

226
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.310
I love that you listen to that last one.
I did not listen,

227
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.750
but he's one of my favorite guests ever that we have on this podcast and create

228
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.750
such,
such a smart dude and cool and righteous and just,

229
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:12.850

He says,

230
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.030
I really love that dude and I'm so happy that he's a,

231
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:18.370
a part of the desk squad podcast network.
Um,

235
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.450

and the poster from,
um,

236
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.820
Chicago.
Um,

the Chicago theater with also with Duncan and Joey Diaz.

238
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:42.670
And the Tabernacle was the one where I filmed my last special and that,
yeah,

239
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:47.060
that is coming out.
I swear to God,
we just waiting for the web's a lot of CGI.

240
00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:49.150
I bet this is just about the website.

241
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:51.700
The website is being redesigned and that shit takes a long time.

242
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.980
I hired an actual real professional to do it this time.

243
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.530
Let's see if it turns out to be a disaster.
Anyway,

Real good experience.
Try My day job.

248
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.450
[inaudible]

249
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.880
San Francisco,
Brian Red Band.

250
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.910
Greg Fitzsimmons and I are at the Nob Hill Masonic order to the Masonic

251
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.560
Auditorium and a,

252
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:31.561
I've gotten more than one email from really dumb people think that because I am

253
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:36.010
playing at the Masonic Auditorium,

254
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.900
it just proves that I am a new world order shill.
Yep.

255
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.560
Reptile.
Did you follow her?
Any light bringer?
Lord Lucifer,

256
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.480
I am a part of the masonic,
uh,
what do they call themselves?
Brotherhood leg.

257
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.020
They're a fraternity,
fraternity.
I'm part of the,
the Masonic fraternity and uh,

258
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:57.640
I'm in with the new world order because I'm planning at the Nob Hill Masonic

259
00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:57.720
Hall.

260
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.540
<v 4>Sorry.
You know what a Mason told me once,</v>

261
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.620
he said that what it's all about is that math or geometry is the first language

262
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.000
of the universe.
It's like the first language of God.

263
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.180
And so like they're super into sacred geometry.

264
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:17.990
Like that's a big thing.

265
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:22.040
And like the whole things based on building the Temple of Solomon,

266
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:24.950
which was where you,
how's the Ark of the covenant?
You know,

267
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:26.300
it's all symbolic of course.

268
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.630
But the new temple of Solomon that they're trying to build according to the

269
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.900
conspiracy theorists is society like this is it.

270
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:36.980
Like society is the New Temple of Solomon and part of that was getting the

271
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:41.720
United States revolution to happen cause they help fund that and also fucking
DC,

272
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.930
the street layout of DC is all masonic symbols and that goddamn obelisks popping

273
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:49.490
up out of the middle of fucking DC.
That weird thing.

274
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.810
And it's all over our fucking money.
So Yeah Joe,
we are worried about you.

275
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.370
<v 2>There is something going on behind the scenes,
right.
I mean it's,</v>

276
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.010
it's clear if you look at the design of Washington DC and folks,

277
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:08.740
you should really should look this up online cause it's not something that,

278
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.120
it's irrefutable.
Yeah.
The Grid,
the grid,
the way they lined up the streets,

279
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.800
the way they put the buildings and everything.

280
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.050
I mean it literally is masonic symbol.

281
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.820
<v 4>It is.
And it's all of our fucking money too.
Yeah.</v>

282
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.220
<v 2>Yeah.
What's up with that fucking all seeing I have of the preamble.</v>

283
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.500
<v 4>Can I on top of a pyramid that makes sense.</v>

284
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
The United States and its long love affair with Egypt.

285
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.710
Think how the Egyptians help form our constitution.

286
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.640
Yeah.
Right.
No one thinks about that shit.
That's what's so fun about the occult,

287
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.100
you know,
cause the word or call itself means hidden.

288
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.670
But it's like hidden in plain view cause this shit's in front of everybody.

289
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.290
Like all the people who deny conspiracy theories and stuff in their wallet or

290
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:54.940
Fucking rectangles covered in Egyptian occult symbology that they don't even

291
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:55.774
think about.

292
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.790
<v 2>For folks who don't know the,
what the symbols are in Washington DC,</v>

293
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:05.120
the way it's set up is one of them is uh,
uh,
uh,

294
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.790
Lucifer,
uh,
uptight upside down Pentagram.
Sure.

295
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.380
I mean,
so the horns stick up in the air.
I mean there's,
that's,
that's there,

296
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.680
I mean they did design this,
they really did design the streets like this.

297
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.720
And the other one is,
um,

298
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.990
like that masonic symbol that looks like a measuring device.

299
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.050
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah.
That,
that means a lot.
But yeah,
that's why,</v>

300
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:27.760
that's why they liked that because they're trying,

301
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:32.970
what they're trying to do is to sort of articulate the primary,

302
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.350
um,
the,
the,
the very first way that the universe form,

303
00:17:38.351 --> 00:17:43.351
which is through geometry or through like a cascade of like specific physical

304
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.760
laws that are based on math.
It's super fucking cool,
man.
I mean,

305
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.800
that's what masons are.
Well,
that's what a Mason told me at a wedding.

306
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:55.870
I don't know.
He's drunk too.
I don't know.
Yeah.

307
00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.650
I met a drunk mason at a,
at an oak show,
at the laugh factory in Houston,

308
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.220
uh,
showing me his mason ids and shit.
And I'm like,

309
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:08.520
what the fuck is being a mason?
What do you,
what do you guys do?
It's like,
Oh man,

310
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:11.910
it's just secret society,
you know,
hung out together.
Yeah.
He was,

311
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:15.540
wasn't got together.
We had to rituals where you come out of a fucking coffin.

312
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:17.040
I know that happens.
Okay.

313
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:22.041
But how much power do you really think they have wheeled try to use?

314
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.090
Is there really anything to what they're doing or is like being a mason?

315
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:31.770
Just fun.
Uh,
I began an elk's lodge.
I've heard there's bunches,

316
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.450
there's many different levels of the thing.
And I imagine that a lot of Masons,

317
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.920
uh,
are probably in politics.
And when you're,
when you're in a fraternity,

318
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:42.060
in you're in politics,

319
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.380
you're probably gonna pay deference to other people in your fraternity when it

320
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:49.350
comes to working together to make laws happened or whatever you're up to.

321
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.850
So I I a lot of people say it's a waning population that,

322
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.720
that the masons are kind of like dying out because fewer young people are

323
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.300
signing up because they don't recruit.

324
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.620
So to become a mason you have to ask a mason so you have to go to the masonic

325
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.690
lodge and be like I want to become a Freemason.

326
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.950
And then they do like background checks on you and so that become masons?
Yes.

327
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:12.990
Let's do it.
I've,
I think it'd be a blast.

328
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.440
What do you think is good about being a mason?
I think ceremony is,

329
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:17.770
people are going nuts right now in front of them.

330
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.480
<v 5>Peter,
it's fucking shoes.
He's a fucking new world order shields.</v>

331
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.170
Where's the Alex Jones hotline number?
I need to call him.
Right.

332
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.390
Joe Rogan has publicly admitted on his show.

333
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.860
He is amazing.

334
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.640
He has Duncan Trussell on it talks about how wonderful it is to be a main fan

335
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.370
and spreading propaganda from this information about Mason's being about

336
00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:46.300
geometry.

337
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.900
They're about control or about taking your soul.

338
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.790
Why you see gentlemen going to stand for,

339
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.230
well

340
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.040
<v 4>man,
I don't know.
You know,
who knows.
I think uh,
ceremony is a,</v>

341
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:07.410
c is something that is missing from a lot of people's wives in our culture

342
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.500
because it's so goddamn weird.
And I'm like,
someone wants to get married.
Yeah,

343
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.470
yeah,
I guess so.
Yeah.
Someone wants to get man,
well that is that definitely,

344
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:18.780
that is definitely a ceremony.
But like,
you know,

345
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:22.080
there's a lot of other ceremonies to that aren't quite so,
uh,

346
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.110
based on like on stupid shit.
But I mean there,

347
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.340
but they are like,
there's their,
their psychedelic man.

348
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:31.910
And like I read this somewhere,
I don't remember who said it,
but it was uh,

349
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.910
an interesting point,

350
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:37.770
which is that a rock show is a ceremony and this sense that you're going to this

351
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.820
too to watch people on stage crew like doing like songs which are a kind of

352
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.860
chant that everyone already knows and you're taking psychedelics to go enjoy

353
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:49.030
this thick.
So it's like that,
you know,

354
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.990
that Youngian idea that like there's just certain basic things that tend to

355
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:55.390
repeat through all different cultures.

356
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.000
And the way it's repeated in our culture is more through,

357
00:20:58.001 --> 00:21:01.450
I'm going to go see a rock show and dress in a certain way and take a

358
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:05.320
psychedelic and trip out and have a kind of transcendent experience that comes

359
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.330
through the music.
But it used to be like,

360
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:09.850
there's more formal versions of that idea,

361
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.720
which is like you take a psychedelic and then you do a series of like

362
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.680
intonations or whatever the fuck it is depending on what religion or cult urine.

363
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.280
And that creates a kind of transcendent connective experience,

364
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.020
which I think is fucking awesome.

365
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.150
And it's fun to just watch regardless of whether or not you believe in what that

366
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:30.550
red religion or ritual is trying to invoke.

367
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.540
It's just cool to watch that form of dance and movement happen.

368
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.510
<v 2>It's a funny way of putting it because most people would never think of ceremony</v>

369
00:21:38.511 --> 00:21:42.170
that way and I think what would a lot of these people that are freaking out

370
00:21:42.171 --> 00:21:43.850
about masons and all this,

371
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:49.150
I think people are nervous about any group that that moves in secrecy.

372
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.640
You know like that was a one of the Kennedy's speeches.

373
00:21:52.641 --> 00:21:57.390
Remember that say societies,
he should not be tolerated.
Remember that?

374
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.350
I don't remember what the,
the actual speech was,

375
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:03.950
but I wonder what that was in reference to bronze CDFI.
She could pull it up.

376
00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:06.330
Pull it up.
It's Kennedy on secret society.

377
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.720
<v 4>Laser in the middle of your forehead is so crazy.
Look,
yeah,
I know.</v>

378
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.280
It keeps popping.
It's like right on here.

379
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.860
<v 2>Not The fact that I'm wearing sunglasses and dressing at NASA out.</v>

380
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.400
What a weight pull up candidate.
What?
Where are we bombing?

381
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.870
I sent you my son tripping out Kennedy on secret societies.

382
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:29.870
Pull up the video.
Kennedy on secret societies,
you know,
I think,
um,

383
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.900
we learned a lot from those early guys.

384
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.740
Early presence for they learned how to shut them up.
You know,

385
00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:38.170
when Eisenhower was talking about the military industrial complex and giving

386
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:41.140
that speech the,
I'll never fucking forget that speech,

387
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.990
that that is not that I saw when I would happen,
but it,

388
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:49.670
<v 6>I guess the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are</v>

389
00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:56.441
as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies,

390
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.300
the secret oaths and a secret proceedings.

391
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.230
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of

392
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.320
pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.

393
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.790
Even today,

394
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.400
there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating

395
00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:24.090
its arbitrary restrictions.
Even today,

396
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.640
there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions

397
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.080
do not survive with it.

398
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.980
And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security

399
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:43.310
will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of

400
00:23:43.771 --> 00:23:46.040
official censorship and concealment.

401
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.940
That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no

402
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.870
official of my administration where there is rank is high or low civilian or

403
00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:58.470
military shoot.

404
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.490
Interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle

405
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:04.754
dissent,

406
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.210
to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts

407
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:15.881
they deserve to know what we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and

408
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:22.511
ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its

409
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:28.751
sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on severity one instead

410
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:35.681
of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night

411
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.990
instead of armies by day.

412
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.890
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the

413
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:47.600
building of a tightly knit,

414
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.830
highly efficient machine that combines military,

415
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.310
diplomatic intelligence,
economic,

416
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.070
scientific and political operations.

417
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:03.740
Its preparations are concealed,
not published.
It's mistakes are buried,

418
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.450
not headlined.
Its dissenters are silenced,
not praised.

419
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.290
No expenditure is questioned.
No rumor is printed.

420
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.150
No secret is revealed.

421
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.100
No president should fear public scrutiny of his program.

422
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.070
For from that scrutiny comes understanding.

423
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.490
And from that understanding comes support or opposition and both are necessary.

424
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.730
I am not asking your newspapers to support an administration,

425
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.990
but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the

426
00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:41.420
American people for I have complete confidence

427
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.460
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

428
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:51.060
<v 6>and the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully
informed.</v>

429
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.490
<v 8>That's a scary fucking at all.
No,
I'm sorry.
Well,
it's chilling.</v>

430
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.310
Scary about that video is that that guy got murdered.

431
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.620
<v 4>Yeah.
You got to start wearing a fucking helmet.</v>

432
00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:01.360
If you're going to give a speech like that,

433
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.400
what do you think it's like to actually be there

434
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.260
<v 8>president?</v>

435
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.310
Do you think that you just immediately meet with bankers and finance ears and

436
00:26:08.311 --> 00:26:12.030
they just establish your agenda like right off the bat?
I mean,

437
00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:16.500
it's pretty obvious that he was warning us about some shit that he used in

438
00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:19.500
countering,
you know,
he was the president.
Yeah.
I think

439
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.700
<v 4>he was sort of experiencing the IX,</v>

440
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.550
the growth of the CIA.
The CIA was starting to,
uh,

441
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.510
turn into this monster that they couldn't control anymore.

442
00:26:30.511 --> 00:26:33.960
I was starting to expand and stretch out and doing that thing that big

443
00:26:33.961 --> 00:26:38.961
organizations do or they try to keep themselves alive by making up shit.

444
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.180
You know that thing where like they're not necessary anymore,

445
00:26:42.181 --> 00:26:44.100
but it doesn't matter.
Just want the power.

446
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.260
<v 2>Yeah.
That's what people don't understand.</v>

447
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:49.680
When you start talking about the government started talking about like,

448
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:50.730
well what's the government?

449
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:54.630
You know the government is going to be either Mitt Romney or Barack Obama.
Yeah.

450
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.750
Not so much.
There's a whole secret government.
There's a,

451
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.040
there's a whole CIA thing.

452
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:01.590
It doesn't have to report to anybody could basically do whatever the fuck it

453
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:03.120
wants,
changes laws.

454
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.080
That's the real government now and that's just like exactly what our founding

455
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:09.810
fathers were trying to avoid.
Having one of those

456
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.410
<v 4>great book called acid dreams that I'm reading,</v>

457
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:17.940
which is about the CIA and how they were the ones who got LSD and they're the

458
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:22.200
ones who this CIA basically started the psychedelic revolution in the 60s,

459
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.550
or was part of the start of that because they started doing LSD tests on college

460
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:30.960
kids.
And so they're the ones who got it into the,
into our society.

461
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:33.930
And it's a fascinating read because LSD,

462
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.950
whenever it gets into whatever group it gets into and it's such a potent

463
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:41.990
chemical,
it starts transforming the group and changing the way the group thing.

464
00:27:41.991 --> 00:27:46.260
So a lot of people in the CIA or were taking LSD because that was part of the

465
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.970
deal is they would dose their agents to get them ready for the eventuality of

466
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:55.200
potentially being,
uh,
given a truth serum or some kind of psychedelic brew.

467
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.710
So you would go to work as an agent and all of a sudden just start fucking

468
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:00.900
tripping cause they dosed your drink.

469
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.880
<v 2>You know,
who was a part of the Harvard LSD experiments to Ted Kaczynski,
right.</v>

470
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:09.470
So Unabomber,
yeah,
they fraud that dude's brain.
Yeah,
exactly.

471
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.410
That dude's brain and made him see the eventual takeover by,

472
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.390
by technology.
He was terrified of the takeover of technology,
of the human race,

473
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.400
and he really literally felt like he was protecting the human race by murdering

474
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.990
people who were innovators.

475
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:30.190
<v 4>Imagine having a hardcore psychedelic experience on Sandoz LSD straight from</v>

476
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:35.280
fucking Albert [inaudible],

477
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.300
Albert Hofmann sneaker just juiced out of his socks into vials and send to the

478
00:28:40.431 --> 00:28:44.300
CIA.
Imagine having that trip.
But you're a CIA agent.

479
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.190
You work in one of the most covert organizations on earth with people who are

480
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:54.180
trained to kill and poison and take cyanide pills if they have to.

481
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.520
Death bills,
imagined being tripping and that kind of environment.

482
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.330
That's fucking insane,
man.
That would be the worst trip.
And I,
in this book,

483
00:29:02.331 --> 00:29:06.960
it talks about one of these agents like ended up committing suicide because his

484
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.600
mind just couldn't handle what it was like to be part of that web of insanity.

485
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.130
And the Senate did trials with the CIA for these ridiculous experiments that

486
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:19.370
they were doing.
Uh,
some of which involved.

487
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.910
Did I tell you about the sleeping room?
Did I tell you about the no.

488
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.700
So they would go into,
they were doing this shit,
uh,

489
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.810
mental health facilities and insane asylums.
Um,

490
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.400
and what they would do is they would take people and they would drug them.

491
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.990
They would put them into an induced coma for a month straight.

492
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.640
It was called the sleeping room.

493
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.290
They put you in an induced coma for a month straight and have headphones on and

494
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:49.210
try to reprogram who you are as a person to wipe your fucking identity or

495
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:52.450
replace your identity with some new thing.
Because if you can do that,

496
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.900
then you create this like wonderful fucking operative.

497
00:29:55.901 --> 00:30:00.460
Like you get to just make a person,
you know,
get rid of all that Pesky fucking,

498
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:04.450
the memories of their parents and whatever the fuck they think they are or

499
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:07.550
whoever the,
and they can do this chemically.
Well,
no,
no,
no.

500
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.930
This shit got shut down because it's so unethical.
But where it gets weird,

501
00:30:10.931 --> 00:30:14.650
and we talked about this on the phone is a,
in Guantanamo Bay,

502
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.350
they've been giving people six times the appropriate dose of Laurium,

503
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.560
which is this medication that you give people from malaria that has negative

504
00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:26.980
psychoactive effects.
Specifically.
It gives people amnesia.

505
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.900
My friend just fucking got an Amnio,
wrote a book on getting Amnesia and India,

506
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.050
uh,
euro,
he's wrote a book called the answer to the riddle as me.

507
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.220
His name's David Mclain,
but he went to India,
took Laurium,

508
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.240
uh,
which is a drug that is illegal in some countries.

509
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.250
It's a drug that came from a partnership between what's that big pharmaceutical

510
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:52.630
company,
Hoffman de la Roche or whatever the fuck the name is.
And um,

511
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.351
uh,

512
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:57.430
the military made this shit to fight Larry and Larry Holmes sits in your liver,

513
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.330
but sometimes it crosses the blood brain barrier and when that happens,

514
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.660
it mouth fucks your brain.
It just,

515
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:09.661
the mouth fucks your brain until you start having these shitty fucking dreams.

516
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.720
And then if,
if it really goes wrong,
you can have what happened to my friend,

517
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:17.530
which is complete and absolute amnesia.

518
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.790
No memory of who you are.
No memory of where you are,
how you got there,

519
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:25.810
who your family is,
anything.
No memory of anything.

520
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:29.920
This happened to him in a fucking train station in India where he said that they

521
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.690
were having,
like they would have English,

522
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.560
which he could understand on the TVs and then it would switch to like Hindi.

523
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.220
It would switch to other languages and he thought when it switched to other

524
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:39.671
languages,

525
00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:44.380
he was hallucinating and the English was like warping and turning into something

526
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:48.850
else.
He didn't even know that these are other languages.
That's how gone he was.

527
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.630
He decked a fucking nurse dude.
Whoa.
Decked to nurse.

528
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:55.300
He was strapped down nurse or a female nurse.

529
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.680
He was strapped down in the fucking bed in an insane asylum in India.

530
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.840
He said that Jim Henson,

531
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:05.790
he elucidated Jim Henson taking him on a tour of the universe.

532
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:10.600
A stand up the fucking puppet puppet guy.
Jim Henson was God.

533
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.310
He elucidated the John Henson is the,
yeah,
not John.
Jim Henson was,

534
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:17.090
God took him on a tour of,

535
00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:21.820
of the universe and explained to him that the reason he had taken a human

536
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:25.500
incarnation and all this was happening to him is because he'd been asked to

537
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:30.510
riddle before he was born and he couldn't come up with the answer to the riddle.

538
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.840
And because of that he had to be a human again.
Yeah.

539
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.371
Crazy shit.

540
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.190
But the really crazy shit is they're giving these motherfuckers in Guantanamo

541
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.190
Bay six times the dose of Larry Them that you're supposed to be getting and

542
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.280
there is no malaria in Cuba.
Oh,

543
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.700
it's called chemical waterboarding.
Look it up.
It's fucking nuts.

544
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.610
It's like chemical waterboarding.
You just get these bastards,

545
00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.470
scoop them up from Afghanistan,
blindfold him,
fly him to fucking Cuba.

546
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.800
Plast and with Larry until they have no idea who they are and they'll fucking

547
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:04.521
tell you anything.

548
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:07.640
Man isn't an incredible like what they're allowed to do legally.

549
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:11.960
Like this Bradley Manning Guide,
the guy who got a this wiki leaks situation,

550
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:15.170
he's the one,
the soldier that released all the documents.
They've,

551
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.440
they've had this guy in solitary confinement for years now.

552
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.420
Like he hasn't talked to people,
he hasn't seen anything.

553
00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:25.400
He sleeps with the lights on,
like he's probably completely insane by this point.

554
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:28.290
Sure.
Like to be without any human interaction.

555
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.970
You laying on a CGM,
so not me.

556
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.040
And there's you like with your work with cap backwards,
pharmacological,
waterboy,

557
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:41.710
pharmacological waterboard and get those fucking neurons all blasted with Larry

558
00:33:41.711 --> 00:33:43.760
them tell them their site and you could tell them anything.

559
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.050
You can tell them their crabs.

560
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:49.100
That came out of hell so fucking freaky that that's us.
You know?

561
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:50.360
Remember we used to think that,

562
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:53.480
that like when we were kids it was like that was still the Soviet Union.

563
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:57.800
Did you know they were cruel,
like the way they bred that Drago and rocky for.

564
00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.950
Yeah.
Like,
oh look,
he's,
they're so cruel and cold.

565
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:05.810
The Soviet Union does these horrible things and now we're doing that shit.

566
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:09.050
And that is that funny thing where people have this idea,
they're like,
yeah,

567
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:10.400
you know,
the United States,

568
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:14.420
we've done some stuff that maybe isn't the greatest thing ever.

569
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.330
We've done it to protect our citizens from terror or the idea that that kind of,

570
00:34:18.331 --> 00:34:21.920
that shit that we did with like injecting people with syphilis or that all the

571
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:23.630
other crazy shit that we've done,

572
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.400
the idea that at some point like maybe in the 80s everyone in the government's

573
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.770
like let's stop being assholes.
What are we doing?
What were we thinking?

574
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:34.250
Let's just stop doing that.
Crazy shit.
Of course it still goes on.

575
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.480
Of course there's still the things that are going by the way,
what do they say?

576
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.660
And rivers in politics,
the lightest ship floats to the surface.

577
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.810
This stuff you know about is a million times less freaky than the shit you're

578
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.060
not hearing about the deep level stuff.

579
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.320
That's the stuff you gotta wander about man.
Cause Bradley Manning,
that's just a,

580
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.520
that's a show pony.
Yeah.
When you see female pumping,
you know,

581
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:02.930
500,000 coffins into the Texas and they have these camps set up,

582
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.600
they have these gigantic camps set up where you're like,

583
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:06.670
what is going on in here?

584
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.720
This high fences and these dormitories and there's armored fucking towers and

585
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:16.970
shit.
And you're like,
wait a minute.
What are these rifles towers doing here?

586
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.410
Like what do you have here?

587
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.710
There's already a room and one of those things with your fucking name on the

588
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:25.640
door,
guarantee it and youtube red band.
You guys are going to get dragged on.

589
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:29.990
What are you talking about?
You're going,
I'm fucking my sports commentator.

590
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.790
I'll quit this job.
I got a cyanide pill on my molar.

591
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.930
I'm going to snap that thing.
The moment they come to the door,
I'm undercover.

592
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.500
This um,
yeah,
Brian has just been a brilliant activists whole time.

593
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:45.930
You thought it was a retard.
Brian's CIA.
I've always thought that this song

594
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.440
<v 8>that's going on right now in New York,
uh,
with this Hurricane Sandy,
it to me,</v>

595
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:53.300
it's making me think,
you know,

596
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.710
of the real possibility that I'd never really considered of,

597
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:01.330
of society falling apart.
I get really fucking could fall apart.
Sure.

598
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.080
Like this,
you know,

599
00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:06.050
one of the things they said was this is a once in a 100 year storm.

600
00:36:06.051 --> 00:36:07.830
Like it's every 100 years of strong.

601
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.170
They actually said after it hit that they'd never had a storm.
Like that before.

602
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.560
But if you stop and think about it,
it's like what,
how much fucking,

603
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.420
how much history do we have storms,
what do we have 300 years that's reliable.

604
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.090
<v 4>No,
I even have 300 year hired.</v>

605
00:36:22.091 --> 00:36:27.030
We have a hundred years of accurate temperature measures.
I just heard this can,

606
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:29.860
they were talking about on NPR but like a hundred years and after that you have

607
00:36:29.861 --> 00:36:34.150
to start going into ice core samples and tree rings and stuff to figure it out

608
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.230
and then you can only figure out

609
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.650
<v 8>late frosts and you get like a limited amount of information.</v>

610
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.150
But like this could happen.
This could happen all over the fucking place.

611
00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:47.370
Like we're just lucky that for the hundred years of our lives that we haven't

612
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.740
had more of these super storms.
The superstorms could be a regular thing.

613
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:55.000
<v 4>Well it's,
I mean it's the,
I,
you know the hockey stick idea,
the hockey stick,</v>

614
00:36:55.001 --> 00:36:57.070
which is like you've got the regular temperature,

615
00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.690
you have the general temperature of the earth and that goes on for a while.

616
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.350
There was like an ice age and the apparently a mini ice age in the 18 hundreds

617
00:37:05.351 --> 00:37:08.170
were shit got really cold for some reason.
Maybe because of a volcano,

618
00:37:08.171 --> 00:37:12.110
I can't remember.
I don't know.
I'm not a fucking geologist.
But the um,

619
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.700
hockey stick,
the handle,

620
00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:17.800
the hockey stick represents basic temperature for hundreds and hundreds and

621
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.633
hundreds of years.

622
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.670
And then where we're at right now is this insane acceleration and temperature

623
00:37:23.951 --> 00:37:26.320
which people call global warming.
And so some people say,

624
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:29.530
well the winners are colder but they,
you know,

625
00:37:29.531 --> 00:37:31.360
the global warming people are climate change.

626
00:37:31.361 --> 00:37:36.040
That's something I think the scientist who uh,
came out with this research,

627
00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:39.520
they feel like they shouldn't have called it global warming cause it's a

628
00:37:39.521 --> 00:37:42.820
confusing term and when shit isn't warm,
people are like,
you're wrong.

629
00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.720
It's climate change.
The idea is with the oceans get warmer,

630
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.700
hurricanes happen later in the season.

631
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.560
I've hurricanes happened later in the season.

632
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.870
Then they also meet up with a winter storms,

633
00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:55.810
which is what this mother fucker was.
It wasn't just a hurricane,

634
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.980
it was a hurricane meeting like a storm.
That's normal in October.

635
00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:03.610
It's like the two coming together.
It's actually three three,
fuck,

636
00:38:03.611 --> 00:38:07.720
I didn't even know that it was the hurricane combining with two other storms.

637
00:38:07.721 --> 00:38:11.140
That's it.
So that kind of shit is like,
you know this,

638
00:38:11.141 --> 00:38:13.780
people are saying it's one once every hundred years,
but it's like,

639
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.280
think of fucking Katrina,

640
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.060
think of all the different crazy events that have been happening just in the

641
00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:21.790
last 10 or 15 years.
Man.
I mean come on.

642
00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:26.791
Obviously something's going down and I think there is a huge possibility that

643
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.180
people are just going to have to get used to moving away from the fucking oceans

644
00:38:31.181 --> 00:38:36.010
or redesigning homes to like handle that shit.
While was in Montana,
we

645
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.220
<v 2>were in a place called the bad lands and we're going down the Missouri River.</v>

646
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.990
We stayed and camped mostly in this place that used to be the great western

647
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.920
inland sea.
And it was a warm water ocean.
So the,

648
00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:52.570
the floor of this area where we're hiking was all mud.

649
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.310
It was like a,
like a silt,

650
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.520
cause it was the bottom of the fucking ocean at one point in time,
man.

651
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.770
And everywhere you go as you're walking up these hills as well,
the the,

652
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.310
the ground breaks away.

653
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.210
You find fossilized seashells and they could be millions of years old,

654
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.630
like literally millions of years old because this used to be a fucking ocean.

655
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.930
So it just tells us that we have to abandon this idea that we can stay wherever

656
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:19.870
we want and that this is our home and we would camp out here,

657
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:23.590
know when the climate changes,
which it does all over the,
it doesn't,

658
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.990
the earth doesn't give a fuck if you've got something written on a piece of

659
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:28.660
paper that says that this piece of Antartica is yours,

660
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.510
you can't live in Antarctic asshole.
You've got to get out of there.

661
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.880
And one point in time people used to be able to live in Antarctica.

662
00:39:33.881 --> 00:39:37.300
They're almost positive of it.
It's a,
it's a controversial subject,

663
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:41.980
but they have a detailed map of the outside,
the like someone,

664
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:47.010
someone did an accurate map of Antarctica before it what was covered in ice,

665
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:49.570
right.
That's the only way they found it.

666
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:53.740
It's from the 15 hundreds and they know that isis existed in Antarctica for a

667
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:57.670
lot longer than that.
So it's an old fucking map.
But at one point in time,

668
00:39:57.671 --> 00:40:00.850
people used to be able to go around Antarctica and they made a fucking map of
it.

669
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.230
Didn't people say that it was tropical there?
That it was good being,
yeah,

670
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:06.820
they don't know.
Look,
look,
there's,

671
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:09.550
there's parts of the world that have varied wildly.

672
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.180
I mean the Nile valley where to giant desert used to be a rainforest.
You know,

673
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:16.090
we know that rainforests receipt in the grasslands,

674
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:20.290
we know that half of North America was covering the fucking giant glacier just

675
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:23.380
14,000 years ago,
14,000 years ago.

676
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:26.500
It was like a mile high of ice and a big part of the country.

677
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.670
So it's like all this stuff happens.
Whether or not you're driving a Volvo,

678
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.010
it doesn't matter.
This stuff is,
this,
does,

679
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:38.070
this stuff has changed radically over time before any human influence at all.

680
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.910
So then it becomes the weird thing where people don't want to admit that we

681
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:46.630
might have some part in this.
No,
it's,
it's very political.
And it's an,

682
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.310
a lot of the people who are climate change deniers as they call them,

683
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.960
are art fundamentalists.
Yes.
Very religious people.
Yeah,
you're totally right.

684
00:40:55.961 --> 00:40:59.950
You know this fucking young kid who was a marine brought it up at a Jujitsu the

685
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.760
other day.
It was uh,

686
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.270
someone was talking about climate change and he's like bap to natural process.

687
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.240
I mean he's stretching out and just Jujitsu Keon he's like 24.
And I'm like,

688
00:41:08.241 --> 00:41:10.150
how the fuck do you know?
You know,

689
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:14.140
like there's dudes out there that are studying ice samples and core samples and

690
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:19.120
try to figure out fucking what's going on with the magnetos fear in this 24 year

691
00:41:19.121 --> 00:41:21.100
old kids.
I get your natural cycle.

692
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.050
Just parroting this right wing talk radio version of what's going on.
Yeah,

693
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.850
that thing,
it's,
I think it changes,

694
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:30.640
but I also think we have something to do with it.
Well the,
the,

695
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.980
the fundamentalists have always

696
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.200
<v 4>had a real fucking problem with nature.</v>

697
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.790
And so whenever people like practice nature,
religion,

698
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.070
like when Christianity was starting to spread,

699
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.000
those were the people who are getting turned into fucking marshmallows is the,

700
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.670
what's called Pagan,
just meant country dweller.

701
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.330
It's people who are familiar with the cycle of the moon.
The equinoxes,

702
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.530
the fucking solstice is,
it's people who are like connected to the harvest,

703
00:41:57.531 --> 00:42:00.830
which is where food comes from.
And the sun,
which is what makes the food grow.

704
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.840
So was like really connected to the earth.

705
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.020
And then Christianity came around with this fucking bearded,

706
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.670
homophobic jock who,
uh,
you know what I mean?
And that guy,

707
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:15.110
he wasn't a homophobe though.
Who,
who cry?
God.
Jesus.
No,

708
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:17.540
I'm talking about God.
His kid was a little wild,
but God,

709
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.500
God didn't like it.
I didn't like it.
God does not like gays.
Um,
God,

710
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.550
according to those people.

711
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:30.080
And God certainly doesn't like people who are slurping back fucking psychedelic

712
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:32.390
brews and having orgies and,
um,

713
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.870
in the forest to celebrate life that God doesn't like those people.

714
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.050
And so we burned them.
They burned all these fucking people.
Anyway,

715
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:44.051
the point is there's always a war on between these fundamentalists who want to

716
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:47.540
believe that the earth is some kind of endlessly renewable resource that you

717
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:52.190
could just rip into and fuck up and bomb and do whatever you want to it.
Uh,

718
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:53.540
and people who are like,
no,

719
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:56.840
this is a living organism and it's infested with these scabies,

720
00:42:56.841 --> 00:43:01.841
like a bomb throwing super advanced beings that are burrowing deep,

721
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.520
deep into it's hide and sucking out it's blood.

722
00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.750
<v 2>Well,
literally vampires.
We were feeding off the blood of the organism.
Yes,</v>

723
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.600
that's what runs our entire society is the blood of the earth.

724
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.730
And that's pretty incredible.
Pretty incredible.

725
00:43:14.731 --> 00:43:17.100
When you really try to wrap your head around it that we,

726
00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.670
we may very well be parasites.
I mean,

727
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:23.880
it's like that bit that I did at the beginning of my 2005 special where I talked

728
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:28.440
about how we were like mold on a sandwich,
like the mold,
you know,

729
00:43:28.441 --> 00:43:32.100
we don't think of mold as individual mold spores.
We just think of it as mold.

730
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.780
Well,
if you looked at us from a distance,
he would look at us as like,
mold.

731
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.710
We're disease were,
and then I said,
we might be here to eat the sandwich.

732
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.080
I mean that might be what human beings are here for.

733
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.670
That might be why we're so far.

734
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.920
<v 4>We'll see.
This is the fucking thing,
man.
We don't even like the,
the,
the,
we,</v>

735
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:53.950
we are all doing similar activities that are based almost a hundred percent on

736
00:43:54.311 --> 00:43:58.120
except the accessibility of that sweet Texas tea.

737
00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:02.320
But if,
if,
and that shit comes from inside the earth and it's a,

738
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.670
and interestingly enough,

739
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:08.230
that shit that we use to fuel our cars comes from an extinction event,

740
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.180
which is really quite fascinating,
is that we fuel our society on the,

741
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:17.930
um,
end result of massive changes to the planet.
And,

742
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.310
but the pressure's causing organic matter under the earth,

743
00:44:21.311 --> 00:44:24.520
the transformative fucking oil.
It's crazy to think about that.

744
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:29.670
We fuel our cars on an ancient apocalypse.

745
00:44:30.761 --> 00:44:32.720
That that's a fascinating thing.

746
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.300
<v 2>Is it an ancient apocalypse or is it just an accumulation of dead bodies over</v>

747
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:36.970
time?

748
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:37.800
<v 4>I think it must,</v>

749
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.010
I mean I think it was whatever that fucking media or impact was that destroyed

750
00:44:42.011 --> 00:44:43.720
all those giant trees back then.

751
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.040
<v 2>Thank nuts necessarily what they believe.</v>

752
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.760
I think they believe that it's a continual cycle of breaking down of organic

753
00:44:49.761 --> 00:44:51.620
manner and converting it into oil.

754
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.050
And that's why they used to call it dead dinosaurs.

755
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:56.330
But they don't do that anymore because they realize there's a lot of it is even

756
00:44:56.331 --> 00:44:59.120
plant matter.
I think it's just,
no,
it's also why.
Yeah.

757
00:44:59.121 --> 00:45:04.121
But that's also why a certain wells oil wells have gone dry and then actually

758
00:45:04.821 --> 00:45:08.010
replenished.
Not too,
you know,
I dunno to,

759
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:12.980
to the original point that we're at is a guy wrote a book on it called a black

760
00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:15.230
gold stranglehold,
I think it was.

761
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:20.120
And his contention was that the oil creation,
uh,
by the earth was a,

762
00:45:20.121 --> 00:45:23.240
just a natural product of just the cycle of the earth.

763
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.140
It's just like something that it does and that we are looking at it like it's a,

764
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:30.880
this,
um,
this finite resource when it's in fact completely renewable.

765
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.660
<v 4>Well,
that's true.
That's true.
There's like the two schools of thought.</v>

766
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:37.470
So you get the peak Oilers who are like,
no man,
that shit is not renewable.

767
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:41.430
We're fucked.
That's going to run out.
And we're fucked and,
and there's no right.

768
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.970
What,
who's right.
God Damn,
I wish I knew you.
Don't fucking ask me.
I mean I,

769
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.850
I've just out of a sense of like wanting to be optimistic and having a rosy

770
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:53.310
outlook on things.
I love Ray Kurzwell.

771
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:57.930
I loved the idea that technology is going to advance to a point where we are

772
00:45:57.931 --> 00:46:02.520
able to fix so many of these problems.
I tend to fall into that camp.

773
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.460
Like my friend Johnny Pemberton,
he's not so much,

774
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:07.590
and we always get in arguments over this cause he's like,
no,

775
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:12.210
it's just going to fucking,
it just society's like on the brink of collapse,

776
00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:15.460
it's going to collapse.
Fuck your technology.
Uh,

777
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.590
motherboards are made of fucking petroleum products.
It doesn't matter.

778
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:21.690
Like it's so there's not enough time.

779
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:24.480
Even if we started producing solar panels now based on

780
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.750
<v 2>the amount of his,
his version of it as based on the peak oil version.
Yes.</v>

781
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.770
That's the peak oil store.
And his version is also based on,
it's,

782
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:36.490
it's sort of discounting the impact of the exponential growth of technology that

783
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.090
eventually someone will come up with a way to convert it.
I mean they've had,

784
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.480
they've got bacteria now that eats plastic,
you know what I mean?
They've got,
yes,

785
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.110
they can turn water into hydrogen and use it for fuel.

786
00:46:47.111 --> 00:46:49.240
There's a lot of crazy shit that's going on right now.

787
00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:51.190
You can't totally completely discount that.

788
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.950
<v 4>Well I think this a simulation theory staff that I know you guys probably talk</v>

789
00:46:54.951 --> 00:46:58.580
about on this show a lot at night endlessly think about,
and Leslie,
um,
I,

790
00:46:58.581 --> 00:47:00.710
I think that,
uh,
if,

791
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.790
if these scientists continue with their research,
which they are trying to do,

792
00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:08.690
the guy that,
uh,
uh,
the,
the guy at the University of Maryland,

793
00:47:08.691 --> 00:47:11.030
that theoretical physicist,
if they try,

794
00:47:11.031 --> 00:47:14.240
if they can prove that we're inside a simulator,
then uh,

795
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.200
just from understanding that,
that kind of shit that you could theoretically do,

796
00:47:18.201 --> 00:47:22.790
if this is a simulation that's running some kind of like weird,

797
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.810
um,
reproduction of the past,
if that's really happening,

798
00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:29.770
then time travel becomes super feasible.

799
00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:34.060
I definitely been thinking lately more and more that that is what the case is

800
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:37.300
because just like ridiculous things like you saying the Pokemon thing the other

801
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:40.180
day,
Joe,
the last podcast,
that was creepy to me,

802
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.440
like I can't stop thinking about it.

803
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:41.691
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

804
00:47:41.691 --> 00:47:45.590
Why did I come up with Pokemon and he had a Pokemon outfit that he just happened

805
00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:47.970
to have and then he walks in the room with it on it's,

806
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:51.680
we never talked about Pokemon before.
Never.
Never,
never.

807
00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.460
But I reached in the back of my head.
I pull out Pokemon.
That was fucking weird.

808
00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.390
See,
that's simulation shit.
It could be.
There's definitely,
well,

809
00:47:59.391 --> 00:48:03.320
our lives are very strange.
Very,
very,
very strange.
Now,

810
00:48:03.321 --> 00:48:05.630
Ari and I were talking about it last night,
you know,

811
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.670
we were talking about Ari's life now.

812
00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:12.020
Ari and I went to play pool after I did the laugh factory last night and we're

813
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:16.400
just talking about how Ari's life has just transformed over the last two years.

814
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.390
He went from being a guy who couldn't get booked anywhere to a guy that is

815
00:48:20.391 --> 00:48:23.750
living a dream everywhere he goes,
he's got packed houses.

816
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.760
They're all coming out to see him.
He's selling out like the DCM provenance,

817
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.570
Saturday night selling out big shows.

818
00:48:29.571 --> 00:48:34.280
They could go crazy when he goes on stage and it's like all of a sudden the

819
00:48:34.281 --> 00:48:38.100
world changed and went from sucky to awesome.
Yeah,

820
00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.770
and it's like he just reached some new level of the computer game and now the

821
00:48:42.771 --> 00:48:47.310
entire world that he sit his world literally is a different world.
Yes.

822
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.090
Like someone who's unsuccessful,
someone is unfulfilled.

823
00:48:50.091 --> 00:48:53.940
Someone who's trying to accomplish something but keeps meeting with,
with,

824
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.820
with failure.
When,

825
00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:00.990
when that happens over a long period of time you can develop like a deep despair

826
00:49:01.131 --> 00:49:05.270
and the way you view the world and that's where Ari was just a couple of years

827
00:49:05.271 --> 00:49:09.140
ago and now all of a sudden he's in this super happy world.

828
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:13.850
Everywhere he goes,
people are happy to see him.
He's got a big smile on his face.

829
00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:16.820
He's fun to hang around with.
He's joking around a lot.

830
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:21.500
He's super positive and he's traveling to all these places and having the time

831
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:25.910
of his life.
It's like his world is a diff,
the world is a different place now.

832
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:30.060
<v 4>Yeah,
it's,
well this is why I love the fucking multiverse theory.</v>

833
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:34.710
I love the idea that we exist in a place where every single possible event is

834
00:49:34.711 --> 00:49:38.610
happening at once.
Everything that couldn't happen is happening.

835
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.820
It's all happening in one great eternal burst of happening ness.

836
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.490
And that you can shift yourself from different nodes of where you are now to

837
00:49:50.311 --> 00:49:54.330
more desirable nodes of the multiverse,
the places that you want to be.

838
00:49:54.331 --> 00:49:57.060
And that's what goals are,
you know,
goals,
goal.

839
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.470
Having a goal is a form of uh,

840
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:04.610
visualizing the specific note of the multiverse that you would like to be

841
00:50:05.131 --> 00:50:10.131
existing in and the contrast between that place and where we currently are.

842
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:15.900
And it's like a grappling hook that you're throwing through infinity and it

843
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:20.610
lands at this place that you can visualize and then you kind of pull yourself to

844
00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:24.240
that place through action over there.
No Dude.

845
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.420
Like the things that you put in the front of the line,
like the

846
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:35.130
<v 0>not gnomes to know.
What's the nose to know?</v>

847
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.940
You're going to have to read before you get into this conversation.
Well,

848
00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.420
you have to go Google that dude.
I wish I was talking about,
no,
go ahead.
Continue.

849
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.180
<v 4>So anyway,
so the idea is like these fucking movements through the multiverse,</v>

850
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.980
as you move towards what you want to become,
uh,
I feel like a,

851
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:57.900
a symptom that you're moving towards this new universe that's possible for

852
00:50:57.901 --> 00:51:01.830
everyone is that synchronicities start happening in the same way that like when

853
00:51:01.831 --> 00:51:04.290
you're in a boat,
you can see ripples in the water.

854
00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:09.291
And when you begin to really focus and move towards a place that you want to be,

855
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.970
regardless of whatever the fuck that place is,

856
00:51:11.971 --> 00:51:14.430
if you really start working going in that direction,

857
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.030
that's when the Juju starts happening.
Weird coincidences,

858
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.080
strange fucking moments that you consider like,
man,

859
00:51:22.081 --> 00:51:27.081
the probability of that happening is so incredibly fucking low.

860
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:31.260
There's no way that that could happen.
And it's quite often absurd.
It's novelty.

861
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.930
It's like what?
You're just talking about fucking Pokemon.

862
00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.730
Brian coming out in a Pokemon outfit.

863
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:40.170
This isn't like Tesla having a vision for the fucking,
for alternating current.

864
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:41.880
It's just absurd and silly,

865
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:46.740
but it still fills you with a momentary sense of novelty.
This kind of like,
wow,

866
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.340
this place is pretty fucking cool.
I feel like that happened

867
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:55.350
<v 2>Boone's the more I'm tuned into life correctly and the multiverse theory as I've</v>

868
00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:59.800
understood it,
is also based on,
well,
one of the operating theory is,

869
00:51:59.801 --> 00:52:01.600
is that every decision that you make,

870
00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:06.190
every direction that you go and every choice that you make literally opens up a

871
00:52:06.191 --> 00:52:07.180
completely new universe.

872
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.350
<v 4>Yes.
It's like,
it's almost like we're cavemen learning like a language,</v>

873
00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.750
but the government or somebody already knows the language,

874
00:52:12.751 --> 00:52:14.790
like we're like learning how to be like,
oh,
we can.

875
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.730
<v 2>I don't think they do.
I think it's a massive mystery to all involved.</v>

876
00:52:18.731 --> 00:52:21.970
I think the government understands that they have a certain amount of power and

877
00:52:21.971 --> 00:52:23.020
they don't want to let it go,

878
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.980
which is what typically all corrupt people do once they get into a position of

879
00:52:26.981 --> 00:52:27.814
control.
Yeah.

880
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:32.910
It takes a massive amount of control over your ego to be in a position of power

881
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:37.951
and still be moral and ethical and kind and loving to be in a position of

882
00:52:38.681 --> 00:52:39.401
ultimate control.

883
00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:42.370
Like if you were in the CIA or that you ran the NSA or something like that,

884
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:47.530
to to be there and have compassion for all of brotherhood and all of all of

885
00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:50.400
mankind.
It's really hard to do.
It's really hard.

886
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.760
It's way easier to be a corrupt cunt and just sort of control shit.
Sure.

887
00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:58.180
But it is possible.
It is possible.

888
00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:03.180
If it's possible for any one person to be moral and ethical and loving and kind

889
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:08.290
and still be a powerful person and still be a strong and accomplished person,

890
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.820
it is possible to be that.

891
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.630
So it's possible to run a government that's like that too.

892
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.810
It's just they have to understand what a massive position they're in.

893
00:53:19.241 --> 00:53:22.180
Instead of thinking,
well,
this is what makes life easier.

894
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.040
This is what makes our job easier.

895
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:28.290
This is what makes it to clamp down on terror instead of looking at it that way.

896
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:33.300
If they just looked at it like literally in what is best for mankind.
Yes,

897
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.570
that's it man.
It can be done totally.
It can be done.

898
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.600
And I think that even thinking along those lines helps to change the world.

899
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.830
Like it sounds like totally Hokey,

900
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:47.520
but I think having this conversation and knowing this conversation is going to

901
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:49.140
easily reach a million people,

902
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:52.590
several million people probably over the course of,
you know,
the next few months.

903
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:57.190
Yeah.
This conversation is going to enter it.

904
00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.990
It's going to be data that enters into certain people's minds.

905
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.290
And that's the kind of thoughts that we need.
We need,

906
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:08.400
do we need an understanding that yes,
government is important?
Yes.

907
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:12.330
Police are important because people are imperfect and they need also to be

908
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.540
protected from themselves.
They need to be stopped and they tried to drunk drive.

909
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:17.700
They need to be that.

910
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.940
We need someone who can protect people from people that are bullies and people

911
00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:24.210
that fuck up and get their,
let their emotions take control themselves.

912
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:25.440
We absolutely need that.

913
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.710
But we also need a very strong moral backbone to this country that we're

914
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:33.120
completely missing.

915
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.970
<v 4>And we need our eyes,
our mental eyes,</v>

916
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:40.590
and our spiritual eyes moved in the direction of we need a philosophy.

917
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.070
Yeah,
a story.
Not just laws and also,

918
00:54:44.071 --> 00:54:48.690
but there's also the story of the government,
the narrative of the government,

919
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.040
the narrative of the news,

920
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:55.160
the narrative of like a media that's giving out information is inevitably a

921
00:54:55.321 --> 00:55:00.180
terrible catastrophic narrative and it will always be whenever you turn on the

922
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:04.620
fucking news,
it's a disaster.
And I'm not just talking fucking frankenstorm.

923
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.680
I'm talking about,
Oh God.
If you believe the news,

924
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.750
then you believe all pitbulls are evil.

925
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:13.890
You believe pit have climbed out of some fucking volcano and how and are just

926
00:55:13.891 --> 00:55:16.800
ravaging the world.
Chewing the phases.
I've senior citizens,

927
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.050
if you believe the fucking news,
you believe that there's,

928
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:21.630
you would have believed the Africanized bees were coming.

929
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:25.650
Communists are attacking.
Al Qaeda is marching into our streets to destroy us,

930
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.020
satanist or molesting our fucking kids,

931
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:32.430
and that all politics is corrupt and evil and that the entire planet is on the

932
00:55:32.431 --> 00:55:35.370
verge of some ecological catastrophe.

933
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.640
<v 2>Well,
the real issue is that there's too many people.</v>

934
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.280
There's 300 million people in this country alone.

935
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:44.650
You cannot concentrate in one hour on the,

936
00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.840
on the news without getting an insane amount of negative shit.

937
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.660
But because you're dealing with individual acts over 300 million,
right?

938
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.330
<v 4>So this is exactly,
so that's where they're,
they're at.</v>

939
00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.730
That's where they are directing the consciousness and the attention of all of

940
00:55:58.731 --> 00:56:03.650
humanity,
uh,
into these,
uh,
basically anomalies.

941
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.790
Um,
and if you look at the amount of people right now and the small amount of

942
00:56:07.791 --> 00:56:09.530
catastrophe that's happening,
comparing that,

943
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.770
compared to how many of us there are,
it's a fucking miracle every day.

944
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.380
<v 2>We've talked about this a hundred times,
uh,
that,
you know,</v>

945
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:21.000
this is a way safer time than there's ever been in human history.
Yeah.

946
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.390
But when you look at people like trying to pass laws to take away rights,

947
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:28.390
you would think that there's riding in the streets and that the world is falling

948
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:33.160
apart.
Right?
So how do you,
what's hot?
What does that connection like?

949
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:38.080
Why is it that with this time where really like things have never been better

950
00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:38.914
for the human race?

951
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:44.070
Why is there still this overwhelming need to crack down further and further on

952
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:49.930
rights and liberties and control the population more and more North Korea style?

953
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:50.764
Why is that?

954
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.990
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
I think that you,</v>

955
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:58.140
it's a trite thing to say,
but it's,
you follow the money.

956
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:02.490
And so I think that if you look in and see that,
you know,
what is it,

957
00:57:02.491 --> 00:57:07.491
48% of people in the prisons or it's drug related offenses,

958
00:57:07.561 --> 00:57:10.500
if you see like the people who are making money off of these lots,

959
00:57:10.501 --> 00:57:15.120
I mean God knows how much money the fucking TSA make selling their crazy gear

960
00:57:15.121 --> 00:57:17.940
that they have.
You know,
that's a big fucking business,
you know?

961
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:23.270
So I think it's just some people tend to profit off of the mass perception that

962
00:57:23.851 --> 00:57:27.660
we are existing in a sort of held dimension.

963
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:30.390
And there's people who figured out a way to suckle at the,

964
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:35.670
those blacks say titanic teats and extract money from it that they use for their

965
00:57:35.671 --> 00:57:37.640
own sense gratification.
Their own self.
Yeah.

966
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:41.330
<v 2>And it's a tiny amount of people.
Really.
Yeah.
Statistically speaking,</v>

967
00:57:41.331 --> 00:57:44.150
if you look at the greater number of human beings in this country,

968
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.840
300 million people,
how many of them are sucking the blood out of the earth?

969
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.120
Is it even a thousand?
You know,
does he,

970
00:57:50.121 --> 00:57:53.930
is it even a thousand industrialists and bankers that are responsible for

971
00:57:53.931 --> 00:57:54.764
wielding that kind of

972
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.320
<v 4>to tonight?
How many of them are masons?
Duncan,
Prosser,
all Mason's brother Joe.</v>

973
00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:03.790
But you're here.
But here's the thing,
man.
I think that,
you know,

974
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:07.690
the stuff that we kind of hit upon when we have these conversations,
um,

975
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.990
I think that that kind of stuff is,

976
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:16.830
if people's eyes start turning in the direction of the idea as absurd and

977
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.440
quixotic is,
it might sound that you can,

978
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:23.230
through a combination of discipline and visualization,

979
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.150
create a positivity singularity in your life where you,

980
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.500
your very being in everything around you can like almost like being in an

981
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:33.131
elevator,

982
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:38.131
going up a few floors into paradise that can happen where suddenly you discard

983
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:43.110
like a snake shedding its skin,
all the foul ness of your,
uh,
uh,

984
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.850
of the,
of the fear calcifications that have formed around your life.

985
00:58:46.851 --> 00:58:51.220
And the form of bad relationship,
shitty friends,
uh,
a negative outlook.

986
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:55.630
You can like drop all that and suddenly experienced some version of rebirth.

987
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:56.201
You know,

988
00:58:56.201 --> 00:59:00.670
this is why the Christian idea of being born again as a beautiful notion,

989
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:05.671
that's a crazy idea to play around with the idea that you can renew and

990
00:59:05.951 --> 00:59:10.951
rejuvenate your life completely if you just let go of fear and turn your fucking

991
00:59:11.261 --> 00:59:15.340
eyes away from the ghost story that these hell buzzards are,

992
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.570
are spoon feeding us so that they can sell droids and fucking Fords.

993
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:23.570
And if you start turning from that and putting your focus on this,
id is not,

994
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:25.360
you're not always going to be perfect.
I mean,

995
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:27.010
you're not going to be suddenly in the garden of Eden.

996
00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:30.590
<v 2>People who need to change their idea of the people that are actually doing that,</v>

997
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.450
not the people that are like buying into it.

998
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.990
It's way more important to have the people that are in control changed their

999
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:38.940
idea.
So how the fuck do you get to the Lizard?

1000
00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.110
<v 4>Well,
the,
to get to the fucking lizard,
it's man,</v>

1001
00:59:41.111 --> 00:59:45.000
I think that what would have to happen would be a,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

1002
00:59:45.001 --> 00:59:48.500
an exponential shift in the,
uh,
uh,

1003
00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.570
consciousness and the predilections of the majority of people on Earth so that

1004
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:55.420
people start,
you know,
playing around with some,

1005
00:59:55.421 --> 00:59:58.720
some of this fucking awesome information that's floating out there and see if

1006
00:59:58.721 --> 00:59:59.740
you can make yourself happy.

1007
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.860
<v 2>So that's where it's,</v>

1008
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:04.730
there's a possibility of technology aiding in the evolution because if there

1009
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:08.390
comes a technology that allows data to be distributed,

1010
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.220
probably wireless,

1011
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:14.960
probably point to point inside something that's installed in a person's body,

1012
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.270
like some sort of a chip that's installed in your body.

1013
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:22.070
And there'll be some sort of a wireless data network that's like an intranet for

1014
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:25.520
human beings communicate with each other and you're going to be able to access

1015
01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.550
the ones and zeroes that make up your own fucking personality too.

1016
01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.940
And people are going to have Yelp scores,
like you're gonna meet someone,

1017
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:34.940
you'll see like two stars over their head.
You're like,
oh,
look at this asshole.

1018
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.020
Yeah,
they're going to be just like,
excuse,

1019
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.550
it's going to be like rating restaurants on Yelp.

1020
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.220
You'll meet someone and as you look at them,

1021
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:46.760
little cursor over them and you'll see stars and you can't resist that.

1022
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:49.210
You're gonna,
you're gonna have to go through with that.
And when,

1023
01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:52.580
when that does happen,
then all the people in government are going to be like,

1024
01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.550
fuck,
I have zero stars.
Like I'm a content.

1025
01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.360
They're going to be forced to recognize that all the people around them are

1026
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:02.290
going to be forced to look at them.
And when the soldiers look at the,

1027
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.690
the generals and all these shit heads that are running the army and they see

1028
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:09.680
zero stars over their head and they realize how fucked up they are as human

1029
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:09.980
beings.

1030
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.480
<v 4>I remember Joe is the Leicas currencies.
Remember Facebook likes long time ago,</v>

1031
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:16.160
we talked about likes currencies.

1032
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.790
Remember when we said that likes and Facebook's a was going to be a currency in

1033
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:20.270
the future.

1034
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:23.830
<v 2>Yeah.
It could very well be,
but I think it'll definitely be a way to um,</v>

1035
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.430
to like look at a person and get a read on who they are before you ever start

1036
01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.120
the,

1037
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.120
I mean a person is directly who you are is directly related to how other people

1038
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:37.400
feel about you when you're around,

1039
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.070
you know that that is a big part of who you are as a human.

1040
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.680
It's how you interact with the rest of the species.
Well,

1041
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:45.370
if there was like a rating system,
like a Yelp for people like that,

1042
01:01:45.371 --> 01:01:48.050
that you just saw when you met someone,
people would try,

1043
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.330
oh so much fucking harder to be nicer.
You know,

1044
01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.830
they would try so much harder to fit in and they would feel the repercussions of

1045
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:56.630
having that zero stars over their head.

1046
01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.820
<v 4>Man.
When people are cons,
if you really consider why people are cons,</v>

1047
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:05.170
my theory on it is that they don't understand how important they are.

1048
01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:08.140
They think they're not important.
Usually when someone's being a cunt,

1049
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.660
it's easy to be a con,
but,
but it's because you're not,

1050
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:14.590
this is something we want to lash out.
When Hancock came on my podcast,
he,
uh,

1051
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:17.560
talked about ios skinned slurping,
ios skin.

1052
01:02:17.561 --> 01:02:22.561
How one of the effects was that it made you experience the way you made people

1053
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:25.350
throughout your life feel.
You know,

1054
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:28.440
like they talk about the life review when you go into the light and that shit.

1055
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.930
It's like they say that,
I've heard,

1056
01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:34.110
I've talked to people who've like died and come back and they say,

1057
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:36.270
it's not that you like watch a video of your life,

1058
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:41.460
it's that you literally see the way that you made the people around you feel.

1059
01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:44.880
You feel that you feel the way you made the people around you feel.

1060
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.060
And I think that most people who are Dicks,

1061
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.990
they don't think they're important enough to induce any kind of feeling.

1062
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:53.040
And the people around them,

1063
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.830
they don't even think that they're important enough to make someone feel like

1064
01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:57.060
shit necessarily.
I don't know.

1065
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.940
<v 2>I agree with that at all.
I don't think that's what's going on at all.</v>

1066
01:02:59.941 --> 01:03:02.490
I think they're just unhappy and they lash out.

1067
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.850
I think that's what being a dick is.
It's a projection thing.

1068
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:08.040
They are trying to hurt people's feelings for sure.

1069
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:09.600
When someone's being an asshole,

1070
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:13.020
they want to have a reaction just to let them know that they're important.

1071
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.780
I don't think that,
it's not that they don't feel like they're important.

1072
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:16.980
I think their egos out of control,

1073
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:19.230
which is just the opposite of not feeling that they're important.

1074
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.290
They're important is more important than anything else in the world.

1075
01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:23.440
That's where they're willing to lash out.
Yep.

1076
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.970
<v 4>People,
you know,
man,
I like,</v>

1077
01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:31.110
I don't want to think that way because I like it.
It's an ego issue.
I liked it.

1078
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.820
What I let,
here's why I like to think,

1079
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.190
speak and write the note of the multiverse.
I want to exist.

1080
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:40.191
Then I want to exist in this note of the multiverse where underneath all that,

1081
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.340
all the ego calcifications and all this shitty lashing out thing.

1082
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.320
It's just a super sweet person that happens to have been just walked out of some

1083
01:03:49.321 --> 01:03:53.790
briny swamp that consists of their family,
their job,
their life,
their past,

1084
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:54.624
whatever it is,

1085
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.860
and they're still dripping with some of the oozing stagnation of being born in
a,

1086
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.090
in a bad incarnation.

1087
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:03.690
And the way that that's manifesting is the form of their shitty activities.

1088
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.540
But underneath that fucking thing like a mask,

1089
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.710
it's just a person who like had a run through a stinky swamp and needs,
you know,

1090
01:04:10.711 --> 01:04:11.940
needs to shower off

1091
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.400
<v 2>mutually exclusive cause that's exactly what I'm saying.
The,</v>

1092
01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:17.380
the person who lashes out,
they're angry.

1093
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:20.560
You know the person who lashes out there trying to hurt people's feelings.

1094
01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.690
It's not that they don't think they're worthwhile,

1095
01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:26.230
it's that their ego is protecting them from their environment because they've

1096
01:04:26.231 --> 01:04:27.190
grown up in a hostile,
yeah.

1097
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.390
<v 4>Well,
okay,
well I'll make it obvious.</v>

1098
01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:34.500
Concession hundred percent of 100% of people.

1099
01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:37.620
Certainly there is some percentage that pride has some bike things.

1100
01:04:37.621 --> 01:04:41.180
They're fucking important.
God knows you run into people or popped up all day.
Do.

1101
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:46.080
Yeah.
But quite often,
man,
I think that that,
that puffed up thing underneath it,

1102
01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:47.490
they don't really think they're fucking him.

1103
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:49.290
I'm saying some people definitely think they're important,

1104
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.160
but they don't really believe they're important.
Yeah.

1105
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.920
They don't really think they're worth something.

1106
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.780
They don't really think that they're,
they're,
they're,
they're part of,
uh,

1107
01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.030
a web of life that that has value.

1108
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:03.680
They just feel like they're fucking worthless shit bags and,
and,
and,

1109
01:05:03.681 --> 01:05:05.190
and so they put on a show.

1110
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.441
<v 2>See,</v>

1111
01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:10.441
I think that what's going on primarily with people is that when you see people

1112
01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:15.310
that are acting illogically and you see people that are just angry with road

1113
01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:19.000
rage,
there's not a of consideration going on at all.

1114
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:22.030
And I think most of what they're operating on his momentum,

1115
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:25.480
so they're not really even thinking about whether they're worthwhile or not

1116
01:05:25.481 --> 01:05:29.940
worthwhile there.
There they're about ego there about reacting to,

1117
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.730
about anger and frustration and there about selfishness.
And when you,

1118
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:34.870
when you live a life,

1119
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.130
especially when you have a job that just sucks the fucking blood out of your

1120
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:42.430
body literally sucks the inspiration out of your soul.

1121
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:45.500
Do you want to be selfish when you're done?
I think that's a,

1122
01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:47.320
a big part of road rage,

1123
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.950
a big part of people yelling at you don't even want to give someone a few

1124
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.360
seconds to get in front of you with the car.

1125
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.230
You want to honk your horn and give them the finger cause they made you wait a

1126
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:58.180
second or two.
I mean,

1127
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:01.190
<v 4>well you're having seat,
you're having an ego ish seizure.</v>

1128
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:05.140
You're having these kinds of seizures than the way they are coming out as and

1129
01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:08.770
you being a dick,
but you're just,
it's like a muscle spasms.
It's,

1130
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.300
but it's all a fucking result of this kind of like,
you know,
unfortunate,

1131
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:16.480
whatever the fucking thing that your past is,

1132
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:20.980
is happening in your path,
your programming.
So,
so it's like this,

1133
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:25.990
I will just love this fucking idea that this is called unconditional positive

1134
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:30.460
regard.
If you ever heard this term before,
unconditional positive regard.

1135
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:36.190
So it's this idea that if you can manifest around people a state of

1136
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:39.970
unconditional positive regard,
it doesn't matter what,

1137
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:44.320
how they're acting without judging them.
Just this NCI.

1138
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.340
A lot of us came into this fucking dimension and her freaking the fuck out.

1139
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.910
Lots of us are rightfully freaking the fuck out.
Some of us,
maybe we should,

1140
01:06:51.911 --> 01:06:54.370
we're freaking out when we shouldn't be.
But if someone's freaking out,

1141
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:55.360
they're freaking the fuck out.

1142
01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:00.070
So the way to handle that as to manifest something called unconditional positive

1143
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:03.700
regard,
this is a psychological theory.
And so there was like,

1144
01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:06.160
I can't remember the therapist's name,
but you know,

1145
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:11.161
they would take kids who are like about to go to Juvie or whatever from schools

1146
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.200
and they would bring these kids to meet with him because he's a therapist.

1147
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:16.330
And these kids have been meeting with therapists their whole lives because

1148
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:21.070
they're fuck ups and so are,
um,
they're,
uh,
they're,

1149
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:21.570
uh,

1150
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.320
experience has always been one of being in offices where someone's trying to

1151
01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:28.240
change them and turn them into something different,

1152
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:30.890
make them feel bad for the way they are.
Bam.

1153
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.970
Or some kind of ethical system into their brain,
whatever.

1154
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:37.090
So this guy started doing this thing where he'd let the kids come into his

1155
01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:41.950
office and he'd just sit there with them.
There's like crayons,
shit,

1156
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:44.770
they can draw on.
They would do their crazy shit.

1157
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:46.600
They're little act outs and freak outs,

1158
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:51.100
but the whole time he was just trying to like be a person with them who wasn't

1159
01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:51.934
judging them,

1160
01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:56.530
who wasn't looking down on them and thinking of them as monsters and so the

1161
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:59.260
effect of this,
these,
this shit that he did,
it's a whole,

1162
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:03.130
I wish I could remember the name of it.
It's a whole goddamn type of therapy,

1163
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:07.150
but the end result is these kids,
their grades started improving.

1164
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.600
They started to become better people because they were in the presence of

1165
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:15.601
someone who is actively trying to like a preciate them as human

1166
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.180
<v 2>beings.
Of course.
Look,</v>

1167
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:22.070
we can all agree that the number one problem with the society is the way human

1168
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:25.580
beings are raised.
Human beings are raised by idiots,

1169
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.170
raised in a a really uncomfortable way with it,
never developed.

1170
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:33.180
They never truly developed character.
Never truly develop

1171
01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:39.620
a philosophy or a point of view that that aids them in life.

1172
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.010
How many people go through life like perfectly,
perfectly program?

1173
01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:43.970
How many people go,

1174
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.090
go through life with a really positive experience of growing up,
but very few.

1175
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:50.150
That's a real,
the real issue because then those people become adults.

1176
01:08:50.151 --> 01:08:53.300
They raised their own children and they try to correct as much as possible.

1177
01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:53.841
But you know,

1178
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:57.390
who knows how much of them has been fucked because of their childhood and,

1179
01:08:57.391 --> 01:09:01.040
and continues on.
And on what I was saying,

1180
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.040
even when we're talking about the people that run the world,
you know,

1181
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:07.610
that we need a philosophy for how human beings interact with each other.

1182
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:12.590
A code that's never broken,
an agreement between all others.
And that,

1183
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:13.011
that,

1184
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:17.180
that to me is the most important thing that the human human race can establish.

1185
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:21.290
There is a way you can be successful while having all those things.

1186
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:24.380
And that's what people don't understand.
There's a lot of people that think that,

1187
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.320
well,
you've got to do what you gotta do to make in this world.
No,
you don't.

1188
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:29.510
That's not true.
That's not necessary.

1189
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:33.180
There's a lot of businesses that act totally,
completely ethically,
you know,
um,

1190
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:36.100
there's a lot of businesses that get by without fucking people over.

1191
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.430
You just do it the right way.

1192
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.290
Life can move in the right direction and we can still have success and

1193
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:45.260
prosperity.
It is 100% fucking possible.

1194
01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:47.600
And the idea that the two things are mutually exclusive,

1195
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.900
it's a fucking dirty lie that's been told to you by crux and the world right now

1196
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:56.390
is run by those crux.
They are running the world.

1197
01:09:56.391 --> 01:10:00.410
When you see all these different bills that are being passed that are slowly

1198
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:03.260
eroding the rights of American citizens and,

1199
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.580
and slowly taking away your liberties and slowly making it easier for them to

1200
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:11.990
spy on you,
that is not someone looking out for your best interest.

1201
01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.140
It just isn't,
they aren't looking out for the human race as a whole.

1202
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.890
They just aren't.
That's not the right way to approach it.

1203
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:21.860
That is the way it should had approaches it.
And so that's,

1204
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:26.220
it's becomes very obvious that we need to overhaul the system that,

1205
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.880
that our country operates under,
that the world operates under.

1206
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:33.380
Because right now it's operating under a shithead dictator system and they don't

1207
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:35.480
need to be that way.
That's the real issue.

1208
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.180
The real issue is they don't need to be that way.

1209
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:41.660
They're that way because they're incompetent that that way because they're

1210
01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:45.560
unhappy and you can't run the world like a cut and still be a happy person.

1211
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.130
You're just,

1212
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:50.060
you're not going to have as much benefit even in your own life and our problem

1213
01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:53.330
is we don't look at the world.
We don't look at our life.

1214
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:56.930
We don't look at our existence as you know,
what is the most important thing?

1215
01:10:56.931 --> 01:11:00.320
Well done,
but the abundance of happiness,
love Pr.
No,
no,
no.

1216
01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:01.910
We looked at it as money.

1217
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.840
We look at it as money as the number one most important thing and the more that

1218
01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:09.380
you can accumulate,
the more you're correct.
That's something that has to shift.

1219
01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:14.381
Money is just simply a part of a good equation and really the money that you

1220
01:11:14.761 --> 01:11:17.400
need to be happy as enough money so that you don't have to think about money.

1221
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:19.020
It's an ironic thing,
you,

1222
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.770
you want enough money so that you can eat and have a roof over your head and be

1223
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:27.000
able to enjoy the comforts of home,
a nice couch and Norton normal shit.

1224
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.210
That that is really the money that you need in this,
this life to,

1225
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.540
to have happiness,
health and money,
to support health,

1226
01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:38.040
money to support nutrition monies,
support,
shelter.
And once you have that,

1227
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:42.330
that is everything that is,
will,
real happiness comes from.

1228
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.480
And if you don't have that,
but yet you have millions and millions of dollars,

1229
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.300
you're sick.
You've missed the point.
Yeah.

1230
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:50.640
Missed the most important part of the equation.

1231
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:55.560
The most important part of the equation is companionship,
friendship,
love,

1232
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:58.470
happiness,
safety,
shelter,
community,

1233
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:03.300
all of those things first.
Yeah.
Then more money.
I mean,

1234
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:06.840
if you really can become some Richard Branson ballers seems to have good Karma

1235
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.920
and yet has a spaceship,
you know,
I mean,
you have more power to you.

1236
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:14.670
The guy seems to have good Karma and yet still has these amazing,

1237
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:18.270
but more important than anything is the first aspect of it.

1238
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.380
So when you see someone who's fucking completely miserable and the rich as shit

1239
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:26.280
and they're evil is fuck,
that's a huge disaster.

1240
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:30.360
That's just a huge imbalance and a huge fuck up for them.

1241
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.170
Like they don't understand that you've got to give up some of that to achieve

1242
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:37.710
happiness and peace and love and friendship and community.

1243
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:39.300
And it's still possible.

1244
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:42.180
<v 4>Have you ever heard the term,
the higher taste?</v>

1245
01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.890
Have you ever heard that term before?
No.

1246
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.620
So the idea is that there's a connection.
Take those glasses off.

1247
01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:50.730
You're freaking me out.
Come on,
let me,
well,
Oh man,
they're my Waco glasses.

1248
01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:55.770
There's the idea that you can,
um,

1249
01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.820
connect.
Now,
a lot of people don't like the word God,

1250
01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:01.140
so get rid of that fucking word.

1251
01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:05.730
But there's the idea that you can connect with a kind of infinite flow of
energy.

1252
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:07.830
This is the shit that Tesla talked about.

1253
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:11.970
This the shit that a lot of people have come in contact with this fucking thing.

1254
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.920
And they have a lot of different words for this fucking thing.

1255
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:18.240
But the idea is that once you begin to connect with that thing or even flirt

1256
01:13:18.241 --> 01:13:22.410
with the connection to that thing and figure out ways to like really establish

1257
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:27.240
that,
when you begin to feel what that feels like,
that sense of connection,

1258
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:31.860
that sense of being in the flow,
being in harmony,
that thing,

1259
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:33.720
you can't buy that feeling.

1260
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.070
There's no way money is ever going to buy that feeling and it's a feeling that

1261
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:42.930
makes any kind of,
it makes everything else just seem like icing on the cake.

1262
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.170
And I think a lot of these people have just simply gotten disconnected.

1263
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:48.120
They're like a garden hose with a kink in it.

1264
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:50.970
They're not getting like an energetic flow.

1265
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.420
They're eating plastic and have this kind of existential nutritional deficiency

1266
01:13:56.790 --> 01:14:01.790
that manifests in the form of an outbreak of cantinas and it's like it's mostly

1267
01:14:02.311 --> 01:14:05.370
just because they haven't made that big fucking connection.

1268
01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:07.170
The connection people make through psychedelics,

1269
01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.060
the connection people make through chanting.
Yeah.

1270
01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:12.310
<v 2>I really don't think that you can become a fully developed the developed</v>

1271
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:13.990
<v 8>human being,
unless you have some,</v>

1272
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:17.530
some of series of events in your life more than one,

1273
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.270
that that breakdown your vision of the world and provide you with deeper

1274
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:24.370
insight.
It doesn't have to be psychedelics.

1275
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:27.640
It could be all sorts of different life experiences.
It could be traveling,

1276
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:32.020
it can be meditation.
It can be deep consideration for the world and constant,

1277
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:37.350
constant overview and a constant audit of your thoughts and the way you know you

1278
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:41.380
interact with people and your happiness and where it comes from.

1279
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:45.640
I think all of that,
all of those are possibilities.
Those are all,

1280
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:49.180
there's different ways to achieve the same effect,
but,

1281
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.110
but unless you do have those things,
you're going to be a child.

1282
01:14:53.111 --> 01:14:54.820
You're going to die.
And old child,

1283
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:59.920
you really never gonna understand that you've been tricked by your own ego.

1284
01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.960
He had been tricked by your own ego first of all,

1285
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:04.270
into thinking that this is somehow or another permanent.

1286
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.500
It is unquestionably a temporary experience.
You got to enjoy the shit out of it.

1287
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:11.140
You got to have as much fun as you can while it's going on,

1288
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.400
but you better be treating it like what it is cause it's fucking temporary and

1289
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:20.401
you're leaving behind a wake and a ripple of shit that is going to go from,

1290
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:26.070
from you onto your ancestors and your shitty kids that you've raised and,

1291
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:28.780
and all the other different people that you've impacted in your life.

1292
01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:33.100
You've created a horrible ripple of shit because you are imbalanced.

1293
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:37.960
Yeah,
but they don't have to be,
they don't have to be.
That's the thing.

1294
01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:39.310
If all these fucking,
you know,

1295
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:42.430
these guys that are in state secret societies and skull and bones and shit,

1296
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:44.860
if they all just dropped the bullshit,

1297
01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:47.620
stop being pussies and took mushrooms,

1298
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.660
the whole picture would change immediately.
You would have looked at.
And folks,

1299
01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:54.340
this is not,
you know,
I'm not making this up.

1300
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:57.820
Look at John Hopkins University studies on silicide been use and what,

1301
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:02.821
what happened to people with one siliciden and experience over the course of a

1302
01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.910
couple of years,
their personalities changed for the better.
He's pussies.

1303
01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:10.570
They need to stop dressing up like fucking eyes wide.

1304
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:13.930
Shut and bone and each other in the ass of videotape and holding each other

1305
01:16:13.931 --> 01:16:18.010
hostage with the,
the information instead of doing it that way,

1306
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.250
they need to get together and do some fucking mushrooms.
Right?

1307
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.420
<v 4>Yeah,
man,
it's,
it's,</v>

1308
01:16:21.421 --> 01:16:24.930
it's such an important thing to make this connection however you do it.

1309
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.260
Mckenna was really into mushrooms cause it's an expeditious way to do it.

1310
01:16:28.261 --> 01:16:32.890
And he had,
he was a believer in 2012 and the idea of some kind of,
uh,

1311
01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:36.540
eschatological event that was going to wipe us all out.
So we got to move quick,

1312
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.800
uh,
around dos as I need.

1313
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.050
<v 8>I actually didn't believe that he is,
his idea was ultimate novelty,</v>

1314
01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.460
<v 4>but he seemed to be in a rush.
He has,
his thing was like,</v>

1315
01:16:44.461 --> 01:16:46.380
you're not going to get people to like your,
this,

1316
01:16:46.381 --> 01:16:48.660
this transformation of society you're talking about.

1317
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.830
He may be fairly recognized that like,

1318
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:54.750
let's make this shit happen fast.

1319
01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:57.600
And the fastest way to deal with be to get everyone or as many people as

1320
01:16:57.601 --> 01:17:02.190
possible to experience the psychedelic state and bring that into the world

1321
01:17:02.191 --> 01:17:03.024
through our actions.

1322
01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:07.370
<v 8>No,
he,
he,
he didn't really believe in the end of the world for 2012.</v>

1323
01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:10.220
That's what I'm saying.
He thought it was going to be a time machine.

1324
01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.570
<v 2>He thought it was going to be some,</v>

1325
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.810
some moment of ultimate novelty that it was going to be a technological thing.

1326
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:15.370
Right.

1327
01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:18.720
<v 4>Well I write,
I,
yeah,
I guess when I say the end of the world,</v>

1328
01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:22.420
I mean like his idea was more of a positive into the world scenario but still

1329
01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:24.360
the apocalypse lifting of the veil,

1330
01:17:24.361 --> 01:17:28.560
transformation of the old ways and to some complete like complete moment of

1331
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:32.160
novelty and like he was into like the reason I'm just trying to get to the point

1332
01:17:32.161 --> 01:17:36.540
that he liked to like he placed mushrooms over meditation where there is other

1333
01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:39.300
people you say,
um,
you know,

1334
01:17:39.301 --> 01:17:44.301
the problem with the psychedelic experience is that it gets you there and it

1335
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.740
gets you there quick.

1336
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.160
But you got to come back out of that and the idea is to like how can we be in

1337
01:17:54.631 --> 01:17:58.500
that state of consciousness?
Not like the walls are melting,

1338
01:17:58.501 --> 01:18:01.350
but in that state of connectivity all the time.

1339
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.581
<v 2>Well,</v>

1340
01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:06.581
we know a lot of people that have had a series of these psychedelic experiences

1341
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:10.980
and they're still like really selfish.
No,

1342
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
we know this one guy was very angry who said a lot of a mushroom experiences.

1343
01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:19.020
I mean a ton writes books on it.
He's angry motherfucker.

1344
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:24.140
The contrary to the vision of the plan itself,
the fungus itself,

1345
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:26.400
<v 4>right?
So because it's a teacher,
it's just like any other</v>

1346
01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.600
<v 2>you can decline and ignore it.</v>

1347
01:18:28.601 --> 01:18:32.980
And also if you've got some weird social issues and psychological issues,

1348
01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.610
you can start having grandiose ideas based on psychedelic experiences.
Like I've,

1349
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:40.690
I've talked to people that had psychedelic experiences and believed that like

1350
01:18:40.691 --> 01:18:42.400
there's a whole team of,
uh,

1351
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:46.660
beings out there that are looking out for them and helping them succeed and

1352
01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.290
succeed.
For what?
Like what is,
what's the end goal?

1353
01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:51.370
Like what are you talking about?

1354
01:18:51.371 --> 01:18:55.660
Like you really believe that it's like they've chosen to like look at only a

1355
01:18:55.661 --> 01:18:57.510
fraction of the information that's being displayed

1356
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.390
<v 4>exceeds,</v>

1357
01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:02.640
see this is that brilliant too because that's the thing is like with meditation,

1358
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.680
sometimes I'll go into meditation with a point like I'm trying to get something,

1359
01:19:07.681 --> 01:19:11.040
I'm trying to do something I'm trying to get like in my mind wants there to be a

1360
01:19:11.041 --> 01:19:12.630
result.
Like you know,

1361
01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:16.830
some kind of like metaphysical tricep development or something through

1362
01:19:16.831 --> 01:19:19.680
meditation because we've been taught to,

1363
01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:24.360
to be completely a result oriented to live a result oriented life.

1364
01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:27.570
And the paradox of meditation is the idea is like,
no,
no,
no,

1365
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:30.000
you don't get anything out of this.
This isn't the,

1366
01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:34.860
it's entering into a mind state where you're no longer constantly in the pursuit

1367
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.090
of the future.

1368
01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.320
You're no longer always chasing whatever the thing is that you think is the

1369
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:43.320
moment in the future.
You are uh,

1370
01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.170
coming into where you are at this very moment.

1371
01:19:46.171 --> 01:19:47.820
Wherever the fuck you happen to be.
You know,

1372
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:52.050
fucking lotion all over your day cause you just jerked off to porn or fucking

1373
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:54.840
with beer cans all over your fucking house or wherever you are.

1374
01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.720
You get into that moment and become that thing.

1375
01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:02.820
And that paradox of being fully in that thing is that your situations and

1376
01:20:02.821 --> 01:20:07.020
conditions will begin to transform because that's where the real like healing

1377
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:07.771
happening.

1378
01:20:07.771 --> 01:20:12.360
The real transformation doesn't start with a fucking beating yourself up.

1379
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:17.190
It starts with a sense of like,
all right,
hold on.
Okay.
Uh,

1380
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.280
entry into this dimension created a form of weird amnesia.

1381
01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:23.760
I apparently have developed the fucking personality of a supreme cont.

1382
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:28.290
I've got some weird fucking hangover that came from my incarnation in this

1383
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.124
dimension.

1384
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:32.250
I'm going to shake off this hangover and the way I'm going to shake it off is by

1385
01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:36.240
fully understanding where I'm at right now.
It's a paradox,
man.

1386
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:41.010
It's something that's like a really strange thing because to get to a place

1387
01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.040
where you aren't such a con and where you aren't trapped,

1388
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:48.270
you need to first understand that what your prison cell is like.

1389
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:50.360
<v 0>Isn't that fascinating?
We seal these roles.</v>

1390
01:20:50.361 --> 01:20:53.540
Truett guys like get rid of about another one the other day who's realized that

1391
01:20:53.541 --> 01:20:58.340
his fund had lost hundreds of millions dollars.
So he committed suicide.

1392
01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.413
Yes,

1393
01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:03.950
exactly do this like strange numbers,

1394
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:07.070
these abstract numbers that are part of this game.

1395
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:11.450
And he realized that the game was over.
Wife,
kids,
the whole deal children.

1396
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:13.280
He had children.
Did you see,

1397
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:16.700
did you see the fucking guy who burned his house down and took a cyanide pill in

1398
01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:21.110
court?
Do you see that video?
Yes.
Holy Shit Dude.
He's like fucking,

1399
01:21:21.111 --> 01:21:23.960
that's it man.
He said he pressed reset cause he's going to jail.

1400
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:27.770
But like he was going to jail for a long time so he decided to take that Sinai

1401
01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:31.190
pill right in front of everybody.
Yeah,
man.
Sinai Dude fucking,

1402
01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:35.930
I looked up how that shit kills you.
It's goddamn crazy dude.
He just sat there.

1403
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:39.300
Yeah,
the pill.
And just sat there and started snoring.
Yeah.

1404
01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:43.340
Then his body just started giving up and then he collapsed.
They're like call,

1405
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:48.230
call,
call hospital called nine one one.
He's down John Moaning.

1406
01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:52.940
And
because it is or the problem,
man,
this is like fucking,

1407
01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:56.780
you know,
it's so funny out.
The Bible's rife with right,
really great information.

1408
01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:58.610
But if you take it literally,
it's retarded.

1409
01:21:58.611 --> 01:22:02.690
But the Bible is always like the god of the Bible is always against false idols.

1410
01:22:02.691 --> 01:22:05.540
And he's always saying,
you know,
don't worship false idols.

1411
01:22:05.541 --> 01:22:09.650
If you worship false idols,
you're fucked.
And people like that,
you know,

1412
01:22:09.651 --> 01:22:14.651
they started this crazy worship of a bullshit and the end result is you end up

1413
01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:19.790
in a pretty fucking crappy I extinction event happened.

1414
01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:21.110
How does this all play out?

1415
01:22:21.111 --> 01:22:24.560
Because this is all just assuming that the world is real.
Now we're,

1416
01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:27.290
we're assuming that the world is some sort of a computer simulation.

1417
01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:28.490
And by the way,
this keeps coming to me.

1418
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.240
Even Brittany Palmer sent me a tweet the other day about a computer simulation

1419
01:22:32.241 --> 01:22:35.000
code.
Very bright girl,
by the way,
even though she's a ring card girl.

1420
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:38.740
Fucking Badass.
It's fascinating.
There's a card girl.

1421
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:41.270
There's a ring card girl that's into simulation theory.

1422
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.540
Any Palmer's bad ass bitch.
She's a cool chick.
That's Jesus.

1423
01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:49.250
She's the incarnation of Jesus.
Her uh,
her boyfriends and do it too apparently.

1424
01:22:49.251 --> 01:22:51.920
Cause he sent all right.
Sent a link to these for me to read.

1425
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.310
The boyfriend thinks that way.
Great.
Great.

1426
01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.430
Handsome Fella had some very successful,
you're fucked.

1427
01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:02.570
You're not getting in their kid.
Uh,
but um,
the uh,
the,
that idea though,

1428
01:23:02.571 --> 01:23:06.070
the simulation theories going around the world,
a lot of people

1429
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.170
<v 8>are looking at it and one of the reasons,
one of the rig,</v>

1430
01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:12.580
the real big ones that sort of catapulted it was when,
uh,
this guy,

1431
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.860
Dr. Gates,
uh,

1432
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:19.890
has found hidden error correction codes hidden in the equations of

1433
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:23.980
supersymmetry.
It's,
this is really,
really hard to wrap your head around,

1434
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:25.990
but in his words,
um,

1435
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:29.860
they had found the presence of codes in the equations of physics,

1436
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.260
not that they were trying to compute something and the way he describes the

1437
01:23:33.261 --> 01:23:36.340
citizens a little bit like doing biology where if you studied an animal,

1438
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:40.090
you'd eventually run into it's DNA.
And that's essentially what's happened to us.

1439
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:41.680
These codes that we found,

1440
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:45.430
they're like the DNA that sits inside of the equations that we study.

1441
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.130
So yeah.
Do we live in the Matrix?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1442
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:54.650
<v 4>Well man,
it's a blast.
I mean,
the reason it's fucking cool is it because it's a,</v>

1443
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:57.630
um,
it's a new,

1444
01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:02.950
it's a new version of a very old idea that's being told using the current state

1445
01:24:03.141 --> 01:24:05.660
of the yard,
uh,
language that we have today.

1446
01:24:05.661 --> 01:24:10.661
But this idea of the universe being a computer simulation that Maya is,

1447
01:24:11.271 --> 01:24:15.290
they call it an India,
which means illusion.
This is a very old fucking idea.

1448
01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.390
<v 8>John.
Um,
John Wheeler,</v>

1449
01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:21.500
John Archibald Wheeler was an American theoretical physicist who was largely

1450
01:24:21.501 --> 01:24:25.670
responsible according to,
uh,
the,
the,
the biology,
the biograph,

1451
01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:30.260
um,
the biography on them largely responsible for reviving interest in general

1452
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.720
relativity in the United States after World War II.

1453
01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.190
And one of the things that Dr. Gates had said was that he thought the wheeler

1454
01:24:37.191 --> 01:24:42.110
was crazy and he believes that this experience,
you know,

1455
01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:44.000
studying this computer code and,

1456
01:24:44.001 --> 01:24:46.490
and finding out that there's code in supersymmetry,

1457
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.670
he says if you study physics long enough,
you might become crazy.

1458
01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:54.330
And that like literally if you delve deep into the heart of matter,
yeah.

1459
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.950
If you really get to the nitty gritty of what life really is,

1460
01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.590
it's undeniable that it's some sort of a code.

1461
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:02.540
It's undeniable that it is some sort of,

1462
01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.410
I'm wouldn't say it's a computer simulation because the term simulation,

1463
01:25:06.411 --> 01:25:09.500
like I joke around about the fact that I believe that human beings are living in

1464
01:25:09.501 --> 01:25:12.910
some video game in the future and that we really looked like the aliens and that

1465
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:13.670
that's,
yeah.

1466
01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:18.670
But what I really think might be going on is that the reality as it as it

1467
01:25:20.271 --> 01:25:20.871
stands,

1468
01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:25.790
has many more elements to it than just things you can hit and knock on with your

1469
01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:29.120
knuckles.
Things you could beat with a hammer,
throw water on.

1470
01:25:29.121 --> 01:25:34.121
I think there's a lot more than the solid physical matter of the universe that

1471
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.180
we are not totally taking into consideration.

1472
01:25:38.181 --> 01:25:41.450
And I always bring up the idea of the imagination that we look at the

1473
01:25:41.451 --> 01:25:43.330
imagination as well.
Can I was a kid,
you know,

1474
01:25:43.331 --> 01:25:46.550
oh he's got such a vivid imagination cause I would lie about shit.
You know,

1475
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.620
may draw pictures and make up things.
Yeah.

1476
01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.680
But what the imagination really is is this,

1477
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:56.950
this hail of ideas in your mind that if followed through manifest physical

1478
01:25:57.921 --> 01:25:59.150
things in this reality.

1479
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:04.390
So it's not simply just this airy fairy woo thing that's like this in that non

1480
01:26:06.091 --> 01:26:10.730
important intangible aspect of life.
No,
it's the creator of everything.

1481
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:15.470
It's the root behind the creation of every single physical thing from nuclear

1482
01:26:15.471 --> 01:26:18.890
power plants to guns to fucking cat clocks.

1483
01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.120
All that shit is created by the imagination.

1484
01:26:23.121 --> 01:26:25.730
It's a piece of all of that shit.
It's a laboratory.

1485
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:30.440
It's an owl chemical laboratory that exists in your mind and that's one aspect

1486
01:26:30.441 --> 01:26:35.210
and another aspect is the exact vibration you put out there.

1487
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.810
The love that you put out there,
the friendship that you put out there,
the,

1488
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:41.330
the happiness that you bring to people.
You know,

1489
01:26:41.331 --> 01:26:45.860
look we were experiencing it in a form with this whole podcast network thing

1490
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.250
because all of us together,
you know having podcasts,

1491
01:26:49.251 --> 01:26:52.640
all of us together pushing this happy positive,

1492
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.140
you know sort of vibe out there and then having all these happy positive people

1493
01:26:57.141 --> 01:27:02.141
come to the shows and experiencing a direct result of this creating this way of

1494
01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:06.590
thinking where people are coming up to us on a daily fucking basis.

1495
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.070
Last night at the laugh factory had a bunch of dudes came up to me and said the

1496
01:27:10.071 --> 01:27:14.000
same thing,
you're changing my life.
You changed my life,

1497
01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:17.390
changed the way I look at things,
change the web.
I'm like happier now.

1498
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:21.260
I was going through a bad breakup,
I was fat,
I lost weight,
I got healthy.

1499
01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:23.270
It's all the same thought.

1500
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:28.330
Re Re re repeating itself over and over and over again and that thought is that

1501
01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:33.170
you're putting out a positive thing and positive results are being accumulated

1502
01:27:33.171 --> 01:27:35.510
because of this transmission.

1503
01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:36.371
<v 4>That's right man.</v>

1504
01:27:36.371 --> 01:27:39.610
In earlier you're talking about this being technologically enhanced.

1505
01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:43.090
Well it is technologically enhanced.
This is it.
This is it.

1506
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:48.091
Your using a technological amplifier to blast positive energy out into the world

1507
01:27:48.941 --> 01:27:53.110
and it's exponentially increasing the positivity that just starts in this room

1508
01:27:53.111 --> 01:27:57.100
with a couple of microphones and that creates big fucking shifts

1509
01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.160
<v 8>and not just positive energy but a positive philosophy that you can use.</v>

1510
01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:07.840
You can actually apply and get direct results.

1511
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:10.450
It will inspire you and you can apply it.

1512
01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:15.650
<v 4>Also a philosophy that is being is open source and the sense that the people</v>

1513
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:16.920
you're blasting it out to,

1514
01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:20.220
at least my experience has been some of these people email you shit you've never

1515
01:28:20.221 --> 01:28:23.970
heard before,
books you've never heard before and then that gets added to it,

1516
01:28:23.971 --> 01:28:28.110
applied to it and woven into this fucking awesome thing which is essentially

1517
01:28:28.111 --> 01:28:33.000
just like a internet salon.
It's a kind of salon in the old idea of what it was,

1518
01:28:33.001 --> 01:28:36.180
which was where a group of people would get together and talk about philosophy.

1519
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:41.160
<v 8>Well it's where the wood Twitter comes into play is the ability to exchange</v>

1520
01:28:41.161 --> 01:28:44.910
links in the short form where you're going to read them.
People send me emails.

1521
01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.110
Jesus Christ,

1522
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.140
some of you crazy fucks that send me these 17 page emails on your whole life.

1523
01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:54.940
<v 4>Yeah,
no one's reading that.
Stop it.</v>

1524
01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.920
<v 8>Stop being fucking crazy.</v>

1525
01:28:57.130 --> 01:29:02.130
But if you send me some shit about like self concrete.

1526
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.790
<v 0>Yes.
Did you read that yet?
It's amazing.</v>

1527
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.550
Self healing concrete go piss dude.

1528
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:13.680
So there's some shit called self repairing bio concrete that's made out of

1529
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:14.610
bacteria.

1530
01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:20.060
I mean is like every day it's getting weirder and weirder and weirder and it

1531
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:22.500
just does not seem to be ending man.

1532
01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:25.980
It's all going on while we're not even paying attention while you're just doing

1533
01:29:25.981 --> 01:29:27.270
your everyday thing there.

1534
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:32.340
They're constantly coming up with new crazier and crazier shit and this stuff is

1535
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:36.420
called it's bacterial spores that are added to the concrete mix and they're

1536
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:39.780
activated by water and this experimental concrete.

1537
01:29:39.781 --> 01:29:42.240
It patches up cracks by itself.

1538
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.390
I mean this is fucking bananas man.

1539
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.450
It's con start growing feelings in the future.
Yeah,

1540
01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:50.790
it's gonna be like we can't drive on the road cause it hurts.

1541
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:54.300
Well wouldn't it be crazy if your house became like something you could talk to?

1542
01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:56.520
Hey I'm home.
How old are you?

1543
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:59.850
And you like touch the walls and it's like happy to see you and shit.

1544
01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.310
I mean that doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility.

1545
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:06.690
Go into the attic once in a while at the house.
No,
what's his boss?
Yeah,
fuck it.

1546
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.600
Fuck it.
Fuck his brain in the attic.
Well when you,

1547
01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:13.440
when you stop and think about it,
like if we do come up with smart computers,

1548
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.770
what if one of the things that we do is make your whole house like a living

1549
01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:18.180
network?
Crazy.
Yeah.

1550
01:30:18.181 --> 01:30:22.080
Like you come home and your house like literally like it feeds off of your

1551
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:25.380
positive feelings.
Like your house is like,
is it cold enough for you?

1552
01:30:25.381 --> 01:30:28.150
It was a warm enough for you.
Would you like the lights on and you're like,

1553
01:30:28.151 --> 01:30:32.580
can you turn on channel 20?
Yeah.
20 Ding Dong home shopping network.
You know,

1554
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.940
you could do whatever the fuck you want through through communicating with your

1555
01:30:35.941 --> 01:30:39.600
house.
You tell it when to turn the lights on,
tell when to turn the lights out.

1556
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.720
That's all coming.
Your House is going to be like one giant computer.

1557
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.370
You're not even going to reach for the Faucet.

1558
01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:45.750
You're going to say turn the hot water on.

1559
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:49.310
<v 3>And then if you had like an Asian Fed as you'd buy like an Asian theme type</v>

1560
01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:53.680
looking house or if you liked that,
you know,
like Western girl or like a rant

1561
01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.940
<v 0>double.
Yeah,
your house.</v>

1562
01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.980
You'd be like really like a muted Japanese lady that's super polite and shy.

1563
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:05.520
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah,
you could,

1564
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:08.850
your house could talk to you.
I mean,
it could have a voice.

1565
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.410
Do you remember when you,
this is a true story,
Brian.
Uh,

1566
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:15.780
Brian was dating this chick and she got jealous of his navigation system because

1567
01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:16.614
it was a hot girls.

1568
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.850
<v 3>Yeah,
she made me change it.
Do I guys so choose the British guy,
but then I acted,</v>

1569
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:24.240
I would pay for him every time he talked to me.
Isn't that hilarious?

1570
01:31:24.241 --> 01:31:27.480
And someone could actually be jealous of the navigation systems voice.

1571
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:31.120
That's when you know you've got a rock solid relationship.
When you chill,

1572
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.250
when you check is upset at the navigation.
This is fucking hard.

1573
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:39.240
Tell us where to go is where the Dan left here.
Oh,

1574
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:40.980
I hate this girl's voice.

1575
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.090
Fake computer was even better.

1576
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:49.290
It was like a Tom Tom and with Tom Tom's you can download like celebrity voices.

1577
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:52.170
So I started dating.
It was like Cameron Diaz or something like that.

1578
01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:54.600
But we can do that.
Yeah,
you're going to do yoga and like,
oh,

1579
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:57.630
did you guys hear about fucking star wars getting bought by Disney?

1580
01:31:58.170 --> 01:32:00.070
That's ridiculous.
Do you think that's good

1581
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.903
<v 4>or bad?</v>

1582
01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:04.340
<v 0>Um,
well look,
let's be honest.</v>

1583
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:09.080
The last star wars movie sucked a fat one.
Yeah,
they all sucked.
They sucked.

1584
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:11.120
And Ari was saying that,
you know,

1585
01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:14.210
we're just in denial that if you go back and try to watch star wars,

1586
01:32:14.211 --> 01:32:15.050
it sucked too.

1587
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:20.410
And I say it didn't suck because it only sucks today if you compare it to the

1588
01:32:20.781 --> 01:32:25.220
movies of today.
But if you go back to the,
when star wars was released,

1589
01:32:25.221 --> 01:32:27.650
it was groundbreaking.
Man.
There's no denying.

1590
01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:31.460
It's like saying that if you go back and listen to Lenny Bruce,
she won't laugh.

1591
01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:34.280
It doesn't matter.
It's still like super groundbreaking.

1592
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:38.450
Have you seen the video of the pre voice over Darth Vader?
No.

1593
01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.510
The guy who did Darth Vader's voice before Morgan Freeman did it.

1594
01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.620
I'm your father.
It's fucking opposite.
Morgan Freeman.
Not Morgan Freeman.

1595
01:32:45.621 --> 01:32:50.500
I'm fuck.
Wow.
That is phrase is the guy awesome voices.

1596
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:53.780
Yeah.
Who Was it?
The guy who did a,
he was in Tulsa.

1597
01:32:53.781 --> 01:32:56.790
Doom in Conan to the fuck's his name.
Really?

1598
01:32:57.090 --> 01:33:01.230
The guy with a black guy commercials.
Lots of commercials.

1599
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:06.560
What the fuck's his name?
Earl Jones.
James Road drums.
Yeah,
that guy.
Yeah.

1600
01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:10.460
Um,
but if you go back and watch those star wars movies,

1601
01:33:10.461 --> 01:33:12.650
like there was a couple of good ones there were decent,

1602
01:33:12.651 --> 01:33:16.250
they were great for the time,
but the new ones are fucking terrible man.

1603
01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.200
They're just terrible.
It's like George Lucas,
like lost his connection.

1604
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.780
It's,
it's really sad.

1605
01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:27.470
It's like the guy needs to do squats and run some hills.

1606
01:33:27.471 --> 01:33:31.040
Squats is not going to make star wars.
He's got a,
he's got like no life to them.

1607
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.720
It's like there's no passion there.
There's no fire.
There's no,
there's no,

1608
01:33:35.721 --> 01:33:40.370
there's no real threat.
It's just all just mush.
It's just mushy,

1609
01:33:40.371 --> 01:33:41.740
Mush,
stupidity.

1610
01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.780
<v 4>I just hope like they don't have like George,
our banks.
Like Disney's like,
no,</v>

1611
01:33:44.781 --> 01:33:48.680
we're going to reinvent jar jar.
He's going to be a vampire this time.
Yeah.

1612
01:33:48.681 --> 01:33:49.910
I wouldn't have a sexy kid,

1613
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.550
<v 0>George.
Our banks,
like what the fuck was that?</v>

1614
01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.470
That's like the just take taking an [inaudible] and just removing everything

1615
01:33:57.471 --> 01:34:00.290
that's good about it and adding more stupidity.
And,

1616
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:02.240
<v 4>and what's even creepier is when they change it.</v>

1617
01:34:02.241 --> 01:34:05.540
Like they just rereleased us all the Star Wars on Blu Ray and I guess they did

1618
01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:08.690
all of these things like making the walks and blink now cause they didn't use to

1619
01:34:08.691 --> 01:34:10.500
blank,
I guess.
I don't remember.
But,
uh,

1620
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:15.030
but like now that's even creepier because now you know that saying,
yeah,

1621
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.160
you know that they fixed fix that.
Did you see the dark crystal?
Yes.

1622
01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:21.380
I love that shit.
And one of my favorite movies,

1623
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:24.680
good movies and that's another movie.
I Bet Ari would say like,
yeah,

1624
01:34:24.681 --> 01:34:28.850
you watch it now.
It sucks.
I'm like,
no,
it still,
you remember it as a child.

1625
01:34:28.851 --> 01:34:30.620
You grew up with that and maybe that's like a class.

1626
01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:33.610
There's a lot of good movies that are still good.
I think these McMahon,

1627
01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.050
I don't keep meaning to go back to this hippy shit,

1628
01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:38.480
but I guess I will for the rest of my life.
I swear man.

1629
01:34:38.481 --> 01:34:43.220
I think these movies all came because people were taking acid and mushrooms and

1630
01:34:43.221 --> 01:34:46.940
like tripping out and like,
and really going for it.

1631
01:34:46.941 --> 01:34:51.941
I think that's what those movies came from is that is a psychedelic,

1632
01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:52.670
uh,

1633
01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:56.810
bringing something back from the psychedelic universe and then using art as the

1634
01:34:56.811 --> 01:35:01.610
kind clothes that you drape around this like,
um,
hyper dimensional form.

1635
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.770
I think that's the fucking job,
man.

1636
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:08.450
You go out into that place and you try to bring back the crazy shit that you

1637
01:35:08.451 --> 01:35:12.140
catch there.
It's like hunting trips and the like,
um,

1638
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.230
alternate dimensions.
But instead of catching animals,

1639
01:35:15.231 --> 01:35:18.770
you're catching thoughts and you're bringing them back and then you're trying to

1640
01:35:18.771 --> 01:35:21.260
bring them to life by putting them in some form,

1641
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:25.490
pouring them into the mold of your music,
your movie,
your book,

1642
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:30.450
whatever the thing is.
Like what I'm Alex Grey does for example.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1643
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.633
<v 0>Really does that,</v>

1644
01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:35.610
he's better than anybody of capturing that dimension and bring it back to

1645
01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.250
reality.
Yeah.
He's who he is.
What a beautiful guy.

1646
01:35:38.251 --> 01:35:41.100
That guy is to like hanging out with him was so intense.
It's just so,

1647
01:35:41.130 --> 01:35:45.840
so crackling with like positivity and love and no matter what I was shit on,

1648
01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:49.400
he would find a way to like look at the bright side of it at Asco has shitting

1649
01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:52.610
all of the fat people at Disneyland on scooters and he's like talking about how

1650
01:35:52.611 --> 01:35:56.900
great it is that Disneyland,
it's like,
Whoa,
homeless,
etc. Or uh,
you know,
uh,
uh,

1651
01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.500
accessible for a wheelchair.

1652
01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.480
<v 4>I love people like that.
Do those people are the best.
This Guy Ragu or I'll go,</v>

1653
01:36:03.481 --> 01:36:06.110
Marcus,
who I have on my podcast,
he was like,
ah,

1654
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:08.580
helps run the love server member foundation,

1655
01:36:08.581 --> 01:36:11.280
which is around his foundation like he has,

1656
01:36:11.281 --> 01:36:14.520
if they have a podcast now called mind rolling and it's him and his friend and

1657
01:36:14.521 --> 01:36:16.110
these guys,
man,
they're so fucking cool.

1658
01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:20.400
And I was on the podcast and we were talking about I'd work myself up into a

1659
01:36:20.401 --> 01:36:23.580
real hip.
You either over fucking like,
uh,

1660
01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.120
people that are dying in war and the drones.

1661
01:36:27.121 --> 01:36:30.780
I was really mad and really spewing like,
it's coming from anger and it's like,

1662
01:36:30.781 --> 01:36:32.670
these are people,
they're cute.
We're killing.

1663
01:36:32.671 --> 01:36:37.440
And like the way they dealt with that blast of negativity was super cool because

1664
01:36:37.441 --> 01:36:41.190
it wasn't like you shouldn't be negative.
It was like,
hold on.

1665
01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.320
Think about how angry you are right now.

1666
01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:45.750
Think about the mind state that you're in right now.

1667
01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:50.880
Think about where you're at right now.
You have now created a fucking,
um,

1668
01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:56.010
a division.
You are no longer in a state of unit,
unit of consciousness.

1669
01:36:56.011 --> 01:36:57.010
You've now cut the,
you know,

1670
01:36:57.011 --> 01:37:01.170
you've parsed the universe and you have done the exact same thing that causes

1671
01:37:01.171 --> 01:37:05.550
war to happen.
The exact same thing that causes comp conflict is this,

1672
01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:10.350
um,
the way that the mind tends to create the good guys,
the bad guys,

1673
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:12.210
uh,
uh,
the,

1674
01:37:12.211 --> 01:37:16.710
the evil forces in the good forces right now we've got al Qaeda used to be the

1675
01:37:16.711 --> 01:37:19.200
communists before it was the fucking Communist.

1676
01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.320
It used to be the fucking a British before was,
you know what I mean?

1677
01:37:22.321 --> 01:37:26.050
There's always a,
an ENL or the Nazis paradigm,
right?

1678
01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:28.540
<v 0>That's set up the enemy and the good and the bad</v>

1679
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.840
<v 4>paradox of that game is that you inevitably continue the very fucking thing that</v>

1680
01:37:35.551 --> 01:37:39.930
you so dreadfully want to stop.
And um,
that's the problem,

1681
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.690
<v 0>right?
You could see in creating that conflict and attacking,</v>

1682
01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.560
you automatically create a war and you automatically give someone something to

1683
01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:48.390
fight for.

1684
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:52.890
<v 4>And these people like Alex fucking gray,
Aragu Marcus or Rom das,
that's what they</v>

1685
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:56.880
<v 0>diverting in making things always pause.
They're trying and that's outcome.
He,</v>

1686
01:37:56.881 --> 01:37:59.670
man,
it's amazing.
By the way,
there is no comedy in that.

1687
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.660
You've gotta be able to shoot on fat people.
Skaters,

1688
01:38:03.230 --> 01:38:07.560
I still need to see that.
South Park,
Joe,
that was all about the scooters.
Yeah,

1689
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:11.340
I do this about a thousand south park's I really need to see still,
but dude,

1690
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:14.280
you know what,
I need to start up your iPhone,
you know?
Yeah.
I need,

1691
01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:17.130
what I need to do is a,
just like next trip I go on,

1692
01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:19.980
just flow the iPad up with like all the best episodes.

1693
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:23.360
Is there a greatest hits of South Park?
Yeah,
there is,
but the best ones,

1694
01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:27.450
just like,
uh,
you could download like the season in the last five even.

1695
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:30.780
I've just forced myself recently to start watching standups,

1696
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.300
like watching comedy again and you know,

1697
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:36.720
there's a lot of bad stand up out there,
man.

1698
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:41.190
But I rarely watch comedy these days.
Like on television,

1699
01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:44.790
I don't watch sitcoms.
I rarely watch.
That's why I don't watch South Park.

1700
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:49.260
It's like I love South Park,
but when I'm alone,
I'm don't go to comedy.

1701
01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:51.120
I almost always go to like science.

1702
01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.330
I almost always go to the discovery channel Shit or you know,

1703
01:38:54.331 --> 01:38:57.390
weird things about volcanoes or oceans or you know,

1704
01:38:57.391 --> 01:39:02.370
any biology type shit and then retard stuff like,
you know,

1705
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:06.270
like my my comments.
Yeah.
My comedy isn't like big foot or swamp people.

1706
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:08.430
That's my new show.
Swamp people.
If you think of that,

1707
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:13.290
do you gotta wash swamp people?
Crocodiles,
alligators,

1708
01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.500
and you can't hunt crocodiles in America.
We're trying to revive them.

1709
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.181
Dunkin cause there,

1710
01:39:17.181 --> 01:39:20.970
it's important to bring the most ruthless and fucking aggressive lizard.

1711
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.280
Bring them back to a healthy breeding population.

1712
01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:26.250
So we have to worry about dog downtown in downtown La.

1713
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:30.420
A dog just got snatched off a bridge in Miami,
six foot off the water.

1714
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:34.800
This fucking crocodile jumps up and grabs the dog and pulls it into water for a

1715
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:38.310
death row.
Fucking dog.
A Brador.

1716
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.600
I think sac might've made up to suck that video of the guy who puts his hand in

1717
01:39:42.601 --> 01:39:44.990
the alligator's.
Now do you see that?
Of course.

1718
01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.870
Say Crocodile.
Those are crocodiles.
Alligator.
Is it,
I don't know.

1719
01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:53.690
Crocodiles are much more aggressive.
What's the difference?
They're bigger,

1720
01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.600
more aggressive,
more dangerous.
They're there.

1721
01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.520
It's like the difference between poodle and a pit bull.

1722
01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:01.060
You know what's cool though,
man?
The good thing it's,

1723
01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:03.950
it's interesting how not all animals learn to swarm.

1724
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:07.850
Like only bees swarm like alligators and crocodiles.
They'll like,

1725
01:40:07.851 --> 01:40:10.290
if you throw meat into where they're at,
they'll eat it.
But there's,

1726
01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.660
there's not like organized swarms of alligators that would change the fucking

1727
01:40:14.661 --> 01:40:15.650
game they would have.

1728
01:40:15.651 --> 01:40:18.170
They're hungry if they're hungry and something goes in the water.

1729
01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:21.830
Like when a Willdabeast or an antelope gets Jack,
they all rip it apart.

1730
01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.140
They're not like Wolfe's,
they don't hunt,

1731
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:26.150
they can't like they don't stalk animals.

1732
01:40:26.151 --> 01:40:28.070
There's not like they have a way better setup.

1733
01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.490
They hold their breath for hours under water in muddy water.

1734
01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:35.180
They just stay put and then they explode out of nowhere when you have to come

1735
01:40:35.181 --> 01:40:35.571
and drink,

1736
01:40:35.571 --> 01:40:39.050
cause there's only one water waterhole like crocodiles are way better than
walls.

1737
01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:40.760
Oh please.
They're in Africa,

1738
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:44.690
they're in Africa where there's a fucking million animals and they all have to

1739
01:40:44.691 --> 01:40:47.120
come to this waterhole and this is the end of our friendship.

1740
01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:51.670
28 foot long dinosaurs that haven't changed in over 200 million years or

1741
01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:54.040
waiting,
holding their for hours.

1742
01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.480
<v 2>Oh,
by the way,
they don't have to eat for a year.
Sorry man woes like she is</v>

1743
01:40:58.730 --> 01:40:59.830
<v 5>five.</v>

1744
01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:09.510
I didn't realize actually
a

1745
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:13.650
little wolf spirit hat.

1746
01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:17.790
What are you [inaudible]

1747
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:22.880
<v 2>Brian,
pull up the video of a wolf.
Uh,
killing wolves.
Killing a coyote.</v>

1748
01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.350
Put it on your wig.
Dunkin.
It's pretty fun.
The wig doesn't work.
That gun.

1749
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:30.350
Isn't it funny that liked us a certain amount of shit you could wear like in

1750
01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.930
your daily life.
They'll allow you to wear,

1751
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:37.220
like that's a costume outside of being dressed up for Halloween.

1752
01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:40.580
Like you can wear it to pay.
That is not your fucking hair,

1753
01:41:40.581 --> 01:41:44.480
but you can wear it to toupee,
but you can't wear a fake mustache.
What was,

1754
01:41:44.481 --> 01:41:49.160
what if you were a big fake mustache and try to go through security.
They'll go,

1755
01:41:49.161 --> 01:41:53.840
sir,
you take the Monistat shot please.
You're like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I,

1756
01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:58.760
I'm a,
I'm really insecure about my lack of a mustache.
I used to have a mustache,

1757
01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:02.500
but my hair fell out of my upper lip.
So now I have to pay muscle.

1758
01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.490
<v 3>That is weird.
You gotta take your hat off when you go through Tsa,</v>

1759
01:42:05.491 --> 01:42:07.080
but you don't have to take off your to pay

1760
01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.690
<v 2>what have yet.
Yeah.
What if she had a Merkin and uh,
they were like,</v>

1761
01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.870
there's something showing up in your crotch.
Like,
yeah,
nothing.
It's nothing.

1762
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:17.440
You're like,
what's going on?
Can you please,
uh,
unzip your pants?

1763
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:21.820
You have this giant Jew fro down your crotch because she's just always been

1764
01:42:21.821 --> 01:42:23.950
really insecure about not having any pubic hair.

1765
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:29.220
So he just glued just this patch of fucking doing and everything is bone dry.

1766
01:42:29.651 --> 01:42:32.830
Your balls are bone dry,
your Dick's bone dry out,
hair on your deck.

1767
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:35.560
I have like stray hairs that are growing out halfway up my dick,

1768
01:42:35.561 --> 01:42:38.470
every now and then I got to pluck them out.
He pluck,
pluck them,

1769
01:42:38.471 --> 01:42:41.740
rip them right out of the roots.
And My,

1770
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:45.320
my pubes are ridiculous if I let them grow,
that's the fucking jungle down there.

1771
01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:47.470
But some dudes,
they don't have that.
So they just,

1772
01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.020
they have a Marcon and you'd go through security.

1773
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:52.510
Do you think they let you keep that merging now?
You got to strip it.

1774
01:42:52.511 --> 01:42:53.530
There's probably a bucket of,

1775
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:57.880
I was probably a dog that will snatch it off bite you,
bite your cock,
you know,

1776
01:42:57.970 --> 01:42:59.520
pull that Merck and off you get up.
Obama,

1777
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.000
<v 3>I actually even heard the term Merkin American sweat.
Your tastes.
What?</v>

1778
01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.690
It's murky.
I think.
Um,

1779
01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:10.800
it's like a fake pubic hair beard Bush.
But for what reason?
Hold on.

1780
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:15.920
There's no such thing.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
there is,
there's two things.

1781
01:43:15.921 --> 01:43:16.431
Like if you get,

1782
01:43:16.431 --> 01:43:20.720
like a lot of girls get their shit lasered off so they want once in a while they

1783
01:43:20.721 --> 01:43:24.530
want to have,
you know,
like a Bush and then they also have like,

1784
01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.950
like strippers or like chicks at one.
But that's not,

1785
01:43:27.951 --> 01:43:30.140
that's not what it was here then invented

1786
01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:34.850
<v 2>a long time ago.
It was to combat pubic lice.
Yeah.
People,</v>

1787
01:43:34.851 --> 01:43:35.270
uh,

1788
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:39.970
they originally worn by prostitutes after shaving their genitalia then now uses

1789
01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.840
decorative items in erotic devices or in films.
Yeah.
It was in the 1450s.

1790
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:47.510
There was,
it was,
um,
they,
uh,

1791
01:43:47.630 --> 01:43:52.070
women shaved their hair and they wore a Merck in the 14 hundreds,
a combat

1792
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.510
<v 8>pubic lice and prostitutes would wear them to cover up signs of disease such as</v>

1793
01:43:56.511 --> 01:44:00.340
syphilis.
So they have a big fucking a wig over the city.

1794
01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.840
<v 0>If you're fucking prostitute is wearing a pussy wig,
you should be suspicious.</v>

1795
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.620
Do you,
did you,
do you think people went raw dog with prostitutes back then?

1796
01:44:08.621 --> 01:44:11.530
Like raw dog,
like a bathroom rug?
You know,

1797
01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.530
after a while she has an old Merkin on.
It's like a bathroom rug.

1798
01:44:14.531 --> 01:44:17.560
It's just all fucking good.

1799
01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:18.820
<v 8>In Hollywood filmmaking,</v>

1800
01:44:18.821 --> 01:44:22.570
Merkin's are worn by actors and actresses to prevent inadvertent exposure of the

1801
01:44:22.571 --> 01:44:27.370
genitalia during nude or semi nude scenes of American.
We're not worn.

1802
01:44:27.371 --> 01:44:31.660
It would be necessary to restrict the shot to exclude the genital area.

1803
01:44:31.710 --> 01:44:34.770
<v 0>Dude,
have you ever heard of the way they shoot sex scenes?</v>

1804
01:44:34.771 --> 01:44:37.980
How they bring the boyfriends?
And we already talked about this.
Oh,

1805
01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:42.750
and the guy watches watches.
So doesn't that,
isn't that sac?

1806
01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:46.800
<v 8>Listen,
you can't have someone have a fake sex scene with someone that's hot.</v>

1807
01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.690
They're going to get hard.
You're going to want to,

1808
01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:52.710
I had a friend who did a fake sex scene in sub terrible movie and the girl goes,

1809
01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:56.100
you can fuck me if you want.
The girl actually said that.
He's like,

1810
01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:58.890
I don't think I can like you.
He didn't know what to say,

1811
01:44:58.891 --> 01:45:02.790
but he's on top of like fake thrusting into her ass asshole with this flacid

1812
01:45:02.791 --> 01:45:03.170
penis.

1813
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:07.920
<v 0>Can you fucking imagine being like someone's husband and sitting and watching</v>

1814
01:45:07.921 --> 01:45:12.270
them get fucked by Bruce Willis?
Oh,
some stark room.
Fuck Blues will us.

1815
01:45:12.271 --> 01:45:16.290
How bout like,
yeah,
I don't know.
How about like the rock live was great.

1816
01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.520
The Rock is just like

1817
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.080
<v 8>giant tattooed chest is sweating into your wife's mouth as he's fake.</v>

1818
01:45:23.211 --> 01:45:27.710
Pumping her with her legs over head fucking her in a way you could never

1819
01:45:27.711 --> 01:45:31.160
possibly do with your lift frame and your joggers body.

1820
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:37.370
Big giant fucking Samoan tribal tattoos on his roided up chest.

1821
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:42.371
And he just pomp in his giant semi hard cock on the outside of your wife's

1822
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:47.840
pussy.
And you know,
deep inside she just slippery and gliding and she's all,

1823
01:45:47.850 --> 01:45:49.460
she wish she would just shove it in.

1824
01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:52.970
I don't care if you watch watching and you're sitting there,
um,
is this over?

1825
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:56.840
Have you gotten enough takes of this is this,
is this,
are we done here?

1826
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.910
Are we done here plus

1827
01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:01.220
<v 0>the society?
Nef what if it was Louie Anderson?</v>

1828
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.150
I'm going to get that your wife's Plessy and you have to watch somebody gross.

1829
01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:08.780
You know,
Burt fucking job with John Love is sloppy.

1830
01:46:08.781 --> 01:46:13.130
Dude eaten a fucking hot dog.
Why bones?
Your wife is sideways glances.

1831
01:46:13.131 --> 01:46:17.600
Got To pick your,
his gut up like an under hook,
like a deep,

1832
01:46:17.601 --> 01:46:21.230
like a chimp.
Remember those chimps in a buckets where they would have that?
Uh,

1833
01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.180
that would be like how their paws would connect.

1834
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:25.410
You would play that game with a plastic champs.
We,

1835
01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:29.570
he's gotta take his hand and sort of that position to just suck up the gut and

1836
01:46:29.571 --> 01:46:31.460
pull it up.
So is short.

1837
01:46:31.461 --> 01:46:36.440
Semi hard penis can even get inside your woman stink wafting out of that flap is

1838
01:46:36.441 --> 01:46:39.760
like a homeless dude just took off his boot.
Just like

1839
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:44.870
just a combination of the La River after a flood.

1840
01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:49.810
These shit rolling water and fucking,
what is it?
What is,

1841
01:46:49.811 --> 01:46:53.370
what is a water tap and water now?
What is it?
Water.
When it's stagnant,

1842
01:46:53.371 --> 01:46:57.780
stagnant water and shit and old loads.
Oh,
loads in there.

1843
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:02.130
Just the old briny old fucking loads and his come comes out like snot.

1844
01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:05.620
When you have the flu,
just yellow,
you know,

1845
01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.130
you blow your nose when you have the flu and it comes out all yellow.

1846
01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:12.600
And that's how it was.
Loads look like the death sneeze of someone with malaria.

1847
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:17.040
It's like your class needs inside of a Boston cream donut.
That custard.

1848
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:21.480
Ah Fuck.
Ah,
yes.

1849
01:47:21.481 --> 01:47:26.190
It's not as smooth and delicious looking.
Yeah.
A little congealed little uh,

1850
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:30.000
cottage cheesy and it burns and it burns.
Yeah,
it stings.

1851
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:33.240
And it stings your eyes too.
You have to run to the bathroom.

1852
01:47:33.241 --> 01:47:35.010
And if you get it on your eyes,
she'll start crying.

1853
01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:38.820
It's like fumes coming up from an old onion.

1854
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.510
I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and I didn't tell him this

1855
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:44.070
because his breath was so bad.

1856
01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.400
I literally thought he shit himself and I didn't know how to,

1857
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:50.580
I just decided I was too high to,
to uh,
to break it down.

1858
01:47:50.581 --> 01:47:54.210
And he was sober and I was like,
oh my God,
I can't talk to you.
And it's so true.

1859
01:47:54.211 --> 01:47:58.020
Like people who have shitty breath want to tell you these fucking long stupid

1860
01:47:58.021 --> 01:48:01.410
stories.
And he wanted to tell me this long story and it was just like,

1861
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:04.410
like prisoners had been farting in his mouth

1862
01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:08.700
because it was just like,

1863
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:14.160
like he'd held his mouth open and every fucking prisoner and cell block d just

1864
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:17.400
farted.
In his mind.
It was so bad.

1865
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:21.960
I literally thought he shit his pants.
It was horrible.
Not me,
is it?
No,

1866
01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:26.940
I'm saying,
yeah,
I would tell you that was weird.
Civilian,
but it's weird.

1867
01:48:26.941 --> 01:48:27.540
Smoker,

1868
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.040
like bad breath is almost like a demonic force that possesses people and compel

1869
01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:34.860
them to tell the longest,
most boring stories.

1870
01:48:34.861 --> 01:48:37.680
It is weird how people with bad breath want to tell your fucking stories.

1871
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:40.760
What is it?
It's a strange thing,
but it's weird of Pew.

1872
01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:44.970
I want people to tell me about my bad breath.
If I have bad breath,

1873
01:48:44.971 --> 01:48:48.180
please tell me.
Because I know I have it.
Especially if I do like a long show,

1874
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:48.481
you know,

1875
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:51.500
like you do us a show and you're talking for an hour and a half and breathless.

1876
01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:53.700
Be Gross.
Yeah.
You're not drinking any,

1877
01:48:53.701 --> 01:48:55.680
want me to drink like a little water here and there,
but you know,

1878
01:48:55.681 --> 01:49:00.240
like refreshing your mouth.
It's like,
ah,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad,
bad stomach acids.

1879
01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.710
Bad,
bad,
bad,
bad.
It's probably disgusting.
Tell me.
But I wouldn't tell him.

1880
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.150
You know why?
Because some people can handle it.

1881
01:49:06.151 --> 01:49:08.760
Some people get all butthurt remember when he went through that brief phase

1882
01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:10.290
where you were like,
I'm not wearing deodorant.

1883
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.960
It's the smell of a man and you are going everywhere.
Sticking with this muscle.

1884
01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:18.240
Well,
I thought that,
uh,
first of all,
deodorant,
um,

1885
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:20.160
I thought it was bad for you and it is bad,

1886
01:49:20.161 --> 01:49:23.730
but I decided that if you get cancer from deodorant,
you're a fucking pussy.

1887
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:26.610
That's what I think.
It's how I feel.
Uh,
I,
yeah,

1888
01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:29.010
I stopped wearing deodorant for a little while,
just wash myself.

1889
01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.870
I'm totally into funky and I eat too much meat.
Man,
I'm too much of a predator.

1890
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.430
So you smell my armpit.
Do you think that,

1891
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:41.580
like that's why a deer run from you,
by the way,
do you think if you only,

1892
01:49:41.581 --> 01:49:46.530
like if you lived on some kind of like Forrest St Diet and you only ate,

1893
01:49:46.531 --> 01:49:48.310
like you would smell different tiny

1894
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.210
<v 3>and fucking flowers and you are,
you know,
like you think you'd stop stinking</v>

1895
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:53.610
<v 8>Oh yeah.
100%.
Yeah.</v>

1896
01:49:53.611 --> 01:49:57.000
Part of what you're smelling is like uric acid and all sorts of different shit

1897
01:49:57.001 --> 01:49:59.700
that comes through your pores that comes directly.
As a result,

1898
01:49:59.701 --> 01:50:03.810
a lot of the smells come directly a result of eating meat.
In fact,
um,

1899
01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.560
that's one of the things that deer freak out about when,
when d or are,

1900
01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:10.050
then they catch you in their nose and they run away.

1901
01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:13.500
That's like when the runaway,
the quickest when we were hunting,

1902
01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:17.520
when the wind would come off of you and go towards the deer and they would go,

1903
01:50:17.521 --> 01:50:19.290
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

1904
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:22.540
There was no mistake in their mind that you were a predator.

1905
01:50:22.610 --> 01:50:26.340
He smelled like a meat eater.
That's a,
I think there's a,
there's a,

1906
01:50:26.341 --> 01:50:30.240
there's a smell like vegans have very different smell than,

1907
01:50:30.241 --> 01:50:31.830
than people who eat a lot of meat.

1908
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:34.320
If you eat like a lot of steak and burgers and shit,

1909
01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:38.520
he definitely develop a different school.
It's true.
Yeah.
100% man.

1910
01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.540
You know your,
your,
your shit smells different.
Jesus Christ.
When I,

1911
01:50:42.570 --> 01:50:44.670
when I drank nothing but kale shakes for a couple of days,

1912
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:47.550
my shit doesn't smell bad at all.
It goes right through me.

1913
01:50:47.551 --> 01:50:52.551
It smells like pineapples and I flush this giant Green Pineapple smoothie out of

1914
01:50:53.131 --> 01:50:56.730
my ass,
but it doesn't smell bad at all.
You're a,

1915
01:50:56.731 --> 01:50:59.670
when you're eating a lot of meat,
man,
you're breaking down a lot of shit.
Look,

1916
01:50:59.671 --> 01:51:03.540
man,
I'll tell you the recipe for some pretty awful dumped if you want to know

1917
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:08.470
<v 3>out there.
Yeah.
Fucking it got mind to.
Should share.
Let's see.</v>

1918
01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.460
Make a cookbook.
Cookbook
Oysters,
oysters,

1919
01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.680
oysters.
Will Oysters.
Think about what that is.
Oysters,

1920
01:51:16.681 --> 01:51:19.070
they're like the phlegm of the ocean.

1921
01:51:19.071 --> 01:51:23.870
It's like they're just like these already mucusy things like oysters destroy.

1922
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:26.120
Destroy me.
I can't do it anymore.

1923
01:51:26.150 --> 01:51:28.490
Starbucks destroys me one of these coffees every time.

1924
01:51:28.491 --> 01:51:31.850
I'm like halfway through it.
I just have to run.
It's a colon cleaner.
Yeah.

1925
01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:32.830
I have to go again on my thing.

1926
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.700
<v 8>The the,
no,</v>

1927
01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:36.840
there's nothing like the Kale shake though for cleaning the colon out.

1928
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.020
Kale shakes were ridiculous.
Like you can't even hold it in.

1929
01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:43.140
Have you ever gotten a colonic?
No.
Hold.
It hurts.
Awesome though.

1930
01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.920
I've also that it's not good for you.
I've heard conflicting things.

1931
01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.700
Pam Tell it's good for you.
It's not good.
What did you dependent on her side?

1932
01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:50.580
I said it's bullshit.

1933
01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:55.050
[inaudible] see the problem with Penn and teller as Penn and teller also said

1934
01:51:55.051 --> 01:52:00.030
that yoga is bullshit.
Yoga is not bullshit.
They're yoga gets you high.
Okay.

1935
01:52:00.031 --> 01:52:02.880
And the only reason why anybody would say that yoga is bullshit is because

1936
01:52:02.881 --> 01:52:04.060
they're out of shape and they're not.

1937
01:52:04.061 --> 01:52:07.060
And we didn't get their body on this podcast.
Yeah,
they're not unshaved.

1938
01:52:07.061 --> 01:52:10.440
They're not in tune with their body and they don't understand that you are

1939
01:52:10.441 --> 01:52:15.441
releasing tension and you're creating a different state of consciousness.

1940
01:52:15.450 --> 01:52:18.420
When you do yoga,
yoga definitely gets you high.
There's no question about it.

1941
01:52:18.421 --> 01:52:22.050
And anybody who says it doesn't,
you're,
you're too out of shape to appreciate it.

1942
01:52:22.051 --> 01:52:25.560
That's all it is.
I've,
I've had like real legitimate,

1943
01:52:25.561 --> 01:52:30.210
like life changing experiences after yoga where if we really sat down and you

1944
01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:34.140
know,
when I say life changing,
I mean like in degrees left right forward,

1945
01:52:34.141 --> 01:52:34.441
you know,

1946
01:52:34.441 --> 01:52:38.370
like there's like certain times where I've had experiences in my life that were

1947
01:52:38.371 --> 01:52:42.990
literally life changing because I sat down and that extra inspiration that I got

1948
01:52:42.991 --> 01:52:45.180
from that moment,
that extra positivity,

1949
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:50.180
extra clarity that I got moved me in a percentage of a point in one direction.

1950
01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:53.240
And it's almost always towards the good.
I've had that from Yoga,

1951
01:52:53.630 --> 01:52:56.930
no question about it.
And it's not just because I chose to have it.

1952
01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.910
It's also because those techniques of all that stretching and all those,
those,

1953
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:07.090
all those things release tension from the body and the way your body carries

1954
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:11.570
around tension is directly affects the way your mind works directly,

1955
01:53:11.571 --> 01:53:15.830
directly affects how you interact with people.
Like true yoga people,

1956
01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:20.750
the real yoga people.
Fascinating to be around men that really cool and calm.

1957
01:53:20.751 --> 01:53:24.320
And there was this dude from South Africa,
he's take yoga with,
he was so real,

1958
01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:26.110
man.
He was still the real deal.
Yeah.

1959
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.840
There's a lot of those fake yoga guys that try to like fuck chicks and you know,

1960
01:53:29.841 --> 01:53:34.100
they try to like be fake spiritual and they sing like Indian songs.
You know,

1961
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:38.520
that they memorize just to fucking impress people with their,
their,

1962
01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:41.080
their Hindu street cred.
You know what I mean?
You know that

1963
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:44.180
<v 4>kind of fake there.
I've seen them giving massages at rave.</v>

1964
01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:46.990
<v 8>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

1965
01:53:46.991 --> 01:53:51.670
With their dirty Birkenstocks on and you know saying Namaz Day get out of here

1966
01:53:51.671 --> 01:53:53.530
bitch,
don't you know mouse may you,
you it

1967
01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:55.020
<v 4>bitch cause the people in what you're up to.</v>

1968
01:53:55.021 --> 01:53:58.230
The people who really practice that shit man,
they don't,
they're,

1969
01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:01.050
they don't act like that at all.
There's none of it's there.

1970
01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:05.430
It's a whole different fucking animal to the point where it can be shocking

1971
01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:09.270
because you kind of expect people to be a certain way.
This is a funny thing.

1972
01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:13.440
This is like one of the fun thought experiment you can do is right now,

1973
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:16.410
maybe you don't,
but right now and a lot of people's minds,

1974
01:54:16.411 --> 01:54:19.290
they already have this idea of what an enlightened person should act like.

1975
01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.260
You already have that idea.
Here's what they might be like.

1976
01:54:22.261 --> 01:54:26.850
Your mind will try to create an idea of what enlightenment looks like and that

1977
01:54:26.851 --> 01:54:30.480
idea is always wrong.
It's never like that at all.

1978
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:34.980
This is that saying when you meet,
if you meet the Buddha on the road,
kill him.

1979
01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.001
That's the idea,

1980
01:54:36.001 --> 01:54:40.150
which is like anything in your mind that's kind of defining the way you think

1981
01:54:40.151 --> 01:54:44.670
and advanced person should be,
creates a real big problem.
Uh,

1982
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:48.510
because you'll start pretending to be that way.
You know,

1983
01:54:48.511 --> 01:54:52.320
you start putting on a costume or show.
But yeah,

1984
01:54:52.321 --> 01:54:55.260
most of those folks you run into are the real deal man.
They just like,

1985
01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.380
they're just totally in the fucking moment.
I'll go with anything.

1986
01:54:58.410 --> 01:55:01.120
It's really hard to be the real deal.
Real Madrid,

1987
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.570
the real into the real world known to rule.

1988
01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:08.880
You say world world,
world.
No,

1989
01:55:08.881 --> 01:55:12.660
you just don't want to say the world's the best thing in the world.
World.
World,

1990
01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:14.040
world.
He doesn't say world.

1991
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:18.420
He says rural world were w r o l d world world.

1992
01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:23.340
There you go.
White Castles.
Awesome.
It's really the best place in the world.

1993
01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.430
<v 8>Please shut the fuck up.
He's changed from uh,</v>

1994
01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:31.620
supporting all the garden.
Now he's chewing change to white castle.
Wow.

1995
01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:37.150
<v 4>That ain't shit.
It's fucking good.
Yeah.
It'd be really drunk.
It's delicious.</v>

1996
01:55:37.151 --> 01:55:41.290
Great dry drunk people a meet in the future.

1997
01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:44.580
I may make my own white castle vets me red cast for Los Angeles.

1998
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:46.160
<v 3>That's why we need is Fuddruckers.
Yeah.</v>

1999
01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.940
<v 8>Back us up and you get those fucking ostrich burgers.</v>

2000
01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:52.390
Do you ever get a raw or rare rather ostrich burger at Fuddruckers now?

2001
01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.160
Oh God damn son.
That shit is

2002
01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.790
<v 3>good.
We can have that red castle.
Yeah.</v>

2003
01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.160
Ostriches or cons to their birds and birds are dinosaurs and all dinosaurs can

2004
01:56:00.161 --> 01:56:03.220
go fuck themselves.
This shit out of an ostrich.

2005
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:05.080
I'll eat the shit out of an ostrich.

2006
01:56:05.081 --> 01:56:10.081
I will come Maura and ostriches his neck and kill it and eat the shit out of it.

2007
01:56:10.210 --> 01:56:11.680
When I was living in Asheville,

2008
01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.010
their necks are perfect for strangling when I was living.

2009
01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.690
That's what I bet you can't even get in them though.

2010
01:56:17.691 --> 01:56:20.020
But they're next is go right with it there.
I bet.

2011
01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:24.190
I bet they can peck the fuck out of right back your Dick.
Why turn your head?

2012
01:56:24.970 --> 01:56:29.930
I used to be so poor when I was living in Asheville that I would go to fid

2013
01:56:29.931 --> 01:56:34.931
rockers and order a bond and just like eat a lettuce and the tomatoes and the

2014
01:56:36.371 --> 01:56:39.340
onions from the fucking do your hammer,
her barbies.

2015
01:56:39.341 --> 01:56:41.990
Yet everything you can make a cheap meal and cheese sandwich out of relish and

2016
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.810
people's making shitty salad bread.
Yeah.
Incredible.

2017
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:48.623
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2018
01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:52.840
<v 8>Asheville,
North Carolina is one of the last great spots on earth.
Yeah.</v>

2019
01:56:52.841 --> 01:56:55.660
It's almost didn't want to tell people about it.
When we got back,

2020
01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.120
we were wandering and walking around on the streets.
I was like,

2021
01:56:58.121 --> 01:57:00.790
this is one of those places where you could walk around the streets and it's

2022
01:57:00.791 --> 01:57:04.150
small.
It's a small town,
but it had all these bars.

2023
01:57:04.151 --> 01:57:08.530
You can walk from bar to bar and people were friendly.
Yeah.
And I was like,
Whoa,

2024
01:57:08.531 --> 01:57:10.540
Duncan,
this is a crazy place.

2025
01:57:10.810 --> 01:57:13.600
We're in like one of the last great places on earth.
Yep.

2026
01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:17.140
Asheville North Carolina is one of the last great places on earth.

2027
01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:20.110
We walked to a Kava bar.
Okay.

2028
01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:24.040
There's bars everywhere and nice people and that.
Sure.

2029
01:57:24.041 --> 01:57:27.280
There was a few drum circles and there's a few fucking hippies sitting on the

2030
01:57:27.281 --> 01:57:29.170
ground and the sidewalk.
There's a little of that.

2031
01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:33.950
<v 3>I'm going to just fucking say this and I know,
forgive me for saying it,</v>

2032
01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:38.300
but Trump's circles are fun.
This fucking go to one.
It's fun.

2033
01:57:38.301 --> 01:57:42.560
You get to bang on a drum.
It's fun.
It's like awesome.
Never smell good though.

2034
01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:46.100
No,
no one's ever accused of drum circle of smelling gray,

2035
01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:51.380
but they're fucking fun.
They're fun.
Do you like the smell of sage?
No.

2036
01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:54.860
It's the worst smell ever,
right?
I don't like that smell.
It's horrible.

2037
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.630
<v 8>Yeah.
Sages smells good when you're walking through it.
When you're outside,</v>

2038
01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.140
<v 3>you can't escape it.
It's horrible.
When it's on fire.</v>

2039
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:06.890
That's when they burned sage spirits and shit.
When I was a kid,

2040
01:58:06.891 --> 01:58:09.800
my mom burned sage in my room cause she thought I'd summon a demon.

2041
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:12.980
We know Salvia sage.
Salvia have enormous,

2042
01:58:12.981 --> 01:58:15.750
that's why I thought it's more like self here that the other day I was like,

2043
01:58:16.330 --> 01:58:18.530
that's like flashbacks.
Salvia.

2044
01:58:18.650 --> 01:58:22.340
I don't know if that sage is psychoactive.
Hmm.

2045
01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:26.200
I should find out because if it's true,
you can just find sages,
smoke it.
Yeah.

2046
01:58:26.210 --> 01:58:30.110
I went to the day of the dead at the Hollywood forever cemetery.
When was that?

2047
01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:34.040
A Friday and it was the worst experience ever.
It was so crowded.

2048
01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:36.110
There was one point you couldn't move any direction.

2049
01:58:36.111 --> 01:58:38.030
I just wanted to cry and run,

2050
01:58:38.031 --> 01:58:42.460
but are you ever doing any more comedy shows or you think,
ah,
I don't know.
Um,

2051
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:44.620
I don't know what's going to happen with that.
I'm so busy right now.

2052
01:58:44.621 --> 01:58:47.050
I don't have time to do it.
That shit was always fun.

2053
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:50.470
<v 8>Yeah.
Sage is Salvia.
There's no crazy,</v>

2054
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:55.270
no wonder I was having flashbacks and one of the several genera commonly,

2055
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:58.960
how do you say?
G?
E?
A.
G.
E.
N.
E.
R.
A.

2056
01:58:58.961 --> 01:59:03.670
What is that genre,
but it is that action now?
No,
no.

2057
01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:07.960
Generra genetics or something about genetics.
Yeah,
it's a body term.

2058
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.910
Several Generra,
whatever commonly referred to as sage.
Let's,
let's look puking.

2059
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:18.070
Give our listeners to answer what is,
look it up in the dictionary.
I love that.

2060
01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:21.640
Highlight.
It look it up.
The Niche Canary Jenise yeah,
that's right.

2061
01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:26.700
I thought it was that principal taxonomic category that ranks above species and

2062
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:29.860
below family.
Hmm.

2063
01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:35.110
And is denoted by a capitalized Latin name for Eg.

2064
01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:40.000
Leo.
Okay.
So,
um,
it's uh,
it's,

2065
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:44.470
it's one of the,
uh,
types of,
of sage.
That's what Salvia divinorum is.

2066
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:48.970
It's one of the several different kinds of sage.
Huh.

2067
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:51.430
So I don't know how much of that shit that you walk into when you're wandering

2068
01:59:51.431 --> 01:59:53.990
through the woods.
It's step over sage brush.

2069
01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:58.270
I want how much of that can you light on fire and see Jesus?
Probably.
Probably.

2070
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:03.400
I bet a lot of it,
you know.
I bet.
I bet.
I bet it's pretty common.
Let's see.

2071
02:00:03.401 --> 02:00:07.820
How common is Salvey in the wild?
Let's look up that.
Is that target?
Yeah.

2072
02:00:07.821 --> 02:00:10.120
You'd get at a target.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2073
02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:13.930
They fell Salvia at fucking salary plans.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2074
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:19.080
They sell,
they sell fucking Payoti.
Ooh,
what?
Yeah.

2075
02:00:19.130 --> 02:00:23.110
They sell the fucking cactus man,
San Pedro cactus.
You can buy at any home depot.

2076
02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:28.680
You take that San Pedro cactus and make fucking payoti allegedly of no.

2077
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.040
Yes,
you can wait.

2078
02:00:30.041 --> 02:00:34.810
You could also take the fucking morning glory seeds and smash them up and cook

2079
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:39.250
them and make a very potent psychoactive.
Similar to LSD.

2080
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.650
Lsa,
I believe is what a job.
As a matter of fact,

2081
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:45.700
they've actually taken steps to make the seeds a non psychoactive.

2082
02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:46.810
They like poison these socks.

2083
02:00:47.070 --> 02:00:50.580
<v 3>You make it so it's like,
well,
upset your stomach.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2084
02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:53.390
Hawaiian Rosewood too.
That's another one,
not mag.

2085
02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:57.840
That's another one to Tura devils.
Gypsum.
See,
that's another one.

2086
02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:01.260
Huge spool spoon.
The cinnamon is supposed to make you trip.

2087
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:02.980
<v 8>Yeah.
In some parts of the world,</v>

2088
02:01:02.981 --> 02:01:07.240
particularly in northern Mexico and southwestern United States like we were low

2089
02:01:07.241 --> 02:01:11.110
Lee live bitches.
Salvia divinorum grows wild.

2090
02:01:12.670 --> 02:01:15.490
It's fucking wild out here,
man.
That's nuts.

2091
02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.670
It's wild right here.
Oh boy.

2092
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:24.050
<v 3>I don't like Salvia.
You don't?
I do not like don't do it anymore.
Why?</v>

2093
02:01:24.051 --> 02:01:28.550
What's going or what that buzz.
You can't handle it.
Yeah,

2094
02:01:28.551 --> 02:01:31.310
I guess if you want to say it like that,
I just don't like the feeling.
It's like,

2095
02:01:31.311 --> 02:01:35.810
it's like it's a,
it's not a great high,
it's not an exact dirty,
dirty half.

2096
02:01:35.811 --> 02:01:40.190
Feels like a damaged too.
It just doesn't work.
It just after

2097
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:43.190
<v 4>you get done doing it,
you're sweating your ass off.</v>

2098
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:46.400
Like your body goes from like,
like zero to a hundred.

2099
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:49.580
Your heart beats going so bad,
you just drenched in sweat.

2100
02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:54.470
You have that dirty like fucking like my brain feels fucked up feeling and it's

2101
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:56.450
just a gross feeling.
Like almost like a,

2102
02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:01.900
like a sinus hangover or something makes us a drug that was sh shamonic drug.

2103
02:02:03.051 --> 02:02:06.230
It's like,
it's like more in the line of like,
I don't know,

2104
02:02:06.231 --> 02:02:09.860
but I've read that like it began is not a pleasant high.
It's like,

2105
02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:15.040
it's meant to be used as a kind of in accordance with like a sham and,

2106
02:02:15.131 --> 02:02:19.520
or someone who knows what they're doing to like create some spiritual effect.

2107
02:02:19.521 --> 02:02:23.270
It's not meant so that you can fucking pass out in front of Mario brothers and

2108
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:25.340
your trailer.
Like,
you know,
it's not,

2109
02:02:25.341 --> 02:02:27.830
it's not the way people use it now as they get,
you know,

2110
02:02:27.831 --> 02:02:31.610
they fucking smoke that shit with the Xbox playing in the background and like

2111
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:34.520
you know,
a baby sleeping in the other room.
It's,

2112
02:02:34.521 --> 02:02:37.190
I don't think it's that kind of drug.
It's not one of the pleasant drugs.

2113
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:41.840
Like there are a psychedelics that if you take low doses definitely can be

2114
02:02:41.841 --> 02:02:44.390
social lubricants and can be fun for partying,

2115
02:02:44.391 --> 02:02:46.280
but Salvia doesn't feel like that at all.

2116
02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:50.380
<v 2>Yeah,
well people that take it to make videos of them taking it certainly support</v>

2117
02:02:50.381 --> 02:02:51.580
that.
Yeah.

2118
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:55.240
Little those videos of people like Brian has a few of them out there and the one

2119
02:02:55.241 --> 02:02:56.380
with Ari freaking out,

2120
02:02:56.770 --> 02:03:01.420
whether they already did it in front of them and Ari did it in this area is one

2121
02:03:01.421 --> 02:03:02.890
of my favorite stories of Salvia.

2122
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:07.420
Ari did it and lived another life for months.

2123
02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:10.390
He made friends,
he had relationships,

2124
02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:15.540
he lived life in this artificial world for months and then was snapped back to

2125
02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:19.540
reality when it,
when it's sobered up and he said he'll never forget it.

2126
02:03:19.541 --> 02:03:21.970
He said it was,
it was really weird listening to him describe it.

2127
02:03:21.971 --> 02:03:24.140
It's like I had a whole nother life from month.

2128
02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.360
<v 4>Yes.
I did it with Bobby Lee and he said he felt like he was on a pirate ship.</v>

2129
02:03:28.361 --> 02:03:31.520
Covered in spiders.
It Brian,
you know,
I don't know.

2130
02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.700
<v 2>I think you're supposed to let these lasers hit you in the eyeball.
Huh?</v>

2131
02:03:34.730 --> 02:03:38.630
These are club lasers,
so they're okay.
The club,
when you go blind,
the club,

2132
02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.570
it's fine.
Just posted there.
Yeah,
there they are.
Okay.
Though,

2133
02:03:41.590 --> 02:03:44.360
then hit your nightclubs and stuff like that.
Oh,
okay.

2134
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:47.470
What happens with the hit your eyeballs?
Nothin.
Nothin.
You know I,

2135
02:03:47.471 --> 02:03:51.950
I read this thing where they said that you were supposed to not wear sunglasses

2136
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:55.580
and that you should allow a certain amount of sunlight to hit your eyes because

2137
02:03:55.581 --> 02:03:59.510
it was essential nutrients,
nutrients,
nutrients that you get from sunlight.

2138
02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:02.180
Just like you get nutrients from sunlight and vitamin D,

2139
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:05.750
but also you get nutrients that help your vision.
I never wear sunglasses.

2140
02:04:05.751 --> 02:04:07.310
I'm wearing them now just for Halloween,

2141
02:04:07.311 --> 02:04:10.610
but I never wear them to the point where I think I probably fucked my eyes up a

2142
02:04:10.611 --> 02:04:14.900
little bit from not wearing well they say if you go like skiing or something,

2143
02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.710
you know,
like snow blindness.
Callen knows a guy who went snow blind.

2144
02:04:18.711 --> 02:04:19.820
Literally he went blind.

2145
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:25.850
You went to climb k two and a,
the snow was so bright,

2146
02:04:25.851 --> 02:04:28.330
he didn't have sunglasses on there for one day.
One of his eyes went,

2147
02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.250
<v 4>that sucks.
That sucks.
I got,
yeah,</v>

2148
02:04:31.251 --> 02:04:34.280
I got sunburn on my eyeball because it rained.

2149
02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:38.610
I was in myrtle beach and it rained on the uh,
table and the table was glass

2150
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:43.170
<v 3>and then I hung out and drank on the table for a few hours in the reflection off</v>

2151
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:47.660
the water on the glass table,
I guess like,
like magnified the,

2152
02:04:47.661 --> 02:04:50.310
the raise or whatever.
And for three days I couldn't see,

2153
02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:53.130
like I couldn't open my eyes.
My eyes were watering and earning.

2154
02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:56.550
I just had to sit there and just like close my eyes at myrtle beach for three

2155
02:04:56.551 --> 02:05:01.090
days.
If you had to pick a sense to lose.
I wouldn't.
Let's not do this.
What be,

2156
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:03.680
I don't like to do that honey booboo.
His mom or honey booboo.

2157
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:08.030
<v 0>Yeah.
I like Connie boob was mom cause she's probably probably can't get pregnant</v>

2158
02:05:08.031 --> 02:05:12.600
anymore.
You,
you would pick honey booboo.
His mom over being able to see the,

2159
02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:15.470
I'm not talking about,
you know is honey booboo his mom or honey booboo.
Yeah,

2160
02:05:15.471 --> 02:05:18.680
that's the,
it's like we're not going to play.
You don't want to play that game?

2161
02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:22.610
No,
it's stupid.
It's negative
like a lot of people.

2162
02:05:22.611 --> 02:05:25.580
Native land loss.
Just talk.
Start talking about loss.

2163
02:05:25.581 --> 02:05:29.540
What'd rather you lose your feet to lose your ooo stupid.

2164
02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:33.740
There's other things to think by the way.
That's an easy answer.
Yeah,
it is easy.

2165
02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:38.240
Okay.
Cause they make fake feet but fake dicks don't feel shit.
Yeah,
right.

2166
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:40.940
Is that what it is now?
Mass Day.

2167
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:46.280
I just enjoyed some amazing vegan salad.

2168
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:49.950
[inaudible]

2169
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:51.143
<v 9>no mustache.</v>

2170
02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:57.910
<v 0>Duncan Trussell.
Why are you wearing a wool fat?
This fucking hat.</v>

2171
02:05:58.090 --> 02:06:00.340
Yeah.
Why are you wearing?
Why do I have to ask why I'm wearing

2172
02:06:00.370 --> 02:06:03.340
<v 3>what's the most amazing have here on earth?
Where'd you get it?</v>

2173
02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:07.490
I got it in fucking Nevada city.
Northern California.
Like the very,
yeah,

2174
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:12.290
<v 0>like with the Emerald Triangle.
One of my friends got a,
uh,</v>

2175
02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:16.740
legal marijuana farm up.
There is no such thing federally and whatever fund.

2176
02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:17.593
Matter of fact,

2177
02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:21.850
I'm going to have to stop smoking marijuana because I want to pursue,
uh,
my,
uh,

2178
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:25.060
hunting obsession,
my new hunting obsession.
So I'm gonna quit pot.

2179
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:30.810
<v 3>If you guys were both single,
would you fuck this girl?
Uh,
who wouldn't?
Okay.</v>

2180
02:06:30.811 --> 02:06:31.710
Cause that's the lady boy

2181
02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:39.440
<v 0>that was like the easiest trap is that girl that's alive.</v>

2182
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:41.300
Thank God I didn't think about it for a second.

2183
02:06:41.301 --> 02:06:44.390
I don't have to listen to her talk.
I'd probably be able to smell him.
No,

2184
02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:46.850
I'd probably go smell her.
Know that she was

2185
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:50.970
<v 3>boy Brody just recently on a podcast came out and saying that he went to a</v>

2186
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:56.140
overseas for a movie Bangkok and tested out a lady.

2187
02:06:56.150 --> 02:06:59.540
Boy,
what do you think?
He's,
he's so,
he's now thinks he's 10% gait.

2188
02:06:59.590 --> 02:07:03.230
He doesn't want to pursue that.
He just wanted to see if he was or not.

2189
02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:07.640
What happened in the,
how did he,
what did,
how did they fuck what happened?

2190
02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.940
Was he on top?
No,
I guess it was just made me a blow job.

2191
02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:16.020
<v 0>Oh boy.
Wow.
You know,
you can get gonorrhea from mouse contact.</v>

2192
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:21.980
300,000 cases of gonorrhea in 2000 did you recently get concrete?
No.

2193
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:22.833
I'm just telling you.

2194
02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:29.520
I'm just saying don't let dudes who dress up like girls and give out blow jobs.

2195
02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:34.990
Suck your Dick because their mouth ain't too picky.
That's what I'm trying to,

2196
02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:37.723
<v 4>you should do publicly.</v>

2197
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.260
Everyone now who buys a gun must fill out

2198
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:45.700
<v 2>the ATF form four,
four,
seven three which asks,</v>

2199
02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:50.970
are you an unlawful user of or addicted to marijuana or any depressant,

2200
02:07:52.241 --> 02:07:57.070
stimulant,
narcotic,
drug,
or any other controlled substance?
Well,
that's,

2201
02:07:57.130 --> 02:08:01.240
that's an amazing question.
First of all,
because you can,
you can answer.

2202
02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:06.230
No,
I'm not because I'm not an unlawful user because I'm a medical marijuana user

2203
02:08:06.231 --> 02:08:10.450
and the state of California where I had a doctor's prescription for it.
So no,

2204
02:08:10.570 --> 02:08:12.880
that's done all lot.
But it's not true federally.

2205
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:18.750
And then it's to say are you addicted to marijuana or any depressant stimulant.

2206
02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:20.740
What about coffee?

2207
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:25.090
Like they could like legally they could bring you to jail if you drink coffee

2208
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:27.550
every day.
That's right.
This is how stupid this law is.

2209
02:08:27.670 --> 02:08:32.260
Narcotic drug or any other controlled substance.
That's fascinating man.

2210
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:35.080
All you were an unlawful user of and what does that mean?

2211
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:40.530
A user of in the past tense or user of currently cause like currently I'm not

2212
02:08:41.381 --> 02:08:43.930
doing anything.
I'm not smart.
I'm not doing anything right now.

2213
02:08:43.931 --> 02:08:47.140
So I could say I could write down that report.
No,

2214
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:51.870
because currently I'm not right.
But like what does that mean?
Like user like it.

2215
02:08:51.871 --> 02:08:55.120
How does that fit into your lifestyle?
Like do do you,

2216
02:08:55.121 --> 02:08:58.000
do you have like PR every day you have to smoke a joint.

2217
02:08:58.001 --> 02:09:01.180
Just like everyday you have to take your fucking thyroid medication.
No.

2218
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:03.340
Like what kind of a weird ass question is that?

2219
02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:06.490
What kind of a weird open end questions that and that can keep you from having a

2220
02:09:06.491 --> 02:09:07.324
gun.

2221
02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.360
<v 4>I just got my shit renewed yesterday.
Look,
oh stone.
It wasn't my pitcher.</v>

2222
02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:13.190
You can see my eyes.
You look barbecued son.

2223
02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.930
<v 2>Yeah.
Isn't that fascinating,
man?
Like are you an unlawful user of or addicted to?</v>

2224
02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:22.080
First of all,
the idea that you're addicted to marijuana.
That's like saying,

2225
02:09:22.081 --> 02:09:23.550
are you addicted to washing your hands?

2226
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:26.850
Because it's the same people that get addicted to marijuana or addicted to

2227
02:09:26.851 --> 02:09:27.870
anything and you just,

2228
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:31.540
<v 4>but that's something that an optimistic thing to put on your form because you're</v>

2229
02:09:31.541 --> 02:09:36.400
just naively assuming that anyone's going to answer that question.
Honestly.

2230
02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:36.760
No,
no.

2231
02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.330
<v 2>What they're doing is they're making it so that anybody runs,
uh,</v>

2232
02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:45.370
who runs a medical marijuana plant,
can't arm themselves.
You know,

2233
02:09:45.371 --> 02:09:48.490
if you have a fucking farm and you're growing medical marijuana and the

2234
02:09:48.491 --> 02:09:49.840
government comes in to take you,

2235
02:09:49.841 --> 02:09:53.620
they can also bust you for usually [inaudible] for having these guns illegally

2236
02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:58.660
and for lying on these federal forms,
which is electric like perjury.
Ah,

2237
02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:01.990
these fucking Goblins,
man,
it's the worst.
It's unbelievable.

2238
02:10:01.991 --> 02:10:05.110
I can work that pass through.
You know,
this,

2239
02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.230
this a second.
You know,
the,

2240
02:10:08.231 --> 02:10:13.180
the second amendment is very important part of anybody who wants to hunt their

2241
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:17.650
own food and be able to protect themselves from criminals,
be able to,
uh,

2242
02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.800
you know,
uh,
protect themselves from predators.

2243
02:10:20.801 --> 02:10:22.570
If you live in like a rural community,

2244
02:10:22.571 --> 02:10:24.730
if you live like if you live in Montana and you're,

2245
02:10:24.731 --> 02:10:27.070
you're living out in the woods like that,
that show mountain men,

2246
02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:30.160
these motherfuckers,
they need guns to shoot off bears.

2247
02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:33.350
They have bears that they need to shoot at.
I mean,
if you don't,

2248
02:10:33.351 --> 02:10:34.100
the bear comes in each

2249
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.460
<v 8>you,</v>

2250
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:38.900
I mean to say that they can't have bears because they also have arthritis that

2251
02:10:38.901 --> 02:10:40.460
medical marijuana cures.

2252
02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:44.830
<v 4>Well,
look,
here's the other fucking thing.
By the way,
fuck the reason.
God dammit.</v>

2253
02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:49.090
Here's another fun thing you can do.
Shoot shooting guns.
It just fucking fun.

2254
02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.920
It's fun to shoot bottles.
It's fun to shoot targets.
It's fun to shoot a fire,

2255
02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:56.440
a gun.
It's just a blast.
Like there shouldn't,
we should.

2256
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:58.750
The whole point is it's not about reason.

2257
02:10:58.751 --> 02:11:01.120
It's like you get to have a gun in this country.

2258
02:11:01.121 --> 02:11:02.410
If you want to have a fucking gun.

2259
02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:06.160
It shouldn't be based on whether or not you smoke something that grows out of

2260
02:11:06.161 --> 02:11:11.020
the ground.
Meanwhile,
you can have like hunter s Thompson had a fucking bar.

2261
02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:13.380
It is shooting range,
a bar.
Have you ever seen that?

2262
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:16.780
A full fucking bar with a butler.
You can have that.
Yeah,

2263
02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:19.160
but you can't smoke pot and shoot.
That's right.
Yes.

2264
02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:22.990
<v 8>Yeah.
You could be.
You got a prescription for Oxycontin as long as it's legal.</v>

2265
02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.540
As long as it's legal,
you don't have that problem.

2266
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:30.870
Any Person Buhr assistant director Arthur Herbert rights in the open letter to

2267
02:11:32.441 --> 02:11:33.820
all gun sellers.
Yes.

2268
02:11:33.850 --> 02:11:38.260
Any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana,

2269
02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:43.410
regardless of whether his or her state has passed legislation authorizing

2270
02:11:44.291 --> 02:11:49.291
marijuana used for medicinal purposes is prohibited by federal law from

2271
02:11:49.991 --> 02:11:54.520
possessing firearms or ammunition.
That shit makes me want to join the NRA.

2272
02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.710
It really does.
The I am going to,
I think I am.
I think the NRA was fucking dead,

2273
02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:00.070
right?

2274
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:04.840
I think they all this time that the NRA has been trying to stop the government

2275
02:12:04.841 --> 02:12:08.200
from taking away gun rights.
Now I understand it now.

2276
02:12:08.201 --> 02:12:11.740
I get it all this time I thought it was like,
wow,
these crazy gun nuts.

2277
02:12:11.741 --> 02:12:13.150
They really want to have machine guns.
Hey,

2278
02:12:13.151 --> 02:12:15.430
they really want to have assault rifles.
No,

2279
02:12:15.490 --> 02:12:19.270
they just don't want to have these people telling you what you can and can't

2280
02:12:19.271 --> 02:12:20.104
have.

2281
02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:23.680
<v 4>It's simple man.
It's a simple fucking right.
It's obvious.</v>

2282
02:12:23.730 --> 02:12:27.720
<v 8>It's to the ATF,
uh,
or the National Rifle Association is in commenting on it.</v>

2283
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:31.800
So as the national rifle association with frequently but with which frequency?

2284
02:12:31.890 --> 02:12:36.420
Frequently butts heads with the ATF has not put out a statement on the letter

2285
02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:40.820
and a spokesperson there did not return calls for comment.
Oh,

2286
02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.390
spokesman for rocky mountain gun owners was also silent.
Well,

2287
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:50.470
you know,
that's a,
that's,
that's really sad.
That's,

2288
02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:54.750
it's a really sad thing because that's just the pressure from pharmaceutical

2289
02:12:54.751 --> 02:12:57.780
companies that are trying to make sure that medical marijuana doesn't spill off

2290
02:12:57.781 --> 02:13:02.040
into some sort of,
uh,
uh,
decriminalization event nationwide and,
you know,

2291
02:13:02.041 --> 02:13:04.640
to stop it in its place.
They've they,
they started,

2292
02:13:04.641 --> 02:13:08.550
it started out in Montana and a,
the reason why it's in Montana is because,

2293
02:13:08.551 --> 02:13:09.780
have you ever been to Montana?

2294
02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:14.610
A huge percentage of the people in Montana Hunt when we were in Montana,
um,

2295
02:13:14.670 --> 02:13:19.410
everywhere we drove people where there was like signs that said welcome hunters,

2296
02:13:19.411 --> 02:13:22.140
like in bars and restaurants to welcome hunters.

2297
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:25.320
It's a lot of fucking people hunting up there and there's also a lot of people

2298
02:13:25.321 --> 02:13:26.370
out there that liked to get high,

2299
02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:31.700
so they decided to kill the medical marijuana community there by making it so

2300
02:13:32.461 --> 02:13:36.030
that if you are illegal registered medical marijuana patient,

2301
02:13:36.031 --> 02:13:38.640
you can't own a firearm.
Well fucking pigs.

2302
02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:42.600
Unbaked fucking believably gross man.
It's really disgusting.

2303
02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:47.580
It said,
I'm Jeff door.
Sure.
A spokesperson,

2304
02:13:47.610 --> 02:13:52.260
a spokesman for the US attorney's office in Colorado said the decision whether

2305
02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:56.730
to prosecute someone would be made on a case by case basis.

2306
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:59.130
That's basically saying they have you by the balls.

2307
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:02.850
There don't appear to be any cases in Colorado where people have been prosecuted

2308
02:14:02.851 --> 02:14:06.090
for illegally owning guns because they are medical marijuana patients because

2309
02:14:06.091 --> 02:14:09.050
there's so many medical marijuana patients who have guns in Colorado.
You,

2310
02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:11.580
you've just made felons out of you know,

2311
02:14:11.581 --> 02:14:13.920
a million people and that's not exaggeration.

2312
02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.130
The medical marijuana community in Colorado is fucking amazing,

2313
02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:19.800
<v 4>isn't it?
Isn't it basically a slippery slope though?</v>

2314
02:14:19.801 --> 02:14:24.801
Like the moment you ask as a government say that people can't consume a plant

2315
02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:29.940
that has,
you can't overdose on the moment you're making laws like that,

2316
02:14:29.941 --> 02:14:33.420
isn't it kind of a slippery slope where you can't expect there to be other

2317
02:14:33.421 --> 02:14:35.790
logical laws following that?
I mean,

2318
02:14:35.791 --> 02:14:40.791
isn't the thing like of like what they're doing is obviously wrong and that

2319
02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:42.630
seems to be part of what they do.

2320
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:47.870
The federal government makes shitty laws that have no basis in actual reality

2321
02:14:49.291 --> 02:14:52.080
and are just based on whatever their weird power agenda is.

2322
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:56.160
<v 8>It's that,
but I think it's also them.
It's a death row.</v>

2323
02:14:56.190 --> 02:14:59.100
They're exposing their belly.
I think they're,
they're,

2324
02:14:59.101 --> 02:15:03.030
they're showing how fucking stupid their system really is.

2325
02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:04.320
That they're actually,

2326
02:15:04.750 --> 02:15:08.790
they're creating a law that's going to make people angry and furious and the

2327
02:15:08.791 --> 02:15:12.780
wrong people gun owners because gun over gun owners and hunters for some of the

2328
02:15:12.781 --> 02:15:17.150
most organized motherfuckers.
You know,
it's really interesting how these,
um,

2329
02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:20.220
fish and game departments are entirely funded.

2330
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:23.070
The conservation efforts are entirely funded by hunters.

2331
02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.400
Hunters and hunting and gun owners are the ones who organize like one of the

2332
02:15:28.411 --> 02:15:32.820
best run departments in the entire country is the,
the,
the different states,

2333
02:15:32.821 --> 02:15:33.930
fish and game departments.

2334
02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:36.960
They're incredibly efficient at managing game populations,

2335
02:15:36.961 --> 02:15:38.620
et setting tag limits at,
at it,

2336
02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:43.650
managing the number of livestock or wildlife rather wildlife stock like men and

2337
02:15:43.651 --> 02:15:46.790
females.
And they do all these surveys and tests.

2338
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:50.130
They're incredibly efficient because it's all based on people actually care

2339
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:53.280
about the environment who actually go out and hunt these wild animals.

2340
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:57.210
So you're going,
you're going,
you're going to get them against you.
You know,

2341
02:15:57.211 --> 02:15:58.560
and this is supposed to be,

2342
02:15:58.561 --> 02:16:00.840
the government is supposed to be the people that are looking out for you.

2343
02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:05.040
There's no reason to pass this.
There's no fucking reason.

2344
02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:08.910
They're just making shit more complicated and making government deeper,

2345
02:16:08.911 --> 02:16:10.980
creating more fucking problems,

2346
02:16:11.250 --> 02:16:15.120
creating more conti scenarios where you're going to lock someone in jail because

2347
02:16:15.121 --> 02:16:18.660
they liked to smoke weed and I like to hunt.
You dummies.
Yep.

2348
02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:22.160
<v 4>Ps,
all this makes me want to do is get baked and go shoot a gun.</v>

2349
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:24.170
<v 8>Almost makes me want to do is go to Canada.</v>

2350
02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:27.800
I told it makes me want to do it makes me want to run away from these stupid

2351
02:16:27.801 --> 02:16:31.390
fucking laws.
These are dumb.
The idea that you could put yourself in jeopardy,

2352
02:16:31.391 --> 02:16:34.450
that you could possibly get locked in a cage and not be able to see your family

2353
02:16:34.451 --> 02:16:38.200
for an extended period of time because you did something that you wanted to do

2354
02:16:38.201 --> 02:16:42.670
that didn't hurt anybody.
It's fucking crazy and believe me,

2355
02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:46.660
if you were stoned and you had a gun,
you'd be careful as fuck.
Oh my God.

2356
02:16:46.661 --> 02:16:51.010
You'd be so goddamn paranoid or I think you would.
You might be an idiot though.

2357
02:16:51.011 --> 02:16:53.860
You might just fuck it,
dude.
Just start shooting things.

2358
02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:55.980
<v 4>Man.
When I,
when I grew up around guns,</v>

2359
02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:00.870
nothing is like growing up around guns makes you so safe with guns.

2360
02:17:00.871 --> 02:17:05.520
Like somewhat since I was like can remember my dad liked me cause kids like

2361
02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:10.560
little boys I fake gun and my dad would like even with a fake guns he would like

2362
02:17:10.831 --> 02:17:14.910
teach us like never point this in somebody,
here's how you handle a weapon.

2363
02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:18.930
And then when then of course you would like taught us to shoot and it was like

2364
02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:23.070
the way how strict and stern he was with weapons.

2365
02:17:23.071 --> 02:17:24.810
Like I'll never forget that.

2366
02:17:24.811 --> 02:17:29.130
I'm so fucking careful when I get around guns because he like raised me in the

2367
02:17:29.131 --> 02:17:31.620
right way.
And that came from being only people who haven't been around.

2368
02:17:31.621 --> 02:17:33.180
Guns are afraid of guns.

2369
02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:33.621
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

2370
02:17:33.621 --> 02:17:38.621
You know like when your kids find guns in your house and if your kids are raised

2371
02:17:38.841 --> 02:17:42.530
and taught what a gun is and what's important and why it's dangerous,

2372
02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:44.720
they're going to be okay because they're there.

2373
02:17:44.721 --> 02:17:46.480
They're used to being around them anyway.

2374
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.310
<v 4>You know what the saddest,
put the safety on.
You know,</v>

2375
02:17:49.311 --> 02:17:52.830
when the safety's off you note and not to fucking pointed at anyone

2376
02:17:53.370 --> 02:17:55.290
<v 8>bullet in the chamber,
you know,
all those things.</v>

2377
02:17:55.410 --> 02:17:57.780
<v 4>And also,
by the way,
if you've got fucking guns,</v>

2378
02:17:57.781 --> 02:18:00.300
the responsible thing is you have a goddamn gun safe.

2379
02:18:00.330 --> 02:18:03.420
You put your fucking guns in a safe,
you don't leave them around.
Yeah.

2380
02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:06.400
<v 8>Period.
Yeah.
It's um,
it's,</v>

2381
02:18:06.430 --> 02:18:10.540
it's really unfortunate when the government has to pass laws like this.

2382
02:18:10.630 --> 02:18:11.470
They don't have to,

2383
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:16.240
but when they try to pass laws like this to further some other agenda,

2384
02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:19.870
it's the,
the,
the agenda against medical marijuana is what it is.

2385
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:23.410
It's that simple.
It's trying to slow the medical marijuana movement.

2386
02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.760
And so they involve guns and I,
I think it's a mistake.
It's fucking disgusting.

2387
02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:32.940
Did you see that editorial article CNN just put out on a legal why we should

2388
02:18:33.011 --> 02:18:36.970
legalize marijuana?
Yes,
I did see.
So cool.
It's amazing.
Well,
meanwhile,

2389
02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:40.120
still illegal.
Meanwhile,
people are getting arrested every 37 seconds.

2390
02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:45.160
Is that the statistics?
39 37 30 Jesus,

2391
02:18:45.161 --> 02:18:49.510
man.
Yeah.
In this country,
by the way.
Yeah.
That's fucking stupid.
Stupid.

2392
02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:53.590
It's a waste of Goddamn time and it's become a business in and of itself.

2393
02:18:53.770 --> 02:18:57.850
That's the real issue.
The real issue is that it's become a fucking business.

2394
02:18:58.030 --> 02:19:00.970
The business of arresting people and keeping people in jail.

2395
02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:06.150
The business of closing down medical marijuana farms and catching Mexican drug

2396
02:19:06.251 --> 02:19:10.270
runners living in the,
uh,
northern California mountains,
and they have giant,

2397
02:19:10.330 --> 02:19:15.330
like wild fucking these huge setups out there where they have the shit growing

2398
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:18.730
wild,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
So brains up there constantly,

2399
02:19:18.731 --> 02:19:21.760
you could just start planting it.
Yeah.
And then they harvest it all,

2400
02:19:21.761 --> 02:19:24.700
but they have these dudes living up there and camps.
They have a,

2401
02:19:24.730 --> 02:19:29.730
they even have a god or a a saint that they pray to that narcos on their fucking

2402
02:19:29.841 --> 02:19:32.870
guns.
Yeah.
They have like pictures of the sky,

2403
02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:36.770
but is the narco saints these got it name.
Hold on,
I'll find out.

2404
02:19:36.771 --> 02:19:40.750
What is working name is powerful.
Google.
Good.
Go.
Hasemyer.

2405
02:19:41.290 --> 02:19:44.040
Gugu look at it.
The fuck was de Souza.

2406
02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:49.140
Malverde sometimes known as the generous band at the angel of the poor or the

2407
02:19:49.191 --> 02:19:51.830
narcan bandits.
Robin had.
Isn't that amazing?

2408
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:55.250
Do you know what Robin Hood was initially about?
Now the king owned land.

2409
02:19:55.251 --> 02:19:56.450
You couldn't hunt the Kingsland.

2410
02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:00.710
Robin Hood would hunt the land and take the deer and a and give it to the poor.

2411
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:04.340
That's what the robbing from the rich and feeding the poor was none.
Amazing.

2412
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:07.860
Yeah.
I thought it was about money.
I,
we started out with that,

2413
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:10.370
start out with poaching.
Poaching the king's deer.

2414
02:20:11.130 --> 02:20:14.520
<v 4>The king's mother,
dear man.
The king's always got deer.
Yeah.</v>

2415
02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:18.030
<v 8>Well apparently the difference between the way wildlife is run in American</v>

2416
02:20:18.031 --> 02:20:21.750
wildlife was run in the European world and that was one of the things that made

2417
02:20:21.751 --> 02:20:26.220
the United States so great when people came here from Europe,
was that in Europe?

2418
02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.760
Uh,
all land and hunting is all owned by royalty and rich people.
Yeah.

2419
02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:34.140
And so there's no private,
there is no public hunting.

2420
02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:37.500
It's all on private land.
Whereas in America,

2421
02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.950
the wildlife is all the,
the people's,

2422
02:20:40.951 --> 02:20:45.600
like even on public or even on private land,
like say if you own private land,

2423
02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:48.930
you still can't shoot everything that's on that land.

2424
02:20:48.931 --> 02:20:52.380
You have to have like a tag for the deer,
right?
You have to kill,
you know,

2425
02:20:52.381 --> 02:20:55.920
only a certain amount of them according to how much population you have in the

2426
02:20:55.921 --> 02:20:59.670
area.
And that was a,
what was that made like?

2427
02:20:59.671 --> 02:21:04.020
These Daniel Boone characters that came here from,
from a European background,

2428
02:21:04.021 --> 02:21:08.880
so happy that they could live this sort of a different life where they're

2429
02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:13.530
running around just hunting whenever they want it to and be able to provide for

2430
02:21:13.531 --> 02:21:15.810
their family,
which you couldn't do in,
in Europe.

2431
02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:20.820
You literally couldn't go out and hunt food unless you went to a private land

2432
02:21:20.821 --> 02:21:24.390
preserve.
It's still a lot of countries in Scotland is still like that can,

2433
02:21:24.391 --> 02:21:27.390
I can't just go there.
I have to go to these private places.

2434
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:29.900
<v 4>It's amazing,
man.
It's incredible.</v>

2435
02:21:29.901 --> 02:21:33.920
The different things that powerful people will do cunt.
Yeah.

2436
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:37.700
Fix the world.
Dunkin.
I'm working on Ken,
you're the king.
Fix the world.

2437
02:21:37.701 --> 02:21:40.730
How you do it?
How do I fix the world?
Yes.
Well,

2438
02:21:40.731 --> 02:21:45.350
I mean obviously we start paying teachers the amount that we paid doctors,

2439
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:48.860
creating a competitive environment and doctors getting fucked over man.
Well,

2440
02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:49.460
let's see.
Okay,

2441
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:53.120
so we pay teachers a fuck load of money so that it becomes what you pay actors.

2442
02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:55.250
Yeah,
that's it.
Imagine that.
That's it.

2443
02:21:55.251 --> 02:21:57.590
And you have like Academy Awards for the best teachers.

2444
02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:01.040
So teachers become the celebrities.
Yeah.
Fucking make it so that the,

2445
02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:03.710
it's the most competitive energy industry to get in.

2446
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:08.030
So the people who become teachers or these fucking super genius,

2447
02:22:08.031 --> 02:22:12.590
brilliant people who start really teaching kids about how incredible and

2448
02:22:12.591 --> 02:22:13.730
beautiful the universe is,

2449
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:18.910
teach them about fucking Feinman teach them how to like a synthesize LSD

2450
02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:22.640
boom that you do that man

2451
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:26.230
<v 8>behavior as labeled in the Patriot Act.
What you just said,
what</v>

2452
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:30.830
<v 4>teaching them about Feinman no,
the other part.
Ah,
well fuck them dude.</v>

2453
02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:36.800
Everybody fuck them,
dude.
No,
that's the problem man.

2454
02:22:36.801 --> 02:22:39.410
You fucking start with the kids.
Get them educated,

2455
02:22:39.411 --> 02:22:41.180
get them re excited about life.

2456
02:22:41.390 --> 02:22:45.590
Get them to understand that we exist in a beautiful,
juicy,
vibrant world.

2457
02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:49.370
And that your brain is an owl chemical laboratory which can produce thoughts,

2458
02:22:49.371 --> 02:22:51.050
which if you put those thoughts into action,

2459
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:54.710
can transform your entire planet in the same way that the invention of

2460
02:22:54.711 --> 02:22:58.670
electricity or the varieties of technologies that have come from the mind have

2461
02:22:58.671 --> 02:23:00.440
shifted our planet.
Uh,

2462
02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:05.620
completely and perhaps perpetually you teach kids that your mind is a fucking,

2463
02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.160
is the laboratory from which every single innovation that is affected your

2464
02:23:10.161 --> 02:23:11.540
species has come.

2465
02:23:11.690 --> 02:23:15.710
You share the same brain that Einstein had fine Manhattan,

2466
02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:19.730
Buddha had you have that computer.
Here's some,

2467
02:23:19.850 --> 02:23:22.820
here's different operating systems that you can decide on.

2468
02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:25.730
You teach them about yoga.
You teach them about health,

2469
02:23:25.850 --> 02:23:29.810
you get them fucking high when they're ready.
Initiatory rituals,

2470
02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:35.020
you bring them into a visceral experience of the beauty of life.

2471
02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:38.540
Instead of putting them in little fucking boxes,

2472
02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:42.800
making them sit at uncomfortable seats and listened to underpaid,
angry people.

2473
02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:46.370
Not all of them.
Some teachers don't give a fuck and they're beautiful people,

2474
02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:49.940
but some of them are like not being treated with any kind of respect.

2475
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:54.650
And the end result is there's speed.
You're there,
they're phoning it in,
you know,

2476
02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.910
and so that makes kids,

2477
02:23:55.911 --> 02:23:58.790
when they think about reading or books or math or any of it,

2478
02:23:58.791 --> 02:24:02.210
they just have this like the same reaction you have when you've gotten a Tequila

2479
02:24:02.211 --> 02:24:06.020
hangover and someone offers you tequila because you've been having this shit,
uh,

2480
02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:08.150
pumped into you in the absolute wrong way.

2481
02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:13.300
We can't educate kids the way we make flog raw by fucking forcing shit down into

2482
02:24:14.901 --> 02:24:19.100
their mouse until they're poisoned and sickened by it and hate it because it's

2483
02:24:19.101 --> 02:24:20.930
coming from angry,
bitter people.

2484
02:24:20.931 --> 02:24:23.810
A lot of the times I can remember certain teachers I had,
man,

2485
02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:29.050
there were of course hist angry shit ads and it made me hate the information.

2486
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.530
Okay.

2487
02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:31.760
<v 2>But play devil's advocate.
When you look at the,</v>

2488
02:24:31.761 --> 02:24:36.490
the possibility of computer simulations and you look at the idea that life is

2489
02:24:36.491 --> 02:24:38.080
some sort of computer program,

2490
02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:41.830
those people inspired you to not be like them.

2491
02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:45.250
Those people inspired you with,
uh,

2492
02:24:45.310 --> 02:24:48.680
energy and the motivation and will to,

2493
02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:53.020
to move past their paradigm and to see the error of their ways.

2494
02:24:53.290 --> 02:24:56.770
And one of the best ways to see the error of someone's ways is to see someone

2495
02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:00.940
who's just preaching bullshit,
living a miserable life.
You see it and it's like,

2496
02:25:00.941 --> 02:25:05.290
it's,
it's almost more powerful sometimes then a positive image and a,

2497
02:25:05.291 --> 02:25:06.490
a positive message.

2498
02:25:06.690 --> 02:25:10.480
Some of the reason why I got motivated to do all the things that I did was cause

2499
02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:12.310
I was raised shitty.

2500
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:14.440
<v 4>I'll tell you what's motivated me,
dude.</v>

2501
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:17.860
What's motivated me is running into some really great teachers in my life.

2502
02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:20.290
You my friend,
email Amos,

2503
02:25:20.291 --> 02:25:24.070
this guy's a fucking amazing musicians that genius different have different

2504
02:25:24.071 --> 02:25:27.610
college professors.
The professor who convinced me to go to fucking India,

2505
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:29.920
like really brilliant people.

2506
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:34.240
<v 8>I agree with that.
You've done the same thing to me as I have all of my,
uh,
my,</v>

2507
02:25:34.241 --> 02:25:35.370
my friends.
Yeah.

2508
02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:40.480
But I also think that the people that would try to stop me and the people that

2509
02:25:40.481 --> 02:25:42.880
are such shitty things to me,
those,
those people just,

2510
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:47.500
they start a fire inside of me that I don't know if it would have been there if

2511
02:25:47.501 --> 02:25:52.000
just it was just a positive reaction.
No,
the Yin and the Yang is important

2512
02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:53.690
<v 4>and I am certainly not.</v>

2513
02:25:53.691 --> 02:25:56.320
I clearly you're never going to get rid of this fucking that,

2514
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:57.450
that negative element.

2515
02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:02.310
But you can be with people who teach what you just said,
what you just said,

2516
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:06.990
which is a kind of like Nietzsche and idea that we need that part of what we

2517
02:26:06.991 --> 02:26:10.800
need is a thing to resist.
We need a thing to rise above.

2518
02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:14.820
We need a thing that we can get angry at the Mo that motivates us,

2519
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.600
but that shit can be taught.
You can teach that to kids.

2520
02:26:18.750 --> 02:26:20.310
You can teach that to people.

2521
02:26:20.311 --> 02:26:25.140
Like you can show people that you could just bring people these philosophies

2522
02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.340
that have been developed by super geniuses and let the kids pick,

2523
02:26:29.341 --> 02:26:31.500
let them decide.
And you can do it.

2524
02:26:31.620 --> 02:26:35.460
Coming from charismatics and coming from performers instead of coming from

2525
02:26:35.461 --> 02:26:36.960
people who just want to get fucking home.

2526
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:41.180
<v 8>So there's like this positive ways to achieve results and there's negative ways</v>

2527
02:26:41.181 --> 02:26:46.181
to achieve positive results and the negative reinforcement forces you to rebound

2528
02:26:47.361 --> 02:26:47.950
and to,

2529
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:52.430
to push away from that and thus create a positive result.

2530
02:26:52.431 --> 02:26:57.080
But it's also possible to create that positive result with correct nurturing and

2531
02:26:57.081 --> 02:27:01.250
a real philosophy for life.
A real positive philosophy.
So it's,

2532
02:27:01.430 --> 02:27:04.970
it's almost like we are,
we're almost,

2533
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:09.810
we're almost destined to follow a positive.
We,

2534
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:14.070
we have several different options for achieving a positive result,

2535
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:17.160
including being raised badly,
you know,

2536
02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:20.460
including being raised by someone who doesn't care about you and forces you to

2537
02:27:20.461 --> 02:27:22.110
be a much more loving and caring,

2538
02:27:22.130 --> 02:27:23.260
<v 4>apparent.
You know,
this,</v>

2539
02:27:23.490 --> 02:27:27.540
this is a story I really probably piss off a lot of the audience cause it's a

2540
02:27:27.541 --> 02:27:29.370
Jesus story,
but I just read it.

2541
02:27:29.371 --> 02:27:33.510
Somebody sent me this book of like monks writing essays on the Gospels and

2542
02:27:33.570 --> 02:27:36.270
there's this,
and when you hear this,
at first it's like,
come on,

2543
02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.400
that's so fucking stupid.
But then when you think about it,

2544
02:27:38.401 --> 02:27:39.480
it's kind of a cool idea.

2545
02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:43.920
But there's this story like Christ is walking through the temple with his

2546
02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:48.360
fucking disciples and there's a blind man that he heals.

2547
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:51.150
And um,
they ask him

2548
02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:56.850
why was that man blind was,
why was that man born blind?

2549
02:27:56.851 --> 02:27:59.520
Is it because of his sins or that now you have to understand this is coming from

2550
02:27:59.521 --> 02:28:03.000
a primitive desert philosophy,
sins and all that shit.
But they're saying,

2551
02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:06.600
is it because of his Karma or is it because his parents bad Karma?

2552
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:09.720
They're asking like,
what's the reason that this guy is fucked up?

2553
02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:12.930
And the response is really brilliant and their response was the guy.

2554
02:28:12.931 --> 02:28:17.070
And if you take it literally it's stupid.
But their response was he was,

2555
02:28:17.370 --> 02:28:21.560
he's born blind so that that miracle could be worked through him.

2556
02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.340
So that novelty could come into the universe in the moment that he regained his

2557
02:28:25.341 --> 02:28:28.520
sight.
And I think that's a really beautiful fucking idea,

2558
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.130
which is that your situation,

2559
02:28:31.310 --> 02:28:33.950
whatever your specific situation happens to be,

2560
02:28:33.951 --> 02:28:38.000
that as a negative backed into a corner,
dark fucking place.

2561
02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:40.850
In one way it's the most awful thing ever.

2562
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:44.390
But in another way there is nothing more fucking beautiful.

2563
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:46.670
Like when you have a friend who's like a desperate,

2564
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:50.150
horrible fucking alcoholic who's life has gone to shit,

2565
02:28:50.330 --> 02:28:52.880
who's broke all the time and is almost dying,

2566
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:56.870
and you see him overcome that fucking addiction.
And all of a sudden this guy,

2567
02:28:56.871 --> 02:28:58.940
wherever he goes to anyone who's an alcoholic,

2568
02:28:58.941 --> 02:29:02.690
is like a living representation of the fact that you don't have to live like

2569
02:29:02.691 --> 02:29:07.220
that.
That is fucking powerful.
So your negative state,

2570
02:29:07.221 --> 02:29:10.430
whether you're obese,
whether you're a drunk,
whether you're on heroin,

2571
02:29:10.431 --> 02:29:14.240
whatever the fucking thing is that you happen to be in because of circumstance

2572
02:29:14.241 --> 02:29:17.180
or whatever that has the potential energy,

2573
02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:22.390
you can convert that into a living teaching so that everyone around you can see

2574
02:29:22.641 --> 02:29:25.940
that you mastered yourself and rose above the darkness.

2575
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:27.800
And the people who are in that dark place,

2576
02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:33.040
there'll be inspired by that a million times more than reading the Bhagavad Gita

2577
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:34.200
a thousand times.
Or,
um,

2578
02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:37.970
he's seeing something written down because you're the living example of the fact

2579
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:39.230
that life,

2580
02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:44.390
human life and the human individuals life can radically transform for the

2581
02:29:44.391 --> 02:29:49.100
positive if you focus.
And if you are,
there's some luck in there too.
But,

2582
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:49.970
so the point is,

2583
02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.770
these negative situations they're given to us is [inaudible] just want to say

2584
02:29:54.771 --> 02:29:55.161
given,

2585
02:29:55.161 --> 02:29:59.780
but there an opportunity to really show people shit can get better.

2586
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:02.270
That because men,
when I hear something,
you know,

2587
02:30:02.271 --> 02:30:06.410
like when you see someone who's a cunt and there yapping about whatever the
fuck,

2588
02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:07.131
you know what I mean?

2589
02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:09.650
But their wife socks and they're always in drama and they're in a bad

2590
02:30:09.651 --> 02:30:12.650
relationship.
You know what it's like,
what are you talking about?

2591
02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.480
But when you run into an authentically happy person who's utilized principles

2592
02:30:17.481 --> 02:30:20.840
and transform their lives,
you fucking listen to that man.

2593
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:24.160
<v 8>Well,
when you run into people that are doing things also,</v>

2594
02:30:24.161 --> 02:30:28.680
you like feel the need to do things.
When you read about someone's inspirational,

2595
02:30:28.690 --> 02:30:31.900
you get inspired,
you know,
you,
you,
we,
we,

2596
02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:35.800
we draw energy from other examples,
including negative ones.

2597
02:30:35.801 --> 02:30:37.990
You'll see a fat person will motivate you to go to the gym.

2598
02:30:37.991 --> 02:30:40.510
You'll see some guy in a fucking scooter with his gut hanging over the

2599
02:30:40.511 --> 02:30:44.980
handlebars and you'll,
you'll throw the twinkie away,
you know?
Yeah.
We,
we,
we were,

2600
02:30:44.981 --> 02:30:47.500
were capable of taking positives from negatives.

2601
02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:51.810
<v 4>Damn right.
We can draw energy from all sources.
It doesn't just have to be like,</v>

2602
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:56.040
uh,
uh,
inspirational people.
Certainly you can like the ideal.

2603
02:30:56.050 --> 02:31:00.460
Really the idea is whatever the energy is coming into your deposit shifted,

2604
02:31:00.690 --> 02:31:01.920
turn it,
transform it,

2605
02:31:01.921 --> 02:31:06.540
be the fucking prism that shifts whatever that energy is into like a beautiful

2606
02:31:06.541 --> 02:31:09.820
rainbow instead of like a Turd and even one of those pause.
Positive.

2607
02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:13.540
<v 8>Just let it enhance your rainbow.
Yeah,
to enhance your,</v>

2608
02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:18.340
your your beautiful vision of the world and pump it up even further and you know

2609
02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:21.780
that it's something that like people could say,
oh,
he goes,

2610
02:31:21.781 --> 02:31:24.330
talk about that all the time.
I really think you have to,

2611
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:26.280
I think it's something that's a mantra.

2612
02:31:26.281 --> 02:31:28.260
I think it's something that needs to be repeated.

2613
02:31:28.261 --> 02:31:33.150
It's an ethic that needs to be ingrained in our mentalities and that's why I say

2614
02:31:33.151 --> 02:31:36.030
it all the time because I'm also doing it for myself.
I want to,

2615
02:31:36.031 --> 02:31:39.540
I want to pump my own version of it up in my own head.

2616
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:43.800
I'm not immune to negative feelings and thoughts.

2617
02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:46.590
I'm just a very diligent watcher.

2618
02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:49.980
I'm a very diligent guard if my consciousness,

2619
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:54.750
so when I repeat positive things,
it's not that I'm trying to convince myself.

2620
02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:59.220
It's a marine forcing these positive traits in my own mind and in the mind of

2621
02:31:59.221 --> 02:32:01.110
other people and maybe a little bit,

2622
02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:04.560
a bit repetitive sometimes and get get a bit redundant,
but I think we need it.

2623
02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:08.220
I really do.
I think you need it yourself.
I think I need it.

2624
02:32:08.221 --> 02:32:11.520
I think things society needs it.
I think it's missing.

2625
02:32:11.521 --> 02:32:14.610
It's missing from all of our entertainment.
It's missing from Anderson Cooper,

2626
02:32:14.611 --> 02:32:16.260
CNN reports.
It's missing from,

2627
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:20.070
it's missing from the fucking that news of all this shit of the day and the

2628
02:32:20.071 --> 02:32:22.980
hurricane devastation.
There's missing a,

2629
02:32:22.981 --> 02:32:25.530
a broadcast from the,

2630
02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:28.650
from from the collective consciousness of broadcast,

2631
02:32:28.651 --> 02:32:33.651
from the culture of the world that we can slowly but surely despite all the news

2632
02:32:34.321 --> 02:32:35.640
and evidence to the contrary,

2633
02:32:35.730 --> 02:32:39.660
slowly but surely all moved towards a more positive state.

2634
02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:44.080
<v 4>This thing you're talking about is that what I think of as the river and the</v>

2635
02:32:44.081 --> 02:32:45.100
forest effect.

2636
02:32:45.130 --> 02:32:48.640
If you've ever been walking in a forest and suddenly you become aware of the

2637
02:32:48.641 --> 02:32:52.390
sound of the river.
It's been there the whole time,
but if you don't,

2638
02:32:52.391 --> 02:32:55.360
it's such a subtle sound that blends in with the wind and the sound,

2639
02:32:55.361 --> 02:32:59.380
but all of a sudden you hear that light trickling of water running over rocks.

2640
02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:00.910
That's what you're talking about.

2641
02:33:00.911 --> 02:33:05.290
It's a kind of like metaphysical river that runs through everything and it's

2642
02:33:05.291 --> 02:33:09.550
very subtle and it's very easy to forget that it's there

2643
02:33:09.570 --> 02:33:12.000
<v 8>and we got to figure out how to get it to the ATF.</v>

2644
02:33:12.390 --> 02:33:15.050
We've got to figure out how to get it to these fucking crazy ass.

2645
02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:17.760
The same people that brought you the fast and the furious,

2646
02:33:17.970 --> 02:33:21.330
trying to lock you up for having a rifle and a fucking medical marijuana
license.

2647
02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:23.850
We've got to get this to the same people that run the federal bank.

2648
02:33:23.851 --> 02:33:27.240
They want to pretend that some fucking crazy debt that we have to pay off to.

2649
02:33:27.241 --> 02:33:28.074
Hello,

2650
02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:32.020
<v 4>what?
Where's that money?
What does it even mean?</v>

2651
02:33:32.021 --> 02:33:37.021
What is your money represent you fucking crazy ass holes with your numbers and

2652
02:33:38.051 --> 02:33:41.200
your fucking,
the scroll underneath the,

2653
02:33:41.350 --> 02:33:44.360
when you're watching the news and that stock market scroll goes under,

2654
02:33:44.361 --> 02:33:49.060
you're like,
what are you sad?
Yeah,
fuck are you doing,

2655
02:33:49.061 --> 02:33:51.790
we have to fix it.
Well first fucking here at yourself.

2656
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:54.490
That's the first goddamn sticks.
The people,
goddammit,

2657
02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:58.930
fix the conch and then get to the point where the consciousness is evolved so,

2658
02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:02.350
so much that it's,
it's,
it's ridiculous to everyone,

2659
02:34:02.351 --> 02:34:05.680
including the people that are in charge.
But it,
you know,
and I,

2660
02:34:05.681 --> 02:34:06.850
this is another thing we always say,

2661
02:34:06.851 --> 02:34:08.920
but we're just talking about this reminds me of it,
man.

2662
02:34:08.921 --> 02:34:12.610
It's so easy to forget this shit and it's so easy to like go out into the world

2663
02:34:12.611 --> 02:34:15.100
and like everything's Goddamn like rubbing you the wrong way.

2664
02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:19.150
Everything's like can seem fucking terrible.
But then when you realize like,
no,

2665
02:34:19.330 --> 02:34:20.590
you don't have to be a victim,

2666
02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:24.220
you can either get rolled by the wave of phenomena or you can surf on the

2667
02:34:24.221 --> 02:34:26.980
fucking top of it.
And when you remember that,

2668
02:34:26.981 --> 02:34:28.600
then suddenly when you go out into the world,

2669
02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:33.130
the asshole you run into at the fucking gym,
the shitty waiter,
whatever,

2670
02:34:33.131 --> 02:34:34.780
the cotton traffic,

2671
02:34:34.930 --> 02:34:39.930
these things become little packets of energy that you can use to enhance your

2672
02:34:40.181 --> 02:34:42.160
existence and to grow,
but God damn,

2673
02:34:42.161 --> 02:34:45.520
it's easy to forget and it's easier to have led them to be rolled.

2674
02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:48.430
It's easier to be angry.
It's a form of laziness.

2675
02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:51.680
<v 8>Yeah.
We're an intellectual laziness and physical laziness.</v>

2676
02:34:51.681 --> 02:34:54.620
That's one of the things that look,
in order to have a sound body,

2677
02:34:54.621 --> 02:34:57.980
you have to have a sound mind.
Sounds like a cliche,
but it's fucking true.

2678
02:34:57.981 --> 02:35:00.890
You got to eat healthy and you got to drink a lot of water and you got to get

2679
02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:03.830
some fucking exercise and if you don't get some exercise in,

2680
02:35:03.831 --> 02:35:06.350
your body's going to betray you.
Your body's going to lie to you.

2681
02:35:06.351 --> 02:35:08.270
It's going to give you stress.
It's unnecessary.

2682
02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:10.520
It's going to send you signals that you have to deal with.

2683
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:13.070
You need to keep your fucking machine healthy.

2684
02:35:13.071 --> 02:35:16.250
Your vehicle for traveling through this dimension is your body.

2685
02:35:16.460 --> 02:35:19.670
Keep that bitch healthy.
See,
I see this shit.
This is water.

2686
02:35:19.671 --> 02:35:21.650
I drink a liter of this every couple of hours.

2687
02:35:21.651 --> 02:35:26.150
I slept like a race horse every five seconds in my pain court.
And folks,

2688
02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:29.750
take your vitamin.
Brian's over there with a class of heroin mixed with AIDS.

2689
02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:34.970
<v 4>Yeah,
I flavor my heroin with AIDS.
There's nothing like heroin flavor.</v>

2690
02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:37.910
<v 8>Take off your glasses and show the world your eyes,
Duncan Trussell.</v>

2691
02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:40.220
Let them know.
Let them see your soul.

2692
02:35:40.460 --> 02:35:43.760
Let them see through the windows of your soul.
They're fun to wear those glasses,

2693
02:35:43.761 --> 02:35:45.470
man.
Folks,

Fun fest this weekend in Austin,

2696
02:35:52.481 --> 02:35:56.590
but on the sixth what does that,
it's as bad as festival in Austin.

2697
02:35:56.591 --> 02:35:58.720
That happens on the flooring is bad ass from Austin,

2698
02:35:59.110 --> 02:36:00.790
but the show please come to this.

2699
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:05.910
It's Fitzgerald's in Houston on the sixth that is a show that I really would

2700
02:36:05.981 --> 02:36:08.560
love for you guys to come.
I have one in Dallas,
but it's sold out.

2701
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:12.730
But the one in Houston,
there's still tickets November six at Fitzgerald's.

2702
02:36:12.731 --> 02:36:15.640

2703

Thanks.
Let me plug please anytime.
Man.</v>

2704
02:36:19.681 --> 02:36:23.310
This weekend,

Washington on Saturday night,

2705
02:36:23.311 --> 02:36:27.750
the November 3rd at the Moore theater is completely sold out.
Uh,

2706
02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:32.610

Um,
Voodoo chicken.

2707
02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:34.440
Are you going to make a scheduled appearance?

2708
02:36:34.441 --> 02:36:35.790
We've got to contact the Voodoo chicken.

2709
02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.740
Bryan red bands come in and of course Greg Fitzsimmons will be there as well.
Um,

2710
02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.570
and by the way,
when I say that we're awesome.
Seattle,
I mean,
you guys too.
I mean,

2711
02:36:45.571 --> 02:36:48.510
all of us together,
it's not just like us.

2712
02:36:48.511 --> 02:36:53.010
I wouldn't say like me and Duncan and Brian are awesome.
We're all awesome.
Yeah.

2713
02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:57.240
We're all a part of this awesome experience.
A San Francisco Friday night,

2714
02:36:57.241 --> 02:37:00.750
November 2nd at the Nob Hill Masonic Center.
Yeah,

2715
02:37:00.810 --> 02:37:05.100
I know masonic piece.
I Dunno,
I don't get it.
For me,

2716
02:37:05.101 --> 02:37:07.260
it's just a place to perform.
Folks.
I call live.
Nate,

2717
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:09.870
I don't even call live nation.
I have a representative that calls them.

2718
02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:12.060
I don't even deal with those people for myself.
You know what I'm saying?

2719
02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:15.000
I let somebody else do all the dirty work for me.
That was the only,

2720
02:37:15.350 --> 02:37:16.160
it's there's nothing

2721
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.390
<v 2>sinister about this Nob Hill Masonic Center and um,</v>

2722
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:22.580
they'll probably smell like weed in there.
We're going to get our free on

2723
02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:26.210
<v 3>Fuck San Francisco.
It's one of the greatest fucking to the masons.</v>

2724
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:30.680
New added build a place to focus energy.
I used to,
I performed the masonic hall.

2725
02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:33.980
You can really fucking blast the beam and those places,
man.

2726
02:37:34.050 --> 02:37:37.230
<v 2>I can really do it well.
It's supposed to be a really cool place.
Um,</v>

2727
02:37:37.231 --> 02:37:38.910
and some tickets are still available for that.

2728
02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:41.760
Some tickets are also available for,
uh,

2729
02:37:41.761 --> 02:37:45.870
the metropolis in Montreal in November 16th.
Are you coming with me?

2730
02:37:45.871 --> 02:37:46.704
Duncan Trussell?

2731
02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:51.210
<v 3>Yes.
Montreal.
You're fucking wait.
Yes.
Oh,</v>

2732
02:37:51.211 --> 02:37:54.360
can I say one more thing?
I forgot.
I November 7th and eighth.

2733
02:37:54.361 --> 02:37:57.270
I'm in New Orleans at the hell.
Yeah.
Fast.
So come to that please.

2734
02:37:57.490 --> 02:38:01.870
<v 2>Oh,
Brian,
my little calendar.
You don't have the 10th,
which is San Diego.</v>

2735
02:38:02.110 --> 02:38:06.070
I know Joe Rogan,
uh,
on the,
um,
the Twitter page.

2736
02:38:06.071 --> 02:38:09.400
Please put that up because Joey Diaz and I are at the Balboa theatre.

2737
02:38:09.401 --> 02:38:11.130
Maybe Brian Red Band too,
if he wants to make,

2738
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:14.120
<v 3>well,
I went down the 10th.
Oh No.
You're going to be out of town.</v>

2739
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:18.620
You're going to be in the Ohio.
Yeah.
Cool.
I'm with Tom Sager and a date in the,

2740
02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:21.320
uh,
November 8th and Cincinnati November 9th.

2741
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:25.670
Those two shows are not selling as fast as the Columbus people.
Yeah.

2742
02:38:25.810 --> 02:38:26.950
Which is Columbus now

2743
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:28.410
<v 2>rung as always,</v>

2744
02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.970
that we might be looking into buying Brian's mom's place in Columbus.

2745
02:38:32.971 --> 02:38:35.480
She has a fucking bed and breakfast and turn it into desk.

2746
02:38:35.481 --> 02:38:40.320
Quad studios turned it into the desk while compound.
You're going to fucking buy.

2747
02:38:40.350 --> 02:38:41.730
What are you going to do with Brian's mom?

2748
02:38:41.790 --> 02:38:44.340
We're going to get rid of her or the streets.
No,

2749
02:38:44.341 --> 02:38:46.260
she's got two houses and one of them,

2750
02:38:46.261 --> 02:38:49.230
she owns a bed and breakfast on a giant piece of land where we can hunt deer.

2751
02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:52.650
Dude,
I like it.
How many acres did you talk to?
Mom,

2752
02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:57.610
<v 3>I haven't,
but I will.
It's a lot more than 20 acres.
You saw just the driveway.</v>

2753
02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:01.010
Yeah.
Looks Great.
We need a few hundred acres.
We need it.

2754
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:05.070
Ted Nugent style high fence keeps fucking Buffalo Rockland road.

2755
02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.340
I found a place online.
Some guy sent me this on Twitter where you can uh,

2756
02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:15.310
buy houses that are built on top of old missile silos.

2757
02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:18.430
There's a bunch of them.
Let's get one of those brother.

2758
02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:22.920
That's where they used to manufacture the LSD on the in a fucking,
yes.
That's,

2759
02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:25.930
that.
Was that a,

2760
02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.100
<v 2>there was the a one that,
um,
what's his face?
Hamilton.
Morris.
Yes.
Yeah,</v>

2761
02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:35.810
yeah.
Silo homes,
man.
There's a lot of those.
These are,

2762
02:39:35.811 --> 02:39:37.730
these are incredible.
They uh,

2763
02:39:37.850 --> 02:39:41.270
there's like several homes for sale that are built.

2764
02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:44.240
Like if you go to silo home.com,
you can check these out.

2765
02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:47.710
It sounds like the ultimate apocalyptic scenarios.

2766
02:39:48.250 --> 02:39:52.340
One of them has a fucking runway for a plane and like,
uh,
uh,

2767
02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:57.580
this rustic looking log house that's built over this several floor missile silo

2768
02:39:58.821 --> 02:40:03.260
that's converted into this crazy like storage compound.
Fucking fascinating shit.

2769
02:40:03.261 --> 02:40:07.150
Folks.
Prepare for the apocalypse.
It is coming.
Headache,
they snap it.
You know,

2770
02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:10.460
it already came to New York and New Jersey and all her brothers and sisters out

2771
02:40:10.461 --> 02:40:14.130
there on the beach in Jersey that lost your houses.
Mad,

2772
02:40:14.131 --> 02:40:17.690
love and respect to you and all the people in Long Island that lost it places
we,

2773
02:40:17.710 --> 02:40:22.030
we feel for you that fucking hurricanes,
a content,
a half and a,

2774
02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:24.750
it may be just the beginning of more crazy storms.

2775
02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:26.280
You've got to keep moving folks.

2776
02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:29.280
You can't stay in places that are getting ravaged by nature.

2777
02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:31.560
There's places on earth right now.
We can't live.

2778
02:40:31.561 --> 02:40:34.020
You can't live with their volcanoes.
You can't live in Antarctica.

2779
02:40:34.021 --> 02:40:37.530
You can't live in the fucking North Pole.
We got to keep moving.
Okay?

2780
02:40:37.531 --> 02:40:41.640
And that's one more aspect of our world where we have to understand that this is

2781
02:40:41.641 --> 02:40:46.060
really truly a global community and we can't live in the places that suck.
