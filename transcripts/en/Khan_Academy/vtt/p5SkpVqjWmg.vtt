00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Tutor] What we're going
to discuss in this video

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.155
is the evolution of Japan

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.243
from being one of the most
isolated countries in the world

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.362
during the Tokugawa shogunate

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:14.339
to being the first Asian
country to truly industrialize

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.011
and become a world power.

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:19.740
Historians will often
categorize imperialism

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.043
or colonialism in one of two categories.

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:26.915
You have settler colonialism
and economic colonialism.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:30.476
Settler colonialism is
exemplified by the Americas,

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:33.855
Australia, South Africa,
where you have the empire

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:38.597
sending people from their
country to settle that territory,

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:41.340
oftentimes displacing indigenous people

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.677
and becoming the ruling class.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.323
Then you have economic colonialism

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:49.742
whose primary goal is to
feed the purported needs

00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:51.713
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:54.648
India and Indonesia are
good examples of this.

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:57.205
You're looking for raw
materials to feed your

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:58.598
increased productivity,

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:01.012
and you're also looking for markets.

00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:02.389
And so, in this context,

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.188
as we think about the evolution of Japan

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:07.910
from being extremely isolated
to becoming an imperial power,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.712
think about which of these motivations

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.776
was primary to Japan.

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.943
Or maybe was there a third motivation?

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.219
Let's begin in the 19th century.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.867
Japan is in control of
the Tokugawa shogunate,

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.673
who has closed the country to foreigners.

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:28.095
One of the purported reasons
is fearing the influence

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:32.370
of Christian missionaries as
early as the 17th century.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.868
You have the British in India.

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:37.272
You have the Spanish who
have been in the Philippines

00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:40.251
for several hundred years at this point.

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.322
You have the Dutch in control of much of

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:45.954
what will eventually be Indonesia.

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:48.173
This orange color shows where the French

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:52.789
already have a strong hold in
Indo-China and Southeast Asia.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.215
And then this peach color,

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.880
this is what they would eventually control

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.520
as we get into the latter
half of the 19th century.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.641
But to really understand

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.066
Japanese motivations in the 19th century,

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:07.766
you have to think about what
was happening in Qing China

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.666
as we talk about in the
video on the Opium Wars.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.486
The British and other imperial powers

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:15.993
want access to Chinese markets.

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:19.104
The Europeans want Chinese
porcelain and Chinese silk.

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.758
But the Chinese weren't interested

00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:23.161
in trading with the Europeans.

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.685
The Europeans, especially the British,

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:27.193
eventually do find
something the Chinese want

00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:29.525
and that's opium, which
is an addictive drug.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.818
It's the core ingredient
in heroin and in morphine.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.324
The Chinese government of course

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:37.267
does not want that opium
inside the country,

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:39.462
but as we talk about in previous videos,

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:41.212
the British are able to force their way in

00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:42.858
with the First Opium War,

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:45.738
often referred to as gunboat diplomacy.

00:02:45.738 --> 00:02:47.682
And after winning the First Opium War,

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.677
the British are able to extract
concessions from the Chinese

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:53.228
including opening up these ports.

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:55.909
And even that does not
satisfy the British.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.076
And so, you have the Second
Opium War from 1856 to 1860,

00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:05.644
after which opium, this
addictive drug, is legalized.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:07.439
And to make matters worse for China,

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.155
during the same period, they
have an incredibly bloody

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.908
civil war where over
20 million people die.

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:17.721
Historians think in part due
to the lack of confidence

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.211
in the Qing Dynasty
because of the Opium Wars

00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:25.378
and the opium itself that is
very destructive to society.

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:28.823
Now, the Japanese were watching all this,

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:32.376
and they also had their own
interactions with the West.

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:36.126
In 1853, the American
Commodore Matthew Perry

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.581
comes in with some of his ships

00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:44.225
into Edo Harbor, which
is modern day Tokyo,

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:47.377
and is able to convince the Japanese

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:49.981
to trade with the United States.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.311
The term convinced should
be used very carefully

00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:56.316
because once again, this was
a form of gunboat diplomacy.

00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:57.720
The Japanese saw the ships

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.541
that Commodore Perry traveled with,

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:03.233
and they knew what had happened
during the First Opium War.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.209
And they were in no mood

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.282
to have the same thing happen to them.

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.241
Especially when Commodore
Perry returned in 1854

00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:12.028
with even more ships,
the Japanese decided,

00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:13.045
why fight them?

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.936
We will open up and allow some trade.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:17.601
And this is a very big deal.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:20.096
Remember, the Tokugawa shogunate

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:24.409
had closed the country for over 200 years,

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.709
but now they saw the writing on the wall.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:28.248
They could not defend themselves

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:30.764
against the American warships.

00:04:30.764 --> 00:04:34.943
Like in China, these concessions
in Japan to the Americans

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:39.605
began to undermine trust
in the Tokugawa shogunate.

00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:42.417
And to get a feel for
what people were thinking

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:45.167
in the mid-19th century in Japan,

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:50.704
we have some quotations
from Shimazu Nariakira,

00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:54.214
who was the daimyo of Satsuma,

00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:57.802
which is at the southern tip
of Japan right over here.

00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:00.728
But he was considered to be a
leading thinker of the time.

00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:02.500
And this photograph, it's not so clear,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.934
but this is believed to
be the first photograph

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:06.434
taken by Japanese.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.755
That gives you a sense of the time,

00:05:08.755 --> 00:05:13.450
that photography daguerreotypes
were starting to be in use.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.883
"It was inconceivable

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:17.558
that China would deteriorate
to such a degree."

00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:19.736
Remember, we're talking
about the Opium Wars.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.174
We're talking about the Taiping Rebellion.

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:24.656
"With its vast territory and population,

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.458
"there could not have been a dearth

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:28.879
"of loyal and devoted patriots.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.535
"Yet since the Opium
War its administration

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:34.426
"has been in disorder and ineffective.

00:05:34.426 --> 00:05:36.376
"It has been plagued by rebellion

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:41.061
"while England and France
have invaded it from without.

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:43.543
"Japan lies to the east of China,

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.972
"and is in such a
position as to necessitate

00:05:45.972 --> 00:05:49.529
"immediate steps to prepare
against meeting the same fate

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.690
"as that which has befallen the Chinese;

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.643
"as soon as England achieves
its design in China,

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:59.852
"it will most certainly direct
its military might eastward.

00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:02.915
"If we take the initiative,
we can dominate;

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:05.998
"if we do not, we will be dominated."

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:09.317
And this last sentence is often quoted.

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:12.964
"If we take the initiative,
we can dominate;

00:06:12.964 --> 00:06:16.448
"if we do not, we will be dominated."

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:19.381
It's almost advocating for
a reactionary imperialism.

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:23.709
Become an empire or become
part of someone else's empire.

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:27.505
And this is the path that Japan goes down.

00:06:27.505 --> 00:06:31.672
In 1867, you have the young
Emperor Meiji come to power,

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:36.579
who was only 15 or 16
years old at the time.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:37.973
This would be the beginning

00:06:37.973 --> 00:06:41.291
of what is known as the Meiji Restoration.

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.684
You could say that it's
a restoration of power

00:06:43.684 --> 00:06:45.148
back to the emperor.

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:47.549
The emperor existed even
during the shogunate

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:48.725
but was a figurehead.

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:50.825
It was the shogun who had the power.

00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:53.540
But now, the emperor was able to take back

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.553
the power from the shogunate.

00:06:55.553 --> 00:06:58.652
But the Meiji Restoration is
perhaps even more important

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:03.617
in that it took Japan from
being a closed, feudal country,

00:07:03.617 --> 00:07:05.402
and in only a few decades,

00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:09.258
to a modern industrial imperial power.

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:11.764
Here are some data that
gives you a sense of this.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:15.347
1875, 600,000 metric
tons of coal produced.

00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.304
1913, 21.3 million.

00:07:20.576 --> 00:07:23.365
So it's grown almost 40 fold.

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.032
1873, 26 steamships.

00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:28.922
1913, 1,514 steamships.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:35.055
Railroad track, 1872, only 18 miles.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.372
By 1914, 7,100.

00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:41.921
Emperor Meiji dies in 1912,

00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:46.194
but as we get into 1914, you
start to see World War I.

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.259
And as we talk about in other videos,

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:51.560
this industrialization
of Japan allows it to be

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.355
a major actor in World War I.

00:07:54.355 --> 00:07:56.018
As we exit the 19th century

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:58.193
and we also go to the 20th century,

00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:01.774
we see Japan leveraging
its industrial might

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:03.237
that we see in numbers here

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:05.159
in terms of taking over territory

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:07.742
and becoming an imperial power.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:12.155
In this flashing red, this is what Japan

00:08:12.155 --> 00:08:16.155
is able to take over by
the end of World War II.

00:08:17.703 --> 00:08:19.224
They were able to take over Korea

00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:21.508
at the beginning of the 20th century.

00:08:21.508 --> 00:08:23.197
And even though Hitler's
invasion of Poland

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:26.166
is often given as the
start of World War II,

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:29.527
Japan's occupation and
very brutal occupation

00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:32.123
of Northeast China is often considered

00:08:32.123 --> 00:08:34.090
the real start of World War II.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.755
As World War II progresses,
Japan is able to take

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:38.252
more and more territory,

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:42.127
French Indo-China, British
Burma, the Dutch Indies,

00:08:42.127 --> 00:08:44.039
Indonesia, Philippines.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.156
And this empire only comes to an end

00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:49.363
when Japan has to surrender

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.280
at the end of World War II in 1945.

00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:55.196
So, go back to the previous question.

00:08:55.196 --> 00:08:58.278
What type of colonial power was Japan?

00:08:58.278 --> 00:09:00.481
It definitely wanted
the natural resources.

00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:02.249
In fact, especially when it was at war,

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:05.428
it needed access to oil
which Indonesia had.

00:09:05.428 --> 00:09:07.877
It needed access to natural resources

00:09:07.877 --> 00:09:09.744
that all of these areas had,

00:09:09.744 --> 00:09:11.302
but there was also this element

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:14.521
of wanting to be a major
player on the global stage

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.132
in fear that if it wasn't,

00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:19.736
it might become a victim
of colonization itself.
