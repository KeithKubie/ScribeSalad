00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.480
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.750
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Sapporo,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.240
on the island of Hokkaido
in northern Japan,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.470
and this is gonna be a little bit

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.230
of a different Japanese food tour.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.540
Normally when I do food tours,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.420
it's like one day of all-out eating

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.870
at five or six different places in a row,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.580
but this food tour in Sapporo,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.000
because it's been so cold,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.670
it's actually warming up today,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.135
today's the day we're leaving,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.070
but it's gonna, it was
filmed throughout a few days,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.230
and it was also a family trip,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410
so I was with Ying and
her family, her sisters.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm gonna share with you
some of the best restaurants

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.050
that we tried during our trip.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.500
Here we go, Japanese food tour of Sapporo.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.928
Let's start with the first meal.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:40.095
(fresh beat kicks in)

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.884
(chatter inside bus)

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.000
No view today, it's completely foggy,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.190
but the snow is powdery fresh,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.890
and it is still beautiful up here.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.550
(child coos)

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.830
Earlier this morning, we took the ropeway,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.910
we took the cable car to
the top of the mountain,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.870
there was no visibility, it was foggy,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.910
but it was really beautiful,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.190
and there was powdery snow,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.740
but we all got really cold,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.178
and so one of the best things to eat

00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:27.640
when you're freezing
cold in Japan is ramen,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.290
a hot bowl of ramen,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.290
and Sapporo is the origin
of Japanese miso ramen.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.625
You'll find miso ramen all over Japan now,

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.323
Sapporo is the original.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.996
(machine beeps)

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:56.354
It's the vending machine style,

00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:58.650
you put your money in, you
choose from the vending machine,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.760
and then you get a ticket,
you hand it to the waitress,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.050
and they make you a ramen.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.900
Beautiful little restaurant.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.020
They actually have a few tables,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.253
plus the bar counter seating.

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.650
We just transferred over to a table.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.450
The table opened up, so that
we're all sitting together.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.840
I got the spicy miso, so
it's a little bit red.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.900
You can see the red
oil, maybe even butter,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.723
I know that sometimes they
put butter in the broth,

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:27.310
then extra chashu, the pork slices,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.830
and then soft-boiled egg,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.670
and yeah, you can even see there's like,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.148
there's sliced up leek, maybe,

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:35.700
and then also some, looks
like strands of saffron.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.710
I'm not totally sure, but
that's what it looks like.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.710
And the first thing you have to do

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.660
whenever you eat ramen

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.003
is taste that broth first.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:43.966
(slurps)

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.851
(gasp of enjoyment)

00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:46.684
Oh, wow!

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.150
Oh, that is so rich,
that's so full-bodied,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.780
you can taste the umami of the miso,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.010
that slight fermented saltiness.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.390
You can feel the warmth just going down,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.313
it's like thick, too.

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:01.735
(slurps)

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:03.130
(appreciative gasp)

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.980
Gonna move over into the noodles now,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.000
before digging into that pork.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.240
Oh, there's some paste in there, too.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.040
Sliced leek, maybe?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.570
And then let's try these noodles.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.917
Oh, there's a little bit
of minced meat as well!

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.167
(slurping)

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.490
Slightly chewy, a little
bit wrinkly, cringly,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.840
and then slightly absorbed
some of that broth.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.783
There's some bean
sprouts in there as well.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.541
That chashu (grunts happily)

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.360
you can just feel how tender that is

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.470
without even picking it up,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.720
just in your chopsticks,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.223
the vein of fat just running through it.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.643
Let me rehydrate it.

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:53.827
(slurps)

00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.126
Whoa!

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:03.761
That chashu is amazing.

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.761
It's so tender, it's fatty,
the flavor is bursting,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.733
and then just wrapped
up in that miso base,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.470
and then the egg, and if
you push your chopsticks

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.290
into the egg, you can look how that yolk

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.653
is just perfect!

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.980
And you wanna kinda cradle
it with your chopsticks,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.140
since you gotta squeeze it too hard,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.063
or that yolk, you'll lose your yolk.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:35.840
Oh, wow, okay, that egg is spectacular.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.103
That yolk is so perfectly
smooth and creamy.

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:47.087
Whoa, yeah, this is a spectacular bowl.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.210
Chili is not really very
spicy, but it is fragrant.

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:10.725
Mm, I was so busy eating my bowl of ramen,

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.273
I didn't even realize it,

00:05:13.597 --> 00:05:15.480
I'm like warm from the inside now,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.180
I am like, I'm sweating, actually.

00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:20.998
(slurps)

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.878
I'm blown away by that miso broth!

00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:25.540
There's so much miso,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.620
you can actually feel
the texture of the miso,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.290
almost like beany, graininess of it, yup.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.250
That is like a huge flavor, huge flavor.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.427
That was delicious.

00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:43.454
(train whooshing)

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.050
It's a little before lunch,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.110
so they're not too busy,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.943
but we're gonna stop in.

00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:57.370
It's at the corner, just
at the small, little shop

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.490
that serves donburi rice bowls

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.070
topped with a variety of seafood,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.640
and when you step inside,
it's so cozy and warm in here.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.840
They serve you a cup of tea

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.640
as you're waiting for the table,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.640
but it's such a wonderful
little, small, little place.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.042
Family-run by auntie and uncle.

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:15.970
(slurps)

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.880
Oh yeah.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.200
That just warms going down.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.490
Back in here, while we're
waiting for a table,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.463
but also they are preparing
our bowls right now.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.595
(paddle clunking)

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.793
- Irashai, domo.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.760
- Okay, uncle is almost
finished making the bowl.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.340
I gotta sit down and prepare myself.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.640
Don't bump over the table.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.543
(slurps)

00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:57.365
Arigato gozaimasu.

00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:58.510
- Hai.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.040
- Before you even eat the food,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.500
I love how auntie and
uncle are working together,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.370
they're so nice, they're so friendly,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.670
they're so warm and welcoming you in!

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.510
Take this guy out for now,

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.560
and then also when you order a bowl,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.420
you also get a bowl of the crab soup.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.850
Auntie's crab soup that
you can smell that aroma,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.900
that smells delicious.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.733
We gotta start with the bowl.

00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:19.583
Let's just dig right into
the uni, right there.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:25.530
(excited grunting)

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.697
(chewing)

00:07:28.993 --> 00:07:29.826
Oh!

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.950
Oh yes!

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.420
When you have good uni,
just the pureness of it,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.753
and that is like, whoa!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.193
That has like an incredible
nutty taste to it.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.490
It's so soft, it's so, like...

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.323
Buttery!

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:50.370
And Hokkaido's very well
known for their uni,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.450
but yeah, that was such a
wonderful nuttiness to it.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.800
I will add a little bit of
wasabi to the next bite here.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.050
Maybe this is like a
surf clam, or something?

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.220
It's so naturally sweet, it
has a crispness that it snaps.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.310
I was gonna add some soy sauce,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.080
but I don't even think I
need soy sauce right now,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.393
it's just too good on
its own with nothing.

00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:22.910
Mm-hmm!

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.047
One more bite.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.680
Wonderful as well.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680
I love how they just pop with
that brininess in your mouth,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.200
and they're just coating the rice.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.813
Oh, wow.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.133
That crab is so juicy, mm!

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.093
Crab is amazing.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.970
Again, it has a natural brininess to it.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.320
You can feel the strings on your tongue,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.460
like, mm, sweet, it's so pure, so good!

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.440
Okay, time out for some of the crab soup.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.290
Oh, there's a chunk of crab in here, too!

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.123
Oh, nice!

00:09:03.883 --> 00:09:05.290
(happy exhalation)

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.300
Oh, that is what you wanna be eating

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.200
on a cold day in Sapporo.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.633
That's like, it's warming,
you can taste the miso in it,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.099
just the light crab
fragrance in the entire soup

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.470
just with some thin sliced leek

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.110
to give it just a little bit of crunch,

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.590
but you notice that.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.840
All that soup is amazing.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.510
I'm loving the rice here,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.817
perfect temperature, perfect
just hint of sourness,

00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:39.440
and just like, all the
gooiness, the, yeah!

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.500
It's perfect rice.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.690
Final piece I saved for the end.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.940
You can just tell how
it's gonna be so sweet.

00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:52.354
Oh, wow!

00:10:01.712 --> 00:10:03.212
Arigato gozaimasu!

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:05.380
Arigato gozaimasu!

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.380
Thank you very much!

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.800
And along with the donburi,
the rice bowls, the seafood,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.690
especially what I loved about this place

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.180
is the Auntie and Uncle, they're so nice,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.563
they're so welcoming, they're
friendly, they're awesome!

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.070
Got really cold this afternoon,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.160
but we're just stopping by

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.744
at the Hokkaido government office garden.

00:10:26.744 --> 00:10:29.526
It's beautiful, there's
a lake, there's ducks,

00:10:29.526 --> 00:10:32.309
it's starting to snow a little bit.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:34.809
(snow crunch)

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.710
Next on this best of Sapporo food tour,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.630
we are in Odori, which is
really the center of the city

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.300
where the shopping district is,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.670
where's there's tons of restaurants.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.770
We're on our way to go eat another

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.830
iconic dish Japanese food in Sapporo.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.760
All over Japan, you'll
find Japanese curry,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.250
which, to me, is almost like a curry stew,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.820
a very, very thick sauce,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.110
but in Sapporo, in Hokkaido,
which is unique to Hokkaido,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.690
they have soup curry,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.700
and it's something I've never had before

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.330
and I'm looking forward
to trying it right now.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.560
There's a really, really
famous place in Sapporo

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.068
for soup curry called Garaku,

00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:12.840
but they are closed right now,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.800
and due to the opening
lunch and dinner hours,

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.780
but then they have another,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.920
it's actually called Treasure Soup Curry,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.920
which is across the street,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.910
and they're open, I think,
they're still open now.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.790
They said the owner is the same,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.420
they said the soup curry base is the same,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.650
and it gets great reviews as well,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.950
so we're gonna try it out.

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:32.957
All right, and you gotta
go down the stairs,

00:11:32.957 --> 00:11:33.830
I think it's in the basement!

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.970
It's warm and cozy down here.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.220
This looks like something
you want to be eating

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.440
when it's cold outside.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.263
Yeah, the broiled leg, original.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.479
I'll have 40.

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:45.312
- [Server] 40?

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:46.850
- Yeah, I got this, the original curry,

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.000
and you choose your spicy
level, one through 40!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.930
I got 40!

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.980
Gotta try the 40!

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.220
And then you choose your rice bowl amount.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.343
Broiled chicken, that's spicy?

00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:58.176
- 40?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:00.336
- Yeah, right here, thank you!

00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:02.460
It smells incredible,
you can smell that spice,

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.270
and it is soupy, but I got
the chicken thigh leg combo.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.373
You just gotta taste
that soup broth first.

00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:14.777
Mm!

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.860
Okay, at first, it's not very spicy,

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.330
okay, you can feel it
growing a little bit spicy.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.240
Not extremely spicy, but
that does burn a little bit,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.000
and it's like a sour spicy, almost.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.290
Oh, that's amazing!

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.730
The aftertaste gets even better,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.670
it's almost like a Tabasco-y sourness.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.110
Oh, wow, that it delicious, though!

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.040
I'm gonna grab some, oh!

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.020
There's quail egg, too!

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.303
Okay, I'll grab some of the
broccoli in this next bite.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:43.212
Mm!

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:45.346
Oh, wow!

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.900
The broccoli is amazing because it's like,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.230
it taste like roasted broccoli,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.700
and then soaked up in that curry!

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.340
I got the broiled chicken leg.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.470
It's like, peppery, too,

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.040
and I'll put some of
this on my rice, maybe.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.130
Is the rice yellow, or is that...

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.580
And I got just the small rice,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.163
since we've already had a
couple of meals already today.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.710
Mm!

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.740
Chicken is soft, it's juicy,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.387
and then that works really
well with the curry!

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.820
I think that's my
favorite bite right there.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.043
The roasted broccoli with that soup.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.440
That's amazing, and
yeah, that's a bit spicy,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.150
but for me, it's like a pleasant spicy,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.460
not like an over-spicy,
that's like, perfect,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.810
I would definitely order
this exact same thing.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.150
It was one of those things
where it grew with flavor

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.610
every single bite that you took,

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.250
and by the end, you just
want to lick your bowl clean.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.820
The ingredients, the flavors, yeah,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.820
that is a spicy, soupy, curry,
light on the dry spices,

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.150
but huge on the flavor, curry.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.290
Highly recommended in Sapporo,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.630
and yeah, this was a really good place.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.463
I don't have anything to compare it to,

00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:20.620
because that's my first
time to ever eat soup curry,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.670
but that was amazing.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.940
For lunch today, we
are at Sapporo Station,

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.070
and on the sixth floor, they
have a food court section

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.820
with a number of different, well,

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.960
quite a few restaurants,
but the most famous place,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.840
and this is a very popular
sushi restaurant in Sapporo,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.370
is a conveyor belt sushi.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.148
I got number 92, they're on,

00:14:45.148 --> 00:14:48.060
I think they said they're on 47 right now,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.660
so it might be a little bit of a wait.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.140
Say it's some of the
best conveyor belt sushi

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.093
in Sapporo, maybe in Japan!

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.380
Better get comfortable for a little while,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.680
it's gonna be a long wait.

00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:04.658
Oh yes, 92, that's us, yes!

00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:05.491
- Hai!

00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:06.324
- Hello.

00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:11.648
Okay, we are in.

00:15:11.648 --> 00:15:15.880
That was like, okay, it
was almost an hour wait,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.820
but I think it will be worth it.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.280
Just watching the conveyor
belt go by for the few seconds,

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.510
you can already see the quality
and the size of the fish,

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.010
the quality of the sushi here, though,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.330
yeah it looks incredible.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.220
This place is Hanamaru, I believe,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.530
and they do have branches around Japan.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.650
I know they have some in Tokyo,

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.200
but it originates from Sapporo.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.190
I've never seen a piece
of sushi like that!

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.368
That's like an entire
salmon egg sack, I believe!

00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:43.320
I think it's salmon eggs?

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.500
Oozing, and like, juicy!

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.333
Wow!

00:15:49.694 --> 00:15:53.220
(excited grunting)

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.053
Wow!

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:58.883
That is a lot of exploding
saltiness in your mouth

00:16:00.358 --> 00:16:01.623
all at once!

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:02.800
As I was taking that bite,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.630
Ying grabbed me the o-toro with
uni and salmon eggs on top.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.080
This is like a premium, premium plate.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.440
It's double, a double plate!

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.310
So they charge you for
two plates of the primo,

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.593
but it does look stunning!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.300
That's o-toro, tuna belly.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.270
O-toro just melts in your mouth,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.053
plus the uni, plus the salmon eggs.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.523
Yeah, that is delicious,
that is a bite of joy!

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.253
This one is negitoro, minced tuna belly.

00:16:50.013 --> 00:16:53.392
Always one of my standards,
one of my favorites.

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.642
This is so creamy and soft.

00:16:58.664 --> 00:16:59.663
We need some more wasabi,

00:16:59.663 --> 00:17:01.790
they don't have wasabi on the table.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.790
I think we might have to ask for it!

00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.777
Look at the size of that
fish, that's fantastic!

00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:17.854
Mm!

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.973
Oh, I love it.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.480
Up the nasal passage, I love it.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.980
I don't think I've had this before.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.820
It's like, little tiny fish, I think,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.700
but they almost look like

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.600
they're almost transparent like squid.

00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:50.850
Whoa.

00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:55.000
They're kinda like, have
very little texture.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.423
They do have kind of
that sliminess of squid,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.390
it's almost like flavorless,
but I taste the ginger.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.740
Maybe it's a texture thing?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.483
Finally came around, sweet shrimp.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.191
Oh.

00:18:18.191 --> 00:18:21.420
That one's good, oh yeah, that one's good.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.757
Shrimp is so sweet, mm.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.493
This is lightly seared salmon belly.

00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:35.615
Oh, wow.

00:18:36.457 --> 00:18:38.100
That is awesome.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.867
That melts in your mouth,
plus the smoky umaminess.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.450
I wouldn't say that I'm stuffed at all,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.630
but we did eat well, and
there were five of us eating.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.430
And so, when you're finished,
they tally up all your plates,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.089
and the count the different colors,

00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:02.113
and then you go to pay up front.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.390
Total price for five of
us came to 8,763 yen.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.840
That's reasonable!

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.580
Yeah, we didn't eat tons and tons,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.340
but we ate until satisfied,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.200
and that is, for sure,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.230
some of the best quality
conveyor belt sushi

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.063
that I've ever had.

00:19:18.063 --> 00:19:19.370
The slices that they fish,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.934
and like the generous portions
on top of each ball of rice,

00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:25.970
it's really good, it's
well worth coming to

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.203
when you're here in Sapporo.

00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.660
And that's gonna complete
this round up of food,

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.030
Japanese food, in Sapporo,
some of the best restaurants

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.070
we tried during our stay.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.390
This is not all of them,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.580
I'll have a few more
videos in this series,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.710
I'll leave the link in the description box

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.910

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.170
