dispersed by November there was so much
 

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.830
dispersed by November there was so much
momentum behind this movement that we

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840
momentum behind this movement that we
 

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.200
momentum behind this movement that we
did go to two days and the radicals

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.210
did go to two days and the radicals
 

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.760
did go to two days and the radicals
actually split off so there were

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:34.770
actually split off so there were
 

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.550
actually split off so there were
actually two sets of activities in

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:37.560
actually two sets of activities in
 

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.520
actually two sets of activities in
nineteen November 1969 there was a very

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:40.530
nineteen November 1969 there was a very
 

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.970
nineteen November 1969 there was a very
orderly giant orderly demonstration in

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980
orderly giant orderly demonstration in
 

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.280
orderly giant orderly demonstration in
Washington and it was a very unruly calm

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:46.290
Washington and it was a very unruly calm
 

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.660
Washington and it was a very unruly calm
additional sending violent demonstration

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:49.670
additional sending violent demonstration
 

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.090
additional sending violent demonstration
so bear in mind that the movement was

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100
so bear in mind that the movement was
 

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.520
so bear in mind that the movement was
not just a you know it was not all

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:55.530
not just a you know it was not all
 

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.420
not just a you know it was not all
radical in it in terms of numbers of

00:33:59.420 --> 00:33:59.430
radical in it in terms of numbers of
 

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.820
radical in it in terms of numbers of
people involved again this is guesswork

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:01.830
people involved again this is guesswork
 

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:05.330
people involved again this is guesswork
I think it's pretty safe to say that a

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340
I think it's pretty safe to say that a
 

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.800
I think it's pretty safe to say that a
vastly larger number of Americans in

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:08.810
vastly larger number of Americans in
 

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.800
vastly larger number of Americans in
1969 identified with a more moderate

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:12.810
1969 identified with a more moderate
 

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.200
1969 identified with a more moderate
part of the movement the movement like

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.210
part of the movement the movement like
 

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:25.070
part of the movement the movement like
the portrait yeah there was a chapter of

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080
the portrait yeah there was a chapter of
 

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.290
the portrait yeah there was a chapter of
students for democratic society here

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300
students for democratic society here
 

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.250
students for democratic society here
probably as early as 1964 and it was

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260
probably as early as 1964 and it was
 

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.310
probably as early as 1964 and it was
even a kind of liberal protest group

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320
even a kind of liberal protest group
 

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.270
even a kind of liberal protest group
before that but they my I was a here

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280
before that but they my I was a here
 

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.690
before that but they my I was a here
then but my understanding is that they

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700
then but my understanding is that they
 

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.550
then but my understanding is that they
were it would finally intellectualized

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560
were it would finally intellectualized
 

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.830
were it would finally intellectualized
group and as SDS was becoming less

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:45.840
group and as SDS was becoming less
 

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.340
group and as SDS was becoming less
intellectualize they would sort of act

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.350
intellectualize they would sort of act
 

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.919
intellectualize they would sort of act
odds they were doing research about

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:51.929
odds they were doing research about
 

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.190
odds they were doing research about
university doings and so on they were

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200
university doings and so on they were
 

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.840
university doings and so on they were
trying to figure out a way to relate to

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:56.850
trying to figure out a way to relate to
 

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.350
trying to figure out a way to relate to
black people in Harlem but they weren't

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:00.360
black people in Harlem but they weren't
 

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.660
black people in Harlem but they weren't
actually that visible although their

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:02.670
actually that visible although their
 

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.450
actually that visible although their
numbers were growing and it wasn't until

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:04.460
numbers were growing and it wasn't until
 

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.840
numbers were growing and it wasn't until
1968 when they decided they were going

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:08.850
1968 when they decided they were going
 

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.850
1968 when they decided they were going
to be a kind of militant

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:12.860
 
 

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.500
 
you know and it seems the term of the

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.510
you know and it seems the term of the
 

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.130

first wave of the student organizations
 

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:36.819
first wave of the student organizations
but I would say it was in in the second

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:45.829
 
research here well yeah that certainly

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839
research here well yeah that certainly
 

00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:48.680
research here well yeah that certainly
wasn't organization in place and they

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:48.690
wasn't organization in place and they
 

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.210
wasn't organization in place and they
were actually two organizations in place

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220
were actually two organizations in place
 

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.040
were actually two organizations in place
they were STS which everybody knew about

would have been no demonstrations at all

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.210
would have been no demonstrations at all
 

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:07.760
would have been no demonstrations at all
that's another story but yes okay number

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:07.770
that's another story but yes okay number

truth again this is more this is
something one this is inundated probably

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:18.510
something one this is inundated probably

more interesting complicated case but

00:36:58.789 --> 00:36:58.799
more interesting complicated case but
 

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.950
more interesting complicated case but

but it is true that there were people

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240
but it is true that there were people
