00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:16.570
Football coaches wear clothes bearing their
team’s logo thanks to the NFL’s push to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.220
sell more merchandise.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.820
Basketball coaches stand on the sideline in
collared shirts and blazers looking for a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.470
neat, professional look.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.910
And then there are baseball managers who dress
in the team uniform, as if they are planning

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.860
on joining their players on the baseball diamond.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.911
Despite that today’s managers are universally
beyond the point where they could play at

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.280
a level worthy of putting them in the field,
the tradition of them wearing the team uniform

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.649
dates back to a time when that’s exactly
what they did.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.829
Specifically, the position that managers hold
today used to be typically held by the team

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.920
captain.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.629
This person was a player responsible for making
decisions about plays on the field during

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:53.629
the game.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.390
He wore the team uniform because he often
took to the field to play alongside his teammates.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.360
connie-mackOver the course of baseball history,
managers gradually stopped going onto the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.089
field to play alongside the men that they
coached.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.399
As this happened, contrary to what you see
today, a few of them began to distance themselves

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.329
from the tradition of wearing a uniform.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.109
Instead, they wore suits while managing.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.630
In fact, famed manager Connie Mack wore a
business suit for each of the fifty years

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.979
that he managed the Athletics.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.389
A former manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers,
Burt Sutton, also shunned his team’s uniform.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.509
But this wasn’t the norm and their idea
for how a team manager should look failed

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.719
the test of time.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.609
John Thorn, the official historian of the
MLB, has his own take on why this is the case.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.399
“Maybe it’s just a testament to the notion
that, no matter how old you get, between your

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.990
ears you think that you’re a baseball player.”

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.350
After all, the body gets old, but so often,
particularly if those you hang around are

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.249
younger (and in this case incredibly athletic),
the mind still feels like you’re young and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:51.789
vibrant as ever.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.590
Many MLB managers also have been wearing a
baseball uniform since they were little kids,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.799
so it may just seem more comfortable for them,
despite their expanding girths.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.729
As for the official rules on uniforms, we
have Rule 1.11, Section a, number 1 and 3

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.450
where it states: “All players on a team
shall wear uniforms identical in color, trim

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.450
and style…

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.610
No player whose uniform does not conform to
that of his teammates shall be permitted to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.769
participate in a game.”

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.371
The official rulebook further goes on to state
in Rule 2 that “A COACH is a team member

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.909
in uniform appointed by the manager to perform
such duties as the manager may designate,

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.019
such as but not limited to acting as base
coach…”

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.180
Also in Rule 2, “THE MANAGER is a person
appointed by the club to be responsible for

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.180
the team’s actions on the field, and to
represent the team in communications with

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.239
the umpire and the opposing team.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.569
A player may be appointed manager.”

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.840
As you can see from this, while players and
coaches are explicitly required to wear uniforms,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.441
there is no mention of managers specifically
needing to wear the team’s uniform, nor

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.349
will you find such a reference explicitly
stated anywhere in the rule book.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.859
In fact, they even allude to the fact that
managers are not required to wear a uniform

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.909
in rule 3.15: “No person shall be allowed
on the playing field during a game except

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.629
players and coaches in uniform, managers,
news photographers…” mentioning that players

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.180
and coaches must be “in uniform” but putting
managers in a different category.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
That said, there is one references in the
rulebook that could be interpreted as managers

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.909
being required to wear the team’s uniform,
found in Rule 2 where it states a, “BENCH

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.359
OR DUGOUT is the seating facilities reserved
for players, substitutes and other team members

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.549
in uniform when they are not actively engaged
on the playing field.”

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.660
Managers would presumably be considered “team
members” even though that is not specifically

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.120
defined in the rule book.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.269
Since they certainly spend a lot of time in
the bench or dugout during the game, and the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.290
team members there are explicitly required
to be in uniform (and there is no mention

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.879
of the manager being allowed in the dugout
otherwise), then it would follow that managers

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.420
should be in uniform too.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.370
However, when defining coaches, as mentioned,
the rule book explicitly states “is a team

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.370
member.”

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.700
The manager, on the other hand, is defined
“is a person…”

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.790
So perhaps assuming managers are team members
by the official rule book definitions is not

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.329
correct.

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.150
Moving on, in rule 4.07 it also states that,
“When a manager, player, coach or trainer

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.939
is ejected from a game, he shall leave the
field immediately and take no further part

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:15.939
in that game.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.359
He shall remain in the club house or change
to street clothes…” also implying the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.569
manager should be wearing special attire while
managing, though it’s not clear from this

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:29.100
whether this is just supposed to adhere to
the general MLB dress code or requires the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.860
manager to wear a uniform.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.160
And since it’s been a long time since any
manager tried to wear something like a suit,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.139
which certainly is within the bounds of the
MLB dress code, it’s not clear what officials

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.979
would do if a manager tried wearing that during
the game instead of a uniform as tradition

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:45.979
dictates.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.270
As noted, in some instances, the rulebook
seems to go out of its way to imply the manager

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.900
is not required to wear the team’s uniform,
while in the definition of a “bench or dugout”

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.590
perhaps implying they should, hinging on whether
they are officially considered team members

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.639
by the rule book’s definitions.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.180
Of course, a player can also be the manager
or designated such, in which case they are

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.590
required to wear a uniform, but it’s been
a few decades since the last time that happened

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.449
when Pete Rose had a stint as a player/manager
for the Reds starting in August of 1984 through

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.090
his retirement as a player in 1986.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.080
So, in the end, as to how this all got started,
it would seem originally individuals who did

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.551
the job of managers today simply wore the
uniform because they also were players, or

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:32.930
at least started out that way in many cases,
and later it just became a tradition.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.360
And baseball is, perhaps more so than any
other major sport, all about tradition and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.479
fighting tooth and nail before changing the
way things have always been done.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.199
After all, even the MLB Hall of Fame still
honors Abner Doubleday by displaying an oil

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.920
painting of Doubleday, despite the fact that
he had nothing to do with baseball at all

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.449
and this fact is well-known and conclusively
proven.

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.750
Two blocks from the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown (where Doubleday was said to

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.590
have invented baseball, which is why the Hall
of Fame was put in this backwater town instead

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.990
of a place more accessible to fans), there
is also a “Doubleday Field” which annually

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.729
features various Hall of Famers and retired
MLB players playing an exhibition game there

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.240
on Father’s Day weekend.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.720
These and many other baseball honors for a
guy whose own obituary stated he was a man

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.620
“who did not care for outdoor sports.”

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.539
This is, funny enough, the only documented
instance of him being connected to sports

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.020
in any way, despite the amazing amount of
documentation on the man’s life thanks to

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.420
the journals he kept and news reports covering
the famed General.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:07:19.830
But, you see, tradition says he invented baseball,
so here we are.
