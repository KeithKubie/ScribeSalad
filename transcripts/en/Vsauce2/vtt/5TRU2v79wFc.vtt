Casttoo designs your cast with your own X-ray

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.440
And this Chinese soft-shelled turtle pees
through its mouth.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.070
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.849
A Dutch design lab has conceptualized the
future highway. It features glow in the dark

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.009
roads that charge during the day and light
up at night, asphalt paint that changes depending

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.210
on the road conditions, such as snowflakes
when the roads are icy, and lanes that double

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.649
as electric car chargers. Prototypes for the
asphalt paint and glow in the dark road are

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.940
going to be implemented in 2013 on a stretch
of road in Holland.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.769
Meanwhile, in Japan, researchers are trying
to make car interiors appear transparent.

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.760
The system applies optical camouflage technology
using video from rear cameras to project onto

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.030
the backseat, and it's all processed by a
computer to make things appear actual-sized.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.780
Currently, only the backseat has been made
to look transparent, but the goal is to make

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.200
the cars interior completely transparent in
order to eliminate blind spots.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.200
This is the earliest known recording of singing from April 9th, 1860, predating the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.200
previous held record by 28 years. And it sounds
kinda scary...

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.500
The Exhale Fan is the first truly bladeless
ceiling fan. It utilizes the science of laminar

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.659
flow between an array of flat discs to efficiently
move air throughout your environment. Air

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.560
is no longer directed straight down, but moves
around the room in a 360 degree horizontal

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.799
flow and passes over you from the side like
a breeze. Check out the website for more.

Giant giraffe sculpture made of flowers.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.299
Four teenagers created a urine-powered generator.
Presented at the Maker Faire Africa, 1 Liter

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.259
of urine creates up to 6 hours of electricity.&nbsp;The
system works by first separating out the hydrogen

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.640
which goes into a water filter for purification
and gets pushed into the gas cylinder. The

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.940
gas cylinder pushes the hydrogen into a cylinder
of liquid borax which is used to remove moisture

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.950
from the hydrogen gas. Finally the purified
hydrogen gas is pushed into the generator.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.000
Half Bear- Half Dog- and extinct for nine
million years.&nbsp; It's BearDog!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.120
Researchers in Japan are working on ways to
control robots with their minds. The interface

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.830
uses flashing symbols to control where the
robot moves and how it interacts with the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.340
environment. A signal processing unit on a
computer translates the brain activity and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.810
classifies it into a series of tasks. The
team can then instruct the robot on which

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.450
task to perform. The hope is this will help
paraplegic people who can't perform certain

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.520
tasks on their own.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.030
MIT Game Lab developers created a new game
called "A Slower Speed of Light"- a first

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.100
person prototype game in which the speed of
light&nbsp;slowly decelerates as the user progresses

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.140
though the game, bringing the effects of special
relativity down to walking speed. With no

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.750
enemies or real obstacles the game seems too
easy; but, with each piece collected by the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.440
player, the speed of light slows incrementally.
Players experience the Doppler effect, time

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.250
dilation, the searchlight effect, the runtime
effect, and Lorentz transformation, all of which

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.240
make navigating through the game exponentially
more difficult. To check it out - fInd the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.770

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.150
Finally, True Skin is a sci-fi short film
set in the not-too-distant future in which augmentation

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.150
is the way of life.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.760
I'm going to leave you with a simulation of
the Sun's magnetic twisters in 3D. And, as

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.710
always, thanks for watching.
