00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.880
- Bladesmiths, this is the kill
test.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.670
We'll take your Sica
sword and deliver killing

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.710
blows on this ballistics dummy.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.500
Frank, you're up first.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.380
Are you ready?

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.210
Hell, yeah.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.880
Let's do this.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.210
I'm feeling good, yet anxious.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.380
I put my all into this blade.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.380
I'm just hoping it just takes
the head right off this dummy.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.580
Nice!

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.250
Well, Frank, your
blade is sharp.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.580
In combat, the Sicas sometimes
used this curve to pull

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.080
away the sword and come in.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.540
In this case, it
pulled away the head.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.580
Overall, your weapon will kill.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.580
Thank you.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.710
Tony, are you ready?

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.580
Mm-hmm.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.080
Let's have some fun.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.920
Frank's blade just
did awesome in this.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920
I mean, the head came off.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.290
I'm hoping mine will
do the same thing.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.040
We'll just unleash
hell onto this dummy.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.460
All right, Tony.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120
This is a scary Sica sword.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.580
On the initial hack
into the chest cavity,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.790
it penetrated so deep,
it totally demolished

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.040
this ballistics dummy.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.420
Overall, sir, your
weapon will kill.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.750
Tony's blade just performs
great on this thing.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.210
I mean, even though
they both will kill,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.120
his just looked a
little bit more violent.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.170
So it has me a little nervous.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170
Gentlemen, this is
the strength test.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.790
In order to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.670
I'm going to attack
these shields.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.420
Remember, this test
is all about what

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.080
a shields do to your
weapons, and not what

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.790
your weapons do to the shields.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.670
Frank, you're up first.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.670
Are you ready?
- Yep.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.290
Let's do this.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.670
Well, Frank, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.620
It's still straight,
it's still sharp.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.960
Everything is still
tight and solid.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.710
Well done.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.120
Thank you.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.040
Tony, you're up next.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.210
Are you ready?
- Yes.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.880
Well, Tony, your edge
held up perfectly as well.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.380
Razor sharp.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.710
I see no problem with
the edge from the shield.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.380
In all, a nice solid blade.
Well done.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.170
Thank you.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.380
Great job, man.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.670
All right, gentlemen.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.880
Now it's the sharpness test.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.880
I'll be cutting through
this sugar cane.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.790
One cut with the front
edge of your blade,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.080
one cut with the back edge.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.250
All right, Frank,
you're up first.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.380
Are you ready?
- Hell, yes.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.540
All right, Frank, right
off, your blade's got

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750
a really nice balance to it.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.880
You can see on that first cut
it kind of pulled in my hand,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.080
but it's still a good feel.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.250
On the back cut,
blew right through.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.080
Any gladiator using this would
be quick and would be deadly.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.580
Well done.
- Thank you.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.500
All right, Tony.
You're up.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.420
Are you ready for this?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.170
Yep.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.750
I'm a little nervous, because
this is going to be the test--

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.670
the performance of my blade.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.080
Without a great cutting
edge, you don't have a blade.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.580
It's time for my
blade to pony up.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.540
So, Tony, is it sharp?
Yes.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.790
It's very sharp and
it cut very nicely.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.960
It's still right, still tight.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.710
Well done.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.290
Thank you.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.080
Bladesmiths, over the course
of three rounds, both of you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.120
has displayed excellent
bladesmithing talents.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.420
However, in this
arena of competition,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.420
there can only be one champion.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.210
Tony, congratulations.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.960
You are the new Forged
in Fire champion.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.460
Frank, unfortunately your
weapon did not make the cut.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.500
Frank, first up, I
want to say that there

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.960
are no losers in this round.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.000
But we can only pick one winner.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.670
Both weapons were very sharp.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.670
Both weapons are very strong.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.250
But the Sica was a
gladiators' weapon,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.420
and your weapon was out
performed in the kill test.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.250
It is for that reason
we're sending you home.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.250
I totally understand.
