00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.480
For some of us, food is one of our favorite
things, a little hint of pleasure in a difficult

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.610
and painful world…

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.640
But, c'mon, what's better?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:17.100
Hot food or cold food?!

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.870
The debate rages on and on, hot or cold.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.140
And this being viewer question Monday, VinylSnapz
wanted to know "How come hot food tastes better

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.210
than cold or warm food?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.980
Is it an evolutionary thing?"

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.410
Well Vinyl, yes, yes it is.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
Some people are all like, "I can't cook, lol,"
but cooking is what allowed us to evolve these

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.930
huge brains which we enjoy today!

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.330
Yay, hot food!

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.480
Before the mastering of fire, ancient hominids
ate cold food; they had no other choice!

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.080
Cold, uncooked food requires a lot more energy
to digest.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.920
Think about it this way: gorillas chew all
day just break down food for digestion; pandas

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.600
eat for up to 16 hours a day; cows have four
stomachs and have to regurgitate their cud

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.140
for chewing and swallow it again… yikes.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.310
And, yes, these are all herbivores, but I'll
get to that in a sec.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.330
Plants are especially difficult to break down.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.700
So, why don't we eat like gorillas?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.520
Because we learned to break down food outside
of our bodies.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.159
We made it easier on ourselves.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.299
Damn we're lazy, lazy like a fox!

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.920
Actually, foxes are carnivores… so… anyway…
you get it.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.200
We're smart and lazy.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.090
In all the animal kingdom, humans are the
best at off-loading our biological responsibilities.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.420
We create tools to do things our fingers can't,
we wear clothes to keep us warm, we craft,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.119
build, invent and think our way around problems,
but our first big breakthrough?

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.119
Cooking.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.409
Two MILLION years ago, we were eating cold
food all day errday, just like our primate

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.310
cousins, and then we got some fire and put
the two together.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.850
Homo Erectus started using fire to stay warm,
ward off predators, forge weapons, allow for

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.290
more REM sleep and cook some tasty morsels.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.250
Fire is an exothermic chemical reaction; it
produces heat while chemically altering the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
wood.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.340
When that heat is applied to foods like grains
or meats, it chemically alters the food, too

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.630
-- and in many cases, it does so to our benefit!

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.250
Rather than eating being all about chewing
and the juices in our stomachs, cooking gave

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.190
us more bang for our bite, so to speak.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.230
Two million evolutionary years later, we can
no longer eat entirely raw or cold food as

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.650
our primate or carnivore cousins do, we don't
have the guts!

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.650
LITERALLY.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.680
See, carnivores can eat a large quantity of
raw meat because they have stronger stomach

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.239
acids, and have a shorter intestinal tract.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.980
All this evolved to harbor less bacteria,
and reduce food-borne bacteria infection,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.030
we don't have those evolutionary traits.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.620
According to Rachel Carmody, Evolutionary
Biologist at Harvard, fire gave us a biological

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.010
advantage because hot food has essentially
been pre-digested!

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.740
When we heat something, we increase the number
of calories available in the food, occasionally

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.430
at the expense of some of the nutrients.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.721
By the time cooked food gets to the small
intestine, we're sucking energy out of it

00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:04.019
left and right.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.420
This isn't just meats, it's also grains!

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.569
According to Carmody's studies, we get 30
percent more energy from cooked oats, wheat,

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.800
or potato than raw, and 78 percent more protein
from eggs.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:27.989
Other studies, too, found digestibility improvements:
10 percent in chickpeas and 90 in legumes

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.989
and starches.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.709
Once we invented cooking, we didn't have to
forage for food constantly, nor did we have

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.080
to sit around chewing all the time.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.380
Because of that, we were able to evolve smaller
guts and larger brains, then we began to solve

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.840
problems, explore the planet, build the internet,
and deliver this video to you!

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.580
We've talked about this on DNews before!

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.910
When anthropologists and scientists flossed
the teeth of neanderthals back in 2011, they

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.409
found cooked grains!

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.690
We've been at this for a while.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.849
A study in Proceedings of the Royal Society
B recently found chimps had learned to "cook"

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.440
food, though they'd actually, learned to prefer
hot food given to them by researchers.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.370
Though the point remains, even chimps know
hot food is easier to eat!

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.121
So yes, VinylSnapz, we evolved to eat hot
food.

00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:13.121
So much so, that in one study of raw-food
dieters, quote "half the women were malnourished"

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.121
and their bodies shut down menstruation, likely
to prevent lost nutrients.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.121
Cold or raw food takes SO much more energy
for the modern human to digest!

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.121
That doesn't mean it's bad for you, though.

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.121
Hot food has more excited molecules which
give off smells, and add flavors.

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:18.121
Scientists think taste evolved to keep us
eating the things that were GOOD for us and

00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:21.989
avoid poisons and rotten food, which taste
bad.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.030
Food packed with energy like meats, fish,
nuts, berries, starches, and so on, taste

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.199
good, thus, we want to eat more.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.650
When cooked, the molecules in the food are
more excited, and volatile -- i.e. they fly

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.789
off into the air, and we smell them.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.960
That makes food better too, and is probably
why we like it served hot.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.930
It's easier to digest, and it's more pleasing
to the senses!

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.970
What do you prefer?

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.770
Hot or cold food?
