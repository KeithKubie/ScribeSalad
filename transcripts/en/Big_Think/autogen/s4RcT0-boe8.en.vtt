achieved for many decades and here it is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
achieved for many decades and here it is
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759

already we now we have examples of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
already we now we have examples of

Amazon echo Alexa Google people talking

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
Amazon echo Alexa Google people talking
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.820
Amazon echo Alexa Google people talking
to their machines and they were talking

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
to their machines and they were talking
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.189
to their machines and they were talking
back having a conversation and so it's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
back having a conversation and so it's
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.190
back having a conversation and so it's
now suddenly easy for us to imagine how

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
now suddenly easy for us to imagine how
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229
now suddenly easy for us to imagine how
the benefits of artificial intelligence

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
the benefits of artificial intelligence
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.940
the benefits of artificial intelligence
could kind of creep into the rest of our

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
could kind of creep into the rest of our
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.660
could kind of creep into the rest of our
lives and it's best I think to think of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
lives and it's best I think to think of
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.200
lives and it's best I think to think of
these intelligences as smartness instead

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
these intelligences as smartness instead
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729
these intelligences as smartness instead
of intelligence because we have a lot of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
of intelligence because we have a lot of
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340
of intelligence because we have a lot of
baggage with this idea of intelligence

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
baggage with this idea of intelligence
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959
baggage with this idea of intelligence
if you think it leaves as artificial

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
if you think it leaves as artificial
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819
if you think it leaves as artificial
smartness and everything getting smarter

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
smartness and everything getting smarter
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910
smartness and everything getting smarter
I think we'll have a better idea of what

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
I think we'll have a better idea of what
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.119
I think we'll have a better idea of what
we're going to see so we don't have a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
we're going to see so we don't have a
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889
we're going to see so we don't have a
good English word for making smarter and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
good English word for making smarter and
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.410
good English word for making smarter and
smarter and smarter Phi so I use the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
smarter and smarter Phi so I use the
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.380
smarter and smarter Phi so I use the
word cognate I to mean making things

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
word cognate I to mean making things
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410
word cognate I to mean making things
smarter and I'm suggesting that in fact

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
smarter and I'm suggesting that in fact
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130
smarter and I'm suggesting that in fact
this is a very broad verb that will

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
this is a very broad verb that will
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.719
this is a very broad verb that will
apply to everything in our lives and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
apply to everything in our lives and
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.030
apply to everything in our lives and
that basically anything that we have

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
that basically anything that we have
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850
that basically anything that we have
already electrified made electronic

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
already electrified made electronic
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340
already electrified made electronic
automatic we're now going to cognate I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
automatic we're now going to cognate I
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070
automatic we're now going to cognate I
so the first Industrial Revolution was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080
so the first Industrial Revolution was
 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.330
so the first Industrial Revolution was
our large-scale switch from the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
our large-scale switch from the
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.149
our large-scale switch from the
agricultural world where anything that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
agricultural world where anything that
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770
agricultural world where anything that
we made had to be done with natural

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
we made had to be done with natural
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319

muscle power was the only way you can

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
muscle power was the only way you can
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789
muscle power was the only way you can
make something the big switch was we

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
make something the big switch was we
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.389

automated this we had electronic motors

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399
automated this we had electronic motors
 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.280
automated this we had electronic motors
gasoline steam engines we had automation

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
gasoline steam engines we had automation
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.580
gasoline steam engines we had automation
and we had artificial power that's what

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
and we had artificial power that's what
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.190
and we had artificial power that's what
powered the Industrial Revolution was we

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
powered the Industrial Revolution was we
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840
powered the Industrial Revolution was we
could apply artificial power to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
could apply artificial power to
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.410
could apply artificial power to
everything and we made a grid to deliver

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
everything and we made a grid to deliver
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899
everything and we made a grid to deliver
that power to every farm and every home

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
that power to every farm and every home
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.770
that power to every farm and every home
in the country in the world and so

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780
in the country in the world and so
 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.310
in the country in the world and so
everything that had been done with

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
everything that had been done with
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200
everything that had been done with
natural power was now being done with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
natural power was now being done with
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.800
natural power was now being done with
artificial power so movement

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
artificial power so movement
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.040
artificial power so movement
transportation was amplified by this new

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
transportation was amplified by this new

Revolution was we took things that we

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
Revolution was we took things that we
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.810
Revolution was we took things that we
took natural muscle power and we

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
took natural muscle power and we
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.510
took natural muscle power and we
amplified them and we multiply that by

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520
amplified them and we multiply that by
 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.840
amplified them and we multiply that by
million times and that was made

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
million times and that was made
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790
million times and that was made
everything that surrounds me right now

from this artificial power we're going

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510
from this artificial power we're going
 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.110
from this artificial power we're going
to have a Second Industrial Revolution

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120
to have a Second Industrial Revolution
 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.560
to have a Second Industrial Revolution
where we take everything we've already

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570
where we take everything we've already
 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.229
where we take everything we've already
automated with Auto with synthetic

artificial power and now we're going to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
artificial power and now we're going to
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.490
artificial power and now we're going to
add artificial intelligence on top we're

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
add artificial intelligence on top we're
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.830

to have a second Industrial Revolution
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.380
to have a second Industrial Revolution
where everything that we make has

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390
where everything that we make has
 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.240
where everything that we make has
previously electrified we're not going

previously electrified we're not going
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.319
previously electrified we're not going
to cognate I and that additional

to cognate I and that additional
 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.750
to cognate I and that additional
smartness is going to unleash the power

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
smartness is going to unleash the power
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.370
smartness is going to unleash the power
that we have not even seen with the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380
that we have not even seen with the
 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.130
that we have not even seen with the
Industrial Revolution the extent of this

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
Industrial Revolution the extent of this
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.229
Industrial Revolution the extent of this
transformation is very very profound and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239
transformation is very very profound and
 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.039
transformation is very very profound and
that is what we're now in the dawn of
