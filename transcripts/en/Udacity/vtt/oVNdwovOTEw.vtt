00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's take a closer look at what happened with Apollo 13.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The rocket is already in a parking orbit around earth.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To take us to the moon, the rocket is fired again,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this will result in such a trajectory.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This phase here is called "translunar injection."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This trajectory is a so-called free trajectory.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's going to return safely without the astronauts doing anything about it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So in case anything breaks, they are going to return, no matter what, just by gravity.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The first thing that happens was planned, namely, to get rid of the rest of the rocket,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which eventually crashed on the moon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The second thing was planned as well.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A midcourse correction, MCC.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The objective was to take the spacecraft to a trajectory that's closer around the moon,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but there was a price to pay.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This trajectory no longer was a free return trajectory,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but eventually they'd not return to earth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So that is an unsafe trajectory.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Which everybody learned somehow was after that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
when one of the Oâ‚‚ tanks exploded.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now the spacecraft had to be taken back to earth

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as quickly as possible.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The solution was to fire the rocket again.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This maneuver was called DPS-1 for distant propulsion system.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The rocket that has been fired

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
actually was the rocket that was intended to safely land on the moon.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This has to be fired in such a way that we are taken back to a free return trajectory

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and eventually return to earth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
What's going to occupy us this and next unit

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is how to compute the right amount of acceleration

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the spacecraft needs at this point in time.
