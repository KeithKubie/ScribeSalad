00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.180
Hi I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and
today we're gonna talk about this lady, Emily Dickinson.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.460
By the way we don't have a book today cause
she's on my Nook. Emily Dickinson was a great

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.830
19th Century American poet who-

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.250
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! I already know everything
about her: she was a recluse and you can sing

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.910
all of her poems to the tune of "I'd like
to buy the world a coke", like: [sings] "because

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.349
I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped
for me"' -

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.160
Stop, Me from the Past, you cannot sing! Fortunately,
your inability to sing does insulate us from

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.570
copyright claims, because I, for one, did
not recognize that as

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.820
"If I could buy the world a coke." Also, Dickinson's
meter is more complicated than you're making

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
it out to be, but yes, you could sing most
of her poems to "If I could buy the world

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.289
a Coke", also, "Yellow Rose of Texas".

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.180
More importantly, these poems have a lot to
say about the relationship between death and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440
life, between faith and doubt, between the
power of god and the power of individuals,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.840
so let's focus on that, because it actually
might change your life and stuff.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.500
So Joyce Carol Oats once called Emily Dickinson
"The most paradoxical of poets, the very poet

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.840
of paradox", and this can really frustrate
students and literary critics alike, particularly

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.270
when Dickinson seems to contradict herself
within a single poem.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.200
Take, for example, this bit of light verse.
''Faith' is a fine invention when gentlemen

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.770
can see - but microscopes are prudent in an
emergency". So this seems like a pretty pro-science,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.030
anti-religion poem right? I mean, faith is
put in quotation marks and called an invention.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.090
But she also implies the possibility of a
different and valuable kind of sight, only

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.050
available to some people at some times, "when"
gentlemen "can" see. And this is where is

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.890
becomes important to look at how Dickinson,
for lack of a better phrase, "sees" sight.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.960
Dickinson often imagines seeing as a sort
of power, so much so that seeing, not just

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.270
literal sight, but also the ability to witness
and observe and understand, becomes the central

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.540
expression of the self. Like her famous poem
that begins "I heard a fly buzz when I died"

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.160
ends with the line "I could not see to see"
associating the lack of sight, with death itself.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.500
Dickinson also often played with the fact
that this "I" and this "eye" sound the same.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.090
Her poem beginning, "Before I got my eye put
out" is about death, for instance, not just

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.360
monocularizaton. In that poem, she clearly
associates sight not just with the power to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.520
observe but ownership. She writes, "But were
it told to me, today, that I might have the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.680
sky for mine, I tell you that my heart would
split, for size of me - the meadows - mine

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.740
- the mountains - mine -".
Of course in 19th century America, the idea

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.100
that an eye, possibly a female eye, could
own the mountains, the meadows, and the sky

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.230
was a little bit radical. I mean, all the
stuff was supposed to be under the control

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.640
of God, not any human being who could see
it.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.480
All this is made even more complex and interesting
by the fact that Dickinson's poems sounded

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.670
like hymns, and throughout her life you can
see her faith waxing and waning in her poetry.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.980
In short, I don't think you can make easy
conclusions about microscopes and faith in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.160
Dickinson's poetry, but that's precisely what's
so important about it.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.200
Dickinson's work reflects a conflicted American
world view. I mean, we're a nation of exceptional

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.690
individuals who believe that we control our
success and our happiness, but we are also

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.810
more likely to profess a belief in an omnipotent
god than people in any other industrialized nation.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.830
All right, I know you guys want all the creepy,
macabre details of Dickinson's biography so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.630
let's go to the thought bubble. So, Emily
Dickinson was born in 1830 to a prominent

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.210
family. Her father because a US congressman,
and lived her whole life in Massachusetts.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.960
She was haunted, by what she called, the menace
of death throughout her life. Although, then

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.920
again, who isn't? Between 1858 and 1865, Dickinson
wrote nearly 800 poems, but she also became

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.610
increasingly confined to her home in those
years, and eventually, rarely left her room.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.520
She usually talked to visitors from the other
side of a closed door, and didn't even leave

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.340
her room when her father's funeral took place
downstairs.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.080
Dickinson published few than a dozen poems
in her lifetime. In fact, no one knew that she'd

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.620
been nearly so prolific until her sister discovered
more than 1800 poems after Emily's death in 1886.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.380
Dickinson was considered an eccentric in Amherst,
and known locally for only wearing white when

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.840
she was spotted outside the home. In fact,
her only surviving article of clothing is

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.760
a white cotton dress. This image of a pale
wraith clad all in white is a symbol of the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.459
reclusive, brilliant poet, but it's worth
noting that for Dickinson, white was not the

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.380
color of innocence, or purity, or ghosts.
It was the color of passion and intensity.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.250
"Dare you see a soul at the white heat? Then
crouch within the door," she once wrote. She

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.280
called red, the color most associate with
passion, "fire's common tint." For Dickinson,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.820
the real, true rich life of a soul even if it was physically
sheltered burned white hot. Thanks thought bubble.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.690
Oh, it's time for the open letter?
An open letter to the color white.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.630
But, first let's see what's in the secret
compartment today. Oh, it's a Dalek. Stan,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.760
more flagrant pandering to the Whovians.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.460
Dear White, you are a complicated and symbolic
-- AH! DALEK! They're not very bright. So,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.130
white you're often associated with purity,
like wedding dresses. You can symbolize heaven,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.960
or the creepy infinite nowhere where parts
of Harry Potter, and all of Crash Course Humanities

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.780
take place. But, many 19th century writers
inverted those associations. Like, Melville's

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.810
famous great white wall of whale, that terrifying
blankness of nature. And to Dickinson, white,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.460
you were the color of passion and intensity.
This reminds us that our symbolic relationships

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.930
aren't fixed. We are creating them as we go,
communally. I mean, other than Daleks, which

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.610
are universally terrifying no matter what
color they come in. Best wishes, John Green.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.490
Okay, let's take a close look at a poem we've
already mentioned, sometimes called Poem 465,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.270
and sometimes known by its first line "I heard
a fly buzz when I died,". Speaking of which,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.199
here in the studio we've had a genuine plague
of flies in the last few weeks. I mean, in

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.780
the lights up there, there are thousands of
fly carcasses. Okay, let's out aside the fly

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.120
carcasses, and read a poem together about
flies.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.919
I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -
The Stillness in the Room

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.889
Was like the Stillness in the Air -
Between the Heaves of Storm -

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.979
The Eyes around - had wrung them dry -
And Breaths were gathering firm

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.650
For that last Onset - when the King
Be witnessed - in the Room -

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.389
I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away
What portion of me be

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.560
Assignable - and then it was
There interposed a Fly -

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.770
With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz -
Between the light - and me -

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.440
And then the Windows failed - and then
I could not see to see -

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.310
Okay, first let's talk about the dashes. Some
critics think that Dickinson's use of dashes

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.650
as punctuation is just eccentric handwriting,
or else an accident. I mean, they point out

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.930
that Dickinson also similar dashes, for instance,
in her cake recipes. Others argue that the

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.979
use of dashes are a typographical attempt
to symbolize the way the mind works, or that

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.879
the dash is used as a punctuation stronger than a
comma but weaker than a period. Regardless though,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.820
the appearance of a dash at the end of this poem at
the moment of death is a very interesting choice.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.580
So, in this poem the speaker is dying, or
I guess, has died in a still room surrounded

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.830
by loved ones. A will is signed, and then
the fly with a "blue - uncertain - stumbling

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.410
Buzz -" comes between the light and the speaker.
This makes it so the narrator cannot see to

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.290
see, and by now you know what happens in Dickinson
poems when people can't see. They're dead.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.900
So, Dickinson was just a smidge obsessed with
death, which means she got to imagine death

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.410
in a lot of different ways: as a suitor, as
a gentle guide, but here death is a buzzing

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.490
fly. So, everyone in the room is waiting for
the arrival of "the king", which before Elvis

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.570
took over the title in 1958 was a reference
to God. But, instead of the quiet, peaceful

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.580
arrival of God they're expecting it's a dirty
little fly with "uncertain stumbling buzz"

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.130
that gets between the narrator and the light.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.470
So, this poem features Dickinson at her most formal. 
The lines are very iambic (John speaks rhythmically):

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.010
"I heard a fly buzz when I died the stillness
in the room,", and they alternate between

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.340
tetrameter, four feet, and trimeter, three
feet.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.199
The rhyme scheme throughout the poem is ABCB,
which means that the first line ends with

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.750
one sound, the second line with yet another,
the third line with another still, and then

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.080
the fourth line rhymes with the second line.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.070
But, Dickinson employs her famous slant rhymes
here. Like in the first stanza, "room" is

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.430
matched with "storm". In the second, "be"
with "fly". These words sort of, almost rhyme

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:08.060
like "room" and "storm" both end in /m/ sounds.
"Be" and "fly both end in hard vowel sounds,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.840
but they don't rhyme. This discomforting lack
of closure is a hallmark of Dickinson's poetry,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.820
also of most of my romantic relationships.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.840
Only in the final stanza, when death comes
do we get a full rhyme. "Me", the eye, is

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.380
rhymed with "see" the thing the eye can no
longer do. So, is this a peaceful death? Hardly.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.750
I mean, the stillness in the room is broken
by the buzzing fly, and yet with that final

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.679
full rhyme, Dickinson offers us a bit of peace and
closure that we didn't get in the first two stanzas.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.309
To return to an old theme, even though we
live in an image drenched culture, this is

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.959
a good reminder that language is made out
of words, and it might sound like over reading

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:45.079
to you to say that a full rhyme brings peace.
But, I'm remind of the story of Mozart's children

00:08:45.079 --> 00:08:48.949
playing a series of unfinished scales in order
to taunt their father, who would eventually

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:50.889
have to go to the piano and finish them.

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:55.100
Poetry isn't just a series of images. It's
rhythmic and it's metric, and we crave the

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:00.290
closure of a good rhyme at the end of a poem.
That's why sonnets end with couplets. Dickinson

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.790
gives us that closure, and the she gives us
a Jose Saramago-ine dash. The poet of paradox,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.519
still haunting us. Thanks for watching our
Crash Course Literature Mini Series. Next

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:12.709
week, we begin a year of learning about US
History together.

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:16.969
[Libertage]
[explosions and patriotic guitar riffs]

00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.640
Now begins the complaining by non-Americans
that we're shallow and self-interested and

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:25.079
call ourselves Americans, even though in fact,
this is America. But even my friends, if you

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.970
don't live here the history of the United States
matters to you because we are always meddling

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.509
in your affairs. Thanks for watching. See
you next week.

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:35.420
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Miller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.920
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson,
and the show is written by me.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.440
Every week instead of cursing, I've used the
name of writers I like. That tradition is

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:45.679
ending, but a new one will begin next week.
