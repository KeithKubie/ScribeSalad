A lot of problems around a large-scale
natural disaster

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.050
don't go away when organizations come in
and dump funds or food or medicines or

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.890
supplies or even help. The organizations
and aid organizations start going away

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
when the money starts to dry up, those
countries, those communities have to pick

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
the pieces up and start all over. Our aim
is to create a more informed and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.629
educated practitioner so people who are
going into these affected communities

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.479
really know the way to talk to people,
the way to assess the situation, and our

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.690
programs are also geared towards
building up those local communities and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
their resilience so that the local
responders are capable themselves of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.100
doing such things. We have a lot of
medical residents who come into our

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.299
programs every year, some of them based
in the South and Florida, Alabama, places

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.780
like that, so domestically, they would be
responding to, you know, Miami, Houston

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.880
and Puerto Rico.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
There's no greater joy or happiness than

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
when we get together and play. Today I
worked shift in the ER and it was rather

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
chaotic and out of control and to come
back to the barn and just play with

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.870
really dear friends and visit the right
side of our brains, I think we overload

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.280
the left side, try to be analytical. When
we were approached to do this concert

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
and actually sort of put our little
creative project to a good cause,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.920
particularly one that has to do with our
work at HHI and at the Brigham, and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
that's really just a phenomenal
opportunity for all of us.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260
We've decided as a band that we would pick up all
costs so that all sales will go directly

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.829
to Direct Relief International, there's no
overhead, there's no charge, and of course

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.580
our, you know, very expensive fee for
playing.
