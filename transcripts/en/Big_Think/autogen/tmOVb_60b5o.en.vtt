those areas encouraging progress is
being made both at the research level

being made both at the research level
 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.409
being made both at the research level
and also the clinical development level

malaria and certainly against TB now we
 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.040
malaria and certainly against TB now we
move beyond infectious diseases and

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050
move beyond infectious diseases and
 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.100
move beyond infectious diseases and
preventive vaccines for those and start

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110
preventive vaccines for those and start
 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.210

to think about therapeutic vaccines and
 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.850
to think about therapeutic vaccines and
vaccines to treat disease then that

vaccines to treat disease then that
 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.150
vaccines to treat disease then that
opens up a whole new Vista and what we

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160
opens up a whole new Vista and what we
 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.820
