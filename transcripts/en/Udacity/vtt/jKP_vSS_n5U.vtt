00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is about testing for randomness.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Suppose is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence is a Python procedure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that takes as input a sequence of bits--that's input s--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and it outputs true if that sequence is truly random

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and false otherwise.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The 2 statements are it's actually impossible to implement

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a procedure that does this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If some source produces random sequences

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that are guaranteed to pass an is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence procedure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that behaves as described, than that source cannot

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
be a true random number generator.

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all the true statements.
