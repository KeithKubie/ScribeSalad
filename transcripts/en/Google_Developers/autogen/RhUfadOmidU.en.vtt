you have to write them yourself and my

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070
you have to write them yourself and my
 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.430
you have to write them yourself and my
twin brother and I immediately started

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
twin brother and I immediately started
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.170
twin brother and I immediately started
finding magazines that had sort of basic

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
finding magazines that had sort of basic
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.150
finding magazines that had sort of basic
programs and you could type into the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
programs and you could type into the
 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.190
programs and you could type into the
computer to create your own game and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200
computer to create your own game and
 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.810
computer to create your own game and
then starting from there and we learned

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820
then starting from there and we learned
 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.160
then starting from there and we learned
how to change the games and write our

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170
how to change the games and write our
 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.380
how to change the games and write our
own cool I just took two months off to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390
own cool I just took two months off to
 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.660
own cool I just took two months off to
learn how to code and like learning

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670
learn how to code and like learning
 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.180
learn how to code and like learning
anything new it it can be hard and for

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190
anything new it it can be hard and for
 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.790
anything new it it can be hard and for
me it was like learning to see and think

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800
me it was like learning to see and think
 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.790
me it was like learning to see and think
in a whole new way and sometimes an hour

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800
in a whole new way and sometimes an hour
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.130
in a whole new way and sometimes an hour
could take I could take just an hour to

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140
could take I could take just an hour to
 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990

yourself from doing it coding and
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.040
yourself from doing it coding and
writing computer programs isn't about

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050
writing computer programs isn't about
 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.050
writing computer programs isn't about
learning a new language and the average

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060
learning a new language and the average
 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.770

computer language has about 50 words in
 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.129
computer language has about 50 words in
it and I could

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139
it and I could
 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.140

thing a kid can learn in one hour of
writing code is to realize that there's

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759
writing code is to realize that there's
 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.309
writing code is to realize that there's
not a lot to memorize and it's more

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319
not a lot to memorize and it's more
 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.050

solving it forces you to organize your

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:48.750
solving it forces you to organize your
 

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.200
solving it forces you to organize your
thoughts better than most other things

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.210
thoughts better than most other things
 

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.380
thoughts better than most other things
you learn and it's interesting that the

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.390
you learn and it's interesting that the
 

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.330
you learn and it's interesting that the
ability to organize your thoughts and to

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:56.340

point two is actually getting this into
 

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.320
point two is actually getting this into
public schools by fall of next year we

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.330
public schools by fall of next year we
 

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.570
public schools by fall of next year we
should have basically put computer

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:38.580
should have basically put computer
 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.850
should have basically put computer
science into about 400 schools but we

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860
science into about 400 schools but we
 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.090
science into about 400 schools but we
want to get to 4,000 schools and 40,000

and then the third thing we're working

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240
and then the third thing we're working
 

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.040
and then the third thing we're working
on is changing policies in 36 states in

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.050
on is changing policies in 36 states in
 

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.440
on is changing policies in 36 states in

requirements in math math or science and

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.230
requirements in math math or science and
 

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.080
requirements in math math or science and
that's actually a great way developers

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.090
that's actually a great way developers
 

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.520
that's actually a great way developers
can help petition their school board

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:04.530

rule so computer science is treated as a

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.310
rule so computer science is treated as a
 

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.130
rule so computer science is treated as a
math or science or so we're lobbying and

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.140
math or science or so we're lobbying and
 

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.810
math or science or so we're lobbying and
and then lastly we're gonna continue do

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820
and then lastly we're gonna continue do
 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.180
