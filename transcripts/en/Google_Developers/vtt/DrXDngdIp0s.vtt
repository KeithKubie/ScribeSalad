[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.788
NETO: Hey, I'm Neto.

00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:07.830
JESSICA: Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.900
NETO: And we're here again
for the second episode

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.520
of "Behind the Action," right?

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.270
JESSICA: Mhm, yay!

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.175
NETO: And the last episode,
we created our first action,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:15.675
right?

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:16.217
JESSICA: Mhm.

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.580
NETO: And it's working, yet?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.100
JESSICA: Oh yeah, it's working.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.760
And we can even try
it out on our home.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.843
NETO: We'll give it a try.

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:22.770
JESSICA: Let's do it.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.306
Hey, Google, talk to
Lucky Number Calculator.

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:29.400
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK,
getting the test version

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.880
of Lucky Number Calculator.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.950
[CHIMES]

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.320
Hello, what is your
favorite color?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.300
JESSICA: I really like purple.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.647
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Your
lucky number is 210.

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:41.481
JESSICA: Ooh.

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:42.250
NETO: Amazing.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.220
[LAUGHS]

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.690
This is so great.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.357
But you see, in the beginning,
I heard a "test version?"

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:49.940
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.510
So this means that this is not
actually available to everybody

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.160
in the world just yet.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.370
NETO: Oh?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.287
JESSICA: This is only
available to our account

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.260
that we have that's on
this particular mini.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.760
NETO: OK.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.070
So on this episode,
we're going to guide you

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.200
through how we
get this published

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.269
to the real world,
so the what do you

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.727
call, the directory, right?

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:06.310
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.850
That way, everyone
has access to it.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.060
So anyone could say
that phrase, and they

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.322
could play with this action.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:14.030
NETO: We can also show
here, if you want,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.360
for example, the
directory information.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.400
So we can go to
assistant.google.com/explore.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.470
And you're going to see, for
example, a lot of actions here.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520
This is like the catalog for
all the actions available.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.675
So after you publish your
action, it will appear here.

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:39.050
JESSICA: Totally,
it'll be there.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.508
Then that way you could share
that link out to other people

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:44.030
and be able to go, hey, try
out the action I just made it.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.790
NETO: Exactly.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.430
And if you check one of
these actions, for example,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.520
you're going to see the ratings,
a lot of things for the Google

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.090
Express.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.450
So can see ways to
activate this action,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.940
what the available device that's
compatible with this action.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.160
And also, reviews and
also, some rating numbers.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.770
This is good.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.720
So we can try.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.740
And then, we want you to
get your action to this one.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.428
So we go back to our Home.

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:13.970
Remember when we
said it's your Home?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.225
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:02:14.225 --> 00:02:16.183
Our Home, we're going to
go back to our Actions

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:17.060
on Google console.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.100
NETO: What we are
seeing here, Jessica?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.910
JESSICA: We're on
the Overview page.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.487
And ideally, you want to
have it where you already

00:02:23.487 --> 00:02:25.820
have the invocation done, and
then all the functionality

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.490
that you want.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.940
And that was through our
actions using Dialogue Flow.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.780
So we've got those
two things done.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.563
We've tested it out
in the simulator.

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:34.980
And what's really nice is the
Nav bar pretty much tells us

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.230
the next thing is deployment.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.070
So let's go under there,
under Directory Information.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.150
NETO: Remember when
I showed you the name

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.210
and the number of devices
compatible and the other stuff?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.972
This is entered all through this
Directory Information, right?

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:51.680
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.340
NETO: Because under Directory
Information, it's here.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.293
So please.

00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:57.710
JESSICA: Yeah,
let's open this up.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.585
It looks like here we
add two different types

00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:00.860
of descriptions.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.470
We need a short description
and then a longer description

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.900
of the action itself.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.483
NETO: And the other information
here is the sample invocations.

00:03:09.483 --> 00:03:10.400
And here is important.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.610
Because you're going
to teach your user how

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.620
you can invoke
your action itself.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.250
Here can include, for
example, Talk To in the name,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.620
or Ask To--

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.470
a set of ways that the person
can invoke your action,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.850
ask your action.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.780
And if you have something
called deep implicit invocation,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.950
you can use here.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.208
We did not cover this
on our last episode.

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:38.750
But it means that you can use
simple-- remember when you say,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.980
my favorite color?

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.310
Imagine you have another one
where the three phrases is,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.770
for example, book a ride.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.170
You could see, call, ask the
name of the action to book

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.970
a ride.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.080
And then what happened is,
these will be directly delivered

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.450
to the action, instead of
going for the welcome intent.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.060
So if you see something
like that on other actions,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.620
it's about the
in-place invocation.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.720
But don't care about this
right now, don't worry.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.850
We're going to go up.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.400
And then some images,
why do we need images?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.450
This is for voice.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.990
JESSICA: Totally,
this is for voice.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.650
But that's where the
directory that we had,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.240
that we showed
earlier, this is what's

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.400
going to be shown on there.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.120
So I'm going to just scroll
down just a little bit.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.003
That way we can see.

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:19.670
There's a larger
image, and then there's

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.230
the shorter, or
the smaller image.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.273
Larger image is for
the actual directory.

00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:24.815
NETO: Yeah, let's
show here, I think.

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:25.190
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.330
NETO: So you can open here.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.180
This is the icon, for example.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.460
And if we hit back here,
this is the larger image,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.960
you'll see here.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.220
So this is the larger image.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.570
And the other one is
more the icon for this.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.730
JESSICA: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.630
And then after that is
all about the developer.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.620
All about us.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.400
NETO: Yes.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.670
So here you must enter
your email information,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.270
so someone can contact
you to report something.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.090
Even to Google contact you,
if it's something necessary.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.420
And also, the display name.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.160
You can put your full name.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.400
You can put your company name.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
You don't need to have all the
same names for all the actions.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.060
Each actions you can
use a different--

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.480
if you would like different
products of their own name,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.940
or you are a third-party
developer that

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.795
is developing for someone,
you can use here no problem.

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.670
JESSICA: And then the
last thing on this part

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.070
is all about the
privacy and consent.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.480
This is really important.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.970
Every action needs to
have a privacy policy.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.800
And that needs to
contain information

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.727
about what you're doing with
the user's information, or data.

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:30.060
This is really important for us.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.560
NETO: Really important.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.477
JESSICA: Because we want
to respect our users.

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:36.200
NETO: And remember, when
it comes to your action,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.180
you have all the
responsibility on what

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.480
you are doing with this data.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.000
So this is important to you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.860
Explain to your user
what you're doing.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.130
And we have many regulations
in many different countries.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.480
So what you provide here
is, for example, it's

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.870
a way that you can
use a Google Doc,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.570
that you can create a link,
and share this link here,

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.160
in the privacy policy.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.330
And this privacy policy,
user can access anytime.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.210
But if you want to use your own
website, there is no problem,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.200
so just put here the link.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.408
And remember that we are
not providing any sample.

00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:12.450
What we have here is just
a template for the file

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.840
so it can know how
to share the file.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.520
The content's your
responsibility.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.990
There are many services
online, or talk to a lawyer.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.370
It's very important.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.100
Don't-- don't let this--

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.420
can I say, don't ignore this.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.190
JESSICA: No.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.080
NETO: And also, this is
reviewed by our team.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.740
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.730
If you do not have it, if
you just put a dummy link,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.470
we do check it.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.280
It's not too bad.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.030
I would Google it.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.010
There's, like Neto said,
tons of different services

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.090
that could support you.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.260
And lawyers are
always helpful if you

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.500
want to go into legal things.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.760
NETO: Yeah.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.370
And also, if you want to put
some kind of terms of service.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.190
For example, you
are accepting this.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.000
We are reading, or we're
storing this information

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.970
to provide you a customized
solution, home mortgage

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.920
calculator, I don't know,
something like that.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.820
Remember to put the
terms of service.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.570
Because there are
different things, right?

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.270
Terms of services is how you
are providing the service.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.500
And the privacy policy's
about the privacy of the user.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.120
But the second one, the terms
of service, it's optional.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.940
So you don't need
to enter right now.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.580
There is some
additional information.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.260
JESSICA: Yeah,
let's click on that.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.340
Let's go down.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.940
There we go.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.820
So category.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.862
NETO: Yeah, this is nice.

00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:23.445
JESSICA: This is
where we could choose

00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:25.390
where this should
live, in regards

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.260
to what type of category,
in the directory.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.607
I feel like ours is like a game.

00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:31.440
So it'd make sense to
put this in the game--

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.170
NETO: Games in Fun?

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.590
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.480
So that would make sense.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.688
So it depends on your action.

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.780
Whatever you think it
matches with that category,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.590
just choose that.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.230
NETO: Yeah.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.670
And now, one very cool
thing about for families.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.890
If you think your action
is suitable for families,

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.620
it's family-friendly,
please, no bad words.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.840
No content that's-- right?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.490
JESSICA: Right.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.490
Of course they wouldn't.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.810
NETO: But why it
should be a good idea

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.780
to develop for a family?

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.120
Because we are
curating this content.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680
And we have a specific
session for a family.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.830
So if someone wants
to play something

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.560
with the kids, their kids,
they can use this session.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.060
It's nice.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.790
In our case, for example,
we are able to say

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.630
that's for a family.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.040
But you're not
sure, don't do it,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.310
but read the documentation also.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.090
And if you are
referring or saying

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.320
something about alcohol
and tobacco, also, please,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.145
you should be
explicit about this.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:24.270
JESSICA: Yeah, let us know.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.380
That way we could let our
users know about that too.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.050
NETO: Yeah.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.940
And there is testing
instructions, right?

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.482
JESSICA: Mhm.

00:08:30.482 --> 00:08:33.630
NETO: For example, imagine
when the person is reviewing

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.690
your action, needs maybe
to do a specific logging

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.350
or run a specific query
to show how it's working.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.260
Because all the actions
are validated and tested

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.039
by a human.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.210
It's not only automated tests.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.520
So if you want to say something
for the person that's testing,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.980
then, please, right here.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.980
There are some other
interesting topics.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.740
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.770
So there's Transactions,
just asking

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.930
whether you're using the
Transactions API, and then

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.350
the Digital Purchasing API.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.680
So if you're using those,
you, of course, click Yes.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.840
NETO: And there's a mic policy.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.907
Because sometimes, for
example, you maybe leave the--

00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:11.865
JESSICA: Microphone on.

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:13.510
NETO: --microphone open.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.540
But if you're not prompting for
answer, you must click here.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.190
Because then the user must say,
yeah, it's kind of hearing me.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.710
But remember, the timeout's
like, eight seconds.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.260
At some point, if there's
no way to put the mic,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.090
it's closed within the action.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.990
It's closed as well.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.647
So it's not hearing the
ambient all the time.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:34.230
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.930
I would say, this is my policy.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.530
Leaving it open is
very special cases.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.030
NETO: Yeah.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.072
JESSICA: Generally, most
actions don't need that.

00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:41.422
NETO: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:42.880
JESSICA: So we
filled all this out.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.380
NETO: Yes.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.540
When I fill it out,
what should I do next?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.630
JESSICA: I think we should
just do surface capabilities.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.700
Let's tell Google what options.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.310
NETO: Oh, yes, Discard.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.780
We are not saving right now.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.110
But remember, you need
to save all the time.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.330
What is this screen
all about, Jessica?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.240
JESSICA: This is all about
telling Google on what devices

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.740
does this action work with?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.510
There are times where
someone might build

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.460
an action that needs a visual.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.060
And so you have
to mark that down,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.210
that it requires
a screen output.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.390
And that way we're not
servicing those actions

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.270
on just audio-only devices,
like Homes and Minis.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.640
NETO: Yeah, for example,
if you are building--

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.950
I can give an example of
something I was playing with,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:28.320
a chess voice, so we can play
chess, saying the movements.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.740
But you need to see the board.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.657
JESSICA: Yeah, you do.

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:32.520
NETO: So in this case,
I would click here

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.437
that it requires a screen.

00:10:34.437 --> 00:10:35.520
JESSICA: That makes sense.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.790
NETO: And also, it's
not OK to play in a car.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.570
So Android Auto, I wouldn't
publish for Android Auto.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.510
I don't want to cause any
accident, car crashes.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.437
So like Jessica said,
we can choose whatever

00:10:49.437 --> 00:10:50.520
is better for your action.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.103
JESSICA: Yeah.

00:10:51.103 --> 00:10:54.255
So once we get that done,
the next thing is release.

00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:56.130
Here there's a couple
of options we could do.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.540
NETO: And this is very cool.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.370
Because imagine
you're working here,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.490
and we want to test with
more people, but not only

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.560
our account.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.488
But it's not yet
ready for publish.

00:11:06.488 --> 00:11:07.280
JESSICA: Everybody.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.670
NETO: Yes.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.890
There's two stages we can use.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.270
One is the alpha.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.020
What is the alpha?

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.280
JESSICA: So Alpha lets
you test with 20 people.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.860
You grab their
emails, and you put it

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.730
into this Alpha Testers List.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.298
And you deploy just to those.

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:24.090
Those 20 people have
access to your action,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.507
to be able to play
around with it.

00:11:25.507 --> 00:11:26.250
NETO: Nice.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.370
And then when it's
almost ready, and you

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.150
want to expand the
number of people testing,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.960
there is a Beta.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.085
JESSICA: So with Alpha,
there is no review process.

00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:36.713
It goes out.

00:11:36.713 --> 00:11:38.130
It's available to
those 20 people.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.630
Beta, you do get the review.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.320
NETO: Exactly.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.380
So it will go through
all the regular process,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.910
but won't be available
for everyone.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.250
And when it's done, you can
just promote to the production.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.650
Or if you want you go
straight for production,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.160
you are totally confident,
no problem this button

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.350
Submit for Production
will be enabled.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.700
You just click.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.720
Then you will receive
an email saying, hey,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.270
your action is under review.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.450
So you can wait some.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.950
In general, we say
takes up to two weeks.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.465
But sometimes it's getting
earlier, a little bit.

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:15.065
No, don't say I said that, OK?

00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:16.440
JESSICA: Don't
quote him on that.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.810
NETO: Don't tell them that.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.000
But yes, wait.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.110
Because it's like I
said, it's a real review.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.580
It's not something
just automated,

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.560
because we take
this very serious.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.470
So the kind of content,
the interactions,

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.592
and everything else.

00:12:31.592 --> 00:12:32.300
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.180
And if there is an issue,
it will be reported back

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.250
to you why it
didn't get deployed,

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.540
it didn't pass the review.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.700
And generally, it usually
links out to our Docs

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.750
too, to help support you to be
able to solve that problem too.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.890
So it's a really nice tool.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.932
Or a really nice service.

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:49.880
NETO: Yeah, so we can easily
fix and meet again if you want.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.180
So it'll then be ready--

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:52.910
how can I say?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.970
It would be really
straightforward to have

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.610
your action available
for everyone.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.330
Then you can say
hey, it's available.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.372
Please test your devices.

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:01.163
JESSICA: Yeah, mhm.

00:13:01.163 --> 00:13:03.760
NETO: Go ahead and share it to
your friends, your customers,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.260
whatever.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.680
JESSICA: Yeah, because
once it's on the directory,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.150
you could even use that
link, and then send that out

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.170
through your social
media campaign,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.140
through an email campaign,
and letting people

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.280
know this thing's alive,
it works, it's out there.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.780
NETO: Yeah.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.738
And for example, if you
have a specific feature

00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:18.570
on the website, or
on your Android app,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.560
or in a mobile app that
you want to call out,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.480
OK, you can try this for voice.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.830
You can try this by voice.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.870
Yeah, say, put the link,
and "train" the person.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.850
Say to the user,
hey, user, say this.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.240
It's a great way to
complement your experience

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.760
across devices, services.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.390
It's amazing.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.200
JESSICA: Exactly.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.870
NETO: Well, this was
kind of a short episode.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.780
But we hope you enjoyed,
because now you are

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.180
ready to go with your action.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.520
So I imagine you had some time
to play more and make something

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.860
more advanced than
our lucky number.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.920
Then you can now go
and publish online.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.248
So please, give us your Like.

00:13:57.248 --> 00:13:58.790
It's important to
us to know that you

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.682
are enjoying the content.

And please, give
us your comments.

00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:05.410
Right, Jessica?

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.200
JESSICA: Oh, definitely.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.450
We want to hear your feedback.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.810
Especially for next episodes.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.602
That way, let us know
something that you're

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:12.140
interested in for future videos.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.700
We could build that out
and be able to deliver

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.783
the content that you want.

00:14:14.783 --> 00:14:15.470
NETO: Yeah.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.530
Thanks for watching.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.680
Stay tuned for the next
"Behind the Action."

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.180
Bye.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.730
JESSICA: Bye.
