00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.260
&gt;&gt; My name is Mary Flanagan I'm
representing the National Endowment

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.986
for the Arts and I'm here today
to showcase with the help of some

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.506
of our state international champions
the Poetry Out Loud program.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810


00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.110
Poetry Out Loud, national recitation
contest is a unique program

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.156
with an ambitious goal to
bring poetry into the lives

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.283
of high school students by having
them learn and perform great poems.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.363
Students from each state,
the District of Columbia,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.063
the U.S. Virgin Islands in Puerto
Rico compete for the national title

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.916
of Poetry Out Loud
champion each year.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.626
The program with a structure
like the national spelling bee

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.226
and entering its sixth year
has been a smashing success.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.543
Poetry Out Loud is a partnership
between the National Endowment

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.983
for the Art the Poetry
Foundation and state art agencies.

Statistics for the
2009-2010 Poetry Out Loud,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.356
nearly 325,000 students
competed nationwide.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.110
This program starts in the classroom
and students have robust anthologies

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.850
from which to choose the poems
they want to learn and recite.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.036
Approximately, 2,000 schools
participated nationwide.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.820
And all of you local residents and
those in the neighboring states,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.020

2011 National POL finals

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.273
in Washington DC.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.713
They're going to be this April
29 at the Lincoln Theater.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to introduce the students,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.290
there's going to be three of them
and they're gonna come up here

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.083
and perform and the first I'm
gonna introduce, Youssef Biaz.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.940


00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.750
Born in Morocco, Youssef Biaz
now lives in Auburn, Alabama

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.470
and represented his state as a
national finalist at the 2010 Poetry

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280
dance routines.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.146
Maybe he'll do that for you.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.853
His favorite authors are
Hemmingway, Sartre and Camus.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.106

&gt;&gt; Mrs. Krikorian by Sharon Olds.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.310


00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
She saved me.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.276
When I arrived in 6th grade, a known
criminal, the new teacher asked me

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.286
to stay after school the first day,
she said I have heard about you.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.126
She was a tall woman,
with a deep crevice

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.370
between her breasts
and a large, calm nose.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.236
She said, this is a
special library pass.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000
As soon as you finish your
hour's work that hour's work

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.276
that took ten minutes and then
the devil glanced into the room

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.656
and found me empty, a house standing
open you can go to the library.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.493
Every hour I'd zip through the work
in a dash and slip out of my seat

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.996
as if out of God's side and
sail down to the library,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.103
solo through the empty powerful
halls, flash my pass and stroll

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.740
over to the dictionary to look up
the most interesting word I knew,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.240
spank, dipping two fingers into
the jar of library paste to suck

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.700
that tart mucilage
as I came to the page

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.353
with the cocker spaniel's
silks curling

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.053
up like the fine steam of the body.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.363
After spank, and breast, I'd move
on to Abe Lincoln and Helen Keller,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.973
safe in their goodness till the
bell, thanks to Mrs. Krikorian,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.110
amiable giantess with the kind eyes.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.206
When she asked me to write a play,
and direct it, and it was a flop,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.103
and I hid in the coat-closet,
she brought me a candy-cane

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.360
as you lay a peppermint on the
tongue, and the worm will come

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880
up out of the bowel to get it.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.676
And so I was emptied of Lucifer and
filled with school glue and eros

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.296
and Amelia Earhart,
saved by Mrs. Krikorian.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.330
And who had saved Mrs. Krikorian?

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.273
When the Turks came across
Armenia, who slid her into the belly

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.426
of a quilt, who locked her in a
chest, who mailed her to America?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.866
And that one, who saved her,
and that one who saved her,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.270
to save the one who saved Mrs.
Krikorian, who was standing there

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.910
on the sill of 6th grade,
a wide-hipped angel,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.363
smoky hair standing up
weightless all around her head?

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.750
I end up owing my soul to so
many, to the Armenian nation,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.056
one more soul someone jammed behind
a stove, drove deep into a crack

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.520
in a wall, shoved under a bed.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.596
I would wake up, in the
morning, under my bed--

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.613
not knowing how I had got
there-- and lie in the dusk,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.856
the dustballs beside my face
round and ashen, shining slightly

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.606
with the eerie comfort of
what is neither good nor evil.

&gt;&gt; Playing dead by Andrew Hudgins.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.643
Our father liked to play a game.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.310
He played that he was dead.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.966
He took his thick black glasses
off and stretched out on the bed.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.690
He wouldn't twitch and didn't
snore or move in any way.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.616
He didn't even seem to breathe!

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.973
We asked, Are you okay?

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.636
We tickled fingers up and down
his huge, pink, stinky feet.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.946
He didn't move; he lay as
still as last year's parakeet.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.946
We pushed our fingers up his
nose, and wiggled them inside.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.650
Next, we peeled his eyelids back.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.590
Are you okay?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.323
We cried. I really thought he might
be dead and not just playing possum,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.326
because his eyeballs didn't twitch
when I slid my tongue across 'em.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.910
He's dead, we sobbed-but to be
sure, I jabbed him in the jewels.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.050
He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,
though I don't think Jesus drools.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.973
His right hand lashed
both right and left.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.613
His left hand clutched his scrotum.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.193
And the words he yelled-I know damn
well I'm way too young to quote 'em.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.676
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Youssef that
was very, very impressive.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.850
I wanted to just keep you up here

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240
for a little bit longer
to ask you a question.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.840
Poetry Out Loud has over 300
poems an online anthology,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.443
you can all look at them,
it's at poetryoutloud.org

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.210
and click on online anthology.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.880
And how it works is these
students, they pick the poems

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.353
that they want to learn and recite.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.243
So can you tell me, you can either
pick one of those poems or both

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.443
of them and talk about out of those
300 what attracted you to develop

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.576
to those and why did
you choose those?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.813
&gt;&gt; Umm, when I first was going to do
the school contest for Auburn High.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.936
I just went blandly on the
website and looked for a poem

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.570
that I was looking for
something that spoke to me

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.056
and I found Mrs. Krikorian
and it was really strange,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.313
I relate to the character
who is speaking,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:49.600
because I remember those
days in middle school

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.440
when I would just be
really bored by busy work

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.176
and that hours work would just take
ten minutes and then I have nothing

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.803
to do and cause a lot of
trouble for my teachers

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.130
and I really enjoyed the idea of
a teacher that saved you and so

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.203
when I found that I was like, this
is for me and that was the poem

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.183
that I first chose and that
initially won me the school contest

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.623
since that was that.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320

here's a letter from our Pete,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.793
and come to the front door mother,
here's a letter from thy dear son.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.533
Lo, 'tis autumn, Lo, where the
trees, deeper green, yellower

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.690
and redder, Cool and sweeten Ohio's
villages with leaves fluttering

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.626
in the moderate wind, Where apples
ripe in the orchards hang and grapes

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.840
on the trellis'd vines,
Smell you the smell

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.880
of the grapes on the vines?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.176
Smell you the buckwheat where
the bees were lately buzzing?

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.076
Above all, lo, the sky so calm,
so transparent after the rain,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.196
and with wondrous clouds, Below too,
all calm, all vital and beautiful,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.470
and the farm prospers well.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.000

all prospers well,

father, come at the daughter's call,

and come to the entry mother, to
the front door come right away.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.716
Fast as she can she
hurries, something ominous,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.543
her steps trembling,
She does not tarry

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.206
to smooth her hair
nor adjust her cap.

writing, yet his name is sign'd.

O a strange hand writes for our
dear son, O stricken mother's soul!

All swims before her
eyes, flashes with black,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:50.743
she catches the main words only.

wound in the breast,

will soon be better.

Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio
with all its cities and farms.

Sickly white in the face and
dull in the head very faint.

around speechless and dismay'd.

says Pete will soon be better.

be better, nor may-be needs

and withdraw.

o'clock news anoche que two robbers

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.650
was caught in Sears and now this is
the part I'm not completely segura

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.330
que I got everything porque
channel 2 tiene tu sabes

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.096
that big fat guy that's hard to
understand porque his nose sit

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.126
on his lip like a elefante pues the
point es que the robbers the police

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.336
say was two young men pretty
big y one have a hairy face

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.510
and the other is calvo
that's right he's baldy

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.530
and okay believe me que
barbaridad porque Hairy Face

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.326
and Mister Baldy goes right into the
underwear department takes all the

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.660
money from the caja yeah
uh-huh the cash register

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.636
and mira Mister Baldy goes

that I guess would be like us sixty
o sixty-five who is in the section

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.630
of the back-support brassieres
and he makes her put a big bra

over her head para que she can't see
nothing and kneel like she's talking

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.456
to God to save her poor life

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:21.256
and other things horrible pero the
point como dije es que there was two

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:30.003
of them and both was speaking
Spanish y por eso is a good thing

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.896
Conchita so the people at Sears

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.510
[ Applause ]

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you Will.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.693
Will has had a great
success at Poetry Out Loud.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.550
You can see why and I don't
think I'll ever read Walt Whitman

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.303
without hearing his voice.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.060
You do a great a job.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.993
You had won very serious
poem, and one funnier poem

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.016
and you don't over do it.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.483
You have exactly the right tone.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.863
Would you mind telling us a
little about your methodology

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.303
and how do you go about
memorizing a poem?

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.836
&gt;&gt; Umm. That's a pretty
good question.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.843
Basic like it's different
for different people I guess

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.683
but I usually just try to take it
a few lines a time, a few sentences

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.673
at a time and you just drill
it in and it's incredible

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.933
because you know, if you try
to memorize something one night

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.493
and then you come back with
the next day like you'll find

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.590
that you've retained a lot of the
material but if you try to do it all

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.530
at the same day it's
like you'll forget it,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.500
so it's sort of a gradual process
and yeah, you just take it in steps.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.400
I remember this year from my
school competition I only had

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.220
to recite one poem for that and
then I won my school competition

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.446
and then we had a regional that
was the next week and I had

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.093
to have an additional two poems
memorized so I had about five days

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.066
to memorize two poems and yeah,
you just sit down and do it

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.703
and it's hard but you know, its
like studying for a test, I guess.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.233
You just go through it.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.273
You say it to yourself, say it in
the shower and say it before you go

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.390
to bed and just really,
just let it sink in

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.863
and let it become a part of you.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you Will.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.930
I have one more question for you.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.770
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.413
&gt;&gt; So, how did you know
to do recitation so well

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.126
and how do you avoid
the over dramatization?

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.150
Was their a coach involved?

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.720
Or did you just figure
out the materials and--

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.980
&gt;&gt; That's-I'm not really sure.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.250
There is a really thin line between,
you know like over dramatizing it

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.130
and then doing it really, you
know subtly, you definitely see

00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.633
that at the competition
even at Nationals.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.640
I remember last year
during my junior year,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.626
the kid who won William
Farley was just--

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.133
I mean obviously Amber was like
awesome but I remember Will,

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.913
Will left a really strong
impression on me because he was

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.006
so ridiculously un dramatic.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.833
He was so honest and like, almost
dead pan in a sense but like,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.210
he was just, I don't know he was
just so straight forward about it,

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.893
and I think that's what Amber
was able to convey as well.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.566
I think that's what the
judges try to look for,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.350
it's just that honesty
instead of that you know sort

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:33.983
of an exaggerated tone that
you might see sometimes

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:36.273
at like some poetry readings but
I'm, yeah, I am trying to make it

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.313
as honest as possible it's
really important, and yeah,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.180
I think we all try to do the best we
can but yeah, just trying to be true

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.486
to yourself and sure to the
poem and that's all you can do.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.510
[ Applause ]

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.180
&gt;&gt; And that's not easy to do--

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.980
what they do, all three
of them here today.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.046
Next I want to introduce
Amber Rose Johnson.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.276
Last April, Amber Rose Johnson,
a junior at Classical high school

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.090
in Providence Rhode Island won
the title of National Champion

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.356
of the 2010 Poetry Out
Loud national finals.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:19.923
She advanced from a
very competitive field

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.076
to claim a 20,000 dollar price.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.143
As the POL national champion, Amber
has been a guess on MPRs the best

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.123
of our knowledge, alongside
Natalie Merchant, Bobby McFerrin

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.216
and Rae Armantrout, and others.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:35.933
Amber also participated
in the poetry--

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.756
the panel on poetry at the American
Library Association Conference held

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.640
in D.C. this summer and will
perform along Rhode Island poets

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.086
at The Library of Congress', Poetry
at Noon Series on October 19.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.186
Her favorite poets are Maya Angelou
and Nikki Giovanni and she hopes

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.640
to pursue a career in public
policy and political science.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.010
Welcome Amber.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.510

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.426
&gt;&gt; Hello, hello.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.790
Oh, my dad is right
there [laughter].

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:13.236
I was looking for him
but he is right there.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.450
Aren't they amazing [applause] Umm,
so, I'm gonna do the last piece

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.946
that I did at the national
competitions this year.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.686
It's called For My
People by Margaret Walker

their slave songs repeatedly,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920


00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.213
their dirges and their ditties
and their blues and jubilees,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.063
praying their prayers
nightly to an unknown god,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.470
bending their knees
humbly to an unseen power;

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.770


00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.366

to the years, to the gone years

years, washing, ironing, cooking,

gaining never reaping never knowing

and never understanding; For my
playmates in the clay and dust

and sand of Alabama backyards
playing baptizing and preaching

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.623
and doctor and jail and soldier
and school and mama and cooking

and playhouse and concert and
store and hair and Miss Choomby

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.753

bewildered years we went to school

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.880
to learn to know the reasons why and
the answers to and the people who

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.693
and the places where and the days
when, in memory of the bitter hours

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.236
when we discovered we were black
and poor and small and different

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.326
and nobody cared and nobody
wondered and nobody understood.

For the boys and girls who grew
in spite of these thing to be man

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.576
and woman, to laugh and dance and
sing and play and drink their wine

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.096
and religion and success, to marry
their playmates and bear children

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.630
and then die of consumption
and anemia and lynching.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.246

blindly spreading joy,

losing time being lazy, sleeping
when hungry, shouting when burdened,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.343
drinking when hopeless, tied and
shackled and tangled among ourselves

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.916
by the unseen creatures who tower
over us omnisciently and laugh;

and money and something--

and floundering in the dark of
churches and schools and clubs

and societies, associations
and councils and committees

and conventions, distressed and
disturbed and deceived and devoured

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.716
by money-hungry, glory-craving
leeches, preyed on by facile force

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.766
of state and fad and novelty, by
false prophet and holy believer;

For my people standing staring
trying to fashion a better way

hypocrisy and misunderstanding,

hold all the people, all the faces,

[ Applause ]

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you Amber, I wanted
to ask you a question too.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.456
Beside the cash prize, you are about
half way to your 10 year as Poetry

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.050
Out loud national champion.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.183
&gt;&gt; And in my introduction,
I read up a series

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.810
of public appearances you've been
making and even talking about poetry

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.023
as well as about your life

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.570
and I know you have a political
career paths ahead of you.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:50.143
I want you to talk a little about
what it has meant to be a Poetry

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.996
Out Loud national champion
to you and you know what--

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:54.843
is there any difference before
you won the title and now,

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:58.500
and what you've learned and
what this has meant to you?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.093
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's quite a question.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.113
Umm, becoming national champion
has absolutely changed my life.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.793
My entire life, woop done.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:14.780
Old Amber is completely
gone, completely changed.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.926
It's definitely a big change
from being a state champion

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:26.010
to national champion and I remember
I competed two years ago, as well.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.066
When Shawntay Henry was the national
champion and I remember looking

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.530
at her and looking at Will
Farley and being like,

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.363
men they are so cool like, I wanna
be them and now that I'm in it,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:40.400
it's just-- it's absolutely
amazing, the way, I--

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.106
the way I used to see
the national champion,

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.596
I know that people are looking
at me that way and just knowing

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.423
that other students are
getting the same feeling

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.070
but you also have a certain level of
responsibility as national champion,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.043
definitely wherever I go, I don't
just wanna talk about myself.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.543
I wanna talk about all the
amazing state champions.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.440
I wanna talk about the entire
experience and how Poetry

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.846
Out Loud is still growing,
I don't-- it's, insane.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.520
I feel like every morning I wake
up and sometimes I'm like whoa,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.770
I'm a national champion, like
its never really hits you

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.963
and never really sinks it.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:19.683
I think I finally understand it
when I'm at the nationals in April

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.043
and heading off the title maybe
that's when it hit me but as

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.650
of right now, I'm kinda still
in the whirlwind [applause].

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.386
We have some time to
have one more question.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.846
I also wanted to ask you
the methodology question,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.626
you know, how do you choose poems?

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:37.426
Are you still memorizing poems?

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360
And you know?

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.640
For all the poetry lovers in the
audience, what does it mean to you

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.623
to internalize a poem and how do
you memorize and how do you go

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.203
about your work with that?

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.660
&gt;&gt; Umm, in terms of
choosing my poem,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.510
it was always a really
a family experience.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.100
I have great family support at home.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.783
My dad is here with me today and
it was always the whole family

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.440
that kind of chose the poem because,
wherever I go I wanna speak life,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.726
I wanna carry a positive image.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.570
So, I'm kind of didn't want
any poems that were overly sad

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.380
or depressing or anything like that.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.120
I wanted a poem that reflected me
and reflected something positive.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.200
And in terms of memorizing,
like Will said,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.210
that's definitely a gradual process.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.610
It's not something that
happens over night.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:24.380
It's just about, you now,
taking it one step at a time,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.840
trying not to get overwhelmed.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.516
If you do motions, if ever
you're trying to memorize poems,

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.763
do motions, that helps it
does, like if you are trying

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.830
to remember something and you do
a motion it will definitely click.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:40.820
But I mean, I had a
coach for this year,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.963
last year when I competed
I didn't have coach

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:45.836
and that definitely
helped but it's just,

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.940
it's trying to find the
heartbeat of the poem.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.823
Because, when you do Poetry Out Loud
I think what Will was trying to get

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.186
at between-- the different routine
a recitation and a performance

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.233
or over dramatize, drama-- yeah that
word is when you find the heartbeat

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.396
of the poem, because I wanna
take Amber out of the poem.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.310
I'm sure they wanna take Will
and Youssef out of the poem.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.843
That's not what the
performances is about;

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.043
it's about finding the
heartbeat of the poem.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.576
Finding the heartbeat of the
author that wrote the poem,

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.333
really understanding and letting
the word speaks for themselves

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.153
and that's really when
you master the poem

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.553
when you can't let the
word speak for themselves

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.820
and take yourself completely
out of it so [applause]

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.953
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more quick one,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.136
and has this helped you
in your writing at all?

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.190
And do you write poetry?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.856
Or is this just a separate
art for you completely.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.240
&gt;&gt; Poetry Out Loud kind of has
touched every area of my life,

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.386
it definitely helps
when it comes, you know,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.720
when your English teach tells you
you're doing a poetry segment,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:51.810
I'm like yes.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.150
My favorite segment, but it
definitely has changed my writing

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.403
and the way I looked at words

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.963
because I understand how
powerful words can really be now

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.733
and I understand that the way
you structure something on a page

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:04.846
or the way you put two words
together can really take

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:08.933
like completely change
the impact of the poem

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.386
and the meaning of the poem.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.496
So, I definitely take that into
consideration, but I have also found

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:15.856
that now whenever I look at a poem
or whenever I hear a poem I think

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.003
about so much more
than just listening.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.753
I think about what the author
was going through when they wrote

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.650
that poem, I think about what
that poem was supposed to mean,

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.070
I think about the time
that it was written.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:27.913
I think about the person
who's reciting it

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.613
and when you do a competition
like that, you really start

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.813
to breakdown a poem and it means it
is much more than just, you know,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.400
something written on the page.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.400
[applause]

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.400
&gt;&gt; Good answer.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.000
That's very interesting.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.760
As an organizer for Poetry Out
Loud, it such a privilege to be able

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:46.690
to get inside the minds of these
kids, that are so good at this.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.590
I want to remind all high school
teachers here that we have kits

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.720
in the back for Poetry
Out Loud to start

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.493
that new classroom please
visit the tables in the back

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.573
and thank you fro being here.
