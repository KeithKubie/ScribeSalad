MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Hello.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.073
JOSH SASSOON: Hi.

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:03.198
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Oh, hi.

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:05.920
Today we are talking
about YouTube and design.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.130
YouTube's grown tremendously
over the last nine years

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.460
and now has a global
community of users.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.210
And that is a really
interesting design problem.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.550
JOSH SASSOON: I mean, if you're
going to have a problem, that's

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.360
a good kind of problem
to have, right?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.010
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Oh.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.530
Yes.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.150
But it presents a challenge.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.540
And that challenge
is, how do you

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.676
design a product that
looks and feels consistent

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:25.550
when it means something
different to everyone

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.740
who uses it?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.360
Most brands have a
pretty clear idea

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.870
of how they want
to be represented.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.040
But at YouTube, our challenge
is that YouTube represents

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.050
everything from delightful
and silly content

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.607
to serious and sensitive stuff.

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.940
JOSH SASSOON: That sounds
like a pretty crazy challenge.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.750
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Exactly.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.251
Exactly.

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:41.708
JOSH SASSOON: So
why don't we share

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.570
the story of how we
took on that challenge

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.779
and captured YouTube's brand.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:45.778
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:46.900
Sounds good to me.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.950
Everybody, this is Josh and he's
a product designer at YouTube.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.130
JOSH SASSOON: Hi.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.963
And this is Michael.

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.100
He's a marketing designer.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.410
We work together on YouTube's
User Experience Team.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.340
And, Josh, let's
tell these folks

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.857
what they can expect
in this video.

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.440
JOSH SASSOON: Sounds
like a good plan.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.981
So in the next few minutes we're
going to cover a few things.

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.800
The first is how a traditional
style guide can actually

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.270
be something much, much
more than a style guide.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.320
The second is understanding
your brand's identity

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.949
through its community of users.

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:13.740
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
And then we can wrap up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.114
with some tips
and tricks for how

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.289
you can use this
in your own work.

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.080
JOSH SASSOON: Cool.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.730
So we represent a
collaboration between UX design

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.570
and marketing.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350
And we actually started building
a traditional style guide.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.377
And then we decided
that we needed

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:27.460
to do something different.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.180
And we ended up
with something much,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.970
much more useful to our team.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.640
So here is just
one page from what

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.110
the style guide looks like.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.400
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Right.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.710
The guide we created
lets teams at YouTube jam

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.510
together on product
design and content

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.920
creation by speaking
a common language.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.249
We can't go through the
entire resource in this video,

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.790
but we're going to share some
of the content and process that

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.910
went into turning YouTube style
guide into a thought guide.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.350
JOSH SASSOON: A thought guide?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.686
What's a thought guide?

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:53.060
MICHAEL AUSTIN
SUI: Well, what do

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.580
you think I'm
thinking right now?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.060
JOSH SASSOON: What are
you thinking right now?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.393
I think you're thinking that
when YouTube first started,

00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:00.310
it was a video dating site.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.920
Am I right?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.620
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.050
You are right.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.450
And that blows my
mind every time.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.949
I love it.

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:04.740
Good job.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.240
JOSH SASSOON: So
since then the site

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.169
has evolved into an entire
service-- a huge service.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.562
And the video content on the
service has grown up, too.

00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:13.270
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
YouTube is a platform

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.760
for community movements, like
It Gets Better Project, memes--

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.940
like the Harlem Shake--
and serious subjects--

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.162
like political uprisings
captured on mobile phones.

00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:23.620
JOSH SASSOON: And obviously
YouTube gets all of its content

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.540
from its users.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.740
So that means that our users are
designing our product with us.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.890
So why wouldn't a style
guide actually reflect that?

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Exactly
what I was thinking.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.710
So we think it's way cooler
to design with our community

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.330
than for our community.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.900
I mean, not that we're not
designing for our users.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.400
We are.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.360
But I mean with them.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.533
We feel like family--
like the Brady Bunch.

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.540
JOSH SASSOON: But that presents
a second question, doesn't it?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.272
Who makes up
YouTube's community?

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:51.730
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
Well, you might

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.040
think it's just people
watching videos.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.610
But it's more complex than that.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.068
JOSH SASSOON: So
complex, actually,

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:57.860
that we spent about
a year doing research

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.630
with users to learn
how they interact with

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.210
and relate to YouTube's brand.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.720
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.928
Here's some of that research.

00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:05.110
Here is a page
from a diary study.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.370
And that looks like
somebody using their tablet

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.020
on the toilet.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.120
Is that accurate?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.950
JOSH SASSOON: I'm afraid it is.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.020
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
Well, that's fantastic.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.080
Because we can use that.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.470
We like data.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.470
Sometimes research
and analytics are

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410
used to solve a really
specific problem,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.022
like how to improve
task completion

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:20.980
or click-through rates.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.080
JOSH SASSOON: But
we're actually curious

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.810
about larger communities and
their needs on our platform.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.190
Not just a specific persona.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.880
And not just the people
that are watching videos.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.780
So going back to
that question, who

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.067
really is everyone on YouTube?

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.150
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Right.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.796
The YouTube community is
really complex and diverse.

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:38.420
There's a lot of
people viewing videos.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.750
But that's not everyone.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.290
There's also people making
really interesting content,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.180
creating original videos,
vlogs, shows, music.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.970
All of that stuff.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.886
JOSH SASSOON: Yeah, and
actually another thing

00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:52.520
that we found interesting is
that advertisers were uploading

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.470
amazing content and
collaborating with our creators

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.310
to make commercials and ads
that people really love to watch

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.790
and actually wanted to share.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.873
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Right.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.490
So the research and digging
into experiments, data,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.930
and YouTube's history
revealed that there's

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.110
real tribes of people
collaborating on the platform.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.570
And that information is so much
more interesting and valuable

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.050
than it is for us
to invent personas

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.238
or to design for just
one kind of user.

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:18.029
JOSH SASSOON: Yeah.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.920
So a style guide
is usually there

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.930
to document a brand
in one direction.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.067
It's like a photo
from one perspective.

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:26.150
And we wanted something a
little bit more dynamic.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.691
Something that was
more like a mirror

00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.037
that reflected principles
back on the community.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.120
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Right.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.774
So if we had a
mirror like that we

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:35.315
could use it to determine the
success of our design solutions

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:36.910
or campaign creative.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.914
The new metric
being authenticity.

00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:40.330
JOSH SASSOON: And
it was that idea

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.260
that started to turn our style
guide into more of a thought

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.850
guide.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.970
And it began by curating words
that described our brand that

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.110
would reflect the personality
of YouTube's tribes.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.500
And then it actually
guided product design.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.680
And it also helped
craft marketing efforts.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.030
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.710
The words.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.260
The words.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.760
The words--

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.135
JOSH SASSOON: The words.

00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:57.710
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
--are connected.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.024
Human, spirit, and simple.

00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:00.940
JOSH SASSOON: Awesome.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.630
Words!

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.200
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Woo-hoo!

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.840
JOSH SASSOON: Words!

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.550
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Words.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.091
JOSH SASSOON: So we
have these words.

00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:07.050
What we do with these words?

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.340
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Right.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.620
Right.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.120
OK.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.225
So words are good.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:09.850
Words are good.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.060
They're well-meaning words, but
we need actionable principles

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.720
that we can actually work with.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.360
So let's take connected
as an example.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.874
We've identified our tribes--
creators, advertisers, viewers.

00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:22.540
And individually--
unconnected-- they're

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.280
just floating out there in
space like little stars.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.079
But say we do something.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.620
We create a product
or an experience.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.841
And we try to solve two of their
needs and connect those groups.

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.840
Well, that's great because
now we've got a line.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.860
And that's good.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.690
But you still got one
floating out there.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.300
JOSH SASSOON: But what if we
actually connected all three

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.120
and we made a consolation
which conveniently

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.450
looks like a play button?

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.760
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Gorgeous.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.080
JOSH SASSOON: Whenever you
have three points connecting

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.746
your community together
you can actually

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:49.975
triangulate your position.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:50.933
You know where you are.

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.010
You know who you are.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.960
And you know where
you're going to go next.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.440
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.080
Exactly.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.155
And chances are if
you've done all those

00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:58.530
and you've connected
them, you're

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.130
probably making work that meets
the needs of more user tribes.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.800
And that's a good thing.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.990
So we shifted the way
that we evaluate our work

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.530
by adding the metric
of connectedness, too.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.500
So we aim for beautiful
constellations, not just

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.970
solutions that serve one group.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.000
The more the merrier.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.310
JOSH SASSOON: Yeah.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.559
And I think if we look back
this principle is actually

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.040
happening already on YouTube.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.660
We had lots of advertisers
that were already

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.570
working with creators to
create great commercials

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.630
and ads for users.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.520
So a lot of this was
already happening.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.230
And all we did on our end was
we started observing this.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.180
And then we assembled
a team of designers

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.940
from product and
marketing all together.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.780
And we started to think
about the brand voice end

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.040
to end on YouTube and
came up with those words.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.940
And those words-- again,
connected, human, spirited,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.630
simple-- they became
principles that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.160
helped us create
a common language.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.618
That was a real
thing that evolved.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.440
A common language for
product and marketing

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.430
to collaborate together.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.200
So let's look at
some of the ways we

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.920
work to deliver on those
attributes and principles.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.790
What comes to mind is
the YouTube Music Awards.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.940
That's a way that we ran
with the idea of connected.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.910
So we streamed a live event from
Seoul, Moscow, London, Rio, New

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.880
York, so that the entire
world could celebrate

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.710
music on YouTube
at the same time.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.230
JOSH SASSOON: Very cool.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.630
And, actually, on
the product side,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.150
I think I have a good
example of connected.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.422
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Oh.

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:19.840
All right.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.140
Let me hear it.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.490
JOSH SASSOON: So we discovered
that creators really

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.530
wanted to connect more
with their viewers.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.690
And we built this tool that
lets those creators see

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.902
who their top fans are.

00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:29.360
And now they can
actually reach out

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.900
to their most
engaged subscribers

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.257
and start a conversation
with them or just say thanks.

00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:35.590
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: I love that.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.091
Humans connecting
with other humans.

00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:37.881
JOSH SASSOON: Yeah.

00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.790
Speaking of human--

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.873
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Speaking
of human-- let's talk

00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:44.030
about LGBT creators on YouTube
who made it a safe space

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.770
to come out and
speak their minds.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.645
We thought that was so
awesome that we wanted

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.040
to make a video celebrating
their work and those moments.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.410
So we did.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.570
And then we asked people in
that video to upload their own

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.530
and join in using the
hashtag proud to love.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.050
And they did.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.430
It was an awesome
response and so

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.190
nice to connect with the
community in that way.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.910
JOSH SASSOON: And now
there's Proud to Play, right?

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.020
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes,
there's Proud to Play, too.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.780
You can search for
that video on YouTube.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.280
It's lovely.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.860
JOSH SASSOON: Cool.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.276
MICHAEL AUSTIN
SUI: You know what?

00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:12.254
Tell them about that secret
Harlem Shake Easter egg

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:14.420
because that is a good
example of spirited, I think.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:14.680
JOSH SASSOON: Yeah.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.820
It's very spirited.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.790
So if you go to YouTube and you
type in "do the Harlem shake"

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.030
into the search field, the site
actually does the Harlem Shake.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.960
It's pretty cool.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.770
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: I love that.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.950
So this is the still image.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.940
You really have
to go to the site

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.360
to try it and see
it for yourself.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.230
It's awesome.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.350
But we wanted to
express our spirit just

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.409
like the original creators
of the Harlem Shake

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.118
and everybody who
joined in with them.

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:35.909
JOSH SASSOON: Cool.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:39.809
So we also want YouTube to
feel simple and easy to use.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.476
It's one of our biggest
ongoing efforts.

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:43.058
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI:
Yup, that is true.

00:08:43.058 --> 00:08:44.261
And it's one of the hardest.

00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:46.510
One of the ways we tried to
solve that was with an app

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.020
called YouTube Capture.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.260
And it made it a lot
simpler to upload videos

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.950
to YouTube from your iPhone.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.574
JOSH SASSOON: I think
the original flow

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:54.830
took almost a dozen steps.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.660
And we were able to reduce
it down to just two steps

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.250
and also include editing and
enhancement capabilities.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.430
That's pretty simple.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.680
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Love that.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.640
Amazing.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.424
So I think when we look
back at all these things,

00:09:06.424 --> 00:09:08.840
one of the things we learned
was that no matter what we're

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.270
doing-- whether it's an app or
campaign creative-- we can find

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.510
ways to embody the brand
attributes in our work.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.510
JOSH SASSOON: And depending
on the specific user

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.920
tribe or the context, we
can dial those attributes

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.260
up or down.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.939
So they're really flexible.

00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:24.480
And I think now's
a good time that we

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.280
show a chart so this
presentation actually

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:26.999
feels official.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.040
You have to have a chart.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.910
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes, that
would make this very official.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.180
All right.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.130
I think we've got a chart.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.610
And it's called "Find
the Right Balance".

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.270
Here it is.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.980
JOSH SASSOON: So for
a product feature,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.460
we look for solutions that
feel connected and simple

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.100
predominately.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.040
And that's the blue and
the purple on this chart.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.123
And then we throw in a
dash of spirited and human.

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:45.430
We always have all four
attributes present.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.430
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yes.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.210
So take the marketing campaign.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.540
All four are present again.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.560
But we want a super sized
helping of spirited and human.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.640
That's the yellow and the
red pieces of the pie.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.450
And then connected
and simple are there,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.560
but they might be side dishes,
but they're still at the table.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.393
JOSH SASSOON: Right.

00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:02.200
So these are actionable
brand principles.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.170
That's awesome.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.697
Now what do you think
we should do next?

00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:09.030
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: I think
we should wrap this video up

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.719
with a bulleted
list of takeaways.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:11.760
JOSH SASSOON: Oh my gosh.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.520
You read my mind.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.060
I love bulleted lists.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.170
MICHAEL AUSTIN
SUI: Mind reading.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.378
JOSH SASSOON: The best way
to wrap up a presentation.

00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:18.389
So when you're designing
your own thought guide,

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:19.805
here's some things
that we learned

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:21.480
that we wanted to
share with you.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.600
The first thing is
it's hard to make

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.390
good decisions with
incomplete date

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.640
or just one kind of persona.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.900
So if you can
research real users,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.770
and especially think about
entire tribes of users,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.199
dig into that and
identify your community.

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.240
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Nice.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.530
Love that.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.030
All right.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.390
So once you've got your
community identified--

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.420
those people are full of
passion and personality.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.780
So why not look to
them to help define

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.800
your product and your brand.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.460
JOSH SASSOON: And next if you've
identified your community it's

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.060
way way, way more fun to design
with them instead of just

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.560
for them.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.770
So engage with the
tribes on your platform

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.960
as often as you can.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.752
Talk to your users
and communities.

00:10:56.752 --> 00:10:57.710
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: OK.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.390
Love that.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.252
And when it comes
to brand attributes,

00:11:00.252 --> 00:11:01.210
I've got a tip for you.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.890
Are you ready?

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:02.120
JOSH SASSOON: Yes.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.078
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: OK.

00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:04.480
So it's flex and fit.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.580
So choose words that are
flexible in their definition

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.600
yet specific enough to
actually work and be useful.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.010
And then once you get them, you
can dial them up or dial them

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.717
down depending on the context
of your project or your work

00:11:17.717 --> 00:11:19.300
or the problem you're
trying to solve.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.091
JOSH SASSOON: Cool.

00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:23.190
And last but not least, think
principles before pixels.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.540
Stay true to your community
by turning those brand

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.610
attributes into
actionable principles

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.020
that you measure all of
your design work against.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.760
A thought guide can actually
help any size company--

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.800
large or small-- with
any type of community

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.790
make better decisions.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.339
It's been a huge change for
us in how we design and work.

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:39.380
MICHAEL AUSTIN SUI: Yeah.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.040
Definitely.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.760
So thank you guys for watching.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.850
Thank you for your time.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.558
Check out some of the
videos we went over

00:11:44.558 --> 00:11:46.960
and shared today on youtube.com.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.570
That's the website.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.820
And we hope you have
a great, great I/O.
