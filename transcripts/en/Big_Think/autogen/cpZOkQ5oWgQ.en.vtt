00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.060
 
I tend to look at things from an

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
I tend to look at things from an
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.230
I tend to look at things from an
evolutionary perspective and so I think

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240
evolutionary perspective and so I think
 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.170
evolutionary perspective and so I think
that I mean I think a lot of a lot of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180
that I mean I think a lot of a lot of
 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.929
that I mean I think a lot of a lot of
the focus for probably the answers to

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939
the focus for probably the answers to
 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.640
the focus for probably the answers to
that question are largely focused on

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650
that question are largely focused on
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.040
that question are largely focused on
stuff that's happened in the last

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
stuff that's happened in the last
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.810
stuff that's happened in the last
thousand years or this these sorts of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
thousand years or this these sorts of
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.240
thousand years or this these sorts of
things I tend to think I look at things

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250
things I tend to think I look at things
 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.519
things I tend to think I look at things
from an evolutionary perspective so I

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529
from an evolutionary perspective so I
 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.979
from an evolutionary perspective so I
think that where we are our brains we

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989
think that where we are our brains we
 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.719
think that where we are our brains we
really have spent most of their time

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729
really have spent most of their time
 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.990
really have spent most of their time
evolving on the African savannah and a

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000
evolving on the African savannah and a
 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.660
evolving on the African savannah and a
very little time evolving in what we

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670
very little time evolving in what we
 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.880
very little time evolving in what we
think is sort of our present day through

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
think is sort of our present day through
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.789
think is sort of our present day through
how we view things so I think we're a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799
how we view things so I think we're a
 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.829
how we view things so I think we're a
lot more base than then we think we are

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839
lot more base than then we think we are
 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.680
lot more base than then we think we are
like the world has evolved much more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690
like the world has evolved much more
 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.899
like the world has evolved much more
quickly than our brains have and so and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909
quickly than our brains have and so and
 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.030
quickly than our brains have and so and
I think we don't acknowledge that enough

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
I think we don't acknowledge that enough
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:15.600
I think we don't acknowledge that enough
and so well I'd like to start turn that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610
and so well I'd like to start turn that
 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.720
and so well I'd like to start turn that
around so really i don't i don't think

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730
around so really i don't i don't think
 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.600
around so really i don't i don't think
that we are a bad people and i don't

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
that we are a bad people and i don't
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.780
that we are a bad people and i don't
think we're different Americans

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
think we're different Americans
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.430
think we're different Americans
Canadians Europeans like I don't I don't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440
Canadians Europeans like I don't I don't
 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.470
Canadians Europeans like I don't I don't
think we're sort of that much different

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480
think we're sort of that much different
 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.500
think we're sort of that much different
and I think the way that we've gotten

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510
and I think the way that we've gotten
 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.440
and I think the way that we've gotten
here is really is absolutely

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450
here is really is absolutely
 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.750
here is really is absolutely
understandable there was a time when

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760
understandable there was a time when
 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.060
understandable there was a time when
natural resources went on and on likely

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070
natural resources went on and on likely
 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.370
natural resources went on and on likely
just there was an incredible amount so

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380
just there was an incredible amount so
 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.710
just there was an incredible amount so
we really didn't have to think that much

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720
we really didn't have to think that much
 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.530
we really didn't have to think that much
about being wasteful and that's that's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540
about being wasteful and that's that's
 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.570
about being wasteful and that's that's
sort of where we where we've come from

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580
sort of where we where we've come from
 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.740
sort of where we where we've come from
in this last century and so we sort of i

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750
in this last century and so we sort of i
 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.770
in this last century and so we sort of i
think we in a way conceptually have sort

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780
think we in a way conceptually have sort
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.600
think we in a way conceptually have sort
of worked our way around the globe you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610
of worked our way around the globe you
 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.460
of worked our way around the globe you
know when we sit we set out one way and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470
know when we sit we set out one way and
 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.990
know when we sit we set out one way and
there's like lots and lots of forests

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000
there's like lots and lots of forests
 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.060
there's like lots and lots of forests
and it's sort of well we're just sort of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070
and it's sort of well we're just sort of
 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.520
and it's sort of well we're just sort of
realizing we're about to hit our come to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530
realizing we're about to hit our come to
 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.670
realizing we're about to hit our come to
the end and we have to relook at how we

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
the end and we have to relook at how we
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.979
the end and we have to relook at how we
do things so i don't think we're bad

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989
do things so i don't think we're bad
 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.190
do things so i don't think we're bad
people we just we didn't look it was

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200
people we just we didn't look it was
 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.170
people we just we didn't look it was
hard to see that far in advance it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180
hard to see that far in advance it's
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.170
hard to see that far in advance it's
hard to think that we would actually

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
hard to think that we would actually
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449
hard to think that we would actually
through those resources and and so now

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
through those resources and and so now
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.759
through those resources and and so now
we just we're learning quickly that we

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769
we just we're learning quickly that we
 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.000
we just we're learning quickly that we
have to have a different approach
