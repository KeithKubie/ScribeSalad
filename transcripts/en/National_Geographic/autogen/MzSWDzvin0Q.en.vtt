I think this might be the best forest we

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:44.180
I think this might be the best forest we
 

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.180
I think this might be the best forest we
can follow her at the moment she has

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.190
can follow her at the moment she has
 

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:55.120
can follow her at the moment she has
gone on to Torchwood I will Emma can we

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:55.130
gone on to Torchwood I will Emma can we
 

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:56.770
gone on to Torchwood I will Emma can we
follow pretty onto Torchwood

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:56.780
follow pretty onto Torchwood
 

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.480
follow pretty onto Torchwood
I'm just checking to see if we can

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:58.490
I'm just checking to see if we can
 

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.100
I'm just checking to see if we can
follow her because if she leads us to

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:00.110
follow her because if she leads us to
 

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.680

the den this is going to be a huge
 

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:08.559
the den this is going to be a huge
moment for us

01:03:08.559 --> 01:03:08.569
 

01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:15.130
okay yeah I think we're gonna lose our

Oh
but you know this would make sense

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319
but you know this would make sense
 

01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:20.049
but you know this would make sense
actually I'm running through everything

01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:20.059
actually I'm running through everything
 

01:03:20.059 --> 01:03:22.179
actually I'm running through everything
in my head because this is where we've

01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:22.189
in my head because this is where we've
 

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:24.099
in my head because this is where we've
been seeing the hyenas and we have

01:03:24.099 --> 01:03:24.109
been seeing the hyenas and we have
 

01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:28.479
been seeing the hyenas and we have
thought very very few corn we have

back on Juma and sort of the southern

01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079
back on Juma and sort of the southern
 

01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:36.009
back on Juma and sort of the southern
boundary latitude area but this would

01:03:36.009 --> 01:03:36.019
boundary latitude area but this would
 

01:03:36.019 --> 01:03:38.229
boundary latitude area but this would
make sense if they've actually things on

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:38.239
make sense if they've actually things on
 

01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:41.829
make sense if they've actually things on
the southern boundary of Torchwood area

01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839
the southern boundary of Torchwood area
 

01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.599
the southern boundary of Torchwood area

they're far into Torchwood because of

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:13.970
they're far into Torchwood because of
 

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.790
they're far into Torchwood because of
where we've been seeing them and where

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:15.800
where we've been seeing them and where
 

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.950
where we've been seeing them and where
we've been seeing tracks I think they

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960
we've been seeing tracks I think they
 

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.110
we've been seeing tracks I think they
could just be on the boundary here and

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:20.120
could just be on the boundary here and
 

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.000
could just be on the boundary here and
that's there's a big termite mound over

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.010
that's there's a big termite mound over
 

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:24.190
that's there's a big termite mound over
here and that's why we've been thinking

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200
here and that's why we've been thinking
 

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.590
here and that's why we've been thinking
that they have potentially moved back to

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:26.600
that they have potentially moved back to
 

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.400
that they have potentially moved back to

some sort of carcass the way she was

01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800
some sort of carcass the way she was
 

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.710
some sort of carcass the way she was
behaving it was becoming quite erratic

01:36:57.710 --> 01:36:57.720
behaving it was becoming quite erratic
 

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.420
behaving it was becoming quite erratic
in France that she was sniffing

01:36:59.420 --> 01:36:59.430
in France that she was sniffing
 

01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:02.210

loops so we were really thinking what is

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540
loops so we were really thinking what is
 

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.090
loops so we were really thinking what is
she doing is she trying to evade us and

01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.100
she doing is she trying to evade us and
 

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.850
she doing is she trying to evade us and
obviously she wasn't she was just

that that is a good question it could

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:18.710
that that is a good question it could
 

01:41:18.710 --> 01:41:20.830
that that is a good question it could
potentially do that you see the size of

the bird in the size of the talons and
 

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.580
the bird in the size of the talons and

with the Gosselin's here and they are
 

01:41:30.139 --> 01:41:31.660
