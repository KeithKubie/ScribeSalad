the gyro gun experience I think William

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
the gyro gun experience I think William
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.900
the gyro gun experience I think William
James was one of the one of the guys who

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
James was one of the one of the guys who
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.849
James was one of the one of the guys who
really did a good job of that saying

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
really did a good job of that saying
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.200
really did a good job of that saying
basically you know if I may be right

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
basically you know if I may be right
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.089
basically you know if I may be right
about this way of thinking but even if

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
about this way of thinking but even if
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.970
about this way of thinking but even if
I'm not thinking this way allows me to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
I'm not thinking this way allows me to
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.290
I'm not thinking this way allows me to
lead a better life and I think he was

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
lead a better life and I think he was
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.529
lead a better life and I think he was
talking about freewill and he was

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
talking about freewill and he was
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929
talking about freewill and he was
basically saying look I don't know if we

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
basically saying look I don't know if we
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.250
basically saying look I don't know if we
have free will or I don't know if

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
have free will or I don't know if
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.470
have free will or I don't know if
everything we do is based on a causal

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
everything we do is based on a causal
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970
everything we do is based on a causal
chain of events that we really can't

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
chain of events that we really can't
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.389
chain of events that we really can't
control but thinking about freewill in a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
control but thinking about freewill in a
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.450
control but thinking about freewill in a
way that it does exist allows me to live

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
way that it does exist allows me to live
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.540
way that it does exist allows me to live
a better life and so guess what I am a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
a better life and so guess what I am a
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280
a better life and so guess what I am a
proponent of freewill because that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
proponent of freewill because that
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.319
proponent of freewill because that
allows me to live a better life that way

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
allows me to live a better life that way
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.430
allows me to live a better life that way
because I feel like I have more

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
because I feel like I have more
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650
because I feel like I have more
flexibility more choice I'm a happier

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
flexibility more choice I'm a happier
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299
flexibility more choice I'm a happier
person and I think sometimes people

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
person and I think sometimes people
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790
person and I think sometimes people
forget some of that too you know I mean

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
forget some of that too you know I mean
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
forget some of that too you know I mean

the mystery of it all that's one of the
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060
the mystery of it all that's one of the
big things that drives me crazy about

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070

the way the government should do is that
and the way we're gonna solve this is by

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
and the way we're gonna solve this is by
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.149
and the way we're gonna solve this is by
that like maybe not maybe not like are

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
that like maybe not maybe not like are
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.530
that like maybe not maybe not like are
you are you really so sure that you're

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
you are you really so sure that you're
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.700
you are you really so sure that you're
paying attention to what the fuck is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
paying attention to what the fuck is
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.639
paying attention to what the fuck is
going on we're flying through space like

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
going on we're flying through space like
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.350
going on we're flying through space like
we're on a spaceship if the spaceship

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
we're on a spaceship if the spaceship
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.520
we're on a spaceship if the spaceship
was a hundred feet wide you'd be

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
was a hundred feet wide you'd be
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.529
was a hundred feet wide you'd be
freaking the fuck out right now the only

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
freaking the fuck out right now the only
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.729
freaking the fuck out right now the only
reason why you're not freaking out is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
reason why you're not freaking out is
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530
reason why you're not freaking out is
because it's like thousands of miles

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
because it's like thousands of miles
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420
because it's like thousands of miles
but it's still a spaceship you're on a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
but it's still a spaceship you're on a
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.429
but it's still a spaceship you're on a
spinning fuckin thing and at nighttime

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439
spinning fuckin thing and at nighttime
 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.960
spinning fuckin thing and at nighttime
you could see the space you're flying

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
you could see the space you're flying
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.729
you could see the space you're flying
through and you're spending a thousand

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
through and you're spending a thousand
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.440
through and you're spending a thousand
miles an hour in a circle and you're

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
miles an hour in a circle and you're
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630
miles an hour in a circle and you're
floating around this giant nuclear

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
floating around this giant nuclear
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.270
floating around this giant nuclear
explosion and that's around other bigger

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
explosion and that's around other bigger
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.610
explosion and that's around other bigger
rocks that are flying behind you and gas

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
rocks that are flying behind you and gas
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.750
rocks that are flying behind you and gas
giants and then other galaxies and other

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
giants and then other galaxies and other
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.580
giants and then other galaxies and other
universes and on and on and you're just

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
universes and on and on and you're just
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.410
universes and on and on and you're just
hurtling through it while you're worried

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
hurtling through it while you're worried
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360
hurtling through it while you're worried
about what's on TV and why the Walking

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
about what's on TV and why the Walking
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.490
about what's on TV and why the Walking

this was let's say put yourself in a
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.839
this was let's say put yourself in a
position where this really was a dream

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849
position where this really was a dream
 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.849
position where this really was a dream
and you had a lucid dream where you're

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859
and you had a lucid dream where you're
 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.740

going to sleep at night and you were
saying you would worry about all of

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
