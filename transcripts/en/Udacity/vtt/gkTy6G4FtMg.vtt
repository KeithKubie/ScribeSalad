00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a look. Your intuition

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.980
may be telling you that the second rule, which

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
is more specific, should be faster because well, it's

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.040
more precise, but actually the opposite is true. The

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.030
first rule tells us that whenever we encounter an

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.030
h1 tag, we should set the font size to

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.560
16 pixels. Pretty simple. The second rule is trickier.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.280
First, it says that we should match any paragraph

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.040
tag, like the one we have here. But then, once we find

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.820
the paragraph tag, we should walk up the DOM tree and only

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.690
apply this rule if there's a div element as its parent. As

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.420
a result, this more specific tag actually requires more work from the browser.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.870
&gt;&gt; Hm, oh wow, so the more specific rule is more

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.550
expensive because it has to traverse more nodes in the DOM tree.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.207
&gt;&gt; That's right. Exactly. That said, before you go all crazy and rewrite all

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:57.581
of your rules, measure first. Chances are

00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.720
selector matching is not your performance model link.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.600
&gt;&gt; So, I shouldn't worry about it?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.860
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't say that. Measure first, optimize second.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.840
And speaking of measure, let's take a look at dev tools.
