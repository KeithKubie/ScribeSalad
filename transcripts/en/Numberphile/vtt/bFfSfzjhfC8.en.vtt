00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so this
morning, Brady sent me an

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.460
email, and he said, check this
out-- something has happened.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.250
And so, on Sunday, it
was the Super Bowl.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.510
I didn't know that myself.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.280
I think Brady-- did you know
it was the Super Bowl?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.660
BRADY HARAN: Yes, I stayed
up and watched it.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.070
I love the Super Bowl.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.050
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK, OK.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.900
Apparently, we have
two conferences.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.980
We've got the NFC, National
Football Conference.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.150
We've got the AFC, the American
Football Conference.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.195
And so every year they have a
team from each conference, and

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:26.850
they play the Super Bowl.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.250
OK.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.590
So for the last 14 years-- the
previous 14 years-- the team

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.890
that represents the NFC have
won the coin toss.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.390
Well, it's certainly,
certainly a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.110
really unlikely event.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.010
Now unlikely events happen.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.530
So last Sunday, this winning
streak of 14 wins that they

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.720
had so far was broken.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.810
So last Sunday, it was the AFC,
the team that represented

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.170
the AFC, was it the Patriots?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.110
The Patriots won
the coin toss.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.990
So that's breaking our streak
of 14 successive wins.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.450
BRADY HARAN: They then did
lose the game, though.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.950
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's
a shame isn't it?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.201
Never mind.

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:08.310
OK, yeah, enough of this
football stuff.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.820
Right, let's do some maths.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.850
Right, so we're going to work
out how long it would take to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.560
get that streak of
14 in a row.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.890
14 wins in a row.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.940
Right?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.850
So to make this a bit easier,
we're not just going to dive

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.820
into the full thing.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.180
We're not going to work
out 14 wins in a row.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.550
We'll make this a bit easier.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.200
We're going to look at getting
3 wins in a row.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.070
If we can work this out,
if we can understand

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.410
it, the rest is easy.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.180
Let's work out how long
it would take to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.080
get 3 wins in a row.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.340
OK.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.970
So this is the odds of winning
the coin toss,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.990
not the game, no.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.670
I could see Brady doing this.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.990
I thought he was giving
me the thumbs-up.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.690
He was like, yeah, good.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.210
Right.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.420
What I want to look at first
is-- let's look at getting 3

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.810
wins or winning 3 coin
tosses in a row.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.130
OK, so first of all, what's
the probability of getting

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.750
those 3 wins?

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.870
This is quite easy.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.235
I think a lot of people can
do this themselves.

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.720
We're looking for
3 wins in a row.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.340
A win--

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.650
a probability of winning
the coin toss is 1/2.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.590
So, to win one time, is 1/2.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.740
To win again, you times
it by 1/2 again.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.800
And then to win 3 times,
you times by 1/2.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.120
OK.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.410
So 1/8 of the time, you could
win 3 coin tosses.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.595
What about a streak of
4, a sequence of 4.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.630
Because that means you've lost
and then you've won 1.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.320
So it's loss, win, win, win.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.380
Now what's the probability
of that?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.700
Again, not too hard
to work out.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.090
1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/16.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.280
1/16 of the time you're going
to get a sequence of 4 games

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.790
that ends with win, win, win.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.280
Or 4 coin tosses.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.800
So what we're going to work out
is the average sequence--

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.340
the length of the average
sequence that ends

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.310
with win, win, win.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.110
What if it was a sequence
that was 5?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.850
That means it could be like
loss, loss, then ends with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.960
win, win, win.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.320
Or you could have a win, then
a loss, win, win, win.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.275
For each of those, the
probability is 1/32.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:18.090
But there's 2 of them, so
altogether, if your sequence

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.360
is 5 games long, it's
2 out of 32.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.770
So if you want to work out the
probability of the average

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.880
sequence length, what
you do is you take

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.300
the sequence lengths--

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.600
each situation-- and multiply
them by the probability of

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.970
getting that situation.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.690
Now this is our waiting time.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.450
This is how long we want to wait
for our win, win, win.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.720
It looks like you would have
to work out every single

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.320
possible situation, every
possible probability for that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.530
situation, multiply
them all together.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.000
That would give you
your average.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.905
That would include all possible
situations like win,

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:58.500
win, loss, loss,
win, win, win.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.550
Then it would be win, loss,
win, loss, win,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.730
loss, win, win, win.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.200
So every single possible
situation.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.740
And that does not
sound like fun.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.510
So there's a really clever
way to do this, and

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.965
this is really clever.

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:11.420
Right.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.630
I'll show you how to do this.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.030
I'm going to draw you a little
picture for this.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.640
So let's say you lose
here and then win.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.640
Or lose and win.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.890
Or lose here and win.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.920
OK, I've drawn you
a little picture.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.190
So the probability of losing is
1/2, losing your coin toss.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.590
Probability of winning
the coin toss is 1/2.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.700
Let's say we're looking for the
time we have to wait to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.110
get these 3 wins in a row.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.050
This call that t.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.530
Now in the first case,
I can toss my coin.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.250
And if I lose, I'm back
to square one.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.400
I've tossed a coin, and then I'm
back-- oh, I have to do it

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.140
all over again.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.620
So the length of
that sequence--

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.020
I've tossed a coin.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.680
Then I'm back to square one.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.990
Back to square one means
I'm back to this.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.150
I'm back to waiting t games
for my sequence of 3, t.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.340
That's how long I would have
to wait if I lose.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.490
And the probability
of losing is 1/2.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.790
Times it by the probability,
that's what you get.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.620
The other situation is this.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.470
You could win, then lose,
and back to square one.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.510
Win and lose probability
is 1/4.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.610
And then you're back to square
one, where you've tossed it

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.240
once, you've tossed the coin
twice, and then you're back to

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.500
square one.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.720
That means you have
to wait t again.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.640
That's how many games
you have to wait.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.460
Or the third situation
is you win, you win,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.770
and then you lose.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.500
And you're back to square one.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.040
So what's the probability
of that happening?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.650
That's 1/8, then 3 coin tosses,
back to square one,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.600
means 3 plus t.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.260
Or, and the final situation is
you get it straight away--

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.810
win, win, win.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.900
And the probability
of that is 1/8.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.560
And how long did
I have to wait?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.490
3 coin tosses, win, win, win.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.990
And you've got your
3 wins in a row.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.360
Fantastic.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.900
You solve this.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.600
This is what you do.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.430
You solve this formula.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.960
It's not that hard to solve,
you just multiply that out,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.590
mess around with it.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.210
I can tell you, if you
do you solve it, the

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.260
answer is t equals 14.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.900
This is the average length that
you would have to wait,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.190
the average number of games you
would have to wait to get

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.320
3 wins in a row.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.450
Now if you want to do it in
general, if you want to do it

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.170
for 14, pretty much
the same idea.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.520
The same idea.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.560
But in general, you get this.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:49.550
T is equal to 2 to the power
n plus 1, minus 2.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.760
That is the amount of time you
would have to wait to get n

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.000
wins in a row, n wins.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.870
N is going to be 14 for
the Super Bowl.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.940
In the Super Bowl, it was 14.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.220
So if n equals 14, we're
going to use this.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.450
And I can tell you the answer.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.070
It was--

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.940
32,766.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.980
We would have to play 32,766
games before-- well, that's

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.260
the average anyway.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.330
Before you could expect to
get 14 wins in a row.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.790
That's the average, I mean maybe
it would take longer.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.010
Maybe you'll get it
straight away.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.565
We don't know.

00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:35.300
But on average, it's going
to be about 32,000 games.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.220
Maybe 32,000 years.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.330
BRADY HARAN: It only took 45
Super Bowls for them to get 14

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.270
coin tosses in a row, though.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.930
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah it did.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.380
BRADY HARAN: What happened?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.970
MALE SPEAKER: So unlikely
events can happen.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.610
Unlikely events like
this can happen.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.910
And like I said before, we can
toss as many coins as we want.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.640
It's not impossible.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.270
It's just unlikely.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.690
So this isn't a probability.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.470
What I've worked out isn't
a probability.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.860
This isn't the probability of
winning 14 times in a row.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.760
This is the length of time that
we're going to wait, the

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.360
number of games we're
going to play.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.310
Or the number of coin tosses
we're going to do until we get

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.730
14 wins in a row.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.070
And it's the average number.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.290
And in the case of the Super
Bowl, which happens only once

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.910
year, if you want this to happen
again, then, I would

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.490
expect to wait 32,000 years--

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.680
maybe 32,766 years, even.
