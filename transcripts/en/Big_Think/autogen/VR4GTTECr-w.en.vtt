00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.350
we asked some of the world's top

are the best solutions to those problems
but not only that also tell us how much

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
but not only that also tell us how much
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.470
but not only that also tell us how much
does it cost and how much good does it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480
does it cost and how much good does it
 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.750
does it cost and how much good does it
do now if you say it's gonna cost a

that's a great investment and it makes

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550
that's a great investment and it makes
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.520
that's a great investment and it makes
it very easy for us to understand how we

will but I'm hoping the cold economic
facts can inform that political decision

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020
facts can inform that political decision
 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.980
facts can inform that political decision
so we don't just make the easy feel-good

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990
so we don't just make the easy feel-good
 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.110
so we don't just make the easy feel-good
politically correct decisions but we

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120
politically correct decisions but we
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.670
politically correct decisions but we
actually focus on the things where we

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
actually focus on the things where we
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.260
actually focus on the things where we
can do immense amounts of good first
