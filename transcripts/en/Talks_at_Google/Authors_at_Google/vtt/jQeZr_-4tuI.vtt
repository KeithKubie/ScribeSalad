MIMI KRAVETZ: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.880
Welcome to the Talks
at Google event

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.490
on "Supersurvivors:
The Surprising Link

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.802
Between Suffering and Success."

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.980
In a moment, I'll introduce
you to the authors, Lee Daniel

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.120
Kravetz and David B.
Feldman, but first I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.940
wanted to steal the
floor because I'm not

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.360
only the Googler who's
organizing this event,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.760
but I'm also Lee's wife, and
I've been part of this book

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.310
since the very beginning.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.530
So five years ago, Lee
and I went for a walk,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.080
and he had just
survived his own trauma,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.060
and we were talking
about how he really

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.120
wanted to do something
meaningful in the world

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.460
coming out of that.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.820
And we were also talking about
how every time he told people

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.730
about his experience, we heard
the most incredible stories

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.670
back.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.170
And we wondered
what factors went

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.980
into how somebody
experiences a trauma

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.586
and how they come out of it.

00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.080
And that was really the germ of
an idea that led to this book.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.129
And so, it's so awesome
to be here today

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.350
introducing Lee and Dave to
talk about their published

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.200
book that's out
there in the world.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.010
Lee Daniel Kravetz
has a master's degree

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.450
in Counseling Psychology
and is a graduate

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.420
of the University of Missouri
School of Journalism.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.000
He's held positions at the
VA Palo Alto Health Care

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.330
System, the National Center
for PTSD, Stanford University

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.467
Hospital, and now works at a
private practice in Palo Alto.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.050
He's written for
print and television,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.440
including the New York
Times, Psychology Today,

Huffington Post, as well as
Frontline, NOVA, and Sesame

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.430
Street, which our three-year-old
is thrilled about.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.950
He lives in the San
Francisco Bay Area with me

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.470
and our two very cute kids.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080
David B. Feldman
is considered to be

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.330
among the top experts on hope
in the field of psychology.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.420
He's an Associate Professor
of Counseling Psychology

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.280
at Santa Clara University.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.670
He holds a PhD in Clinical
Psychology from the University

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.910
of Kansas and completed
a postdoctoral fellowship

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.830
in the VA Palo Alto
Health Care System ,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.920
a medical center associated
with Stanford University.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.380
Dr. Feldman is the author
of two previous books

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340
and has written for Psychology
Today and the Huffington Post

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.160
and published numerous
research articles.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.920
He lives in the San
Francisco Bay Area

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.738
with his partner
who's also here today.

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:27.071
DAVID FELDMAN: And adorable cat.

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:31.720
MIMI KRAVETZ: And they
will be in conversation

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.770
with Dan Ariely.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.530
Dan is the James B. Duke
Professor of Psychology

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.460
and Behavioral Economics
at Duke University

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.370
and is the author of
New York Times Best

Sellers, "Predictably
Irrational,"

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.760
"The Upside of Rationality,"
and "The Honest Truth About

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.270
Dishonesty."

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.320
And Dan also works with
us here at Google now.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.060
In the SP&amp;E team in
the Irrational Labs.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.180
It's a great honor to introduce
all three of these gentlemen

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.904
and I'll turn it over to them.

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:07.259
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.300
DAVID FELDMAN: Thank you.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.424
Can you hear me OK?

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:11.590
Is this OK or do I need to
speak more into the mike?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.100
I've got my little lapel thing.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.070
I think what we'll
do is I'll talk

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.880
for a few minutes about the
journey that led us to write

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.890
this book and a little bit
about our process writing it.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.309
Lee will talk a little bit.

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.100
We'll read from the
book for a few minutes,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.280
and then we will take our
positions here on these chairs

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.140
and have a little conversation.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.720
And Dan is prepared to
ask us some questions.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.000
So first of all, it's great
to see so many people here.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.580
I'm told the people tend to
come two or three minutes late

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.810
to these events, and people
were here early, which is great.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.150
Sorry we were a little
late getting started.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.340
I didn't know it, walking into
my Foundations of Personality

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.110
and Psychotherapy class
in the Fall of 2010.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.690
But I was about to embark on a
fun and meaningful and exciting

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.870
journey that would bring me and
Lee up until this very point.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.385
As Mimi told you
a second ago, I'm

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:08.070
a Professor at Santa
Clara University,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.240
just down the street from here.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.866
And I teach one of the most
boring classes on earth,

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:15.740
Foundations of Personality
and Psychotherapy.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.550
This is the class that I think
a lot of students dread taking

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.380
because we go through theory.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.040
It's just a theory
course, and they

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.130
have to take tests
and write papers.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.170
And these people want
to be counselors.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.440
So that's not their thing.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.180
So we talk about Freud, and we
talk about cognitive theory,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.550
and we talk about humanistic
and person-centered approaches

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.350
to how the mind works.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.380
And I try to keep it a little
lively and a little interesting

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.090
so less people will fall asleep.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.230
I didn't know it
walking in that day,

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.060
but it would be one of the most
meaningful groups of students

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.999
that I would ever teach.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.540
It was a fantastic
group of students.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.690
I can see the classroom now.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.300
And seated in the middle,
in the very middle--

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.850
it was a stepped classroom,
and on the second step,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.297
in the very center-- was
a guy named Lee Kravetz.

00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:03.880
And I didn't know
his name at the time

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.430
because I'm the jerk who doesn't
learn students names very

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.990
easily.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.610
I still don't.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.940
What is your name?

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.630
But I would learn it about
three or four weeks later,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.680
when I would give a
lecture on Existentialism.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.180
So for those of you who aren't
familiar with Existentialism,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.110
it is a psychological
perspective, these days,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.030
imported from German philosophy.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.060
People like Nietzsche.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.260
And it has a lot of
German words in it

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.720
that bore the heck
out of people.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.080
So I try to keep students awake
by asking them pesky questions,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.667
and asking them to
do pesky things that

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.000
are designed to make them think.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.670
For instance I ask
them to calculate

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.640
how many years they
have left to live.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.410
And then I ask
them how much time

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.247
they've wasted up
until this point.

00:05:51.247 --> 00:05:53.580
And generally I get-- sort
of like you did right there--

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.200
blank stares in
response to this.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.070
Sometimes people come up and
say it was a meaningful question

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.120
to ask, and it changed
the way that they thought.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.320
But what I noticed is that
Lee started to tear up.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.110
And it's rare in a master's
class in Counseling Psychology

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.840
that someone starts crying
in the middle of a lecture.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.254
Perhaps it was
because it was boring.

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:18.990
I later found out though that
he came across that tear very

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.680
honestly.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.900
As Mimi mentioned, he had
suffered his own trauma.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.810
At the age of 29, Lee suffered
an ordeal with cancer, one

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.610
that he would
eventually win, but that

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.020
made him question whether
he was going to die.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.530
Something that somebody at the
age of 29 shouldn't have to do.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.770
And as a result, he
dramatically changed his life.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.110
He went from someone who was
working in New York as a book

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.380
publicist-- very
convenient when you've just

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.970
written a book-- to
moving out here, getting

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.160
his graduate degree in
Counseling Psychology

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.790
and eventually
becoming an author.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.710
Now this sounds a lot
like our definition

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.820
in the book of what
a supersurvivor is.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.060
Someone who encounters a trauma,
a tragedy, an illness, a loss,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.340
some major adversity
in their life, and then

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.370
not only bounces back
but bounces forward,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.060
often revolutionizing
their life for the better,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.650
and often touching the world
around them in positive ways.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.790
Now I had done,
for years, therapy

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.310
with people who were
suffering from trauma

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.670
and serious medical
illness, and my research

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.840
has all concerned how people
not only bounce back but bounce

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.290
forward in the wake of trauma.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.110
And so this started a series
of conversations between us

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.890
that culminated in a summer
independent study project

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.120
where we worked together,
and Lee ended up

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.150
writing a stunning,
I think 20-page,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.810
paper on some of the factors
that help people to bounce back

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.090
from trauma.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.352
I think it's safe to say
that that 20-page paper,

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:54.810
and that independent
study project,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.020
turned into one of the
most epic independent study

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.770
projects of all time and
eventually this book.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.300
At some point, we were seated
in Nervous Dog Coffee on Mission

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.050
Street in San Francisco, and
we just looked at each other

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.200
and said there's a book here.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.010
And the rest is not
exactly history,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.820
but I will let Lee
catch you up from there.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.879
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Sounds great.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.420
Thanks, Dave.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.130
As we've kind of
talked about, this

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.600
is as much about
other people as it

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.510
is our own personal journeys.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.330
And my experience-- I
was a cancer survivor,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.226
and when I bounced back from
it I became intensely focused

00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:36.309
on the ways that other
people kind of bounce back.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.892
How in the world do
people bounce back

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.780
not only after cancer but all
kinds of crazy experiences

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.740
in their lives.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.070
Everything from natural
disasters to car accidents.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.170
The things we have no
control over to things we do

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.770
have control over.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.590
And then I met Dave, and Dave
is a Professor of Counseling

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.700
Psychology, but he's
also an expert in hope.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.730
And when I met Dave, I knew that
there was a partnership here.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.190
We had to start writing
and working together.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.330
His research has
been the foundation

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.490
of a lot of the
studies that have

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.690
worked toward a
positive psychology.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.470
The study of hope in general
is just fascinating stuff,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.979
trust me.

00:09:14.979 --> 00:09:16.520
I can't even go
there because I don't

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.490
know what I'm talking about.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.573
But Dave does, so you
should talk to him about it.

00:09:19.573 --> 00:09:23.580
But he said to us early on, he
said, yes there's a book here.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.060
We need to expand it.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.210
Beyond cancer.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.850
But also look at all the
different types of trauma

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.600
that people experience.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.620
And we spent months and
months defining and redefining

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.620
what a supersurvivor was.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.810
And this was all
based on the research.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.644
There's 20 years-- two
decades-- of research

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:42.643
that talks about what
we're going to talk about,

00:09:42.643 --> 00:09:43.909
called post-traumatic growth.

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:45.950
We've all heard of
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.580
and the negative side of trauma,
but post-traumatic growth

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.490
is a pretty
spectacular phenomenon,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.990
and it happens quite often,
much more than PTSD, in fact.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.540
And we dove into the
research, and the research

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.520
was fascinating.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.760
We saw things that
were counter-intuitive

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.880
that we'll talk about
a little bit later.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.830
Things that just really
sparked our interest

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.600
about these clinicians, and
researchers, and writers.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.690
And then we started matching
up case studies-- examples that

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.260
mapped perfectly
onto the science.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.460
And that's when we
got to actually meet

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.251
our supersurvivors.

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:23.880
We started with
one or two and it

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.000
expanded to about 150 people.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.882
We pared it down
to 17 for the book,

00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:31.247
but these people were amazing.

00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:33.330
I mean, this was one of
the best parts of our job.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.746
We got to hang out
with people who

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:37.380
had survived remarkable,
remarkable things,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.380
and then gone on to change their
lives dramatically as a result.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.460
We met Asha Mevlana,
who we're going

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.940
to read about in a few
minutes, who went from a cancer

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.840
survivor, like me, but did
something remarkable with it.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.730
We met a genocide
survivor who went on

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.590
to become a
presidential appointee

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.712
and ultimately actually had
an internship here at Google.

00:10:56.712 --> 00:10:59.170
I don't know how I met her.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.180
We met a plane
crash survivor who

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.430
went on to change the airline
industry for the better.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.520
We met a tsunami survivor who
went on to become a rabbi.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.680
A domestic violence survivor who
went on to become a yoga guru.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.454
And they just kept on
getting cooler and cooler.

00:11:12.454 --> 00:11:13.870
And there was
science behind this.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.286
There had to be
science behind it.

00:11:15.286 --> 00:11:18.040
And we found it, and this
is what the book's about.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.870
Each of these stories,
and all the science,

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.214
kind of taught us ways to
live a life worth living.

00:11:24.214 --> 00:11:26.130
I think that's the big
takeaway from our book.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.335
We want people to
learn how to live

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:29.460
a life that's worth living.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.480
You don't need a trauma
to experience that.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.200
And that's one of our
big messages today.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.450
This was a huge collaboration,
so thank you to Mimi,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.590
thank you to Vin, thank
you to Dan Ariely today

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.070
for helping us out.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.455
This is just a
spectacular moment for us.

00:11:44.455 --> 00:11:49.099
And without further ado, we will
start to read Supersurvivors.

00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:50.640
DAVID FELDMAN: So
we're going to read

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.200
a sort of abridged version of
Chapter One which is titled,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.480
"To Survive or Supersurvive."

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.900
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Thank you.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.240
To Survive or Supersurvive.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.950
On the spectrum of
trauma survivorship,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.830
everyone falls somewhere
between hiding under a rock

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.790
and becoming a rock star.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.830
Asha Mevlana lay on a table
in a small examination room

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.920
at St. Vincent Catholic Medical
Center in the West Village, New

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.700
York City, when this thought
first crossed her mind.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.050
She was 24 years old,
dark-haired, and beautiful.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.640
The technology industry
in 2002 was making people

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.270
all over the city rich.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.680
She had a great job at a
startup, an apartment in Soho,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.790
and a pearl-shaped problem
within her left breast.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.960
Asha had already guessed
that it was cancer.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.090
The lab technician's grim
look was merely confirmation.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.110
The defining moment
of her ordeal however,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.570
wasn't the diagnosis.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.480
It also wasn't the
undeniable sensation

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.400
that her life was
spinning out of control

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.210
as she underwent eight
months of chemotherapy.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.680
For Asha, the
defining moment came

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.170
after the doctors announced
that she was cancer-free

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.380
and sent her back
into the world.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.680
While she'd been
facing her mortality,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.030
everyone else had gone on
blithely living their lives.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.480
Her co-workers talked about
the crummy New York weather,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.500
the long lines at Starbucks, and
the finalists on American Idol.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.050
Everyone seemed to place value
in such inconsequential things,

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.800
that she found herself
yearning for a time

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.590
when she did as well.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.840
Life as Asha once knew it simply
didn't make sense anymore.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.360
It seemed empty.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.720
So she promptly
dropped out of it.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.279
I'm not a religious
person, but I prayed.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.820
Just give me a second
chance, and I'm

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.360
going to change my life.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.180
I'm going to do what I'm
passionate about, she says.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.540
DAVID FELDMAN:
Asha is not alone.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.270
According to the
American Cancer Society,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.150
roughly 13 million
people around the world

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.290
are diagnosed with
cancer each year,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.880
a number that is projected to
double in the next two decades.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.220
The journal "Neuroimaging
Clinics of North America"

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.570
provides a similarly
grim outlook,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.700
with a startling 10 million
people worldwide affected

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.410
every year by traumatic
brain injuries.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.150
The harsh reality
of widespread trauma

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.970
becomes even more apparent
once we combine these numbers

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.330
with the World Health
Organization's calculation

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.670
that 50 million
people a year survive

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.660
car wrecks, the UN's finding
that one out of every three

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.480
women will be beaten,
raped, or otherwise

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.160
abused during her lifetime,
and the realization

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.140
that these statistics
cover only a small portion

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.520
of the catastrophes that
befall people every day.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.240
Harvard Medical School Professor
of Psychiatry, Judith Herman,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.690
calls trauma the affliction
of the powerless.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.070
The problem is
we're all powerless

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.990
against the
vicissitudes of fate.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.210
She writes in her book,
"Trauma and Recovery,"

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.000
quote, "traumatic events are
extraordinary not because they

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.180
occur rarely, but
because they overwhelm

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.540
the ordinary human
adaptations to life," unquote.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.600
Depending on the
particular type of trauma,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.080
about a quarter
of survivors will

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.860
fall into post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.950
a painful and often
debilitating condition.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.180
Others will experience
significant depression

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.130
or anxiety.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.680
In the midst of
all this adversity,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.580
it's tempting to become
pessimistic and fall

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.920
into a kind of
fatalistic hopelessness.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.990
It's easy to overlook
the amazing potential

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.940
for resilience in us
all as human beings.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.780
Amazingly, even in
the midst of trauma,

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.780
people continue
to smile, to love,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.110
to celebrate, to
create, to renew.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.320
In making this
observation, we absolutely

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.020
do not mean to belittle the
impact of traumatic times,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.980
or the suffering that many have
endured and continue to endure.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.730
Suffering is real.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.920
But resilience is also real.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.870
It is an incredible
and encouraging fact

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.950
about human nature, that
contrary to popular belief,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.550
after a period of
emotional turmoil,

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.720
most trauma survivors
eventually recover and return

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.030
to their lives.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.900
They bounce back.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.820
And in some cases they do more.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.400
They bounce forward.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.010
And sometimes in
truly remarkable ways.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.690
They refocus their energies on
a new calling, on a new mission,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.610
on a new path, on helping
others who have been victimized,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.300
on education, on legal
reforms, or any number

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.550
of other big goals.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.610
They move beyond
mere resilience.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.540
They transform the meaning
of their personal tragedies

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.020
by making them the
basis for change.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.520
We call these people
supersurvivors.

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:17.600
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: In the
aftermath of her cancer

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.390
diagnosis, Asha paid for
improvisational violin lessons.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.250
Now before surviving
the trauma, Asha

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.710
had no illusions about
making career out of music.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.720
"You mean like
playing for bar tips?

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.180
No, it never crossed my mind.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.510
I was just way too
practical," she remembers.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.586
But that pragmatism didn't
survive the chemotherapy.

00:16:35.586 --> 00:16:37.210
And after working
hard for many months,

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.140
she began playing electric
violin for a few amateur rock

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.700
bands.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.860
Something about this
new life clicked.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.410
Perhaps it was the
unscripted nature

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.980
that, much like
the music itself,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.510
was creative and freeing.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.600
A couple of months later
when a friend invited

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.470
her to visit Los
Angeles for a weekend,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.030
she met a number
of local musicians

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.260
who convinced her she should
get paying gigs out here

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.210
in California.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.370
It would be an enormous risk.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.690
Asha's entire universe
was on the East Coast.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.319
She had no job prospects in Los
Angeles, no income, no place

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.470
to live, and a million reasons
to go back to her old life.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.380
Plus although
proficient in violin,

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.460
she was safely an amateur.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.660
But then again she
was also 28 years old,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.160
one of the younger survivors
of breast cancer she knew,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.910
spiritually damaged, and
more than a little lost.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:28.460
From this perspective,
she had nothing to lose.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.700
DAVID FELDMAN: In the origin
stories of superheroes,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.560
something profound, unexpected,
and often frightening,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.780
transforms ordinary lives.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.330
A massive discharge of radiation
turns a mild-mannered scientist

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.390
into a hulking green avenger.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.030
The murder of another's parents
leads him to don a black mask

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.560
and dedicate his
life to rescuing

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.081
innocent victims of
a maniacal joker.

00:17:50.081 --> 00:17:51.580
By the way, I just
want to point out

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.440
that we broke no
copyrights at all in that.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.520
I bet you can't even figure
out which ones they were.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.940
But one of these scenarios
are closer to reality

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.814
than we think.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.980
According to nearly two
decades of research emerging

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.355
from institutions as far flung
as the University of North

00:18:06.355 --> 00:18:08.670
Carolina Charlotte and
the University of Warwick

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.010
in England, the majority
of trauma survivors

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.190
report some degree
of positive change.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.350
These individuals may
emerge from otherwise awful

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.000
experiences primed
with something

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.050
like x-ray vision, which
allows them to notice value

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.869
and opportunity where they might
never have seen them before.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.660
They may develop inner
strength from having

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.520
lived through an experience
beyond their worst imaginings.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.340
These psychological gains are
known as post-traumatic growth.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.880
But even after experiencing
such inner growth,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.240
most trauma survivors
find their outer lives

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.827
returning to normal.

00:18:41.827 --> 00:18:43.285
According to
research, the majority

00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:46.440
of post-traumatic growth
is internal and private.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.870
It's what psychologists
refer to as perceived growth.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.280
Survivors report that they've
changed for the better,

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.100
and they may feel the benefits
of that change, but outwardly

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.820
their lives don't
look much different

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.890
from before the trauma.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.860
Perceived growth
isn't fake, however.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.650
Though the research
is mixed, some studies

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.540
show links between greater
perceived growth and lower

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.830
emotional distress, as well
as better physical health.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.400
But sometimes people
move far beyond both

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.500
the life-altering negative
effects of trauma,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.990
and the usual outcomes
of post-traumatic growth.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.990
These people don't just grow,
they revolutionize their lives.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.590
They transform and
transcend their suffering

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.620
even while enduring.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.990
These supersurvivors
radically deviate

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.960
from their previous life paths,
often transforming the worst

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.850
thing that's happened
into the best.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.800
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: So Asha
has a kick-ass Viper violin.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.240
It's purple, and the
hourglass-shaped belly

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.790
is cleaved.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.960
Instead of the classic
configuration of four strings,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.940
her fingerboard is
laced with seven.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.830
Rachmaninoff would have
been puzzled but awed.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.440
One afternoon, Asha picked up
her violin from a repair shop

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.660
in downtown LA, and the guy who
had just made her instrument

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.797
said he knew Dee Snider, the
lead singer of Twisted Sister,

00:20:00.797 --> 00:20:03.380
who just happened to be trying
out electric violinists to join

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.442
his new tour.

00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:06.400
Although she knew her
chances were pretty slim,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.150
Asha auditioned.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.160
Two months later, she celebrated
her 30th birthday on a tour bus

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.090
with one of the top metal
vocalists of all time.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.910
One opportunity led to the next.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.400
With startling
swiftness, Asha was

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.090
hired to play alongside
Alanis Morissette,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.540
and after that on a US
tour with Gnarls Barkley,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.660
opening for the Red Hot
Chili Peppers in front

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.800
of 30,000 people a night.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.400
That same year, she
performed at the Grammys.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.420
Jay Z and Mary J. Blige
both tapped her to play.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.560
Her reputation on
the rise, in 2009

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.480
she played regularly
for the American Idol

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.340
band and the Tonight Show.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.182
Asha had been in Los
Angeles 15 months.

00:20:43.182 --> 00:20:44.640
If someone had told
her in New York

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.181
that someday she'd be playing
in front of millions of people,

00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:49.050
she would have
laughed in disbelief.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.597
Yet, she'd arrived at this
place with unusual calm,

00:20:51.597 --> 00:20:53.430
as though somewhere in
the back of her mind,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.120
she always knew
she'd wind up here.

00:20:59.006 --> 00:21:00.880
DAVID FELDMAN: Asha is
one of the many people

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.380
we'll meet in this book who
have dramatically altered

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.750
their lives after suffering
trauma, often discovering

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.520
hidden parts of
themselves or contributing

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.480
to the world in ways they
never thought possible.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.830
But these people
are not superheroes.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.540
At least no more than any
other trauma survivor.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.780
In truth, they aren't
even superhuman.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.480
Their stories betray
their utter humanness.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.120
They're stumbling
and they're grasping

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.328
as they wrestle with the
fundamental questions we all

00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:28.920
face, who am I, what
do I believe in,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.450
and most importantly, how
should I live my life.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.150
There is a lot
that all of us can

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.260
learn from their often
haphazard but beautiful answers

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.710
to these questions.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.310
To be clear, this is
not a book extolling

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.180
the bright side of tragedy,
the silver lining of any cloud,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.190
or the so-called power
of positive thinking.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.360
No trauma is good.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.420
Every trauma involves suffering.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.490
There is nothing inherently
positive or indispensable

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.300
about atrocities, violence,
disasters, or illness.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.540
But given that such events
are sometimes unavoidable,

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.990
it is important to understand
the incredible resilience it

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.000
is possible for
ordinary human beings.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.720
The ability to peer into the
face of tragedy and somehow

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.350
emerge fundamentally
changed and able to impact

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.267
the world in previously
unimagined ways.

00:22:17.267 --> 00:22:19.350
Drawing from research in
the fields of psychology,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.570
psychiatry, sociology,
anthropology,

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.190
and even business, in this book
we explore why and how people

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.230
transform suffering
into personal triumph.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.060
Each chapter focuses on a
particular principle identified

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.540
by social scientists, including
hope, personal control,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.576
social support, forgiveness,
and spirituality.

00:22:37.576 --> 00:22:38.950
But these principles
don't always

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.850
work the way you'd think.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.350
We explore how hope has little
to do with positive thinking,

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.260
and how despite
conventional wisdom,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.950
the disorientation and
groundlessness experienced

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.770
by many people after trauma
can ultimately be advantageous.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.250
We discover why
psychologists think

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.540
that's certain delusions
can be healthy,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.720
why forgiveness is good
for one's physiology

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.200
as well as for the soul,
and why reflecting on death

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.580
can lead to a better life.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.010
Finally, we ask what
implications these stories

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.740
have for the rest of us,
regardless of whether we've

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.930
survived a serious
trauma or are merely

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.230
confronting the setbacks and
difficulties of everyday life.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.870
Asha's cancer was a
transformative and meaningful

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.130
turning point.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.920
It afforded her the
freedom and motivation

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.520
to move beyond her
previous life and build

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.640
a new reality for herself.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.030
Instead of hampering
her, trauma freed her.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.480
But stories like
Asha's are not typical.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.440
While trauma leaves many
people suffering, lost,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.680
and searching to
reclaim their lives,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.890
Asha's experience seems to have
provided her with direction.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.530
In this book, we discover why.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.870
Thank you.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:53.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.650
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
And we were just

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.644
notified that apparently there
are books in the back for sale.

00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:58.810
If anybody would like those.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.435
DAVID FELDMAN: So
we'll take our places

00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:03.010
and we'll welcome Dan to
the stage-- Dan Ariely--

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.710
and we'll start a conversation.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.550
DAN ARIELY: So if
anybody has questions,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.970
feel free to ask as well.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.780
Let me start by asking
you, how did you

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.220
get the people you interviewed?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.020
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: So
it started very simply.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.980
People who had survived cancer,
people I'd met, had said to me,

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.180
hey, you know you
should meet somebody.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:27.950
And we met Asha.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.350
She was actually the very
first person that we met.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.030
And Asha said, ah no, no, no,
no, I'm not a supersurvivor,

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.520
you should talk to my friend.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.572
And I was like, oh OK.

00:24:35.572 --> 00:24:37.280
So then she put me
touch with her friend.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.650
And then Dave would meet
people the same sort of way.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.660
And then, it took us from
individual points of contact

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.240
to major organizations.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.050
We spoke to Desmond
Tutu at some point.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:51.180
We spoke to people who have
appeared on the world stage

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.250
and made major, major
changes to the world.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.210
That was kind of how
it started, and it just

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.100
started spiraling
after that point.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.820
It was a wonderful experience.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.340
DAVID FELDMAN: And
we were looking

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.230
for particular cases that
would exemplify the research.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.620
We started by really
diving deeply,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.020
as Lee said in his
opening, into the research

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.440
and finding out
what do the hundreds

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.904
and hundreds of studies
out there say about what

00:25:20.904 --> 00:25:23.320
helps people to bounce forward
after trauma and experience

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320
post-traumatic growth.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.650
And so when we went looking,
we went looking particularly

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.700
for case studies that
would exemplify that.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.451
So the foundation was
really the research,

00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.241
and then we tried to
put flesh on the bones

00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:35.700
and make the book
more interesting

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.741
by saying here's what this
looks like in reality.

00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:39.340
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Yeah, it was fun.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:44.270
DAN ARIELY: And so if you
think about supersurvivors,

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.240
how much of it is
about the individual's

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.345
inherent characteristics
versus something

00:25:50.345 --> 00:25:52.510
that happens to them
in the environment.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:58.720
So for example, Asha,
that you mentioned,

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.700
it sounded like she
had good luck, as well.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.380
So you could imagine
a world in which

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.620
she tried to play
the violin-- and I

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.240
guess the vast majority
of violin players

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.420
have a miserable
professional career.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.970
They end up doing
something else.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.469
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
I'm one of them.

00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:20.100
DAN ARIELY: So you have
to wonder how much of it

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.150
is the individual?

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.380
How much of it is luck?

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.280
How much of it is risk taking?

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.960
If you look at
everybody here, do you

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.640
think there would be a way for
you to talk to everybody here

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.030
and identify whether they
would, in principle, be

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.070
supersurvivors?

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.797
Like is this
something about them.

00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:39.130
DAVID FELDMAN: Boy, there's
a lot of questions in there,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.990
let me see if I can take
them sort of one at a time.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.780
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: They're
all great questions.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.120
DAVID FELDMAN: They're
all great questions.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.890
First of all, I'm
not sure that there

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.870
is anything-- The
question we often get

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.720
is, are we talking about
immutable traits here?

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.960
There are just people who are
supersurvivors and will become

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.630
supersurvivors if
they encounter trauma,

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.320
and then people that won't.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.115
And that's not what the
research seems to say.

00:27:03.115 --> 00:27:05.490
Although the research seems
to say that there are certain

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.400
things, like being a
little more extroverted,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.240
having certain kinds
of social skills,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.290
that tend to elevate your
likelihood of growing from

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.800
trauma a little bit,
actually it's other things,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.830
things that we all have
the opportunity to do,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.040
things like taking
a hopeful outlook,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.800
being a realistic thinker,
cultivating social support--

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.580
turns out that social support
and noticing and taking

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.850
advantage of social support
networks is extremely

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.730
important-- rebuilding one's
worldview in a certain way

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.990
after trauma-- I'm sort
of glossing over these--

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.410
but these are all things that
I don't think are immutable

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.310
traits-- something
about the person--

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.840
but are principles that
anyone can exemplify.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.150
That's what the research says.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.730
Now when we talked to
the supersurvivors, one

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.410
of the things that we noticed
was this incredible humility,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.050
that a lot of them said,
look, don't present me

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.490
as a superhuman person.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.150
Present me as an
ordinary person who

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.530
discovered a new way of
living through trauma.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.280
And all of them wanted to
make sure that in the book

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:13.220
we got across this idea that
anyone can be a supersurvivor,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.030
and in fact, you don't
have to wait for trauma

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.690
to wake you up to
begin to really pursue

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.424
your dreams and your goals.

00:28:22.424 --> 00:28:24.090
DAN ARIELY: But some
of those attributes

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.430
that you described, do seem
like individual traits.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.860
Like your ability to have a
nice social network, right?

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.550
Somebody who's an introvert
and doesn't like people

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.740
will inherently have a
harder time with this.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.490
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Well it's interesting.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.230
We actually spoke to-- anybody
here know Jane McGonigal?

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.410
Heard of her?

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.650
So Jane, when we spoke to
her about social support,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.044
she identifies herself
as an introvert.

00:28:51.044 --> 00:28:51.960
DAN ARIELY: She's not.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.340
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Yeah, well
she wears pink and glitter,

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.740
but it's interesting because
she identifies, self-identifies,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.132
as an introvert.

00:29:00.132 --> 00:29:01.590
DAVID FELDMAN:
Let's say who she is

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.940
for those people who don't know.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.270
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: So
Jane McGonigal was a gamer.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.370
She creates games.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.440
And she had a
traumatic brain injury.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.890
A very odd traumatic
brain injury.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.900
She was cleaning her house,
and she reached up real fast

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.260
and hit her head on a drawer.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.760
DAVID FELDMAN: She was repairing
her printer, so be careful.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.380
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Yeah,
don't let that happen.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.500
So she hurt her head.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.656
And you know she had a
traumatic brain injury.

00:29:23.656 --> 00:29:24.530
She had a concussion.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.980
Most people recover
from concussions.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.320
She was having a
hard time with that.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.490
And she felt very isolated.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.000
She stayed in her apartment.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.360
She didn't want to leave.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.620
The people who tried to
come in and help her,

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.830
she kind of pushed away.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.100
She wasn't getting out.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.140
And so what she
did was she created

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.300
a game called SuperBetter.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.130
And with this game--
It was for anybody

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.630
who had-- it started
out with people

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.640
who just had traumatic brain
injury who were shutting

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.040
themselves in but still
wanted that connection.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.930
So they would go online.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.870
They would each give
each other tasks.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.610
And if they achieve
these tasks--

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.660
And these tasks
were very simple,

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.390
like walk around the
block and then come home,

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.052
look out the window for five
minutes, give your Mom a call,

00:30:06.052 --> 00:30:06.760
things like that.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.551
But every time you do
that, you get points.

00:30:08.551 --> 00:30:13.130
And she felt-- she perceived-- a
certain level of social support

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.100
that may or may not have
actually been there.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.345
And that really helped
her tremendously.

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:18.820
And it's helped a lot of
people as a result as well.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.653
DAVID FELDMAN: I think
the interesting thing

00:30:20.653 --> 00:30:23.070
about this story, is here's
somebody who credits herself,

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.361
whether you believe it or
not, with being an introvert.

00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:28.800
And in fact, at that point in
her life felt very withdrawn.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.190
She found a way, a
creative way, to reach out.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.900
And that is what we find with
a lot of the supersurvivors.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.420
That, whether or
not they necessarily

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.090
look like supersurvivors
before, they discover

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.900
new parts of themselves, they
discover ways of reaching out,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.790
they discover new
goals, they connect

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.950
with their values
in a way-- maybe

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.380
values that were partly sort
of covered over beforehand--

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.030
and they change in certain ways.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.280
To answer your question.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.655
I mean you said a lot of these
seem like personal traits.

00:31:01.655 --> 00:31:02.900
They are.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.240
I study hope.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.510
And at first scientists-- I
mean hope has of course been

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.490
a philosophical and religious
topic for millennia--

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.040
but at first when
scientists started

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.690
to study this
about 50 years ago,

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.960
they treated it like hope
was a personality trait.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.620
Either you were
a hopeful person,

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.610
or you were a less hopeful--
a hopeless-- person.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.430
And it turns out,
that my own research,

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.065
that I've done during
the past 10 years or so,

00:31:28.065 --> 00:31:30.190
has shown that hope, this
thing that people thought

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.400
was a trait, is
actually very malleable.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.800
That if you put people
through a 90 minute workshop

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.300
to teach hopeful
thinking skills,

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.716
that they can dramatically
change the way that they think.

00:31:38.716 --> 00:31:41.800
And you see effects from
that three to six months

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.110
down the road in
terms of their mood,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.080
in terms of their ability
to accomplish goals,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.700
in terms of-- if you do it on
college students-- in terms

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.929
of their GPA rising.

00:31:50.929 --> 00:31:52.470
So I think a lot of
these things that

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.340
seem to be immutable traits
are actually very mutable.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.690
DAN ARIELY: Just as a
question for the audience.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.630
How many of you think that if
something terrible happened

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.459
to you, that you would change
your life in positive ways.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:09.750
How many of you think that
you would be supersurvivors?

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.816
DAVID FELDMAN: Or something
like a supersurvivor?

00:32:15.816 --> 00:32:18.815
DAN ARIELY: How many don't know?

00:32:18.815 --> 00:32:20.190
And how many think
that you would

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.575
be just a plain old survivor?

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:36.430
Do people have a sense
of what they will be?

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.030
So people here have some
kind of thing intuition

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.535
of whether they would
be better off or not.

00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:44.410
DAVID FELDMAN: That's
a really good question.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:45.880
DAN ARIELY: And is it
possible that the people who

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.589
think that they--
those of you who

00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:50.130
think you'll be a supersurvivor,
that you just take more risk

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.932
and therefore have a higher
chance to experience a trauma?

00:32:53.932 --> 00:32:55.640
DAVID FELDMAN: Let me
take a stab at that

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.430
and then I'll turn
it over to Lee

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.400
because I know he wants
to talk about risk.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.657
If I know you well enough.

00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:07.155
I don't know the answer
to that question,

00:33:07.155 --> 00:33:08.860
and I think we just need
to put it out there.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.193
I don't think anybody knows
the answer to that question.

00:33:11.193 --> 00:33:13.300
That's a fascinating
research question, and one

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.030
that I'd love to
do actual work on.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.340
Can people who end
up supersurvivors,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:24.380
can they prospectively predict
whether they will or not.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.360
People do have an ability
to assess, to self-assess,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.080
their own level of
some of the traits,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.740
or characteristics,
or principles

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.890
that we're talking about.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.300
I mean you all can ask yourself
right now, how good am I

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.130
at achieving my goals?

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.690
How honest am I with myself
when something bad happens?

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.870
Or do I tend to practice denial?

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.170
Do I tend to paint a
smiley face over things

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.250
rather than accept them?

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.530
How good are you at acceptance?

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.880
How quickly do you snap back
from problems, daily problems,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.190
when they occur in your lives?

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.660
How well do you cultivate
your social support network?

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.080
How good are you at reaching
out and asking for help

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080
when you really need it?

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.550
Or are you the
kind of person who

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.540
doesn't like to ask for help?

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.201
I think you can self-assess
some of these characteristics,

00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:11.659
and to the extent that those
self-assessments are accurate,

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.670
and generally
people's are, I think

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.190
you could predict for yourself.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.642
But whether just asking
it is a prediction,

00:34:17.642 --> 00:34:18.850
it's an interesting question.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.600
DAN ARIELY: Is there
like a little trauma,

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.395
we can just try out and see--

00:34:22.395 --> 00:34:24.270
DAVID FELDMAN: So what
do we do to you today?

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.620
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Yes seriously,

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.080
who wants a traumatic
brain injury,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.360
I can help you with that.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.610
DAVID FELDMAN: Right, yeah,
we've got a bat somewhere.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.639
So the research shows that 50 to
80% of people-- a lot of people

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:43.159
don't believe this statistic
when we say it, but it's true.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:47.570
In worldwide surveys,
epidemiological surveys,

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.820
with 10s of thousands
of participants,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.699
we know that 50 to 80% of
people during their lifetime,

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.790
at some point, will
suffer a trauma.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.569
50 to 80%.

00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:57.360
And we're not talking
about little traumas,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.859
we're talking about
the big things--

00:34:58.859 --> 00:35:02.690
natural disasters,
major victimizations,

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:08.630
physical traumas,
assaults, et cetera.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.440
And only about 20 to 25%, as
we said, end up with PTSD.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.920
The majority bounce back.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.180
So I think the majority
of us-- and that's

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.680
not to say that
PTSD is unimportant,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.680
it's extremely important as
a topic, and people with PTSD

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.990
deserve treatment and
the topic deserves

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.930
a lot of conversation--
but 50 to 80%

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.604
of people in the
aftermath of trauma, grow.

00:35:30.604 --> 00:35:32.020
So I think it's
actually something

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.410
that we all have built in
to us to a certain degree.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.281
DAN ARIELY: Don't develop PTSD
is not the same as growing?

00:35:37.281 --> 00:35:37.780
Absolutely.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.400
And these are not
mutually exclusive either.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:39.525
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Right, that's

00:35:39.525 --> 00:35:40.450
the other thing, they're
not mutually exclusive.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.370
DAVID FELDMAN: Sometimes,
it's in fact, well

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.310
you can speak to this.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.690
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Oh sure.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.190
Sure.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:50.540
I mean we interviewed-- One
of the subjects in our book

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.800
survived genocide.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.030
And she did remarkable
stuff afterwards.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.580
She really bounced forward.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.090
She worked with Oprah Winfrey
at the Leadership Academy

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.380
for Girls, as a
presidential appointee

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.110
to the United States
Holocaust Memorial

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:07.630
Museum with her hero,
Elie Wiesel, on and on.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.550
But when you talk to
her, she still tears up.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.370
She still is quite fearful.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:18.040
She displays a lot of the
negative effects of trauma.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:24.230
And that really points out
that these things are not

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.926
mutually exclusive, that
many times, often times,

00:36:26.926 --> 00:36:28.800
the negative effects
and the positive effects

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.150
happen at the same time.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.802
And to the point
though about-- We

00:36:34.802 --> 00:36:36.635
talk in the book a
little bit about delusion

00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:38.200
and taking chances.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.750
So one of the
things we found was

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.500
that most of the
people in the book

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.520
had something that we
called, grounded hope.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.660
And so grounded
hope-- It's two parts.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.250
The first part is you look
at the situation you're

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.930
in with eyes wide open.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.760
Don't paint a
smiley face over it.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.040
This is the circumstance
that I face.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.980
There's no getting around the
fact that I've lost my vision.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.470
There's no getting around the
fact that I've lost a limb,

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.760
or that I have
experienced this trauma.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.310
That's the grounded part.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.830
The hopeful part is looking at
the things that you can change.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.230
And we found somebody--
There's a man in our book,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.460
his name is Casey-- it's
actually his birthday today,

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.370
so if you're watching
Happy Birthday--

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:23.020
but he survived a car accident
where he lost one of his legs.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.130
And today he's one
of Hollywood's most

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.540
sought after stuntmen.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.284
He's been blown up 50, 60 times.

00:37:28.284 --> 00:37:30.700
DAVID FELDMAN: His specialty
is getting his leg blown off.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.260
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: It is.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.990
It's really great.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.750
DAVID FELDMAN: Which
makes a lot of sense.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.120
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
It's wonderful.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.570
You have aliens ripping it off.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.150
You have police officers
shooting his leg off.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.135
It's actually really
harrowing stuff.

00:37:40.135 --> 00:37:41.510
When we asked him
what it was, he

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.710
said he feels like-- he
thought he could do this.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.690
He had this delusional idea,
this slightly delusional idea,

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.960
that he could do this
and be safe at it.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.540
And many people who
become supersurvivors

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.320
have this idea, this
sense of confidence,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.710
that they can try
many different things.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.010
And one or two of
them will work out.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.980
Many of them don't.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.771
And that's the important
thing to note too.

00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:05.610
Failure is part of
this whole equation.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.150
Goal disengagement is
part of this equation.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.580
But goal re-engagement is
also part of the equation,

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.897
and people try new things.

00:38:11.897 --> 00:38:13.980
DAVID FELDMAN: Let me fill
in a little more there.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.680
One of the things that Casey
said, which is amazing,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.580
is he said, look I feel
like-- and this is something

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.829
we saw in a lot of
our interviews--

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:24.370
I feel like I've lived through
the worst thing I can possibly

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:24.675
imagine.

00:38:24.675 --> 00:38:25.440
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
That's right.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.330
DAVID FELDMAN: He
was pushing a car

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.320
by the side of the
road, that had broken

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.750
down-- he was 19 years old--
and a drunk driver careened

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.639
into the rear bumper,
ripping one of his legs off.

00:38:36.639 --> 00:38:38.680
He said, I feel like I've
lived through the worst

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.270
possible thing
that I can imagine.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.390
Nothing else is scary.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:45.590
And now I am willing
to open myself

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.550
up to trying a lot of new things
and taking some risks because I

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.190
know I can survive it.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:53.771
And that willingness
to take risks,

00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:56.270
I think what some people would
call that slightly delusional

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.790
sense that I can
handle anything,

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.590
actually is what has enabled
him to be incredibly successful.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.006
DAN ARIELY: So
this sounds like it

00:39:03.006 --> 00:39:05.760
fits with the research on luck,
that basically says that there

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.890
are lucky people and there
are non-lucky people,

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.545
and lucky people are
not better at roulette,

00:39:10.545 --> 00:39:12.190
they just try more things.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.340
DAVID FELDMAN: Right.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:12.460
Exactly.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.251
DAN ARIELY: They try
at least a little bit,

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:15.880
and something seems
to be going well,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.046
and then they keep on doing.

00:39:17.046 --> 00:39:19.880
And some people just
don't try as much.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.870
But it opens another
question, which

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.830
is, what is the
cause of the trauma?

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:28.040
So if you think about a
trauma like a car accident,

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.920
it's a one-time trauma.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.980
It's caused by a one-time event.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.620
And then on the hand,
there are things

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.090
like learned helplessness.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:37.670
Right?

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.250
There are experiences
of somebody

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.630
who's being abused
for a long time.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.420
The environment
is unpredictable.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.460
They don't have control
over it, and so on.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.170
Do you find differences
between the type

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:54.560
of-- If it's about the
willingness to take risk,

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.220
is learned helplessness going
to lead to less willingness

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.990
to take risk.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.480
And one-time events are just
going to give us more courage,

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.080
then what else can happen?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.610
DAVID FELDMAN: So
there's a lot there too.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.970
So let me see if I can
take the first part.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.680
There are certainly
different kinds of trauma.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.160
And the type of trauma
makes a big difference

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.160
as to what the outcome will be.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.550
So for instance, we know that
for one-time traumas that

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.970
are non-personal, so they're not
perpetrated by an individual,

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:28.780
it's a freak event-- a
fire or an earthquake--

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.290
those are a lot less traumatic.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.580
People have a lower degree of
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.950
And they have a
higher level-- they

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.980
tend to grow more as a result
of those sorts of events.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.670
Things that are
personal traumas--

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.910
so we're talking
about rape here,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.900
we're talking about
personal abuse

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.590
by someone else-- these
are more traumatic.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.730
They tend to lead to
higher rates-- combat

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.270
is another one-- they tend to
lead to higher rates of PTSD.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.360
The rate of PTSD in combat
is between 30 and 40%,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.120
whereas the mean of all the
rates is more like 20 to 30%.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.920
And those tend to lead
more to learn helplessness,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.320
particularly if
they are repeated.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.692
So when we talk about the
certain percentage of people

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:16.650
who end up with PTSD,
these are all the factors

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.830
that go into it.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.560
And when a person
ends up with PTSD,

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.820
the good news is we have very
good treatments for that.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.150
This is for the vast
majority of people

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.910
not at all a chronic
condition if you

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.500
get appropriate
psychological treatment.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.440
The medicines don't work
as well as the therapies.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.190
Therapies like cognitive
behavior therapy,

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.020
exposure therapy, cognitive
processing therapy,

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.050
tend to work in the
neighborhood of 70% of the time

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.340
to help people to
overcome what you're

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.710
calling the learned
helplessness,

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.620
or learned hopelessness,
that goes along

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.050
with this, along with the
nightmares, and the flashbacks,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.950
and the reliving,
and things like that.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.060
The interesting thing
is that very often,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.130
in the process of
these therapies-- now

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.640
this is documented by
research-- in the process

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.070
of these therapies, people grow.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.010
And often not measured,
but when you do measure it

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.730
you see it, an outcome of
therapy for Post-Traumatic

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.080
Stress Disorder, is
post-traumatic growth.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.860
DAN ARIELY: So it's not
just the individual,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.260
it's the environment and
the kind of injury as well.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.130
And we think that luck also
has something to do with it.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:27.580
You mentioned that this is
not about recommending people

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.540
to start jumping
in front of cars.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.990
That trauma is terrible,
and awful, and so on.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:38.070
To what extent do the
people that you talked to,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.190
have a sense that
there was something

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.160
in this experiences
that was worth it.

00:42:44.972 --> 00:42:46.950
It's terrible to say
I would do it again,

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.260
but they see it as an overall

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.010
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
There's some positive?

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.080
DAN ARIELY: Not some positive.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.080
Some positive I can see.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.414
But they see it overall as
more positive than negative?

00:42:55.414 --> 00:42:57.330
DAVID FELDMAN: Well I
can answer that question

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.330
from the research,
but why don't you

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.540
answer that question from the
actual 17 supersurvivors first.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.920
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Well I
can talk about that even just

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.780
from my own personal experience.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.266
When I was going
through treatment,

00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.140
somebody sent me a "New
York Times" article--

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.270
it was an Op Ed-- that said I
am so glad that I got cancer.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:14.400
It changed my life, and
now I'm doing things

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.050
that I never thought I would do.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.270
Personally, that just
really bothered me.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.000
I thought it was the
worst thing on earth.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.160
And I would give a million
dollars, I'd give $2 million.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.940
I'd give everything
I'd ever earn

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.470
to never have that experience.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.920
Because it was-- as much as I
grew from it-- it was painful,

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.150
it was hard.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.782
And I still think about that
and think about, God, I never

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:38.990
ever want to go through that.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.550
And I hope people I love and
know, don't go through that.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.920
So I think, from a
personal experience,

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.400
I don't relate to that.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.400
And I think, it depends on the
supersurvivors you talk to.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.180
Some of them thought that,
yeah, it actually turned out

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.959
to be a pretty darn
good thing, and they

00:43:55.959 --> 00:43:57.000
wouldn't change anything.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.125
Because that's the way life
was supposed to happen,

00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:00.807
and that's what they do with it.

00:44:00.807 --> 00:44:02.640
And what they did with
it was the only thing

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.240
that they could do with it.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:09.560
Other people-- We met a
guy who was a businessman.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.680
He made millions and
millions of dollars--

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.750
this is a pretty quick
story-- he made millions

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:15.929
of dollars selling jambalaya.

00:44:15.929 --> 00:44:16.720
That's what he did.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.516
He sold jambalaya.

00:44:17.516 --> 00:44:18.640
He went to business school.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.520
DAVID FELDMAN: He was the CEO of
a company that made jambalaya.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.603
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Right.

00:44:21.603 --> 00:44:23.660
I mean he made a lot
of money very fast.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.280
At 9/11, as everybody
did-- they all

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.190
felt the effects, the
vicarious traumatic effects,

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:33.530
even if you didn't know anybody
who died in the attacks.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:38.920
His best friend was the
co-pilot that hit the Pentagon.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.370
And he asked himself,
OK, well, life is short,

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.580
and I want to make the
biggest impact I possibly can

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.110
on the world, what can I do.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.560
He liquidated his assets, sold
this company to his investors

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.540
for a song, and moved into a
parish and became a priest.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.490
And now he lives of
$70 a month, and he

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.430
was one of the first people back
after Katrina hit New Orleans

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.240
and help rebuild that community.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.560
It was a remarkable story.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.799
I asked him, would
you give all this up

00:45:08.799 --> 00:45:09.840
to have your friend back.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.730
And he said, without a doubt.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.650
Without a doubt.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.220
DAVID FELDMAN: And I think
the research coincides

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.350
with what Lee is saying.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.890
If you ask people
who-- that 50 to 80%

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.420
of people who-- grow in some
way as a result of trauma,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.410
was it worth it?

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.130
Was this growth like
a really good thing?

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.310
And people would
always say no, I'd

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.680
trade in this growth to not
have suffered the trauma.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.520
DAN ARIELY: So there are
people like Dan Gilbert, who

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.920
wrote "Stumbling on
Happiness" and a lot of papers

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.970
on this question, and it
includes both a question

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.040
of adaptation and
growth-- And he

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.460
has the opposite perspective.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.345
So when I talk to him
about my own experience.

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:50.377
and I think it's--

00:45:50.377 --> 00:45:52.960
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: You are very
much a supersurvivor I think.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.825
DAN ARIELY: I don't.

00:45:53.825 --> 00:45:55.450
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
That's another sign

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.730
that you are a supersurvivor.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.190
I'm not one but you are.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.070
DAN ARIELY: But he
thinks I'm wrong.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.600
When I say that I don't
think it was worth it,

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.200
he thinks I'm wrong because
of the research on adaptation

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.570
and an inability to do this.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.530
Actually, I have
one more question.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.840
I have the kind of injury
where I have lots of scars.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.075
And I've wondered
whether having scars

00:46:21.075 --> 00:46:29.730
is actually a good reminder of
the differences between being

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.980
injured and not being injured.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.136
So if you think about somebody
who-- I think like you.

00:46:34.136 --> 00:46:36.010
You look in the mirror,
other people see you,

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.301
they don't see anything, and
you don't see to yourself.

00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:41.170
You just have to think
about it or remember it.

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.820
There are some
injuries that you just

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.470
have the constant
reminder of that.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.790
And I can think about
why that would be good

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:51.720
and why it could be bad.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.105
It's a reminder of how
life would look like.

00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:55.480
At the same time,
it's a reminder

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.810
I'm alive, nevertheless,
after some challenges.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.310
DAVID FELDMAN: It's
a good question.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.850
I don't know--
Perhaps, you do know

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.160
of research that supports this.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.350
I can tell you
that when we talked

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.930
to some of the
supersurvivors, particularly

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.200
for the chapter
on social support,

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.310
one of the things
that they said to us

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.200
was-- Because we talked
to two people who

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.170
had brain injuries
for that chapter.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.960
And the thing that's common to
a person who has a brain injury,

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.090
is that they look perfectly
normal, even though they

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.970
may have trouble finding words,
doing math, thinking straight,

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.020
planning.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.320
They may have immense
emotional difficulties.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.980
Lee mentioned Jane McGonigal,
who was very depressed

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.440
and even at one
point was suicidal

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440
and felt very isolated.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.470
And yet her friends
treated her very normal.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.100
So she felt very
alone and isolated.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:52.210
And we did hear people say, I
wish that I had something that

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.480
would make me look
more traumatized,

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.790
so that I wouldn't have to
constantly be explaining it,

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:02.720
so that people would care
for me in a different way.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.260
I don't know what the numbers
are behind that sort of thing,

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.650
but I do think
that that happens.

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:08.900
I've seen that clinically too.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.210
DAN ARIELY: So the
argument is that there

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:14.116
could be an element
of the person thinking

00:48:14.116 --> 00:48:15.990
about their own life,
but there could be also

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.150
the environmental factor,
where other people just

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.790
stop thinking of you as
being sick, or injured,

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.119
or needing help.

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:23.910
DAVID FELDMAN: Yes.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.449
And often will
withdraw their support

00:48:26.449 --> 00:48:28.740
because they look at you and
you look perfectly normal.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.180
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: You're fine.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.090
What do you need my help for.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.923
DAVID FELDMAN: What do
you need my help for?

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.860
DAN ARIELY: So you mentioned
a few times, social support.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.240
It seems to be very important.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:44.020
It's important for lots
of good functioning.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.540
If you were giving a
recommendation for somebody

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:52.440
who's recently injured, in terms
of how to improve their social

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:57.082
networking, outside of switching
from Facebook to Google+.

00:48:57.082 --> 00:48:59.540
DAVID FELDMAN: Of course, that
would be the recommendation.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.897
I mean that's number one.

00:49:00.897 --> 00:49:02.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.690
I can take this, and
it's a counter-intuitive

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.240
recommendation.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.415
So the research, and
certainly our experience

00:49:09.415 --> 00:49:11.540
with the supersurvivors
and my clinical experience,

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.960
shows very clearly that
one of the number one

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.826
protective factors against
the effects of trauma,

00:49:16.826 --> 00:49:18.200
one of the number
one things that

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.920
allows people to bounce back
and even forward after trauma,

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.940
is social support.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.100
But there is a twist here,
and it's a big twist.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:30.330
And that is that it's possible
to be surrounded by people who

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.120
love you and care for you and
want to support you and not

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.320
realize it.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.260
That this is one of
those areas in psychology

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.680
where perception and reality are
actually two different things

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.970
and can be separated.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.250
Trauma is incredibly
alienating, and people

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.720
in the aftermath of
trauma often withdraw.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.910
The majority of people
withdraw to a certain degree.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:52.940
A lot of people believe
no one could possibly

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.730
understand what
they're going through.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.680
So they could literally be
surrounded, we could literally

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.740
be surrounded, by
a sea or virtually

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.150
be surrounded by a
sea of social support,

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.950
and think we're in a desert.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.890
And so the advice
that I would give is,

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.820
notice the support
that is there for you.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.160
It turns out, it doesn't
take a lot of support.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.210
It just takes you noticing
it, being open to it,

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:17.750
and accessing it.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.100
That perception that
people are there for you,

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.840
turns out to be far more
psychologically important

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.550
than having some
huge support network.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:26.320
So notice it.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.409
DAN ARIELY: I guess that's
really good news for Google+.

00:50:29.409 --> 00:50:31.200
DAVID FELDMAN: And
there's lots of research

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.850
that shows that these
sorts of networks

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.230
are effective in helping
people bounce forward.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.000
DAN ARIELY: Great.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.157
Any-- yes.

00:50:39.157 --> 00:50:40.740
AUDIENCE: One of the
things that seems

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.950
to be a recurring theme
in a lot of these stories,

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.070
is that people realize
that they don't

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.290
have to follow the rules
that they were set out

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.420
to have before, and maybe
they have different values.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.290
And I can imagine a lot of
other life circumstances

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:57.420
that have that effect, like
kids go away to college,

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.600
or you get out of prison,
or lots of things that this.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.040
How similar is it
to other things

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.267
that might cause you to
abandon the rules and value

00:51:07.267 --> 00:51:08.100
something different.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.090
DAN ARIELY: So you're
asking, can you

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:12.260
get the benefits
without the costs?

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.160
Can you get like
the life-growth,

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.640
minimizing bodily harm.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.640
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: Thank
God the answer is yes.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.230
I mean, my God,
wouldn't it just be

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:26.909
horrible if you were just living
in this matrix-like stupor

00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:28.950
your whole life, and it
took like getting punched

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:34.220
in the face, with the trauma,
to have this moment of, wake up!

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:34.720
No.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.090
Thank God.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.690
The people we spoke to in this
book, the supersurvivors here,

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:40.920
it took trauma to do it.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:45.150
And many of them told us that
it doesn't have to be trauma.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.280
It just happened to
be trauma for them.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.430
So like you said,
getting out of prison,

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.240
having your kids
go off to college,

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.120
something needs to
shake you out of this.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.980
And in many cases-- the people
in our book, the supersurvivors

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.270
we spoke to-- it
was facing death.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.040
I mean, that had the
most profound effect

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.310
on most of these people.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.851
DAVID FELDMAN: And
by the way there's

00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:10.500
lots of research that
shows people can face death

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.790
without actually facing death.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.116
So there was this
researcher, whose last name

00:52:14.116 --> 00:52:16.470
is Cozzolino, I think
its Philip Cozzolino,

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.620
who did a number of studies
a number of years ago.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.810
And where he had
research participants,

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:26.350
college students mostly, who
don't think a lot about death,

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:27.260
come into a lab.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.080
And he simply had
them reflect on

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.080
how they might die, what
would happen to their body

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.890
after they died,
and then reflect,

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:41.320
like I did in my class, what
has your life exemplified up

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.890
until now, and what would
you like it to mean.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.870
And it turns out that
if you have people

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.250
do that, they get less greedy,
they become more spiritual,

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.490
they become more invested in
their own personal intrinsic

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:58.140
goals, they start to break
some of the rules of achieving

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.290
extrinsic goals that
society wants for them.

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:05.140
We talk a lot about that
sort of thing in our book,

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.124
and say we can learn
from these stories.

00:53:07.124 --> 00:53:08.790
We don't have to have
gone through this.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:12.180
AUDIENCE: I think maybe
like on a social level,

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.770
I think maybe on a Google
scale or something like that,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:19.030
how do you make a society
where people are encouraged

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:22.647
to find their own rules
kind of situation.

00:53:22.647 --> 00:53:24.480
DAVID FELDMAN: That is
too big of a question

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.110
to answer in one minute.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:28.657
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ: But it's
a great cause to look into.

00:53:28.657 --> 00:53:30.240
I would love for
there to be something

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.440
like that, that would
just get them there.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.700
DAN ARIELY: It sound to me
like a Disneyland ride that

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.547
gets you to be a
supersurvivor at the end.

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.130
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
What a great idea.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.546
DAN ARIELY: You
get to face death.

00:53:40.546 --> 00:53:41.720
You get to reflect on life.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.345
DAVID FELDMAN: I do
think to the extent

00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:47.730
that we can put a sense of
control over people's lives

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:53.170
into their hands-- I think,
for instance, that YouTube

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.330
is a wonderful example of
how you're putting tools

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.414
into somebody's
hands to have control

00:53:58.414 --> 00:53:59.580
to be able to achieve goals.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.450
I think to the extent
that we can say,

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.040
here are the controls,
do something with them.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.540
Those are ingredients--
At least in my research,

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.080
to the degree that
people believe

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.950
they're behind the levers
of control and creation,

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:14.020
they tend to feel
more hopeful, and they

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.507
tend to behave in
more intrinsic ways.

00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:18.590
That's a quick answer but
it's a complex question.

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:23.310
DAN ARIELY: And like all good
things-- Thank you very much.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.640
And I just want to say,
on a personal note,

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.570
about twice a week I get
an email from somebody

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.340
who was just injured.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.820
And they ask me questions
about-- They really

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.240
want to ask questions
about their own lives.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.170
Last week I got an
email from an aunt

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:48.240
of a young girl whose jealous
boyfriend spilled acid

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:48.920
on her face.

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.060
So I get lots of these
emails from people

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.580
who are really struggling.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.340
These are people who
just got the injured.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.670
They're in the first step.

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:08.570
I think it's unclear what
kind of path they will take.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.970
And they ask me for some
feedback, some advice,

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.950
some insight into how
life would look like.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:20.530
And lots of time I give
them practical things

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:24.740
in terms of how you find
passion, and interest, and so

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.240
on.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:31.910
But I think your work kind of
gives another dimension to it

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.610
in terms of what are the
elements that you need

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:39.050
to explore, and how do you
get back a feeling of control.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:42.420
And I think the social elements
are incredibly important.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.990
So I thank you very much.

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:48.275
And this was a great book,
and topic, and very important.

00:55:48.275 --> 00:55:49.110
I appreciate it.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:49.310
LEE DANIEL KRAVETZ:
Thank you very much.

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:50.351
DAVID FELDMAN: Thank you.

00:55:50.351 --> 00:55:53.570
[APPLAUSE]
