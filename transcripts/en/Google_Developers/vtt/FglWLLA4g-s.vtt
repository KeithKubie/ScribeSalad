00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, everyone.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.850
We're now at the Web
Sandbox and we're

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.950
going to talk to Paul
about Lighthouse.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.830
Now you may remember, Lighthouse
gives you actionable advice

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.080
for improving your websites.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.110
Paul, come on over here and
show us what this is all about.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.270
PAUL KINLAN: How you doing?

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.742
Yeah, so this is our Lighthouse,
real world lighthouse

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:29.700
that we've got as well.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.250
So Lighthouse is our tool that
helps developers actually fix

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.600
the problems on their sites.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.727
So we open up Chrome,
run Data Tools,

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:38.310
and then we just inspect a whole
bunch of the tools that we've

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.830
got or the problems on the
page and give developers

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.327
actionable advice.

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:44.160
But the problem that
we've got is that we've

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.550
got a lot of different tools.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.070
So this is our
actual central place

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.830
to try and unify
Google's performance,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.650
informational, architectural
tooling story as well.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.175
So should we give it a demo?

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:55.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Yeah, let's do that.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.288
PAUL KINLAN: All right, cool.

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:57.052
So here we go.

00:00:57.052 --> 00:00:59.010
I'll use my site because
it's probably the best

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.900
and I like people
to go to my site.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.090
So what happens, we're
going to enter the URL.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.798
And so basically,
developers at the event

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:11.040
are going to be able to come up,
put their URL in, and then get

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.700
actual real world feedback
about how to improve their site.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.570
So we can press Go
and it goes off.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.114
It runs Lighthouse, it runs
PageSpeed and also WebPageTest.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.280
And we've also got a number
of other different tools

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.530
as well, which we're not
automating today because it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.615
a little bit too much.

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.349
But we want to give developers
an idea of what's happening.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.890
So the first one's already come
through, the page [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.760
inside score.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.730
So the general
mobileness is good.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.937
I'm 99 out of 100.

00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:39.520
And then the Lighthouse scores
have also come through as well.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.090
So I'm doing well in
performance, progressive web

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.520
app-ness, I'm not doing
very well in accessibility,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.250
I need to fix that, and my
SEO is pretty poor as well.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.000
Then if you want a
little bit more detail,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.770
we've got the View
Report button as well,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.920
which will give you a full
detailed report that you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.420
can go and send
back to your manager

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.317
and tell them like, everyone's
just seen how poor our site is.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.150
Let's go and fix it.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.900
Or how good it is, actually,
and give me a raise.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.120
So yeah, that's our
Lighthouse, our PageSpeed.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.052
We've got a numerous
range of different tools,

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.510
and this whole area
is about trying

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.817
to show you what goes where
and how to use it and when.

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:11.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is awesome, Paul.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.530
And I have to admit, I
was kind of expecting 100s

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.742
across the board.

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:16.950
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I know
Dion said the same as well,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.866
and he's going to have
words with me later on.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:19.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:21.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you
so much for showing this.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.680
PAUL KINLAN: Thank
you very much.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.055
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, if
you want to see more videos

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:28.590
just like this, remember to
head on over to g.co/io/guide.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.600
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.510
I'll see you in the next one.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.812
