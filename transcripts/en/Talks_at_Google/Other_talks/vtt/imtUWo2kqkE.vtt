Karen Winfrey: Hi everybody. I'm Karen Winfrey
from the communications team. Glad to have

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.190
you all here and those VC-ing in, welcome
also. We have a really great storyteller and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.810
political reporter here today;John Heilemann,
talking about the best seller "Game Change",

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.119
subtitled "Obama and the Clintons, McCain
and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime", and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419
I assume all of you are listening in because
you felt the same way. It was - it felt like

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:41.430
the race of a lifetime and it was only a year
ago, a little more, that things came to one

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.820
kind of fruition. John, wrote the book with
Mark Halperin. John is here today, on his

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.910
own. He's a longtime business and political
reporter for, uh a lot of well known publications

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.460
like, "The Economist" and "Wired", "The New
Yorker"; and now he is the national political

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.620
correspondent for "New York Magazine". This
book, "Game Change", (and there are copies

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:14.009
in the back here in the Mountain View), um
has been the number one - it was number one,

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.500
number one on the New York Times Bestseller
List for seven weeks which is very good for

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.799
a political book of this sort. And uh John
has been busy touring and Mark too, and uh

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.630
going over a lot of the fresh ground that
the two of them came up with to tell this

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.520
incredible story. So, John's going to talk
and then there will be a little time for question

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.950
and book signing at the end, and we'll end
at noon. So John - [applause]

00:01:44.950 --> 00:02:00.840
John Heilemann: Thank you, Karen. That was
a very loud applause for a very small group

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.709
[laughs from audience] The enthusiasm is always
very high. Thank you for having me come here

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.330
back to one of the many hums in my professional
life. I spent four years in Silicon Valley

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.819
from 1998 to 2002, writing about people whose
degree of ego and vanity and hubris and neediness

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:25.500
is almost as great as those of Presidential
candidates I'm speaking of, high-tech CEO's.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.879
[laughs from audience] Karen is right. The
subtitle of our book was not a mistake. A

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.390
large part of why Mark and I decided to write
the book was because though we'd been covering

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.450
presidential politics for 20 years, off and
on; my case, full straight through, and in

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.689
Mark's case, we thought that this campaign
was pretty extraordinary, and in fact, there

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:50.510
had been a general view about campaign books
which is that it was sort of a dead genre,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.260
that people um-especially in an age of 24/7
news and the blogosphere and cable television,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.670
that everyone knew everything there was to
now about any campaign in real time, and why

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.840
on earth would anybody want to read a book
about campaigns and support the past year

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.590
after it was over. We thought that this campaign
was different and we almost thought that there

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.219
were some mistakes in that analysis of the
news cycle. I'll talk about both of those

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:21.780
real quick. The first was that, you know,
as I say, Mark and I have covered Presidential

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.459
politics for a long time and we had never
seen a race quite like this one. We thought

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.019
it was the best race we'd ever covered and
would possibly ever cover. Every great story

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:39.430
has a couple of things in common and two features,
one of which is great characters and the other

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.819
is a big plot; and in the case of the 2008
campaign, we had both of those things in abundance

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.560
and I think part of the reason that the book
has done well, to the extent that it's done

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.370
well, is because people are in fact still
incredibly interested in all these people.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.239
They are not interesting for politics, like
John Kerry or Dick Lugar, but they are interesting,

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.249
interesting people who could be on the cover
of "People" magazine or Oprah as easily as

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.890
they could be on the cover of "Professional
Quarterly". The Obamas, the Clintons, Sarah

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.569
Palin, of course, John McCain; these people
continue to be big players on the national

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.609
stage. People continue to pay a lot of attention
to them and want to know who they are, what

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.949
they're about, and what they're doing. So,
that was a big factor. We thought those characters

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.620
would be still interesting a year after the
campaign and it turns out they are. Another

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.039
factor of course was the plot which was part
of the reason

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.720
why we called the book "Game Change". There
were a lot of game changing moments, or potentially

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.120
game changing moments in 2008. It was a wild
ride by every standard and we thought that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.819
would also help us and I think again to the
extent the book has been a success, the characters

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:46.050
and the plot are part of the reason why. We
also thought that the analysis of the fact

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.720
that the news cycle was so constant and that
there was so much coverage. In fact, this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.000
race, you know, was certainly the most covered
and arguably the most over-covered race in

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.960
history, that that in fact opened a door for
us rather then closing one-and by that I mean,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.020
you know, we had covered the race as closely
as any one and we'd read all this coverage.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.819
And the fact was that the way that that news
cycle now works, every reporter is now a wiser

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.320
sort of reporter effectively. You are now
having not just do a story every day but do

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.580
multiple versions of the story on the web.
That creates enormous advantages in terms

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.870
of how fast we get the information, it also
creates real strains for reporters who are

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.610
not having the kind of time that they once
did to go back and really excavate what happened

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.290
as things occurred. So you have events that
take place, whether it's Barack Obama winning

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.729
the Iowa caucuses, or John McCain putting
Sarah Palin on the ticket. People are fascinated

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.069
and obsessed with those topics for a few moments
and reporters really fixate on them for 48

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.090
hours and then the circus moves on and they
have to move on with it. And so big questions;

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:52.280
by big questions, I don't mean big philosophical
questions. I mean, just fundamental questions

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.080
that I think not only political insiders want
to know the answers to, but many people who

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.050
were watching this race and talking about
it around watercoolers and kitchen tables

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.740
would ask themselves all the time. Mark and
I had those same questions and we didn't think

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.860
there were really satisfactory answers to
them at all the covers that we'd seen. And

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.050
again when I say big questions and fundamental
questions I mean things like, "How did Barack

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.980
Obama actually decide to run for President?",
"How has a guy who'd only been in the United

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.419
States Senate for about two years, who had
a very thin resume by any stretch, had a last

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.150
name that sounded like Osama and a middle
name that was Hussein, get it into his head

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.340
that he could be the first African American
President?", convince himself. He's not a

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.501
guy who is prone to flights of fancy, be very
cautious in a lot of respects, how did he

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:37.050
get to the point where he thought he could
beat Hillary Clinton? Who was by every stretch

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.720
of the imagination, the odds on favorite and
was seen as being the candidate who was going

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.190
to run away with the Democratic race. That
question, to my mind, had never been answered

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.581
and we thought that that was a rather important
question.You know, what was the relationship

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:55.150
between Bill and Hillary Clinton in the course
of her campaign? Many people had a lot of

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.520
speculative theories about whether President
Clinton had been running her campaign secretly,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.889
whether he actually wanted her to win or was
trying to, in some way, sabotage her. Some

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.310
of these theories were crazy, some of them
were not less crazy, but again I couldn't.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.120
I have even covered the Clintons. Mark and
I both have known both Clintons since 1991

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.110
or 1992 and having covered them for a long
time, I couldn't give you a good answer to

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.950
that question; what role did the President
really play in the campaign? And then of course,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.419
the biggest mystery of all for a lot of people,
which was how did Sarah Palin actually get

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.330
on the Republican ticket? A question, again,
which people obsessed over for 48 hours and

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:36.210
walked away from. So we thought that in fact
if we took the time, which entailed a certain

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:42.400
risk, if we took the time and went back and
did a lot of interviews and did voluminous

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.099
interviews, not only great in number but also
great in the amount of time and effort that

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.199
we'd spent in doing them. We did - we talked
to over 200 people for the book, we did more

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.810
then 300 interviews and those were not follow-up
interviews but were the main interviews we

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.889
did. We did almost all in person and many
of them, virtually all of them, ran at least

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.080
an hour or an hour and a half, and many of
them ran five, six, seven hours and they were

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.050
like conducting oral histories. We had the
advantage of knowing virtually everybody who

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.210
we were writing about in the book, from the
candidates, to the most junior staffers who

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.520
worked for them, and have known them for a
long time. Having relationships with them

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.990
where we could sit down with them in a kind
of considerate way and explain what we were

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.009
trying to do, how the material that we got
from them was going to be used, and there

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:26.009
was - because of the fact that we knew them
so well, they were inclined to trust us and

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:29.979
I think as they started to see the kind of
questions we were asking and the time we were

00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:34.000
taking with the process, they became more
trusting and they had also experienced this

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.990
race in the same way we had. It was kind of
an extraordinary thing; whether they had won

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.870
or lost, or worked for a winner or worked
for a loser, they recognized that this was

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.220
an event unlike most of the things they'd
ever done in politics before and they became

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.529
very much invested in the spirit of the project
that there was a reason to try and get this

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.720
campaign down and to do it in the way that
we were trying to do it and I think that also

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.990
goes to one of things about the book that's
a little different. The thing that I think

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.420
we were a little relentless about it without
trying to do this book, was not to write about

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.450
strategy and not to write about tactics, and
not write posters, and not to write about

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.141
consultants, but to try to write really about
these characters and about the candidates

00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:17.060
and their spouses, and how going through this
process, which is some combination of meat

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.440
grinder and a flash incinerator, how that
process changed them, how they dealt with

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.451
it, how their strengths and weaknesses as
human beings manifested in the course of the

00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:31.519
campaign and how it affected the outcome because
we both believe that it really did. In this

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:36.490
campaign in particular and in the Democratic
nomination fight, even more particular. The

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.050
differences of policy were minimal between
the candidates. Hillary Clinton and Barack

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:45.210
Obama were not competing really on the basis
of big differences in terms of how they would

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.260
govern the country, they were campaigning
largely on the differences of visions, on

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.709
the differences of temperament, and style,
and character. And we felt that one of things

00:09:55.709 --> 00:10:01.800
that were really missing in the lot of coverage
was a really intimate picture of what this

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.110
process was like in the early 21st century
and how these people went through it. And

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:11.170
that's what we set out to do. I think that
there's been, the book produced a fair amount

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.971
of news but beyond the news nuggets in the
book and the things that got headlines that

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:19.779
helped sell the book for sure. You know I
think people who actually sit down and read

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:24.990
the book rather then reading the coverage
of the book, find in all of the portrayals

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:33.860
in the book of much more nuanced and careful
and certainly right up close, kind of a picture

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.300
of all these people then they've gotten in
a lot of the other coverage and some of that

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.220
reflects badly on the candidates, and some
of it reflects really well on the candidates

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.519
and I think all of them show in the book the
real mix that affects and afflicts, in some

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:51.380
ways, all politicians...between the high nobility
of their polling and a lot of the personal

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:57.920
qualities that sometimes trip them up. I will
try to do two things over the course of the

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.459
next half an hour, based kind of on experience
of having done a fair number of these talks

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:10.290
in the last couple of months. One is talk
just a little bit about the core of the book

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.060
which I say is the candidates and their spouses,
but in particular talk about a handful of

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.529
the relationships that are the dominant relationships
in the book and that again was a real focus

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:24.510
for us, trying to hum in on the relationships
among the candidates; both as rivals, as in

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.010
some cases, as collaborators or as allies,
and talk about some of the surprising things

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.740
that we learned in the course of reporting
the book. And then I'll try to talk a little

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.149
bit more specifically about Obama because
I think a lot of people have asked over and

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:41.560
over again what do we learn from the book
about where he is now. And the book is kind

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.450
of scrupulously non analytical in a way. Though
Mark and I both get paid to do a lot of political

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.950
analysis, we try to tell this very much as
a story, just a straight narrative. But there

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.640
are clearly things in the book that if you
read the book intelligently, as I know anybody

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.810
who works at Google would do, you find that
there are lessons in the book that tell you

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:07.269
things, things are exposed about Obama's character
that bear very definitely on his situation

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:15.040
today. Before I do either one of those things,
even though this group is small, I'm going

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:25.230
to ask - I like to always get a feel for my
audience before I punch into the substance

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.620
of the talks so I'd like to figure out where
we all are politically so I'm going to ask

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.620
you guys in 2008 who you voted for. If you
feel uncomfortable voting in front of other

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.050
people, close your eyes. [laughs from audience]
So, how many people in the audience here voted

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.690
for Barack Obama for President? How many people
voted for John McCain? Okay, so that's a typical

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.580
crowd for northern California [laughs from
audience] Usually I'm blessed by like one

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.100
or two people who put up their hands for McCain
and then I can say, you know, for Northern

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.690
California, that's a very relatively diverse
audience and offer up Secret Service protection

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.360
for you. [laughs from audience] But in this
case - umm, let me ask one other question.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.050
On the Democratic side, how many people voted
in the Democratic California Primary? How

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:59.230
many people voted for Barack Obama? How many
people voted for Hillary Clinton? Wow. See

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.290
now you guys - now that's a relatively diverse
audience for Northern California too so a

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:08.899
big Obama crowd here so we'll talk a lot of
about Barack Obama. [laughs from audience]

00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:14.950
I think the core relationship in the book
is between Obama and Hillary Clinton and one

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:20.779
of the great pleasures that we had in doing
the book, I mean, I have known Obama for 22

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:25.410
years, which I'll talk about a little bit
more later. As I said, Mark and I both know

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.079
the Clintons really well but nevertheless,
there were a lot of things that we didn't

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:31.400
really know and one of the things that we
didn't know, like most of the country, we

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.100
observed the Clinton-Obama fight very much
from the context of them as rivals and heated

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.690
rivals, very bitter rivals at some point during
the campaign and the conflict was the prism

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.520
through which we saw it. As we started to
go back, we found out about the relationship

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.900
that the two of them had before the campaign,
which was really surprising to us, how much

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:54.880
Hillary Clinton had been a huge fan of Barack
Obama's when he first ran for Senate in 2004

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.570
in Illinois. We talk about her being desperate
to go see him before his speech at the Democratic

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.320
Convention. She had heard about this kind
of incredible political performer in Chicago.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.480
She was asked to go out and do a fundraiser
for him. She was stuck on an airport tarmac,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.480
not able to get out,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.290
insisting that she would go rather then not,
rather then giving up she wanted to go see

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.009
this guy and find out what all the fuss was
about. Coming back incredibly impressed, telling

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:20.180
all of her friends that she'd never seen a
political neophyte who had as much potential

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:25.040
as Obama saying, "There's a superstar in Chicago."
Hosting a series of fundraisers for him at

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.199
her home in Washington, then back to Chicago,
sending her husband out to do a fundraiser

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:34.730
for him also, very much the kind of candidate
the Clintons historically would have wanted

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.560
to support. A bright, progressive African
American candidate, well spoken; a guy who

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.410
they really felt a kinship to in a lot of
ways and were incredibly happy when he won

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.910
the race and when he first came to Washington,
Hillary Clinton made herself very much available

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.260
to Obama as someone who could be an advisor
to her. Obama entered the Senate in a kind

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.191
of unique way, right? I mean, he was not your
normal freshman Senator in a institution that

00:14:56.191 --> 00:15:01.360
basically prized seniority. He arrived as
a global superstar because of the Convention

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.670
speech in Denver. He was already getting hundreds
of requests to speak every week the day that

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.780
he walked in the United States Senate and
was able to raise a huge amount of money for

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.100
brother Democratics. He'd spent a lot of his
campaign for Senate because by the time he

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.560
won the nomination in Illinois, it was clear
he was going to win the general election.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.470
He spent a lot of that Fall raising money
for other Democratic senators, even though

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.930
he was not a Senator yet which I think is
actually unprecedented in the history of American

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:31.889
politics. He was, you know, an, unusual uh,
unusually bright star and he recognized that's

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:36.140
a problem, that in the Senate, which is a
very high band institution, that trying to

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.259
arrive, arriving with that kind of celebrity
around you, could actually hinderyour ability

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:44.480
to be effective and there was only one person
in the Senate who had ever done anything like

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.000
that that he could see and that was Hillary
Clinton who had arrived in the Senate in 2000

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.529
to 2001 with exactly the same kind of level
of celebrity, global celebrity and had to

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:56.520
navigate the same kind of treacherous to making
herself an accepted member of the body so

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.870
Obama went to see her very early and said,
"How do I succeed?" She gave him advice about

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:08.449
what he needed to do and he was very much
a loner in the Senate. He had totally attracted

00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:13.709
to her, talked to her more frequently, would
go and pull her aside, she would pull him

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:16.529
aside on the Senate floor. They were, I would
say, a budding relationship of "mentor and

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:23.490
pupil" in a lot of ways. He gave her a photograph
of him and Michelle and his daughters which

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.540
she kept on her desk, kind of prominently
displayed, until the day she left the US Senate

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.040
and I think that had it not been for his decision,
which she considered ridiculous, to run against

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.100
her, they could have been the best of friends.
But unfortunately Barack Obama had other ideas

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.990
and that kind of drove the wedge between the
two of them. We talk in a lot of detail in

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:47.160
the book about why the Clintons were so affronted
by Obama's decision to run but without wasting

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.510
a lot of time, you know the story after that
in some ways, just how bitterly contested

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:56.400
the Democratic fight was but I think it's
really important to recognize what

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.889
the foundation was because for a lot of people
the fact that Barack Obama asked Hillary Clinton

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:06.040
to be his Secretary of State was a huge surprise,
given - certainly a surprise to her, it was

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.080
a surprise to everyone around her, it was
a surprise to most of the people around Obama.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.310
He had decided very early. Like one of the
great qualities about Barack Obama is his

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:22.220
ability to shed our rancor when the moment
for rancor is finished and so literally on

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.830
the day after he finally locked up the Democratic
nomination in early June, his attitude was

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.720
all that's the past, you know? These are things
people say in political campaigns, I don't

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.570
care. She's really smart, she's really savvy,
I want her in my Administration and people

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:47.770
around him were like, you know, "Are you crazy?"
They would then ask the natural next question

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:55.870
which was, "Well, why not put her on the ticket?"
And his answer to them was, "Well, I don't

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:03.380
really think it could work with three Presidents
in the White House." [laughs from audience]

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.505
Which is a fair point. He was determined not
to put her on ticket but was determined to

00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:08.505
have her in the Administration and spent most
of the Fall campaign thinking in the back

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:09.505
of his mind that she would either be Secretary
of State or Secretary of Defense. And many

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:10.505
of the people around Obama thought it was
a horrible idea, that she couldn't be trusted,

00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:11.505
that she would have her own agenda, that her
husband would be a huge problem, but Obama's

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:12.505
attitude was, "I don't care about any of that
stuff; what I care about is the fact that

00:18:12.505 --> 00:18:15.780
the economic crisis is going to take up most
of my first couple of years. I need someone

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:21.770
to run foreign policy who I don't have to
hand hold, who I can trust to be able to be

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.360
America's face in the world, and who is not
going to say stupid things all the time."

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360
One the reasons why

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.430
Joe Biden wouldn't have been a good Secretary
of State [laughs from audience] (and I love

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:37.920
Joe Biden by the way), but his attitude was,
you know, this is serious and she's a serious

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.650
person and I want to do this and from the
very first day after the election, he was

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:46.690
intent on the notion of putting her in office
and there's a - at the end of the book, the

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.581
epilogue of the book is really the story of
the two of them and how she, Hillary, does

00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:55.500
not want this job, is trying to do everything
she can to keep from taking it, is totally

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.170
exhausted, does not want to work for Obama,
has this huge campaign debt still hanging

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:05.050
over her that she knows if she takes the job
will be harder to repay. Wants to go back

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.550
and have something like a semblance of a normal
life. And the process by which Obama convinces

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.380
her which culminates in a pretty extraordinary
after midnight one on one telephone call where

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:20.570
the two of them sort of get real with each
other in a way as human beings that they had

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.000
never done before. Each admitting a certain
vulnerability, certain political vulnerabilities,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.540
and human needs that was a kind of conversation
they'd never been able to have before. How

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:37.410
she ends up in that partnership, also with
the incredible support of her husband, who

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.900
on one level was still furious about Obama's
victory but on the other level really thought

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:54.850
his wife could be a great Secretary of State
and wanted her to have the job, didn't want

00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:10.790
to be blamed for her not getting the job.
How all that came about is kind of incredible

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:25.050
and I think that, to this day, among - the
relationships that Barack Obama has among

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:32.900
his cabinet, the relationship with Hillary
Clinton is the strongest relationship he has

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.650
with anybody else in the cabinet. They have
worked together

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:46.841
incredibly well in the first year and I think
that being the only way you can explain that,

00:20:46.841 --> 00:20:56.970
both her decision to go in and, the fact that
they in the end have worked together is so

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:08.360
well, goes to many qualities of character
that they both have but it also goes back

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.950
to those early days when they first met each
other and what their relationship might have

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:25.420
been had the Democratic nomination fight not
intervened. We kind of fancifully in the book

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:32.590
say that the relationship between Hillary
and Barack is a love story, right? Boy meets

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:39.380
girl, boy and girl fight for the Democratic
nomination, boy loses girl, boy gets girl

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:46.800
back again. [laughs from audience] But the
other two relationships I'll talk about a

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.830
little bit are the Edwardses because again,
many people are interested in the Edwardses,

00:21:53.830 --> 00:22:04.180
much to our surprise in some sense. And then
a little bit about John McCain and Sarah Palin.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:12.260
The Edwardses, I think, were a decision that
when we decided to write a chapter in the

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:32.521
book about John Edwards, not at all the center
of the book but we were going to devote a

00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:48.150
little space to him. It was a little bit of
a risky decision in some sense because Edwards

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:58.250
had fallen most further short of the White
House of anybody that we wrote about.It was

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:07.920
not at all clear that anyone in 2010 would
still care about John Edwards who had been

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:17.980
off the national scene since the middle of
2008. We wrote about their relationship for

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:26.541
a couple of reasons. One was because Edwards
had really, in much of our minds, choose to

00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:34.240
tell us otherwise, had been someone who could
have easily been President of the United States.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:43.340
Had he won the Iowa caucuses where he came
in second. He could have been a very plausible

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:49.390
Democratic nominee and therefore President.
He'd also obviously been the Vice Presidential

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:57.460
candidate in 2004, someone who came very close
to occupying at least the old executive office

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.750
building. And as we did the reporting on Edwards,
I think probably no candidate shocked us more.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:09.500
Not just in terms of his behavior, which of
course now is large public but just the gap

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:17.550
between public image and private reality.
Every politician there is a gap of some distance

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:25.820
and Edwards was as great as any politician
that we'd ever covered and thataccording to

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:32.471
the people around them, the greatest they'd
ever seen. And that gap also extended to a

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:39.040
large extent to Elizabeth Edwards. And so
the story of this couple and the ways in which

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.890
the things that - the qualities I mentioned
before talking about high tech CEO's, ego,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.010
vanity, hubris, and neediness; these are qualities
that every Presidential candidate has to some

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:53.630
degree, but the successful ones keep them
in check. They become motivational and they're

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:59.080
managed. In Edwards's case, they became all
consuming, and took him over and drove him,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.300
I think, quite literally crazy and I say that
sometimes and people say, "Well, really? That

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:11.670
seems a little harsh", and then I have to
say well, wait! Not the affair, because many

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:16.750
politicians have had affairs, both aspiring
Presidents and actually Presidents in the

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:22.000
Oval Office as we know but the behavior afterwards.
The fact that so many people around him, as

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.630
we report in the book, from junior staffers
to senior staffers and best friends, knew

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:38.730
or suspected what was going on, trying to
get him to stop, that he was in denial about

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.980
the risks of how this might ruin his personal
life and his public profile, his

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.650
potential to ever be a serious person in American
life again. The way - most dramatically, I

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:57.390
think, after - we report in the book, after
he was out of the race his out of wedlock

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:07.040
had been born, you know? And was walking or
gurgling in a crib somewhere with Rielle Hunter,

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:14.050
how Edwards at the point still believed that
he could be the Vice President to either Barack

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:20.750
Obama or Hillary Clinton and was negotiating
very hard to get on the ticket. After that,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:26.550
negotiating very hard to become Attorney General.
The idea that someone who had lived this lie,

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.630
could ultimately be confirmed as the United
States Attorney General is just nuts. It's

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:36.580
a delusion on a grand scale and I think that
one of things, the portrait of the two of

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.470
them is very vivid in the book and harsh in
the sense that portraying someone's madness

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.810
quite that clearly is kind of inevitably harsh.
But, what's been most striking about the reaction

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:51.000
to this part of the book, and peoples' interest
in it is again just how resonate a figure

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.740
 - how resonate a pair of figures these two
people remain for a lot of people in America.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:06.280
We were both surprised, Mark and I, in December
of last year when the Wall Street Journal

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.750
ran a poll where they asked people who the
most disappointing figures of 2009, the most

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.850
disappointing public figure of 2009. Edwards
won that poll, and collected twice as many

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.780
votes as the second place finisher who was
Tiger Woods, in the middle of the Tiger Woods

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.780
Sex Scandal. And 2009 was not a year where
John Edwards was in news very much actually.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:33.080
So, that actually said something about how
much people were still fixated on the Edwardses.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:41.820
And I think after traveling around and talking
to people about this for some time, I think

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:50.850
I now understand a little better why it's
true and I think it goes to this pervasive

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:57.870
fear that a lot of people in the public have
about politicians which is that they're all

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:05.170
phony and we all have that sense, we know
that there's some play acting who aren't this

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:10.290
involved in politics and in Edwards's case,
he's like the worst nightmare of every person

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:16.290
who believes that politicians are fake in
some way. Someone who's represented himself

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:25.330
to be something totally other then who he
really turns out to be and I think it fuels

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:32.460
peoples' fear. It's like that nightmare scenario,
not just for people who gave money to him,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:40.360
of whom there were many, of people who voted
for him but for all voters. They sensed that

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:52.140
 - they see in him kind of, as I say, the
worst nightmare about what their fear is about

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:59.260
all politicians and I think that's part of
why he continues to be such a resonate figure

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:08.180
for so many people. The first story I said
was a love story, the second story is sort

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:16.900
of a wreck on a highway. The third story,
John McCain and Sarah Palin, we like to think

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:26.160
of as sort of "Stranger on a Train" [laughs
from audience] because the truth is that John

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:33.720
McCain didn't really know Sarah Palin when
he put her on the ticket and one of the things

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:41.020
that we try to do in the book was - we had
been told, like America had been told by the

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:54.970
McCain campaign, that when Sarah Palin was
put on the ticket that she had been on the

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:01.810
short list for Vice President for months and
that she had received as much scrutiny as

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:08.110
anybody else who they seriously considered
putting on the ticket. Rarely in politics

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:17.380
do people lie quite that boldly to reporters
and to the country. The book shows just how

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:24.180
last minute and half-hazard the decision to
put Sarah Palin on the ticket is...I won't

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:37.100
spend a vast amount of time on it except to
say that for most of the summer of 2008, John

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:43.720
McCain was going to try and do a game changing
pick for his Vice Presidential nominee. They

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:50.730
were convinced they needed to really change
the playing field in a profound way because

00:30:50.730 --> 00:31:00.350
Obama's strengths, in terms of fundraising
and organization, were so great that there

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:07.620
was very little likelihood that McCain could
win if he ran a conventional campaign. So

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:13.580
his game changing idea for all that summer
was to pick Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:19.030
Vice Presidential nominee under Al Gore. A
conventionally liberal Democrat on almost

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:25.420
all matters of social and domestic policy
but much more conservative on foreign policy

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:34.370
and security policy, for sure. But the notion
was they would run as a unity ticket and say

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:41.200
they would take a one turn pledge and serve
the country for four years and try to tackle

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:50.550
big problems in a bipartisan way. The problem
with that and McCain, it should be noted that

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:59.770
he just loves Joe Liberman. He's one of his
closest friends in the Senate, and he really

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:07.160
wanted to run with Liberman so all those reasons.
And then they realized that they couldn't

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:13.570
do it and that the Republican primary electorate,
the Republican Convention delegates wouldn't

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:20.390
accept a candidate that liberal. They heard
from a lot of people in the Conservative movement

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:28.960
that if they put Liberman on the ticket, he
might not make it through the Convention and

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:36.560
if he did make it through the Convention it
would spark such a civil war that it would

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:44.420
destroy McCain's convention and leave him
worse off then if he had picked a more conventional

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:50.860
candidate. So literally four nights, five
nights before his deadline, they looked at

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:57.830
the field and said, "You know, the
people who we've actually scrutinized, people

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:07.130
like Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty will not
help us win. We can't put Joe Liberman on

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:17.560
the ticket. What are we going to do?" And
at that point, the name Sarah Palin was placed

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.550
on the table. Now, that they had discovered
Sarah Palin a few weeks earlier when a Rick

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:29.780
Davis, John McCain's campaign manager, sat
down in front of his computer and thanks to

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:38.980
the good people over at YouTube, was able
to discover Sarah Palin by typing in the names

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:46.190
of all the female office holders, public in
office in the country. He came upon a video

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:58.440
of Sarah Palin on the "Charlie Rose" show,
and thought that she jumped off the screen

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:08.190
and she was exciting, and that put her in
contention. At the time that McCain, in this

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:15.700
last week before he had to make this choice
on a Friday morning...The amount of vetting

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:23.230
that she received was one Washington lawyer,
a junior lawyer, sitting in his office for

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:30.690
about 40 hours searching Google. Again, thank
you very much Google. [laughs from audience]

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:38.160
They looked through public record searches
and looking at newspaper clips. Now, if anybody

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:44.030
here knows anything about Presidential vetting
processes, this is not the way most Vice Presidential

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.810
candidates are vetted and certainly not the
way that Barack Obama's vetting team vetted

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:53.460
within an inch of their lives every single
person who they seriously considered for his

00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:01.091
ticket. The McCain campaign did not ever send
anyone to Alaska. They did not speak to her

00:35:01.091 --> 00:35:05.750
political enemies, they did not speak to her
political friends, they did not speak to her

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:11.980
husband or children. The 77 part questionnaire
that every other candidate filled out; some

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:20.310
of them like Mitt Romney took two months filling
it out, Sarah Palin did it in a half a day

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:24.220
and left a lot of the questions blank. She
arrived in Arizona on the night before she

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:33.090
was going to first have a serious conversation
with anybody, McCain staff and McCain, about

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:38.750
being on the ticket. Having not met any of
the senior advisors, many of them did not

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:50.470
know how to pronounce her name when she arrived
in Arizona. They didn't know if it was 'pal-in'

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:56.910
or 'pa-lin'. No one had ever had a conversation
with her and did not, even after McCain put

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:06.770
her on the ticket, no one had had a conversation
with her about what she knew about domestic

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:15.410
policy, about foreign policy, their assumption
was that she would know as much as the average

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:26.670
governor. That turned out to not be quite
true. And they, had a very clear picture that

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:34.920
she was very calm and very poised and very
charismatic, they did not really do enough

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:44.050
scrutiny to get to the point where they realized
that she had what we have mistily referred

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:52.110
to as "limited bandwidth". [laughs from audience]
She - on the night before she met McCain,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:58.000
she had a conversation with his senior vetting
lawyer, an esteemed graveur from Washington

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.170
DC named A.B Culvahouse called the house,
interviewed all the other Vice Presidential

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:12.920
candidates in person for many hours. They
did not have time to do that so he found himself

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:22.480
doing a phone interview with Palin in the
middle of the night, hours before she was

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:31.240
going to go to McCain's ranch and meet McCain
and Culvahouse asked her if she had anything

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:38.050
to tell him and she said, "Well, I should
tell you my daughter is pregnant." That was

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:47.370
the first time they learned that Bristol Palin
was pregnant. Culvahouse took a deep breath

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:56.470
and said, "Is she planning to get married?"
And there was another long pause and he said,

00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:06.240
"Is she planning to get married tomorrow?"
And Sarah Palin didn't think that was very

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:17.910
funny. But this gives you a picture just how
little they knew about this woman when they

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:27.150
put her on the ticket and I think the important
thing to know from that is, you know, someone

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.119
from the McCain campaign, Nicole Wallace,
one of his main communication advisors said

00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:40.130
the other day in an interview that even if
you put Jesus Christ on the ticket, you'd

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:51.840
need to do a lot of preparation because no
matter who you are on the ticket, you will

00:38:51.840 --> 00:39:00.730
come under relentless scrutiny and withering
attacks from the other side. In order to be

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:08.840
able to defend your candidate, it takes a
lot of time to know their record, to have

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:17.580
defenses mounted. The McCain campaign, by
being so half-hazard and so slip shot in the

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:28.800
way that they chose Sarah Palin, they did
not serve her well. She was not put in a position

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:40.530
where she could succeed, they put her in a
position where she was almost doomed to fail

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:47.210
and to a large extent, whatever you think
of Sarah Palin, the ultimate responsibility

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:54.820
for the problem goes back to John McCain and
the people around him who made, I think, a

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:00.460
terrible blunder by not doing the kind of
preparation that's required in these circumstances.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:08.280
The rest of the McCain-Palin story is colorful
and I urge you to read the book because some

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.390
of the scenes in it are quite stunning and
I think if anybody here in this room is thinking

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:20.820
about voting for Sarah Palin in 2012, the
fact is that none of you are, not a single

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:28.120
one [laughs from audience] but if you are,
you'd want to read these - those portions

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:34.920
of the book so you get a sense of what she's
really like. I said I would talk about Obama.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:41.310
For the next ten or fifteen minutes, I will.
I first met Barack Obama in

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:48.950
1988. We were both graduate students at Harvard
arriving there; him to Harvard Law School

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:57.190
and me at the Kennedy School of Government.
We struck up an immediate rapport. I was standing

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:12.280
on the steps of Langdell Library at the Law
School smoking a cigarette and holding a pack

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:28.930
of Marlboro Reds as I smoked and he walked
up and said, "Can I bum one of those?", and

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:40.100
I said, "Sure", and I gave it to him and I
said, "This man is going to be the first African

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.800
American President of the United States."
[laughs from audience] At least, that's how

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:53.130
I like to tell the story. [laughs from audience]
That was really the extent of our relationship

00:41:53.130 --> 00:42:03.840
for those two years. He'd bum cigarettes from
me and I gave him cigarettes and now we share

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:09.400
a common addiction to Nicorette. But I have
watched Obama pretty carefully. I've reported

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:16.170
on him for a pretty long time. And he's an
extraordinary political talent in a lot of

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:20.690
respects but there are a lot of other things
to say about him beyond that so let me talk

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:28.640
about the things that to try and answer the
question, which I said earlier has been asked,

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:35.010
it gets asked constantly about the book;what
does it say about where Barack Obama is now?

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:40.410
I think there are a number of things that
you see in "Game Change" about Obama that

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.380
bear directly on today. And I'll start I guess
with his aversion to, or allergy to, the artifice

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:52.760
of politics. One of the stories in the book
that I think people again, with the benefit

00:42:52.760 --> 00:43:03.580
of hindsight or the hindrance of hindsight
in some ways, don't remember is just what

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:14.050
a bad candidate he was in 2007. In a lot of
respects, the weak leak in the Obama campaign

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:23.300
in 2007 was Barack Obama. He was miserable
much of the time in those early days of the

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:30.570
campaign. His campaign was raising a ton of
money and there was a ton of enthusiasm about

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:40.470
him in
the country and he was formidable in those

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:45.700
respects that he was doing things that were
providing objective metrics that made him

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:51.900
look like a serious challenger and yet on
the stump he was almost repelled by the idea

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.760
of doing what the people wanted him to do
which was to give the 2004 Convention speech

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:01.790
over and over again, and on a number of occasions
he would complain to people around him, "You

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:09.990
know, everyone who wants to comes here wants
to leave the room in tears and I can't do

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:17.300
that five times a day. That's not the speech
I can give, it's not the speech I want to

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:23.150
give five times a day. It's not a reasonable
expectation." He missed his family enormously

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:31.220
and hated the press coverage of the campaign,
thought it was too 'horse racy', wasn't substantive

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:37.270
enough, hated more then anything the debates,
which he thought were a totally artificial

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:43.240
format. He was a kind of guy, a professorial,in
the sense that he was trying to get as much

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:48.050
information into every answer as possible
so literally in debate prep he would say,

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:57.720
"I have a minute for this response. How many
things can I get in?", you know? Which is

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:04.690
not the most effective means of political
communication. And if you remember those debates

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:16.950
in 2007, there were a lot of them, he was
really destroyed by Hillary Clinton, like

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:25.230
time and time again. Her greater experience
in this realm and her savvy about being able

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:34.690
to talk in a very sophisticated way about
policy but in a very clear way, she beat him

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:48.520
and he knew it. But debate after debate he
would go out and be very frustrated by the

00:45:48.520 --> 00:46:01.000
fact thatthe format combined with Hillary's
mastery of the format, meant that he was losing

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:12.250
over and over again. And it got to the point
where in the summer of 2008, many of the people

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:19.790
who had urged him to run, the people who were
closest to him, started to wonder whether

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:26.450
it was a mistake and rather they had talked
him into something that he didn't really have

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:39.040
the heart for. We talk about it in the book,
you know, Obama's decision to run which is

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:47.680
a longer story but you know there is a moment
just as he's about to decide to go where he

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.020
has a conversation with David Axelrod where
Axelrod says, "Look, I've worked for Hillary

00:46:54.020 --> 00:47:02.620
Clinton and I've worked for John Edwards and
I know what they will do to win. They know

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:10.200
where they are going to be three months from
now. Every hour of the day, they are scheduled

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:18.740
all the way out into the Fall. If they have
a 105 temperature, they'll look it up and

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:23.860
they'll put in a 15 hour day. I don't think
you're necessarily crazy enough to be President.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:29.050
You don't want this bad enough. I mean, you
want to be President but you don't need to

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:35.060
be President and that could be a problem."
And Obama's attitude was, "Yeah, that's true

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.580
but I think I'd be a good President and I'm
really competitive and I think that my competitiveness

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:46.830
will come out, and I want to reject the notion
that you have to be borderline insane to run

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:50.940
for President of the United States. It's got
to be that we can elect sane people President

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:56.340
of the United States." A very radical stipulation
on his part [laughs from audience] but I think

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.460
by some point in 2007, he obviously turned
things around in the Fall but the year holds

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:08.160
a lesson, which is that, and I think we've
seen this in the course of 2009 which is Obama's,

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:16.361
as I said before, allergy to the artifice
of politics. His desire, a noble desire I

00:48:16.361 --> 00:48:21.210
think, to have an adult conversation with
people, something that has worked for and

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:30.130
to his advantage in many settings, has been
a hindrance in way in this last year and I

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:37.010
think people expected Obama to be a much more
inspirational figure. And what has happened

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:49.060
of course in 2009 and into 2010 [coughs] excuse
me, has been that he's been caught in the

00:48:49.060 --> 00:49:01.470
weeds and has seemed to people much more a
creature bogged down in the legislative process,

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:21.710
stuck in Washington, not out on the hustings,
not inspiring people in the way that he did

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:39.610
during the campaign and I think for
a lot of people that's led to some disappointment.

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:48.520
I think his attitude towards it is that this
is a serious time and I need to be serious

00:49:48.520 --> 00:50:00.040
but that disjuncture, his kind of at times
strange aversion to wanting to be an inspirational

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:09.760
figure who is speaking with passion, and rather
speaking within a more rational, empirical

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:17.610
way has actually hurt him to some extent politically
over the course of the last year. Another

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:29.220
thing you see in "Game Change" is the way
that Obama deals with crises and there really

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:38.260
were two places in 2008 where Obama faced
something that looked like a crises. I am

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:44.600
going to put Reverend Wright aside for a moment
because it was very kind of a specific thing.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:56.700
The big crises that he faced that were more
macro were in the Fall of 2007 and the Fall

00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:06.480
of 2008. In the Fall of 2007, Hillary Clinton
was ahead by 35 points in the national polls.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.260
Many of Obama's donors and a lot of national
Democrats saying, "You have to change course.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:19.720
This is not working. You are going to lose,
where you wasted all this time and money.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:27.920
You've wasted our time and money. What are
you doing here? You have to take her on, you

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:35.670
have to attack her, kneecap her. Take the
meat cleaver out and put it in her back."

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:40.910
In the Fall of 2008, when again, hindsight
blinds us to some of the difficult truths

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:50.360
of the 2008 campaign, there was a moment in
the Fall of 2008 when John McCain was ahead.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:59.270
A week after Sarah Palin was put on the ticket,
before some of her weaknesses became clear,

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:05.490
before the financial crisis happened, Obama
was actually losing in the middle of September.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:13.341
According to those national polls, McCain
was ahead by two or three points. At that

00:52:13.341 --> 00:52:19.990
moment again, Democrats around the country
were freaking out, "You have to change course,

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:26.280
you have to destroy Sarah Palin, you have
to attack John McCain, you have to do the

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:35.160
following things." And Obama's attitude, which
was in fact exemplified by David Plouffe his

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:42.010
campaign manager, referred to those Democrats
who were complaining and panicking as "bedwetters".

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:50.900
Obama's attitude was, in both instances, was,
"We have a strategy, we have a plan. We are

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:57.560
going to stick to this. It was well thought
through, and we're not going to change because

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:03.220
of these momentary vagaries of our fortune."
In both those instances in the campaign, it

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:08.580
worked enormously to Obama's advantage. It
worked out really well. I think the question

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:23.920
today is whether they've learned that lesson
too well, whether they've overlearned that

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:44.210
lesson and one of the questions again, I think
it's an open question, his attitude has been

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:55.470
towards the crises or the difficulties he's
been facing for the last few months around

00:53:55.470 --> 00:54:08.260
healthcare and other things has been exactly
the same as it was in the campaign. We have

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:17.540
a plan, we have a strategy, we've thought
this through, we are going to keep doing that,

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:26.840
and he's basically put his head down. You
know,[speaker stumbles] one of your board

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:36.630
members, John Doerr, often likes to say, "There's
a time when panic is the appropriate reaction."

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:43.070
And I don't know whether this time is that
time for Obama but there are many people who

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:52.950
would say that a more serious mid-course correction
is required then the one that he's so far

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:59.560
enacted and I think regardless of whether
healthcare passes, it's quite likely Democrats

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:11.140
are going to suffer pretty significant losses
in the House of Senate this Fall, and will

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:19.980
face Obama with a crisis that will be greater
then any political crisis he's ever faced

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:33.300
before. This is not a guy who has had a lot
of setbacks in his life politically. He's

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:43.970
had a very difficult, has had real challenges
to overcome as a child and it's in his biography

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:51.860
but as a politician has lost almost nothing
and Hillary Clinton use to often bemoan the

00:55:51.860 --> 00:56:00.850
fact that the Democrats were about to nominate
someone who had never had a negative ad run

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:10.910
against him in his life which was actually
true until she did [laughs from audience]

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:26.150
in March of 2008 but he's not a guy like Bill
Clinton or like Ronald Reagan for that matter

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:33.810
whose political character has been shaped
by adversity, who lost big things, and had

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:43.660
to, in a resourceful way, pick himself back
up and move on and figure out how to make,

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:53.710
to find a way forward, how to improvise, and
make the best of a bad situation or make lemonade

00:56:53.710 --> 00:57:03.820
out of lemons. I think, you know, Obama is
facing a moment where if healthcare fails,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:09.780
the moment will be upon him now. If healthcare
does not fail, the moment will be upon him

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:19.100
in November and the question of whether he
decides to improvise or to change course in

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:27.520
a dramatic way or do what he's done and did
in 2008 which is put his head down and stick

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:32.870
to his plan, that will be a decisive moment
in shaping the

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:40.380
rest of the Presidency, I think. What are
my other Obama points? I'm going to look here.Right...

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:54.390
Let me talk about two other things that you
really see in the book that are things that

00:57:54.390 --> 00:58:11.430
have, I think, are relevant to today. One
is the perception and I think this goes to

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:28.060
a lot of what some people feel they are frustrated
by with Obama. The perception of Obama coming

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:45.780
into Washington was that he was going to be
a great change agent and was going to fundamentally

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:53.120
change the culture and process of how Washington
worked. In addition to being a post partisan,

00:58:53.120 --> 00:59:11.490
who would reach across the partisan island,
and would be able to usher us into an era

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:22.020
where the polarization of our politics was
less damaging to the public good. There was

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:28.760
also this notion that in many ways he would
sort of sweep in and clean out the ugly end

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:39.119
stables in Washington. I think one of the
most important things in the book in a lot

00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:44.710
of ways is the misperception that it conveys
of Obama as an insurgent figure. I was not

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:49.180
actually very clear in what I was saying a
second ago. I think many people thought that

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:57.520
Obama was an insurgent figure. I think the
book shows the extent to which Obama was much

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.190
more at core,[inaudible], at his character
logical and cultural core, is a much more

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:13.310
establishment figure then many of the people
who were so enamored in thought. I don't say

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:29.650
that in a bad or critical way, it's just a
fact and I think the book, if there's a big

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:42.210
story in this book in terms of news and I
mean historically important, it's the stuff

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:59.150
that
we write in the book about the extent to which

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:05.880
the Democrat establishment, who everybody
thought were lined up behind Hillary Clinton

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:16.160
in 2006, were in fact quietly conspiring to
get Obama to run against her. They have various

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:25.230
reasons why they thought Hillary Clinton would
be a bad general election candidate and so

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:33.690
people like Harry Reid, the Senate Majority
Leader, extensively neutral in the race; Tom

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:40.090
Daschle, the former Senate Majority Leader;
even people who were publicly supportive of

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:47.380
Hillary Clinton, publicly endorsed like Chuck
Schumer, her colleague from the New York Senate,

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:52.940
were actually secretly going to Obama saying,
"Hillary Clinton is too polarizing to win.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:58.010
She'll lose the election, she'll drag down
Democrats across the country. Her husband's

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:09.230
personal life could explode in his lap if
Republicans make an issue of the things that

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:19.430
Bill Clinton's doing in his private time.
In the Fall campaign, that could be a disaster.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:28.010
We need an alternative." And they sought Obama
out. We refer to it in the book as "the conspiracy

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:37.500
of whispers" but he had dozens of Democratic
senators pulling him aside saying, "You need

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:44.350
to take the Clintons on." I think that was
influential, not the reason he ran, but it

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:51.990
gave him comfort that what was supposed to
be this iron wall of support behind Hillary

01:02:51.990 --> 01:03:00.010
in the establishment that it wasn't really
true and that there was actually more of an

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:07.000
opening there then many people thought. But
I also think it reflects on what I was talking

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:16.130
about a second ago which is this is not a
guy, to the extent that people thought Hillary

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:28.480
Clinton was the establishment candidate, we
could argue that Obama was as much or more

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.290
the establishment candidate then Hillary was
and you could see that when the super delegates

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.290
finally started to tumble in Obama's direction.
They were supposed to be the firewall for

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:36.760
Hillary Clinton but they ended up in Obama's
camp and the seeds of that were in this period

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:43.720
of 2006 I just described but this is not a
guy with that kind of establishment backing.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.150
That much appealed to the Democratic establishment.
This is not someone who arrives in Washington

01:03:47.150 --> 01:04:02.540
like a revolutionary figure and tries to burn
the place down and so a lot of the, what has

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:08.430
seemed to be, a much more accommodationist
attitude towards Washington and trying to

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:16.420
get things down within the existing power
structure rather then replacing it or reforming

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:25.210
it or stripping it bare. I think that's all
very consistent with this story of how he

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:34.685
got there. The last thing I'll say is I'll
say that I think that Obama, when he ran for

01:04:34.685 --> 01:04:46.420
President, my co-author often very wisely
says, "The Presidential candidates do exactly

01:04:46.420 --> 01:05:05.990
what they need to do win and not an inch more,
not an iota more then what they need, exactly

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:24.790
the amount they need to get across the finish
line." And in Obama's case, I think in the

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:29.550
Democratic nomination fight, the main thing
Obama needed to be was not a Clinton and he

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:37.760
did that very well. In the general election,
he needed to not be George Bush or not anybody

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:45.960
who looked like or smelled like or sounded
like George Bush, or who could be caricatured

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.720
as sounding like a clone of George Bush. Both
those things were, this is a kind of 20,000

01:05:51.720 --> 01:06:01.490
foot analysis, but I think it's fundamentally
true. What that meant was that Obama did not

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:06.690
have to do something that other Presidential
candidates have had to do and the two that

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:10.660
come to mind most strikingly are both Bill
Clinton and Ronald Reagan, who had very deep

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.609
and well articulated theories of the case.
By which I mean, they had not just policies

01:06:12.609 --> 01:06:20.100
that they wanted to enact, and not just inspirational
rhetoric, but they had a view of where the

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:26.070
country was at a particular
moment in history, they had real ideologies.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:32.040
They had a coherent way of getting together
their policies and their rhetoric and talking

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.280
about, in a narrative way, this is where the
country is, this is where we want to go, this

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:43.880
is what I believe the role of government is
at this moment, and here's how all this stuff

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:50.140
comes together in a coherent whole. Obama
didn't have to do that. He had some really

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.350
good policies and he obviously had incredibly
inspirational rhetoric. He promised a change

01:06:53.350 --> 01:07:05.849
that I think he believed in, in terms of as
I said before being kind of post partisan,

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:11.750
but what you didn't have was that kind of
theory in the case in the middle that knitted

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:15.030
everything together and I think it's hurt
him enormously in the course of this first

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:19.359
year of it. I think there is enormous confusion
still in the country about who this guy is

01:07:19.359 --> 01:07:23.310
and what his theory is, what his plan is,
and how the stuff that he's trying to get

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:29.560
done fits in with this bigger vision of America
where it is today and where he wants to take

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.410
it, and so you have this strange situation
now where much of the Democratic party is

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:40.050
dispirited with Obama in one way or another.
Much of the left thinks he's been much more

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.000
centrist and much more compromising and accommodationist
then they thought he would be and that they

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.900
think he should be. I think you have many
Democrats who are more conservative Democrats

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.230
or Democrats who you would call Centrist who
think Obama has been way too much of a big

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:59.570
government Liberal. And I think part of that
confusion owes to a very successful campaign

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:00.760
by Republicans to caricature him certainly
but it also owes to the fact that he's not

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.810
been sufficiently clear with people about
this thing that I keep referring to as the

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:07.680
theory of the case. And I think it again something
that Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan had in

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680
spades, something Obama has not had and I
do think that for the future political success

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.070
of his administration being able to be more
clear and more precise about what his vision

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.070
of governance is and where it fits into the
times we live in is something that's going

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:14.070
to be essential to him being as successful
a President as he could be, he could still

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.070
be despite all the difficulties that he's
faced over this first 14 months. With that,

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:16.070
I will halt; I'll stop[Laughs],and thank you
for coming and take any questions that anybody

01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.070
has here. [applause]

01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:18.070
&gt;&gt; Hi. I thought the book was really fascinating
and one of the most fascinating parts was

01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:19.070
just the scenes between Hillary and say a
close group of people in her campaign. And

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:20.070
I'm wondering with your sources, why were
they so willing to be so honest and paint

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:21.070
the candidate in a bad light, whether it's
Hillary or Obama or John Edwards? And have

01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:22.070
you heard from any of your sources regretting
being so honest, and uh in painting such a

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.070
negative picture of the candidates?

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:24.070
John Heilemann: Those are both good questions.
You know, I mentioned earlier that Mark and

01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:29.170
I had been doing this for a long time so we
had relationships with a lot of people that

01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:30.170
stretch back a long time and so that's the
opening salvo to that answer is that. We were

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:31.580
surprised often by how open people were. We
did not as a general matter or even in very

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.580
many specific cases have to go and pull teeth
out of people to get the information that

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.580
we got. We would sit down with people and
say, "Tell us about what happened", and the

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.580
stories sort of poured out. So I think in
some cases there were probably some people

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:35.580
who were frustrated with what they saw as
the failings in their candidates, if it was

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.359
a negative situation. And I think also that
the way this reporting works is it's through

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:43.819
the kind of accretion of small details and
so in a given meeting you would get - someone

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.529
who tell a story about how this meeting happened
and then you know, we would know an account

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:47.529
of that meeting would go to the other people
in the meeting and as you start to demonstrate

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:48.680
that you know something about what happened,
people are both - there's an interesting kind

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.470
of human instinct to want to add your "two
cents" to the story. So whether the correct

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.310
things that they thought that we had heard
in error, or just to add a small detail. So

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.310
we were relentless in terms of trying to talk
to, in any given meeting, trying to talk to

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:54.310
everybody who was there in the meeting probably
including from the candidates down to whoever

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.310
happened to be in the room with someone we
tried to talk to. In many cases in the book,

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:56.310
if there was meeting that we talked about,
we talked to everyone in the meeting. In many

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:57.310
cases we also had
contemporaneous notes that people took of

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:58.310
the meetings and in some cases we had recordings
of things that people had recorded in certain

01:08:58.310 --> 01:08:59.310
situations. So uh, I think that people have
a natural desire to tell stories, and to testify

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.310
to their experience, and I also have a belief
that most people tend to be truthful rather

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:01.310
then lie, or at least to the best of their
memory. Memories are flawed, but people try

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.310
to tell
the truth and so when you have someone who's

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:03.310
decided they want to participate in doing
something they think will be important to

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.310
history and you sit them down and ask them
and show them that you're not trying - you're

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.310
not looking for a particular answer, you're
just trying to understand what happened; the

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:06.310
natural instincts of wanting to tell your
stories and wanting to be truthful I think

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:07.310
all sort of kick in, and people tend to do
that rather then trying to sugarcoat things.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.640
Certainly the fact that we did most of these
interviews after the campaign was over, shortly

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.819
after the campaign was over; most of the stuff
we did was started immediately after election

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.310
day. We did some
interviewing in the summer of 2008. Remember,

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:16.380
we were trying to get people when memories
were still fresh. But clearly the fact that

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.880
the contest was over, and that we were writing
for a book that was not going to affect the

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
outcome had a huge impact there towards peoples'
candidness and the last question you asked;

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.880
we've heard from tons of people who we talked
to for the book. I said before we talked to,

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.880
we had more then 200 sources for the book.
We haven't heard from everybody but we've

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880
heard from many people and every single thing
we've heard from everybody has been that they

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880
felt they were treated fairly, that we were
very explicit with people about what we were

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880
going to do with the material we were getting,
about what the ground rules were for our conversations

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880
and people have come back in some cases and
said, "You know, that was a tough passage.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
That was tough to read that portrait of my
boss but you got it right and you didn't screw

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
me." And so to this point at least, we're
pretty happy with the response we've gotten

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.880
from everybody involved in the book.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880
&gt;&gt; So what did the experience of putting the
book together after the fact teach you about

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880
how you think political journalism and campaign
coverage could be done differently while it's

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
actually happening?

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880
John Heilemann: Well, it's a really good question
and I don't know that I have a good answer

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880
for it. I do think that it's not a secret
that this notion that the public, the public

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880
image and the private reality of candidates
diverge to some extent, sometimes a lot, sometimes

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880
a little. Uh and I think it's a salutary thing
for voters to keep and a salutary thing for

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:35.880
the press to keep in mind as they do this,
as they embark on whatever 'do this' is, in

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880
the case of voters evaluate candidates to
decide who they're going to vote for and in

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
the case of journalists trying to cover them.
I don't know the forces that are at work in

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
shaping campaign coverage on a day to day
basis are so big that...by that I mean the

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880
nonstop news cycle, the web in particular.
It's not clear to me how you turn back that

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880
tide. It's a - the thing that I would like
to see that, I don't know - I have no idea

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880
how one would engineer this but I think the
most regrettable thing that; and I think Mark

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880
would agree with this; that we've seen in
the course of doing this for 20 years is that

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
it's really hard now for reporters to actually
get to know the people they cover. And it's

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880
a combination of the time pressures on them
to produce and those time pressures meaning

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880
that people who log their reporting by IM
or log their reporting by phone or log their

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880
reporting by email, and don't actually spend
time, even with secondary sources; by secondary

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880
sources, I mean not the candidates but even
the advisors around them. They don't really

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880
have personal bonds with those people so they
have all these time pressures that keep them

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880
from doing a lot of face to face reporting
and certainly keep them from doing like a

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880
long and extensive interviewing. On the candidates
side, the imperative now - I mean, it's always

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880
the imperative in every Presidential campaign
or every political campaign; you know, control

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880
your public image is the paramount challenge,
right? And what people have learned, again

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880
regrettably I think, is that there's a very
little upside to direct engagement with the

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880
press. And so some people say, "Well, their
so good at image manipulation", and I don't

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880
really take that point of view but it is true
that candidates and journalists very rarely

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880
interact anymore. And so you can travel on
a candidates' camp, on a candidates campaign

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880
plane for days without ever talking with the
candidate and if you do talk to the candidate,

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
he walks to the back of plane and does a gaggle
with all the reporters on the place for five

01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880
minutes and then goes back to the front. You
know, 20 years ago Mark and I - Mark got to

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880
know Bill Clinton by traveling around with
him every day, you know. Riding on the backs

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880
of buses and planes with him for months and
months and months, and there are candidates

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
that I can say that I've spent hours and hours
and hours with, and nobody gets to do that

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880
really anymore unless you have the privileged
status of having known that person before

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880
and maybe you're
working on a big magazine profile. But this

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880
huge wall between reporters and candidates
is a huge problem, and it's a problem in both

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880
directions, I think. It's a problem in the
sense that the public doesn't get as clear

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880
a picture of who these people really are,
and I actually think it's disadvantageous

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
to the candidates in some ways also because
you know there was a time, and I hate to sound

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880
like an old man, but you know if you knew
a candidate well and you had spent a lot of

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880
time with them and they said something stupid,
you were in some cases like, "Well, he didn't

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880
mean that", you know? I know he didn't mean
that, I've heard him give this answer six

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880
times and that was a slip of the tongue. That
was not a reflection of what he really thinks

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880
and feels about something, and so I'm not
going to write that to embarrass him. It's

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880
just not who this person really is. I don't
mean something horrendously inflammatory,

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.880
I mean like some dumb thing where he said
the word 'not' when he meant to say'would',

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.880
you know? Nobody does that anymore. And now
the game is a gotcha game largely and if a

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880
candidate stumbles and says something in error,
it becomes a huge deal where everybody who's

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880
writing about it focuses on the thing and
then it

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.880
becomes - and they get misinterpreted more
then fairly interpreted. All that's a way

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.880
of me dancing around the fact that I don't
really know how to fix that problem but it

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880
seems to me that it would be advantageous
to everybody involved in the process if we

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880
could in some way get back to a situation
where candidates and journalists actually

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.880
got to know each other and there was a spirit
of greater trust that didn't take away of

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.880
their appropriately adversarial role that
the press should play in the system, but got

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880
you closer to something that vaguely resembled
truth; that would be a good thing.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880
&gt;&gt; Thanks

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880
&gt;&gt; One more.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.880
&gt;&gt; Hi. I bought a copy of your book but my
daughter took it away to college so I gotta

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
get another one.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880
John Heilemann: I'll take yours too though
[laughs]

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. I wanted to correct one other thing
you said. You said nobody in here was going

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880
to vote for Sarah Palin and I'm actually registering
as a Republican in 2012 to vote for her in

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.880
the primary. There's a bumper sticker out
here that you probably haven't seen in northern

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.880
California.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.880
John Heilemann: Really? Didn't you just say
you voted for Barack Obama before?

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
&gt;&gt; I did.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880
John Heilemann: And now you're going to vote
for Sarah Palin?

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880
&gt;&gt; In the primary. [laughs from audience]

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.880
John Heilemann: Ah. Strategic voting.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880
&gt;&gt; The bumper sticker says, "Palin in 2012:
We'd love to kick your ass again." [laughs

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880
from audience] My question to you is more
about -

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880
John Heilemann: That's funny. You got the
kind of like Sarah Palin is going to be in

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880
this.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880
&gt;&gt; I don't think she's really going to have
a chance in the primary but in the 2008 election,

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880
I wonder if you could just talk for a few
minutes about what happened in New Hampshire.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880
All of the polls ahead of that primary had
shown that Barack Obama was going to win.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880
He had come out of the Iowa caucuses with
a gold halo and nobody expected Hillary Clinton

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880
to take that particular primary. What do you
think actually happened there?

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880
John Heilemann: That's a good question and
I think I know the answer; that's what makes

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
it an even better question. Where to start?
Mark Penn, Hillary Clinton's Chief Strategist,

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
had a theory which was that a lot of - the
Clintons obviously have a strong connection

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880
to the state of New Hampshire that Obama never
had. Obama had done

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880
a lot of work in Iowa, the Clintons had never
had a history there. The difference between

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880
the states go largely to that. But the Clintons
had a strong reservoir of support in New Hampshire

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880
and that was the first important thing. Second
important thing was that there were a lot

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
of woman voters in New Hampshire had, for
a variety of reasons, drifted away from Hillary

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880
Clinton and drifted largely not into Obama's
column but into the undecided column. So Mark

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880
Penn's theory was that Hillary Clinton needed
to get those, needed to reactivate those women

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880
voters who were inclined towards her but had
been kind of pulled either into; in some cases

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880
they were saying they were pro Obama but in
most cases they were down in the undecided

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880
column. She had to do something and somehow
that had to happen. She needed to bring those

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
people back home. You know, everybody remembers,
of course, her moment of emotional vulnerability

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880
in New Hampshire. I think that in fact a big
factor and I also think the people of New

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880
Hampshire, if you have spent any time there
as I have, there was a very strong sense of

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880
people in New Hampshire who were very sophisticated
about politics. And the notion that the media

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880
narrative, which was true, which was that
if Obama had of won New Hampshire, the race

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880
would basically have been over. I think there
was a backlash to that among a lot of voters

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880
in New Hampshire, who didn't want the race
to end and didn't want to be part of the coronation

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
of a candidate who would have been so untested
at that point. To give Barack Obama - given

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880
his relatively newer resume, his relatively
brief time on the national stage; to allow

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880
him to take the Democratic nomination having
only had to succeed in one caucus and one

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
primary, I think struck people in a very conscious
way as being a problem. If you look at the

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
polls from New Hampshire, one of the things
you will notice is that - and people say,

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
"The polls are so wrong, the polls are so
wrong"; they weren't really that wrong. And

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880
what the polls showed going into election
day, was that Obama had a lead, Hillary had

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880
 - I won't be able to quote the numbers for
you but Obama had 'x' percent, Hillary had

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
'y' percent, and there was a 'z' percent undecided.
Obama basically hit his number; what didn't

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880
happen on election day was that he didn't
also get any undecided voters. So what you

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
saw was something you never see in politics,
which is essentially close to 100% of the

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880
undecided voters went for Hillary Clinton
and so the polls actually had gotten, I think

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
actually got it right in New Hampshire. What
people got wrong was applying the normal predictive

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
models to how undecided would break, because
no model ever predicts that a 100% of undecideds

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880
will all go in one direction. But the combination
of Hillary's moment of vulnerability, Obama's

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880
moment of nastiness, if you will, at least
ice coldness on the stage when he said you're

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
like blowing off Hillary, both contributing
to the same thing which made her seem a much

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880
more sympathetic and appealing figure, especially
to women voters, and this perception that

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880
the people of New Hampshire didn't want to
be the place where the race ended. I think

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880
those were all important factors. And I'd
say on the margin, there was some number of

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880
independent voters in New Hampshire who, seeing
what they thought was an Obama landslide,

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880
decided in a strategic voting way that they'd
rather vote for McCain. And it's an open primary

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880
and independents can vote in either one of
the races. There were a fair number of New

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880
Hampshirens, I can say empirically, and I
think the data actually shows this, that were

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880
actually torn and who actually - their favorite
two candidates were Obama and McCain and they

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880
were very centrist kind of liberal Republicans
 - liberal Conservatives, or very conservative

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
Liberals, if you will, who on the day of the
election thought that my votes not going to

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
count in the Democratic primary, why not go
the Republican primary and vote for McCain

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
where it actually will count because that
race was seen as very tight between him and

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880
Mitt Romney so some combination of those factors,
I think tell the story there.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
&gt;&gt; It's a good answer and you did answer my
specific question but in particular I was

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
referring to the exit polls on the day of
the election which also showed that Obama

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880
was winning.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880
John Heilemann: Now, the exit polls were accurate
in that case.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880
&gt;&gt; That Obama was going to win?

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880
John Heilemann: No, the exit polls didn't
show that.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880
&gt;&gt; That's not my memory from the day of the
election.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880
John Heilemann: You know, I'd be very surprised
if you actually saw exit polls on that day

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880
but the exit polls told the campaign something,
that the actual network exit polls that came

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880
in were actually on the money as to why Obama's
campaign was able to go and tell him he was

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.880
going to lose long before the results were
actually finalized. I'll take one more if

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.880
you -

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.880
&gt;&gt; Last one.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880
John Heilemann: He's eager.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880
&gt;&gt; Sorry I'm so late. So I really tried to
understand Obama from his early biography

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880
and [inaudible], but it's just very confusing.
One thing - two questions about Obama. One

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880
is there's this idea that he read "Team of
Rivals" and he sort of thinks of himself as

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880
Lincoln in the sense that he'd come into this,
some sort of catastrophe in the country, and

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880
having to... maybe that's part of the reason
for bringing Hillary and I wonder what you

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880
thought about that. The other question is
something that's even somewhat troubling,

01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880
is the fact that you know there was a pretty
well researched book called "The Case Against

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880
Barack Obama" that talked about his history
in Chicago, his associations with a corrupt

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880
machine there, you know, very supportive of
BOGO in 2006, his association with radicals,

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880
criminals, and you know he was right in all
of that. So I wonder how does one make sense

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880
of that, you know?

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880
John Heilemann: Thank you. Well, uh...I think
that the answer to the second question will

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.880
be a little too tendentious for us to get
into right now. But I have read the book you

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880
are talking about although I have a feeling
that it's written with some [inaudible] of

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880
ideological predispositions that don't make
it quite straight journalism given the title.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880
The answer to the first question is yeah.
I mean, I think that Obama thinks that the

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880
amount of crises that he faced when he came
in were on a historic level. He, like Hillary

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880
Clinton, a lot of Presidential aspirants,
really like "Team of Rivals". They think it's

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880
a really great book. Hillary Clinton tried
to institute a team of rivals on her campaign.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880
It doesn't work very well on campaigns it
turns out especially if you're not willing

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.880
to mediate between the war and factions and
then make clear decisions on the basis of

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880
on this letter, we fight. Her theory was if
you let her fight, the best ideas will come

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880
to the top. She didn't seem to realize that
when the best ideas came to the top, she needed

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880
to then endorse one of them and choose that
as a course of action; she seemed to just

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.880
let people kind of fight endlessly. There's
no doubt that Obama had read the book and

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880
there's also no doubt that he admires Lincoln
a lot. But you know, I - I mean, Hillary Clinton

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880
was his rival in the Democratic nomination
fight, but I'm being maybe a little bit too

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880
literal about the title of the book, but if
you look around, I think people naturally

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.880
kind of fastened on to that when he put her
in the Cabinet. I don't think he really thought

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880
of her that way, in a funny way. I mean, he
obviously did know that he had fought this

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880
race against her and knew that she had been
his rival but I think he wanted to send-in

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880
choosing her, he thought she would do a good
job and he wanted to send a message to the

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880
world about his "bigness", you know, as a
person who was able to move past the campaign

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880
and pull and put someone in the job that he
thought would do the best in that job, and

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880
that not only did he want that substantively,
but he wanted to be seen as someone who would

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880
do that. You know, if you look at the makeup
of his cabinet in general, there's not a lot

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.880
of rivalry there. I mean, there are a lot
of people who Obama was very friendly with

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880
or very close to in the past. People like
Arnie Duncan, the Education Secretary, who

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880
he had a great relationship with. In the White
House, the same two of the three people that

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880
Obama actually listens to, who he'd listened
to during the campaign and continues to listen

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880
to, Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod are still
there. He swapped out David Plouffe for Rahm

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880
Emanuel but again it's a very tight circle
of people within the White House who Obama

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.880
actually cares about their opinions. And you
know in the context of foreign policy, you

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880
know again this a hard thing again for many
of Obama's more progressive backers to swallow

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880
but I think you know there was consistency.
Hillary Clinton, Bob Gates, Jim Jones; all

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880
pretty hawkish for Democrats. I mean, in Gates's
case, not really a Democratic. People who

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880
were much to the right of where I think a
lot of progressive voters were in terms of

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880
foreign policy, but that's not a team of rivals,
that's a team of people who believe what Barack

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880
Obama seems to believe about foreign policy.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880
Again, I say many progressives don't, we don't
want to believe that but I think everything

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880
that's happened over the course of the first
year, particularly surrounding the decisions

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.880
in Afghanistan, suggest that those people
were put in the office because they had the

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880
same orientation towards national security
that Obama actually has. I mean, I'll conclude

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880
by saying it is, I think, one of the biggest
problems for Obama, is the Rorschach Blot,

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
blankness of his campaign and the amount of
projection that people put on him and believe

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880
things that he never was, and I think one
of things most, where it's most striking,

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880
is in this area; because I think foreign policy
in the end may be the thing that will be determinative

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880
in the 2012 elections. Around the time in
2011, he has to decide whether or not to withdraw

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
troops from Afghanistan as he said he was
going to. You know, a lot of people on the

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880
left heard Obama's speech about the Iraq War
in 2002 and thought he said he was against

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880
the Iraq War and that he was an anti-war person,
and what he said was, "I'm not against all

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880
wars, I'm against dumb wars", and I think
it's a salutary and important thing for people

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880
who, to listen to both parts of that sentence.
Again, I take no position on the subject but

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880
this is not a guy who is a pacifist, and I
think his appointments in foreign policy demonstrate

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880
that's pretty clearly the case. So anyway,
thank you very much, you guys, for coming.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:57.881
[applause]
