00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:08.816
&gt;&gt;Erica: So, the moon is
going to be right here.

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:11.436
Remember that we're going to look in
a straight line through the center

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:12.316
of the Earth, so we're going to...

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Erica Waybright
teaches science.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.196
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: -- 90 and 270.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.326
If you have a quarter-moon,
a quarter-moon...

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:19.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lindsey
Pairs teaches math.

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:21.756
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: It shouldn't
look like a crescent at all.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And they work
in the same classroom.

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:25.386
&gt;&gt;Erica: Pass these
out to each table.

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like all other
core-subject teachers in the sixth

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:31.986
and seventh grades at YES Prep
North Central, they teach as a team.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:34.576
&gt;&gt;Katie: Did you have any
connections to this poem,

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.096
or did it make you
think of anything else?

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:39.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While YES Prep
spends slightly less per student

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.236
than other Houston public schools,

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:45.346
the team-teaching approach is an
unusual allocation of resources

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:47.146
that seems to be paying off.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:50.156
&gt;&gt;Erica: I actually think the
team-teaching model is amazing.

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:52.386
My partner teaches
basically the math portion.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.396
I teach the science portion, but we
do a lot of shared responsibilities.

00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:56.796
We do a lot of planning together,

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:58.906
making sure that we're
integrating math and science.

00:00:58.906 --> 00:00:59.346
&gt;&gt;Nice job.

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:03.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether it's math and
science or arts and humanities,

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:07.606
a prime reason for team-teaching is
the integration of subject areas,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.226
which, as studies have shown, results
in deeper understanding for students.

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:16.436
&gt;&gt;Katie: It's hard for teachers at
first to integrate, because they want

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.936
to teach their own subject and
teach it well, which obviously needs

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:24.086
to happen, but I think we've learned
that kids love it when we integrate.

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:26.446
They see the connections
a lot more quickly

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:27.796
than I think we ever
thought they would,

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:30.536
and they sort of latch
on to that information.

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.586
&gt;&gt;Student: It's waxing, because after
a while it's going to get bigger,

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.616
and then it's going to be waning.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:36.046
&gt;&gt;Erica: Perfect.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:37.796
&gt;&gt;Katie: Being in a
classroom with 36 kids

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.496
by yourself, you'd probably go crazy.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:43.426
I mean, there's always someone to
help you and to bounce ideas off of,

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:44.706
and it's good for grouping.

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:46.796
We can do a lot more group
work, a lot more centers,

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.256
a lot more projects,
where the kids are going

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.346
to get the attention they need.

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:51.016
&gt;&gt;What else?

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:51.866
Ms. Knapp?

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I thought of
world's greatest boss,

00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:55.896
world's greatest teachers.

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:56.496
&gt;&gt;Katie: Absolutely.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:56.563
&gt;&gt;Class: [laughs]

00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:59.436
&gt;&gt;Philip: We know how important that
collaboration is, not only in terms

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:02.916
of sharing the workload
but, more importantly,

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.686
if you have hired two people
that are incredibly intelligent

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:08.296
in a content area, their
lesson's only going to be stronger

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:10.166
by them sharing their
ideas with each other.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.356
I think every single type
of poem we can incorporate

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:15.496
into the different
aspects of community.

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:18.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teacher teams
meet for 50 minutes each day

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:21.266
to strategize and plan lessons.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.496
&gt;&gt;Katie: I think what we talked

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:26.556
about with you having them actually
write poetry in history is huge.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:30.316
&gt;&gt;Lora: It does take a little
bit of extra time to meet

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.886
and make sure our two
subject areas are aligning.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.626
It would be a lot easier to just
do my subject and stay in that box,

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:38.946
but it wouldn't be as beneficial.

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:40.516
&gt;&gt;Why don't I just write the poems

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:43.226
for the lesson on Thursday
and Friday?

00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:46.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The YES Prep formula for
effective team-teaching includes:

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.936
daily 50-minute common planning
sessions for teacher teams,

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:55.406
lesson plans that require active
participation by both teachers,

00:02:55.866 --> 00:03:00.126
professional development specific
to best practices in team-teaching.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.566
&gt;&gt;Katie: So, the upcoming week...

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:03.306
&gt;&gt;Hard parts about it?

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:05.846
I mean, personalities have to match.

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:08.566
I've been lucky enough this year
to have a really great team teacher

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.476
who we get along perfectly,
but that's always a struggle

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.466
for administration, I think, to
put teacher together who're going

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:18.856
to work well together and just
that there's not a lot of research,

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:21.726
I don't feel like, about how
team-teaching can really work,

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:24.146
so we've kind of made
it up as we go along,

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:27.706
and we've learned every year
different ways that we can best use

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.966
that relationship, since we're
both there in the classroom.

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.756
&gt;&gt;Lora: You guys have the same thing?

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:32.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For YES Prep,

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:36.796
team-teaching has provided
smaller teacher-to-student ratios,

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:40.556
deeper student understanding
of subjects and connections

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:44.156
and positive examples of
successful collaboration.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.696
&gt;&gt;Katie: So let's try to
put that into a paraphrase.

00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:49.866
&gt;&gt;Lora: I think that team-teaching
models how you can be even more

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:53.806
successful if you can work positively
in a team, so it's really cool

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:57.456
that our students get to see us
every single day interacting,

00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:59.876
and they also see us outside
of the classroom interacting

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.206
with each other, and they know
that just being in relationships

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:05.956
and having a positive working
environment can help you

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:06.746
be successful.

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:10.276
&gt;&gt;Erica: Make sure you get even
with it and tell me what you see.

00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:11.196
Good.

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:14.226
