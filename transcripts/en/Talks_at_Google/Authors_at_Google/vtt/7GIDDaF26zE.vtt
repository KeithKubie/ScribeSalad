00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.780
MALE SPEAKER: Let's give it
up for Randall, all right.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.426
RANDALL MUNROE: Hi.

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:13.790
All right, so I wrote a book.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.840
It's full of my
answers to questions

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.580
that people submitted
through my website.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.450
And so one of the questions that
was submitted that I would like

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.940
to talk about today
is the question

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.450
that someone asked-- what if
you built a periodic table using

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.639
bricks, where each
brick was made

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:36.930
from the corresponding element?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.630
And so for-- there's a
bunch of different elements,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.880
some of which are easier
or harder to get a hold of.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.690
All in all, there are--
of the 118 elements

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.770
in the periodic table,
there is about 30

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.080
of them which you can get
at the local supermarket.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.500
You can get samples of aluminum.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.570
You can get samples
of-- oxygen and nitrogen

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.130
are not hard to find, either.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.660
And then there are
another bunch of elements

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.620
that you can get if you're
a little bit more creative.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.170
For example, if you need a
radioactive source for a cloud

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.520
chamber, which is a
science project you can do,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.880
you can take apart a smoke
detector, because they'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.090
have a tiny lump of americium
in the middle of it.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.500
And if you-- it's a
very small amount--

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.045
but if you wanted
to make a brick,

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:37.170
you could just buy a whole
bunch of smoke detectors

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890
and disassemble them all
and gather all the americium

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.580
together.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.310
And this is an
effective way to A,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.340
get a brick-sized
sample of a rare element

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.490
that's otherwise
hard to find, and B,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.720
get yourself onto a bunch
of government watch lists

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.588
really quickly.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.990
But despite-- there are some
dangers to this, for example,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.030
a lot of these
elements, in addition

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.980
to being maybe hard to find
and/or some degree of illegal,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.580
some of them are kind
of dangerous to handle.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.480
So mercury, depending
on what form it's in,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.840
can cause mercury poisoning,
which is really bad.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.160
Even some of the elements up
near the top of the table,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.570
like beryllium, is-- it's
not radioactive or anything--

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.450
but you don't want to get it on
your hands and into your food.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.930
So there is-- but
despite this, people

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.750
try to collect samples of as
many elements as they can.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.090
And I totally understand this
sort of collector's compulsion

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.170
that people have, because I
played the original Pokemon

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.620
on Game Boy.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.620
And if you look up
what year I was born

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.636
and the release dates when
"Pokemon Blue" and "Gold" came

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:06.260
out, you'll realize
that I was actually

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.959
not quite in the--
I was a little older

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.500
than the demographic that was
supposed to be playing Pokemon.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.270
But I played through, and
there's the appealing idea that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.741
there's-- originally-- 151,
plus or minus, Pokemon.

00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.240
And the goal is to
collect them all.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.200
And so there are 118 elements.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.940
So it's easy to
think of them as sort

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.150
of radioactive, and sometimes
very short-lived, Pokemon.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.760
But people who try
to collect them

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.150
usually top out somewhere
around 80 to 90,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.700
depending on how
comfortable you are

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.290
with your health and safety,
how much money you have

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.380
to put into this, and-- in
the case of plutonium-- how

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.720
many international laws
you're willing to violate.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.330
And the elements at the
very bottom of the table

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.080
are the ones that they
typically have a hard time

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.050
with for reasons which will
become clear in a moment.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.535
So we're going to start
with the top of the table.

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:18.910
So what I decided
to do is think,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.597
OK, I'm going to build
a periodic table.

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:22.430
There's going to be
trouble near the bottom.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.640
But let's start with the top.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.490
So the first row of
the periodic table

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.880
is just hydrogen and helium.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.220
And that would be easy
to build, because you

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.180
get a bunch of hydrogen,
get a bunch of helium.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.596
I think we have a
helium shortage,

00:04:35.596 --> 00:04:38.750
but you can still buy
it at party stores.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.684
And so you if you
made a brick of those,

00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:42.100
it would be really
anti-climactic.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.800
It would just sort of
diffuse and float away,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.390
but this would be a
good place to stop.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.410
Because we have
seven rows to build--

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.680
so of these rows, the
first two rows really

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.840
you can build without
too much trouble.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.920
The third row will
burn you with fire.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.000
The fourth row will choke
you with toxic smoke.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.250
The fifth row will do all of the
things that the first rows did,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.400
plus give you a mild
dose of radiation.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.250
The sixth row will disintegrate
instantly in a column of steam

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.830
and extremely toxic dust
and smoke and destroy

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.150
whatever building
you're doing this in.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.270
And you should not
build the seventh row.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.221
But the first two rows are OK.

00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:38.720
You can build these
without trouble.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.796
The second row you
also-- if you built this,

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:46.420
you'd have some
elements that are solid

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.180
and some that are gases,
but they would basically

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.598
float away.

00:05:51.598 --> 00:05:55.860
The one, though, that I want
to point out here is fluorine.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.880
Fluorine is really, I
think, the worst element.

00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:02.980
It's the most reactive
element in the periodic table,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.700
and I was recently
reading a list of chemists

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.665
who have been mauled or killed
doing fluorine experiments.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.980
So not only is it
super-reactive,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.430
there's a fluorine
compound which,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.710
if you have a gas
of this compound,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.450
and you place things in
it, almost any substance

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.330
will spontaneously catch fire
in a fluorine atmosphere,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.660
including, for one of
these compounds, ice cubes.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.535
So you definitely don't
want to breathe it in.

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:41.660
It would just sort of spread
out across the ground,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.560
but you can back away slowly.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.420
I do remember seeing
in a data sheet

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.100
that it will also eat through
many common gas mask materials.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.160
So be careful with
your safety equipment.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.940
But it really doesn't
become a scary situation

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.590
until we get to the third row.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.210
So the third row has a
couple of troublemakers.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.320
Over on the left is
phosphorus-- over

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.790
on the left is
sodium and magnesium,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.779
and those would
probably also-- you

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.320
can see the sodium
actually-- I think

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.420
drew it starting to
tarnish a little bit.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.090
Depending on how
moist the air is

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.850
and what the
conditions are like,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.520
those would more or
less rapidly start

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.400
to oxidize, either
slowly or quickly.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.720
But over on the right,
we have phosphorus.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.590
And because it's, I
guess, more fun to draw,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.300
I assumed that we were using the
white allotrope of phosphorus,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.850
which will spontaneously
ignite when

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.270
it comes into contact with air.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:52.570
And so we have this lump
of burning phosphorus,

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.770
and then the things around
it, which might not normally

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.730
spontaneously
catch fire, will be

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.034
lit on fire by the phosphorus.

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:03.450
And as if the whole situation
were not combustible enough,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.615
it's not just
happening in oxygen,

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:07.240
because we've got
fluorine from the row

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.540
before spreading out
over it, and then also we

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.000
have chlorine that's just
below the fluorine, which

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.280
is almost as bad.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.880
So at this point, you definitely
don't want to breathe this in.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.600
You want to back away.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.933
It's going to be a lot more
smoky than the previous one.

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:22.860
But you could
probably survive this.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.180
The fourth row gets trickier.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.510
So the fourth row introduces
a bunch of new elements,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:36.510
including the metals-- a lot
of the more traditional metals.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.220
And also we have a lump--
underneath the phosphorus

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.190
is a lump of arsenic.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.810
And so arsenic is sort of a
really recognizable element,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.870
and we have a lot of
associations with it.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.770
And I remember
hearing an interview

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.050
with a spokesperson for a
chemical plant in Texas,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.780
I think, where there had been
groundwater contamination

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.440
downstream from the plant.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.307
And the spokesman
said, you know,

00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:06.140
yeah, they've detected
arsenic in the water,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.810
but arsenic is
really a scare word.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.460
And on one hand,
that is probably

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.260
not the best public relations,
to say, oh, it's arsenic,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.997
but arsenic is not that bad.

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:21.580
But on the other
hand, he has a point,

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.121
which is that there
are trace amounts

00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:25.152
of arsenic in just
about everything.

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:26.610
So all of our food
has a little bit

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.930
of arsenic in it-- few parts
per million or billion--

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.640
and that's OK.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.810
And there could be a
little bit more than that,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.650
and it's also OK.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.290
It's not going to be toxic.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.980
But on the other
hand, this is a lump

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.465
of arsenic, one part per lump.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.650
And the reason that
we-- even though there

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.510
is a little bit of arsenic in
everything-- the reason we have

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.015
these associations for it is
that in large enough quantities

00:09:56.015 --> 00:09:59.440
it is toxic to virtually
all forms of life.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.300
And this is-- a lump about
yea big is definitely

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.990
a large enough quantity.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.460
So the phosphorus has the
burning sulfur-- the burning

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.820
phosphorus and then the
sulfur sitting on top of it.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.710
Next to it is the
selenium and the bromine,

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.740
which are also reacting pretty
vigorously, although probably

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.410
at this point cloaked
in the smoke that's

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.770
bubbling off of the
phosphorus here.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.320
And all of this is wrapped in
this smoke that's boiling off,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.464
which is also smoke that's
full of fluorine compounds,

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:31.880
just to make things
more exciting.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.580
And so you have all the
burning chunks-- arsenic

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.080
combining with the phosphorus
and making all these compounds

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.650
that are
arsenic-something-something

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.490
oxide, arsenic fluoride,
and things that.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.556
If you don't get
away pretty quickly,

00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:48.180
you will be breathing in a bunch
of stuff that could definitely

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.200
kill you.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.450
So the right thing to do here
is to run away very quickly

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.242
and not keep
building rows, which

00:10:55.242 --> 00:10:58.870
is what we're going to do.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.570
This fifth row I think of as
sort of the foreshadowing row,

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.510
because the fifth row
is the place where

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.845
we meet our first mildly
radioactive element.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.400
And this is one
that I have heard--

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.304
so I memorized the
periodic table.

00:11:18.304 --> 00:11:20.220
If you hadn't gathered
from the Pokemon story,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.270
I was not always the best
at being social and finding

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.070
other people who
shared my interests.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.080
So one thing was I learned
the periodic table from books,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.140
but did not talk to a
lot of people about it.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.470
And so this is an element
where it's sort of like

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.000
the aluminum-aluminium thing--
I've always pronounced it

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.442
"tech-net-ium," but the few
times I have heard someone else

00:11:40.442 --> 00:11:42.900
pronounce it, which I have--
although, come to think of it,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.180
I'm not sure why
I had heard that--

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.460
but I've also heard technetium.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.550
And that led me-- I was
wondering about that.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.925
But then I got distracted
because I decided to look it up

00:11:53.925 --> 00:11:56.630
on Wikipedia, and then
got diverted into reading

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.960
the something like 10,000-word
talk page argument over

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.520
aluminum versus aluminium.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.770
And I got into, like,
archive seven of that

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.220
and then had totally forgotten
what I was originally

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.530
supposed to be doing.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.656
But this element,
whichever one it is,

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:15.664
is the first mildly
radioactive one.

00:12:15.664 --> 00:12:17.080
Now in this scenario,
it would not

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.620
kill you before the arsenic,
the phosphorus, the smoke,

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.687
the fluorine, and
then also, again,

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:25.270
the left side of the
table here, which

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.210
is like slightly less
bad, but still bad--

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.469
the potassium and sodium.

00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:30.760
Those would all kill you first.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.630
The "tech-net-ium" or technetium
is not radioactive enough

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.250
to kill you.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.065
At least, I think you
would have to cradle it

00:12:40.065 --> 00:12:44.750
to your body for a
day or so, or if you

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.080
managed to eat a chunk
of it, or wore it

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.597
as a hat that could
give you a lethal dose.

00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:54.680
Hopefully they can add
that to the material safety

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.450
data sheet-- do not wear as hat.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:05.490
But the radiation
itself would really not

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.590
be the biggest problem
you would be facing here.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.950
For that, we're going
to go to the sixth row,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.807
because the sixth throw
contains astatine.

00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:18.390
It contains a lot
of other things too.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.723
And I remember when I first
saw this printed in the book

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:22.600
I was reading, I was
flipping through,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.240
and I hit this article, and
I hit this illustration,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.560
and it was like,
oh, hey, I stopped

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.893
drawing all the smoke and stuff.

00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.840
I wonder why.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.230
Was that a mistake?

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.410
I had the-- the
mercury should be

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.340
flowing just like
the bromine was.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.650
How come I just drew them
sort of stationary like that?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:43.140
And then I remembered
that the only chance

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.020
we will have to see this table
is the snapshot taken right

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:53.020
at this moment, because--
so plutonium is radioactive.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.990
And we use it-- we use
uranium in reactors,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.460
where we trigger chain
reactions in the uranium.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.919
And those chain reactions--
the uranium undergoes fission,

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:07.710
and because I can never
figure out the verb

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.430
form that I would use there to
say where it fizz-- fizzes--

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.880
fissions-- nothing
sounds right, so I'm just

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.620
avoiding saying that.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.630
It undergoes fission.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.932
It splits into chunks,
and that releases

00:14:22.932 --> 00:14:25.140
energy which splits more of
it and splits more of it.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.970
But it will also-- if you
have plutonium sitting there,

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.330
it's radioactively decaying,
and so it emits heat.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.550
And that is what
we used to power

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.270
a bunch of the
long-term space probes.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.992
So the Curiosity Rover
has-- and I really

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:41.450
find this amusing
for some reason--

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.370
but they have a chunk
of plutonium, which--

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.280
I think we've come very close
to running out at this point

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.784
and may be buying
it from Russia.

00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:53.200
So if you're an
element collector,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.850
I know that there's someone
out there who's selling it.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.310
If you can avoid all of
the federal agents who

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.980
will try to find you if you
Google-- I did Google plutonium

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.024
prices for this and then started
thinking, like, wait a minute,

00:15:07.024 --> 00:15:09.110
well, I'm probably on
that watch list already.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.240
I think, actually someone
asked me if any of my research

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.640
got me in trouble, and as
far as I know, all of that

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.920
googling-- like there was
a question I answered where

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.784
I was writing about the
most expensive thing

00:15:22.784 --> 00:15:23.950
you could put in a shoe box.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.610
And I've looked up prices
of a bunch of hard drugs

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.250
and then realized my
search history is now

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.370
how much does heroin cost?

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.410
How much does LSD cost?

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.160
OK, but, like, on the
street, in the city,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.900
how much does it cost?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.640
Or what about this city-- trying
to get a real practical street

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.200
price.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.110
But really the only
consequence I've ever suffered

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.050
was there was an article I was
writing a couple of months ago,

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.777
and at one point I wanted to
include a sample of the items

00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:54.610
in the collection of
the Library of Congress

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.722
and what kinds of things
they were on the whole.

00:15:59.722 --> 00:16:01.680
And it was sort of hard
to get broad statistics

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.240
of the kind I wanted.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240
So I figured, oh, hey,
I'll just randomly sample

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.180
their collection and look at 100
items and see how many of them

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.680
are books and how many
of them are other things.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.250
And so I found--
they had a web API

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.510
and collection items
had one number.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.140
And I was like, OK,
the number looks--

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.009
it's not too many digits.

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:20.550
It's probably not
too sparse a space.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.190
I'll just start
requesting random IDs.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.890
And then I parallelized
that, because that

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.910
was going too slowly.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:33.694
And then I found it was
really hard to get good data.

00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:35.610
And so I was ramping up
the number of requests

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.710
I was making.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.110
And then suddenly they
stopped returning anything,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.430
and then I found that not
only had the API blocked me,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.330
but the entire Library
of Congress website

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.040
was now redirecting me to a 403.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.540
And in fact, everyone
in my building

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.390
was also redirected to the 403.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.790
And I felt like that's totally
fair, because I was definitely

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.520
spamming their API
and abusing it,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.150
but I also felt
really bad about that,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:05.603
because I have never been
kicked out of a library before.

00:17:05.603 --> 00:17:07.560
And I felt like that was
a line I had crossed.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.156
So I really wanted
to apologize to them,

00:17:10.156 --> 00:17:11.530
that I just wanted
to tell people

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.255
about their cool
collection, but sorry.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.180
So the thing that really
entertains me about plutonium

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.560
is that you think of these
sort of complicated reactors,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.870
but with plutonium
electric generators,

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.790
we're just using the fact that
this thing gets really hot.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.870
We just wrap it in things
that will generate electricity

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.990
from the heat and
from the radiation

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.057
that's being put off by this.

00:17:41.057 --> 00:17:42.640
But then we have the
problem that it's

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.270
a big chunk of plutonium, and
it's hot, and it's radioactive.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.880
And so they put it
out on a long stick

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.560
and just hold it
away from the Rover.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.350
And so you can see
on the Voyager probe

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.556
they've done the same thing.

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.430
And so they've got this
long scaffolding arm.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.330
And at the end
there's a little thing

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.371
that I always assumed is
a scientific instrument.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:01.620
But no, it's just a
chunk of plutonium.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.700
And the Curiosity rover
has the same thing.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.210
And this plutonium
has a half-life

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.980
on the order of a century,
which means that after a century

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.470
or so-- or whatever the
specific half-life is--

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.990
80-something years--
the heat and power

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.150
output will drop in half.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.590
And so they've
designed it to keep

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.080
working until the voltage
drops to a certain point.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.750
And so it can keep
running for decades,

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.230
assuming the other
stuff holds up.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.060
But if you wanted to run
something for longer than that,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.880
you would need something
with a longer half-life.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.440
I did work out, by the way--
the plutonium chunk that they're

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.020
using on Curiosity, if
you had a Nintendo Game

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.630
Cube and a TV hooked up to it,
it would provide enough power

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:55.820
for about 130 years
of continuous play.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.830
So if you are stuck
on Mars, and you've

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.790
managed to commandeer
the Curiosity Rover,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.330
if you have brought nothing
except a Game Cube and a TV--

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:11.740
But the half-life of
plutonium is just about right,

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.590
because if it were
much longer, that also

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.770
means that it is less
radioactive, because it's

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.570
taking longer for half
of it to decay, which

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.550
means it will be producing
less power and less heat.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.100
And so you always try
to find a balance.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.490
And this is also why nuclear
contamination sites-- when

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.700
a reactor melts down or
something-- the really nasty

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.362
elements are the ones that
half-lives of about 30 years,

00:19:33.362 --> 00:19:35.570
because the ones that have
half-lives of a day or two

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.390
are incredibly
radioactive, but then

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.090
they all decay,
and they're done.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.830
And so those will be the
things that will give people

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.560
lethal doses very, very quickly.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.060
And then the things that
have really long half-lives--

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:56.540
like uranium 238 is on the
order of billions of years--

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.810
that stuff does not decay often
enough to emit much energy.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.310
So the really bad
stuff is the stuff

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.080
that is like a 30
year half-life,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.820
so it will contaminate the
area for a couple of decades,

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.800
but also be short
enough that it's

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.090
emitting a lot of radiation.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.870
And plutonium is,
again, about a century.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.090
So it emits all of that
heat in about a century.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.530
So astatine, in its
most stable form,

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.541
has a half-life of
eight hours, which

00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:25.040
means that all of
the energy emitted

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.664
by the plutonium
powering the Curiosity

00:20:26.664 --> 00:20:28.910
Rover over the course
of the next century,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.530
if it keeps running, is being
limited by our lump of astatine

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.370
in an afternoon.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.700
This is why no one has
ever collected enough

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.540
of a sample of astatine
to really look at it,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.100
because any sample large
enough to see with a naked eye

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:49.370
would also melt the naked
eye and vaporize itself

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.570
from its own heat.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.040
This actually leads to a
really funny situation.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.290
My favorite thing about
looking up these elements

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.940
is, if you look
under astatine, there

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.230
are all these great
chemistry data tables,

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.670
like "CRC Handbook
of Chemistry" that

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.360
list all of the elements and
every conceivable property

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.950
you could want.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.350
And actually during the
street drug research,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.470
I remember I was
trying to figure out

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.190
cocaine density, or
something like that,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.490
and found that they actually
have a whole bunch of data

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.590
on a bunch of these, but
for some of the drugs

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.950
they have mysteriously
missing chunks.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.960
I didn't know if those were
removed for some reason--

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.040
if that's sensitive information,
or if it's just no one else has

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.950
really tried to figure out the
physics of a shoe box of LSD.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.660
In the handbooks, if
you look up astatine,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.496
you'll find all its
density and stuff

00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:46.620
and its various properties.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.040
But if you look at--
surface appearance

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.100
is a field that they'll have
where they'll say is it shiny?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.790
Is it reddish?

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.304
Is it matte?

00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:53.220
Does it have a luster?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.630
Is it black?

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.820
And astatine will just
have a question mark,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:04.210
because there is no way--
if you have a sample that

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.065
is large enough
to reflect light,

00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:07.690
the light that the
astatine is emitting

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.065
will be brighter
than whatever it

00:22:09.065 --> 00:22:11.940
is you're trying to
illuminate it with.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.350
And so no one has
ever-- I think that I've

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.790
read that the best guess is
that it is probably black

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.232
if you were able to illuminate
it brightly enough to see.

00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:25.190
But it's also possible
that it's shiny and kind

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.930
of metallic-looking.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.810
And that will probably
be a mystery forever,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.620
because those are
chunks of astatine that

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.770
are a collection of a bunch
of molecules in one place.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.890
This would be a chunk
of about a liter, which

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.820
is more astatine than
has ever been made

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.670
or exists in the world.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:49.150
And this lump of
astatine would promptly

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.220
turn into a column
superheated steam by that heat

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.530
that it's pouring out.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.060
But this column of
superheated steam

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.600
will continue pouring
out that heat steadily

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.370
for the next eight
hours, and then

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.240
the next day for less
than that, and less than.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.620
And this is-- so if
someone were actually

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.165
trying to do this
table following

00:23:14.165 --> 00:23:15.540
these instructions,
first of all,

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.720
there's a legal disclaimer
at the front of my book.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.080
They said, you can make
this kind of a joke,

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.070
but definitely do put this in
about not doing this at home.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.140
And this is one
where if somehow you

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.420
were a bunch of people
with both the resources

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.710
to get a hold of some
of these elements

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:39.270
and an environment
that was fostering

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.427
really weird experiments
in the building

00:23:42.427 --> 00:23:44.760
where you might be able to
get away with doing something

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.890
like that, the
amount of astatine

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:53.280
that you would be using here
is a quantity that maximizes

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.970
the amount of paperwork
you're going to have to face,

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.710
because if it were
smaller-- a liter is enough

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.400
that it will probably demolish
the building that you're

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.000
doing this in.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.300
And there are going to be a
lot of people asking questions.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.074
For example, whoever
owns the building,

00:24:12.074 --> 00:24:13.990
or whoever was paying
you to do something else

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.365
when instead you
were doing this.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.560
Do you still have
20 percent time?

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.060
Is that?

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.619
Well, I guess you've
already seen all the Google

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:30.410
searches I've done for
plutonium suppliers.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.326
You can find that out.

00:24:35.117 --> 00:24:36.950
But if you did this,
there would be no way--

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.980
if it were a smaller
amount of energy coming

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.270
from the astatine, you might
be able to cover it up.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.820
You could just-- if it was
a well-built room and sealed

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.870
away, and then you'd
have charred walls,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:51.560
a lot of radioactivity, but you
could in your 20 percent time

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.920
discretely work
to clean that up,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.020
and maybe the news
of what happened

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:03.130
would not reach your
immediate superiors.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.170
If it were a substantially
larger chunk of astatine,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.140
then there would be no one
left to submit paperwork to.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.930
And that is what would
happen with the seventh row.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.520
And so the seventh
row-- we're getting down

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.840
into the elements that
just have numbers,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.090
and they have not
settled on names yet.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.820
When I was a kid and
learning the periodic table--

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.440
and playing Pokemon and
being really totally

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.350
well-adjusted and very,
very popular and social,

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.980
but also memorizing the
periodic table-- I found

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.230
there were a whole bunch
of elements that got you up

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.760
to 100-- you could get
up to 105 or so, or 110.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.890
Some of the books I
had went up to 110.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.430
But then they stopped, and all
of those didn't have names.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.380
They would just be like
"unun-something-ium"

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.540
that was like this
naming convention.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.880
And they've start
assigning names recently.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.699
They've started finishing it up.

00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:07.990
But we're also at a really
interesting situation, which

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.630
is that they have
synthesized elements,

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.920
as of a couple of
years ago, they finally

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.130
synthesized element number
118 in a particle accelerator,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.670
which means that
they've squared off

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.476
the bottom of the
periodic table,

00:26:19.476 --> 00:26:22.100
because they finished out a row,
which is not something-- which

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.400
has not been the case for a
very, very, very long time.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.320
And when I saw that, because
all the periodic tables

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.910
I learned as a little kid had
an extra line that ended halfway

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.130
across.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.960
And I don't know if it's
a typographic thing,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.810
but I feel like it's
very, very satisfying

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.830
have the nice, square,
rounded-off shape.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.960
And it gives me this weird urge
to sabotage particle physics

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.190
experiments, so they don't
synthesize element 119

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.230
and ruin the really
nice justification.

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.490
But the reason that the elements
are only being filled in right

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.350
now is that they're
very hard to produce,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.220
and they are very short-lived.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.440
And so astatine, the reason
it decays so violently

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.040
and destroys the
building you're in,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.690
is that its half-life
is only eight hours.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.290
So it dumps all
of that stored up

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.470
radioactive energy
in eight hours.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.290
Some of the elements at the
bottom of the periodic table

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.520
will decay-- they have
half-lives-- some of them

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.300
are measured in seconds and a
couple of them in milliseconds.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.310
So all of the energy
that's released

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.410
by your column of
heated astatine rising

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.200
into the stratosphere over
the course of an afternoon

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:41.610
will be released by these
elements now, right away.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.500
It would be sort of like
a nuclear chain reaction,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.740
only it's not one
part triggering--

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.282
it's not one of them decays,
and that triggers the other ones

00:27:51.282 --> 00:27:51.781
to decay.

00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:53.250
It's not a chain in that sense.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.310
It's just a reaction.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.720
It all happens it once.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.910
However, there is sort
of a chain element,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.860
because the elements that are up
way far on the periodic table,

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.690
some of them will emit a couple
of protons and neutrons, which

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.990
now makes-- element 118
has 118 protons-- it decays

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.280
immediately, releases some
protons, and becomes element--

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.910
maybe it drops down two spaces--
it becomes element 116, which

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.160
is also extremely radioactive
and has a very short half-life.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.040
And so you get
these decay chains,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.210
all of them pouring out a
whole bunch more and more

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.720
and more energy all at once.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.570
And the energy
released-- so if you

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.310
were able to watch this whole
scenario from very, very, very

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.534
far away, on one of
the mountains-- which

00:28:45.534 --> 00:28:46.950
way are the
prevailing winds here?

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.199
They come in from the ocean,
so I guess from the west,

00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:53.470
out over the east, so maybe
to the south in the mountains,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:29:00.180
southwest-- anyway you
would first see this,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.500
because the energy released
in the first few seconds

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.110
would be on the order of that
from a medium-sized nuclear

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.260
weapon.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.850
But because of
these decay chains,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.780
these things just continue and
continue decaying and decaying.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.200
So it's like a nuclear bomb
which just keeps exploding.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.900
And what happens is you've
got your wall, which

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:25.370
existed for-- if it's made
out of one liter blocks,

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.650
I guess it'll be a
couple of metres wide.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.590
It will take light in the
neighborhood of 10 nanoseconds

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.620
to cross from one side
of the wall to the other.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.450
So you have that
much time to enjoy it

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.010
before the radiation
vaporizes it.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.620
But it vaporizes
it, but you've still

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.900
got this plasma of these
radioactive nuclei, which

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.050
are continuing to decay.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.630
So your mushroom
cloud is now pouring

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.540
out all these radioactive
products and elements,

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.520
and it's continuing to become
super-hot the winds carry it

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.590
away from you, cover
everything downwind,

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.690
and it's only-- I
only realized very,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.350
very recently that when
you have a mushroom cloud,

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:11.760
and you have all the heavy
dust and stuff with the uranium

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.329
dust on it that is in
the mushroom cloud,

00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:17.120
but it's heavier than
air-- so as it cools,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.340
it falls down from the cloud
on to the ground, which

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.940
is actually why it
is called fallout,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.250
because it falls out
of the mushroom cloud.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.850
And I guess that's sort
obvious in retrospect,

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.640
but it had never occurred
to me until just now.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.220
So this cloud is full of this
stuff, which falls out of it

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.170
and covers land.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.970
And this stuff is
rapidly decaying.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.910
All of these elements
way down the table

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.580
are decaying until
they reach something

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.850
so stable as astatine, and
then they take a break.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.390
And that is a much
more calm situation,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.950
because then it's just
superheated plasma and not

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:05.990
quite as superheated
exotic particle mess.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:12.060
So this whole mushroom
cloud will continue spilling

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.860
out this stuff as
it goes downwind,

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.050
rendering more and more
areas uninhabitable

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.400
for long periods of time.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.770
And from a nuclear
cleanup point of view,

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:30.972
it's sort of hard to figure out
what to model this on, because

00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.680
of the way that the
steam is superheated,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.410
and it's all mixed
in this cloud.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.856
And you've got a lot
of heat, and then a lot

00:31:35.856 --> 00:31:37.790
of cold environments, and a lot
of high pressure environments,

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.820
and then low pressure
environments.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.400
And you have samples of
literally every single element

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.630
in this-- at least
at first-- you

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.320
have all of chemistry
happening at once.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.820
Every different pair of atoms
that can run into each other

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.362
will be running into each other
here somewhere in your cloud.

00:31:58.362 --> 00:32:00.403
And they were doing it
under every different kind

00:32:00.403 --> 00:32:01.110
of condition.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.552
So every product that could
happen from a reaction

00:32:04.552 --> 00:32:06.510
that you're like, oh,
this is hard to clean up,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.730
will be happening in this cloud.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.660
So in addition to all
of the radioactivity

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.118
and all of everything, if you
just flip through a chemistry

00:32:14.118 --> 00:32:15.880
book, and you can
point like anything,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.870
you will have that
problem to deal with too.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.525
And also at this
point, it's definitely

00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:23.990
the least your problems,
but all I can think

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:27.710
is also there's a liter
of fluorine in there too.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.350
And I'll just have
my gas mask, and I'd

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.490
be thinking about that too.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.730
So this, if nothing
else, definitely

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.320
helped me come to
terms with my sort

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.470
of Pokemon-inspired frustration
that you can only buy 85 or 90

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:55.140
of the 118 elements, because
this has really driven home

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.410
that the most important
thing an element

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.930
collecting is that you
do not catch them all.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:07.570
But I got this-- I had
come up with the scenario.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.940
And I have physics background.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.730
And in doing what-- I've
gotten a lot more into geology.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.189
I was learning about
the way continents

00:33:17.189 --> 00:33:19.480
break apart as you do various
horrible things to them--

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.521
that's been a lot of fun.

00:33:20.521 --> 00:33:22.690
And I've also learned a
lot more biology lately,

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.840
but I feel like chemistry
has always been something

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.680
that I've had a
harder time with,

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.050
maybe just because there
are a lot of things

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.630
that-- this atom is more
electronegative than this atom.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.210
But we don't have a real
life-- it's sort of harder

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.720
to connect that to real life.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.450
And you know quantum mechanics
can be hard in the same way.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.866
And I really like
stuff where it's

00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:48.950
easy to think about intuitively,
like mass and speed and force,

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.680
because you can think
about this is an object.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.590
This is an apple.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.580
This weighs this much.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.830
This is what a kilogram means.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.940
This is what a ton means.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.190
And so I feel like I had a
harder time with chemistry.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.150
And so after I
finished this article

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:05.070
I got, because I was
writing this for my book

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.860
and had a little bit more
luxury-- I could have a longer

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.754
deadline-- I got in touch
with a professional chemist,

00:34:12.754 --> 00:34:14.170
because I wanted
to run it by him.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.670
And I said here are all these
reactions that I've worked out

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.128
that I think will happen, but
I wanted you to look over it.

00:34:19.128 --> 00:34:20.600
And let me know what you think.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.310
And this guy was really helpful.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.730
I talked to Derek Lowe, who's
a chemist who also writes

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.560
the drug industry blog
"In the Pipeline,"

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.159
which I had read for a while.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.449
And so he went
through my article.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.190
And actually his
first question was,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.340
if you're going to build this,
this would definitely not

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.380
be a good idea.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.540
He said, so what form
is the carbon in?

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.469
Do I get to specify?

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.059
Do I get to be a giant
chunk of diamond?

00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:48.100
And I said, I don't know.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:53.179
And he said, well,
because diamond,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.400
it will actually burn if
you get it hot enough.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.490
But that's pretty difficult.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.350
And you'd have sort of the
problem-- the same thing that

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.670
happened with some of the
Cold War-era projects,

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.330
which is if you have an
explosion like this, that's

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.600
this violent, the question is
will it fling the thing away

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.164
before it delivers enough
energy to disintegrate it?

00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:17.080
So he said there's a
decent chance that-- when

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.970
you have this radioactive
nuclear bomb going off--

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:24.950
that it's possible that
the diamond will not

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.240
be incinerated.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.100
So back in the early
days when we were still

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.800
doing nuclear weapons tests,
there was this series of tests

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.520
underground.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.900
One of them was
Operation Plumbbob,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.820
where they had a
nuclear weapon going off

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:47.210
in an underground
chamber with a shaft

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.980
connecting to the surface.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.300
And the shaft had a
cement plug and an iron--

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.000
some kind of heavy steel-- cap
on it blocking the top of it.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.230
And some of them had been
doing some calculations

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.860
about when you have the
incredibly high pressures

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.100
in this, they have nowhere
to go except up the shaft.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.170
They're going to hit this plug.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.470
And they think the
plug will not actually

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.240
be disintegrated by this,
but it might be hurled away.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.640
And there was an interview
with one of them,

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.630
where he talked about
it they weren't sure

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.011
how fast it was-- they thought
it was going to be flung /

00:36:22.011 --> 00:36:24.260
and they were coming up with
some sort of high numbers

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.610
for the speed.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.060
And so they what did is they
trained a high-speed camera

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.120
about a quarter mile away
on the mouth of the shaft,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.830
just to catch anything
that happened.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:43.380
And so they detonated
the bomb and they

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.880
had this high-speed
camera-- I think

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.630
they said it was running
around 300 frames

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:54.230
a second-- the plug that was
over the top of the shaft

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.420
appears in the air in one frame.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.150
So they can put a lower bound
on how fast it was going,

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.590
but they do not
have an upper one.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.230
The lower bound is a-- I tried
to run through the calculations

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.211
myself using the field
of view of the camera.

00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:14.710
It's a little bit
tricky calculate--

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.670
but it is a double digit number
of kilometers per second.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.380
One of them-- one [INAUDIBLE]
was about 65 kilometers

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.050
per second.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.600
And that's interesting
because you'll see sometimes

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.760
the Helios 2 probes that we sent
around the sun are often listed

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.214
as the fastest human
objects-- the fastest thing

00:37:35.214 --> 00:37:35.880
we've ever made.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.020
And frame of
reference questions,

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.030
it's hard to figure
out how to define that.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.924
But with reference to the sun,
the thing it was going around,

00:37:42.924 --> 00:37:45.340
they dropped so close, they
whipped around it really fast,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.881
and at the bottom
of that they got up

00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:50.540
to about around 60 or 70
kilometers per second.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.370
Depending on exactly how
fast this manhole cover that

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.390
was on top of this
thing was going,

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.880
it is possible that
for a moment this

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:07.290
was the fastest
object ever built.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:11.090
And there was some
thought that this

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:18.160
might have-- if it was going
at 60 kilometers a second,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.160
the escape velocity from
the surface of the earth

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.490
is less than 10
kilometers per second.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.990
And in fact, the escape velocity
from the whole solar system

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:33.340
from where we are is only
about 40 kilometers per second.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:43.410
And so this manhole cover,
which was never found,

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.480
may have left-- it's
possible, given its speed,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.574
it made out of the atmosphere.

00:38:50.574 --> 00:38:52.740
And I actually started doing
a bunch of calculations

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.460
to figure out if it
was going forward

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.880
from the Earth-- like in
the direction of the Earth's

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.750
motion.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.539
If they were pointed toward the
direction the Earth was going,

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.330
you get to add on the
Earth's 30 kilometers

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.644
a second speed around
the sun, when you're

00:39:05.644 --> 00:39:07.310
trying to get up to
the escape velocity.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.330
And so this thing could be going
over 100 kilometers a second,

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.860
which would send it straight
out of the solar system.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.730
And it would be going
way, way faster,

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.480
even after it had lost
all its speed there

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.626
than the Voyager probes
at their fastest.

00:39:19.626 --> 00:39:22.000
And so that would now be our
first representative heading

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.820
for the stars, which is
a really appealing idea.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.212
And I think I came
up with-- I was

00:39:32.212 --> 00:39:34.670
digging through these files
trying to find what time of day

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.679
did this happen, so which
way would the shaft have

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:38.220
been pointed?

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.860
And I think that the
Earth's speed came out

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.790
as kind of a wash.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.370
But it's also sort
of a moot point,

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:54.130
because further calculations
show that probably the metal

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:58.380
cover, because it was
not quite large enough,

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.490
probably did not survive the
impact with the atmosphere.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:09.410
So it would have been sort of
the only-- maybe the only time

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:14.140
in Earth's history that we've
seen a meteor going directly

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.230
upward, burning up
in a plasma trail.

00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:23.517
And so probably that
manhole cover was destroyed,

00:40:23.517 --> 00:40:25.600
but it's possible it is
still out there somewhere.

00:40:28.737 --> 00:40:30.820
So when I talked to the
chemist his first question

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.220
was, hey, that
chunk of diamond--

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.219
it's possible that's just
going to be flung free

00:40:34.219 --> 00:40:37.250
from this explosion,
and have landed OK.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:41.300
And then at the
very least, I would

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.010
like to go and pick
it up and then use it

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.080
to pay for all of the
damage that I did the labs,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.310
and to the city, and
all the rebuilding.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.064
And then he thought
for a second.

00:40:51.064 --> 00:40:53.480
He was like, I would definitely
wipe it off first, though.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.482
What was really fun is he also
got to-- he said you, yeah,

00:41:02.482 --> 00:41:04.190
these reactions that
you've talked about,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.900
they would definitely--
they would happen.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.483
But there are a lot
of really bad ones

00:41:07.483 --> 00:41:10.070
too that you didn't
even get to, you know?

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.135
And he said-- he pointed
out that the selenium

00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:15.760
and the bromine would
react vigorously.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.890
He said the fluorine--
he said you're

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.615
right that fluorine is where
this whole scheme goes to hell.

00:41:21.615 --> 00:41:23.990
That the fluorine, he said,
it would be OK with the neon,

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.710
and it would observe
sort of an "armed truce"

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.000
with the chlorine,
but everything else--

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.530
his exact words were "but
everything else, sheesh."

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.466
But you get further
down the table,

00:41:39.466 --> 00:41:41.340
and he got to throw in
all these fun tidbits.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.800
He said that you're right.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.460
That this would be really
toxic, but also the selenium

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.790
would be burning,
and burning selenium

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.180
is the worst thing
that he'd ever smelled.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.570
And he said it's
like-- he said it

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.066
makes sulfur smell like Chanel.

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:58.440
So the selenium
and the tellurium

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.520
and would both be really,
really awful smelling.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.670
And he listening
then, this would

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.470
produce all these chemicals.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:03.400
And this would produce
all these chemicals.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.860
And this one I've never
worked, and this is why.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.570
You know?

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:12.180
And I found this really,
really satisfying,

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.640
because when I answer
these questions,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.690
people say that I write
all these articles,

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.200
and how come I destroy
the earth so often?

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.446
And how come the
articles always end

00:42:24.446 --> 00:42:25.820
with everyone
dying or something?

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.350
And it's really because
that's the questions

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.170
that people ask me.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.670
That would really
be the consequence

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.740
of the scenario
you're talking about.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.430
But I'm trying to not make them
more dramatic than they are.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.315
I'm trying to tell the real
story of what would happen in

00:42:41.315 --> 00:42:43.080
as fun a way as possible.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.680
But especially with the
chemistry things like this,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.662
I liked going to
experts to find out--

00:42:48.662 --> 00:42:50.120
make sure I'm not
overselling this.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.500
Like, is this
really-- the science

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.860
that I'm talking about-- really
this weird and this horrifying,

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.020
or it is it more
complicated than that?

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:08.280
And it's really nice to
learn that, in fact, reality

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.010
is way more horrifying
than I was able to imagine.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.600
And I think that's
been the most fun

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.440
thing about doing all of
this, is getting to discover

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.130
all this really crazy and
exciting and fun and uplifting

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:29.810
and sometimes really terrifying
stuff that the science can show

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.740
us.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.920
And so we also--
we have some time.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.260
I think we're running into--
we have some time for Q&amp;A,

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.500
if anyone wants to
do any questions.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.960
We've got a
microphone back here.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.130
So you can just-- if anyone
wants to ask any questions,

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:48.190
you can come up there.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Alex Weisen.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.440
I'm the tech lead
manager for Google Voice.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.494
And you've made a few
comic strips on "xkcd"

00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:55.660
that mentioned Google Voice.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.640
And so I just wondered,
is there anything

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.980
we can do for you, anything
we can help you with?

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.500
RANDALL MUNROE: Which ones?

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.970
Sometimes I'll
have people come up

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:08.035
and say, oh, I really
liked in comic 446.

00:44:08.035 --> 00:44:10.814
Can you say, is that
from experience?

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.188
And then they
pause for a minute.

00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:13.695
And I have a moment
where I'm like,

00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:17.580
oh god, they think that
I know them all by heart.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.150
Do they know them all by heart?

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.170
It's weird.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:26.015
And so when people both cite
them by number I don't know,

00:44:26.015 --> 00:44:27.890
but also now I'm trying
to think, what have I

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.080
said about Google?

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.122
Was it nice?

00:44:30.122 --> 00:44:31.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
was pretty nice.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.700
You just made funny jokes.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.490
It's cool.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.550
RANDALL MUNROE: I've had some
fun transcripts delivered

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:37.270
to my phone.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.650
I really enjoy the sort of
the word play aspect of it.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:48.200
Like, here is how the transcript
rendered my dad talking.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.060
Now it's like a
crossword puzzle,

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.940
figuring out what
did he actually say?

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.310
But I assume that a
huge amount of that

00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:01.350
is the quality of the
connection and everything.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.780
But I am kind of
enjoying that part.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.408
So I would say keep that up.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.870
No, I've been really enjoying
the rate at which the voice

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:19.700
recognition has been improving.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.315
Especially recently,
to where we're finally

00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:24.690
getting to the
point where do not

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:28.730
have to mode switch five times
to get voice commands up,

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.330
to then say, OK,
now I want to search

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.884
for this in a clear, loud
voice projecting to everyone.

00:45:33.884 --> 00:45:35.550
I'm really looking
forward to the future

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.965
where you can just
kind of discretely

00:45:36.965 --> 00:45:38.715
be like, oh, what's
the weather right now?

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:40.430
OK, it's this.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.740
So I'm enjoying that.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.381
And keep up the
progress on that.

00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:47.611
Yeah, thank you.

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:48.152
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:48.152 --> 00:45:48.890
It's great to have you here.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.745
I missed your last talk,
as I wasn't at Google yet,

00:45:50.745 --> 00:45:53.220
and I've been waiting--
waiting for this day we finally

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.590
get to see Randall Munroe.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.042
RANDALL MUNROE:
That's satisfying.

00:45:59.042 --> 00:46:01.250
AUDIENCE: In all of the
submissions that you received

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.840
for "What If," were there
ever any that intrigued you,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.700
but that were just
too frightening.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.700
You weren't going to touch
them with a 10-foot pole?

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.570
RANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, there have
been a number of weird things.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.650
I had one person
who in their job

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:25.640
may have conceivably-- they
asked a question about-- a fun

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.700
earth science question
involving nuclear weapons.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:36.730
And their from address, the
TLD that it was coming from,

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:40.087
and the title that was
after their signature,

00:46:40.087 --> 00:46:42.170
and then some of what they
described in the letter

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.050
suggested that perhaps
this was a person who

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.630
had access to nuclear weapons.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:53.720
And that was a little worrying.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.570
I have also gotten
ones from-- I had one

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.070
that I think came from
a doctor that was like,

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.780
suppose that a toxin blocks
the effect of so and so

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.175
on a patient's so
and so receptors,

00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:05.800
and it was delivered
at this dose, what

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.765
would be the effect
of this toxin?

00:47:08.765 --> 00:47:11.390
And that's not sort of the vibe
of the usual "What If" question

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.890
I get.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:19.140
And it gave me the sense
that somewhere there's

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.070
a doctor who's in a
hospital at a computer,

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.770
and there's a nurse coming in
who's like, Doctor, Doctor!

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.764
Asking her, we have
a patient so and so.

00:47:31.764 --> 00:47:32.680
What is your decision?

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.721
What are you going to do?

00:47:33.721 --> 00:47:36.370
They have this talk, and
the doctor's like, hang on.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.520
There's an internet
cartoonist who I really

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.850
think we should ask about this.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.209
And they're waiting
for-- like, we

00:47:43.209 --> 00:47:44.750
have to wait for
this week's article.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.470
But hopefully you'll
tackle this for us.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.169
And so that's definitely
sort of worrying.

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.460
I also get a lot of questions
that are very transparent

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.270
attempts to get me to
do people's homework.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.390
Like, what if you had a ball
was on an inclined plane

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.550
at this many degrees that was
this many centimeters long,

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.300
and you let it go?

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.510
Like, how many
seconds do you think

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.843
it would take to hit the bottom?

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.710
It's like, nice try.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:16.770
And then I think, actually,
the most worrying ones

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.870
are-- there are a
bunch where they're

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:26.550
totally reasonable, legitimate,
answerable questions that I

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.260
still just refuse to tackle.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.540
Which are like-- one of them
was someone asked would it

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.840
be possible to chill your
teeth to such a low temperature

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.266
that drinking a cup of hot
coffee would cause them

00:48:41.266 --> 00:48:41.765
to shatter?

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:53.230
And I included this
question, and I have never

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:57.370
been able to get beyond
the end of that sentence

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:02.320
without just cringing,
because I imagine it.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.340
And so I have never-- I
don't have the stomach

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.761
to do the research to
answer that question.

00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:08.260
And so there are a
couple like that,

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.790
where it's like this
is just pushing it.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.970
But other than that, there's
a huge number of what

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.330
if Superhero X
fought Superhero Y.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:23.916
And I feel like that's
A, sort of hard to answer

00:49:23.916 --> 00:49:26.290
scientifically, because the
powers of the superheros sort

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.040
of change depending
on who's writing them,

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.470
and it will often be the ones
who are sort of infinitely

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.530
powerful, where it's
not really well-defined

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.040
what the limits of
their powers are.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.120
But I've gotten to learn
a great list of all

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.204
of the near-infinite
power superheroes,

00:49:41.204 --> 00:49:43.620
because people really like to
pit them against each other.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.940
And part way I don't
answer that is that,

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.190
in addition to being hard
to tackle with science,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:56.157
it's-- from what I understand--
that's basically the kind

00:49:56.157 --> 00:49:58.490
of question that superhero
comics exist to try to answer

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:59.190
in the first place.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.363
It's like, what if we took
Hero X from mythology X

00:50:01.363 --> 00:50:05.770
and had crossover with
someone from mythology y.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.930
And I was thinking that this--
but this interest in asking

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:12.340
about infinity is
a common trend,

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.910
and it's not limited
to just superheroes,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.760
because before that it's
exactly the same impulse that

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.870
leads people to ask the
old question of could God

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.170
make a rock so heavy
that he can't lift it?

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:31.422
And this question--
you've defined this person

00:50:31.422 --> 00:50:32.380
as infinitely powerful.

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.860
How powerful are they really?

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.050
Goku from "Dragon Ball Z"
I gather, at some point

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.930
becomes nearly
infinitely powerful,

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:41.888
because people keep asking
questions about what

00:50:41.888 --> 00:50:43.714
if he fought the
Hulk or Superman?

00:50:43.714 --> 00:50:45.630
And so I think this is
sort of a common trend,

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:50.860
although I was thinking
that I don't think anyone

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.930
has-- this has been a common
trend throughout history--

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:57.060
but I don't know if they
necessarily always combine them

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.510
with the sort of pitting
rivals, because I

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.150
don't think anyone
who's ever asked in.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.950
What if Goku "Dragon
Ball Z" fought

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:04.430
the God of the Old Testament?

00:51:08.554 --> 00:51:10.720
And I don't know what science
has to say about that,

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:11.740
but if anyone does
discover if they've

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.864
done a crossover comic of
that, please let me know.

00:51:13.864 --> 00:51:14.780
I would read that.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.170
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:16.820
Hope you'll be back soon.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.695
RANDALL MUNROE: Yeah.

00:51:17.695 --> 00:51:19.642
Thank you.

00:51:19.642 --> 00:51:22.020
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.910
You mentioned how
you've been learning

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:25.905
a lot about different
subjects that

00:51:25.905 --> 00:51:28.800
are sort of out of your
original realm of study,

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.470
in terms of chemistry and
biology and these things.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:35.750
How do you go about learning
enough in this new domain

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.450
to be able to produce
a meaningful answer

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:42.410
to these kinds of complex
questions in a complex world?

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.680
RANDALL MUNROE: I
think one sort of skill

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.855
that I have gained that I didn't
really have before this, was I

00:51:52.855 --> 00:51:58.060
have learned to read-- skim--
a whole lot of research that

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.390
does not turn out to be
relevant really fast.

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:04.360
Like download 40
PDFs on some subject,

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.860
skim each one looking
for, does this

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.690
have the equation
that I'm looking for?

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.890
Does this have something
that I'm looking for--

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.140
and discard them really quickly,
like doing blind-- going down

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.696
blind avenues or dead ends.

00:52:13.696 --> 00:52:15.820
I haven't learned to avoid
doing dead end research,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.790
but I've learned to do it
as quickly as possible.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:25.690
But the other thing is
people are-- whenever

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.950
I write about one of these--
I'll write about some space

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:32.080
thing, and someone will say, oh,
yeah, I don't know about that.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.800
I didn't-- I know
you worked at NASA.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.474
So you know about what
happens when the moon collides

00:52:36.474 --> 00:52:37.640
with something or something.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.610
And it's like my
formal education.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.354
I was working in a
robotics lab at NASA.

00:52:42.354 --> 00:52:44.270
And I've worked on some
virtual reality stuff.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.720
But the physics of the moon
running into things stuff

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.190
was like if we were hanging
out at lunch talking about it.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.590
But I think more
than anything, just

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.284
there hits a point
in the night where

00:52:57.284 --> 00:52:58.950
I stop getting anything
productive done.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.366
And if I have
Wikipedia tabs open,

00:53:00.366 --> 00:53:02.170
I'll just start
reading from there,

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:05.540
and it will never be
anything useful for what

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.540
I'm doing right
then, but often I'll

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.350
learn all about something
that two weeks later is

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.290
the answer to a
question that comes up.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:19.215
So just a lot of totally
unfocused reading

00:53:19.215 --> 00:53:22.460
of Wikipedia or
weird papers ends up

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.789
coming in handy later on.

00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:25.080
AUDIENCE: And lots of Googling?

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.871
RANDALL MUNROE: Hm?

00:53:25.871 --> 00:53:27.200
AUDIENCE: And lots of Googling?

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.350
RANDALL MUNROE: Yes,
I've actually found--

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.516
so everyone's like, oh,
yeah, do spend a lot of time

00:53:30.516 --> 00:53:35.837
on ResearchGate, JSTOR-- how
do you pronounce-- A-R-X-I-V?

00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:37.170
That's another I've never heard.

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:37.961
Is it just archive?

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.650
Yeah, but I found that-- and
even Google Scholar and stuff--

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.130
and I use all of
those, but I have

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:49.700
found that if you're looking for
weird research that maybe isn't

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.029
the easiest to find--
maybe it was a government

00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:54.070
study in the Cold War that
has been declassified,

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:56.153
but not really they haven't
published [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:56.153 --> 00:53:58.930
I have a lot more luck just
googling for the search terms

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:02.440
that I would been looking for
and adding "PDF" to the end.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.249
In terms of does this
get me a paper that

00:54:04.249 --> 00:54:05.790
answers the question
I'm looking for,

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.940
that has a higher hit rate
than any of the specialized

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.460
services.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.580
So I appreciate that.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.780
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.620
RANDALL MUNROE: Thank you.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.840
AUDIENCE: Hi, so you had
a lot of fans show up.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.230
And that's just
to hear you talk.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.495
You must get a bunch of
requests on the email address

00:54:24.495 --> 00:54:27.400
that you use for us
to ask you questions.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.470
I was wondering how many
of those do you get,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:30.880
and how do you
whittle them down?

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.510
And really what I
would like to know

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.377
is how do I ask you
the perfect question

00:54:34.377 --> 00:54:35.460
that you end up answering?

00:54:38.262 --> 00:54:39.470
RANDALL MUNROE: I don't know.

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:47.184
So it's really nice to that
so many of you came out here.

00:54:47.184 --> 00:54:48.600
Although I feel
like that's easier

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.240
to do when it's appearing at a
workplace, because it's like,

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.680
so do I work on
the thing that I'm

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.070
supposed to do
this evening, or go

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:56.725
hang out of the
talk about comics?

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:04.630
I'm flattered, but I figure--

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.090
But there are definitely a
lot of questions submitted,

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:11.950
and I will admit to doing--
there's some sort of filters

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:12.950
that I put on the inbox.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:15.609
So after a little bit
I started filtering out

00:55:15.609 --> 00:55:17.650
the names of all of the
invulnerable superheroes,

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:20.800
because they were just too
many questions about them that

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.680
were never ones that I was
going to be able to answer.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:32.080
I also filtered out the word
"woodchuck" after week one.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.190
Because the first time
someone submitted "hey,

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:37.180
how much would could a
woodchuck really chuck

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.450
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?"

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:39.950
I laughed.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:40.922
I was like that's
funny, and then

00:55:40.922 --> 00:55:42.900
the second time I was like,
oh, yeah, hey, someone else

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.775
thought of that joke.

00:55:43.775 --> 00:55:48.800
And then in the first week it
was like 70 or 80 emails that

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.440
were just the same
woodchuck joke,

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.980
and then by then I was like,
OK, I now hate that rhyme,

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.030
and I refuse to
answer any questions

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:58.920
about woodchucks on principle.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.140
But other than that,
I actually find

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:07.100
some of my favorite questions
come from little kids,

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:12.180
because adults will sort of try
to be really clever about it

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.230
and come up with a
question that suggests all

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:16.220
these horrible
consequences, and they've

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.410
set up a scenario that's going
to result in a mushroom cloud

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.280
engulfing wherever it
is you're doing this.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.530
Whereas little kids will ask
extremely straightforward

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.905
questions like, I want to
build a billion-story building.

00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:28.140
Can I do that?

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.700
And then answering
takes you in a bunch

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.330
of unexpected directions.

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:38.330
So my advice to people who
are submitting questions

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.330
is mostly ask little
kids for questions,

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.732
because they have
some of the best ones.

00:56:43.732 --> 00:56:44.815
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:46.148
RANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, thank you.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:52.570
AUDIENCE: I guess I am the last
one here, so I want to ask you

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.400
something I asked Vin
Diesel, because you

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.840
have a lot in common with him.

00:56:59.339 --> 00:57:00.380
RANDALL MUNROE: OK, wait.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.310
Hang on.

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.894
Before you ask your
question, which parts?

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.650
AUDIENCE: I think
both of you have

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:14.740
a real passion for geeky things.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.464
RANDALL MUNROE: Yeah, he was
a role playing guy, wasn't he?

00:57:17.464 --> 00:57:18.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so I was wondering

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.963
if you'd want to join us
for Dungeons and Dragons?

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.790
RANDALL MUNROE: Sure, so here's
the qualifier-- the thing

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.745
for this-- possibly.

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:43.260
Coming back to this theme again,
the more social geeky pursuits,

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.270
I didn't really get into
until I went away to college.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:52.610
And then eventually got a job
working with more geeky people.

00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:55.220
So when I was a kid, I knew
about Dungeons and Dragons

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.590
but never actually
played it with people.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:02.270
So what I did is I got a bunch
of-- my closest exposure to it

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.370
was the single player NetHack
and derivatives, Angband

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.060
and stuff, which
I played through

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.754
for several years every day.

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:13.545
So all of my Dungeons
and Dragons knowledge

00:58:13.545 --> 00:58:14.680
is secondhand from that.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.550
The one time I did play Dungeons
and Dragons, the DM was like,

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:19.410
OK, your character.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:21.870
You've at this point
picked up a weapon,

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:24.509
which only you can pick it up.

00:58:24.509 --> 00:58:25.550
It's magically enchanted.

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:28.940
If anyone else-- it's a
10-pound ax-- or something,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:33.400
and if anyone else picks it
up, it weighs 1,000 pounds.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.740
If anyone else touches it, in
fact, it weighs 1,000 pounds.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:40.450
And I was immediately
like, OK, wait a minute.

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:43.440
Is there a water
wheel in this town?

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:48.730
Can I get someone else from the
party or a peasant or someone?

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.624
I want to strap the
ax to the water wheel,

00:58:50.624 --> 00:58:53.040
and have the handle sticking
out, like my hand on one side

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.414
and their hand on
the other side.

00:58:54.414 --> 00:58:56.140
And we'll get it spinning.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.694
And then we'll have it weighted.

00:58:57.694 --> 00:59:00.110
So it's really heavy, but then
it comes around to my side,

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.360
and I touch it, and
suddenly it's light,

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.800
and the it starts spinning
faster and faster.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.070
And then we get it spinning
up to the speed that's

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:08.710
the maximum speed that the
water wheel can handle.

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:11.750
And then we pull the axles
out so it drops to the ground.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:15.510
And then we've got
this giant heavy water

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:18.050
wheel spinning at
a fantastic rate.

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:20.890
It'll go tearing across the
landscape toward the enemies

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.485
who we're trying to fight.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.610
There was this very
nice woman in college

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:37.460
who invited me to play that one
time and then didn't invite me

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.580
back.

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:44.310
My D&amp;D experience is limited,
but I would love to try it out.

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:45.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.740
RANDALL MUNROE: And thank you.
