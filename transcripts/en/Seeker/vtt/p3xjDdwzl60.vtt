Has your love life been stuck in a rut lately?

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:10.809
Maybe you should spice it up with a stay at
a motel, hotel...

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.990
So, it’s no secret that after a while, sometimes
love loses it’s spark. Couples get stressed

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.750
and busy and sex just doesn’t seem to be
a priority any more. Some might turn to expert

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.280
advice, a sex therapist might tell you to
try new things or get away for some quality

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.660
time. But, simple hotel sex might be just
what the doctor ordered.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.879
According to a 2004 National Leisure Travel
Monitor study, one third of couples reported

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.219
they had more sex while on vacation. So clearly
people are already taking advantage of a little

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.219
get away!

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.160
So what is about a hotel that gets people
all hot and heavy?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.309
Well for one it sets the mood. A hotel room,
could ease stress. Psychotherapist Ian Kerner

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.350
says getting out of the house might be away
to leave all your cares behind literally.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.810
In a hotel, there’s no distractions or reminders
of life’s daily stressors. No bills to be

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.240
paid, no laundry thrown all over the floor.
He told the Huffington Post that in a hotel

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.729
“you’re in a place out of time, out of
your life” and this “creates a boundary

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.299
[between yourself] and anxiety and stressors
of everyday life, [which] is going to contribute

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.299
to sexual arousal."

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.259
And he’s not the psychologist who thinks
a get away is a good idea. Participating in

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.310
a new experience with your loved one can bring
back that old spark in other ways. Social

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.500
Psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron, believes that
when couples are first in love they stay up

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.530
all night learning about each other. This
facilitates what’s called self expansion,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.320
when you include the other person as part
of yourself. That buzz wears off after while,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.840
but Aron told the New York Times that he thinks
“couples can get some of that back by doing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.820
challenging and exciting things together.”

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.840
But don’t just take psychologist's word
for it. Your brain thinks so too. Sex in a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.329
new environment is definitely a change of
pace, and the sheer novelty of the situation

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.000
may help bring back the spark!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.569
We are wired to get a kick out of new things,
new things help improve memory and learning.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.110
And one study published in the journal Neuron
found out how. In a cleverly designed study,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.260
the researchers found that new photos participants
had never seen before activated the midbrain,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
but the photos they had seen did not. The
midbrain is part of our brain's reward system.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.080
Specifically the substantia nigra/ventral
tegmental area, is responsible for a lot of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.330
our motivations and rewards, but it also plays
a role in dopamine production. So, basically,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.390
the researchers found that experiencing novelty
effects dopamine levels. And this hit of dopamine

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.720
makes us feel pretty good for evolutionary
reasons. The researchers said that "Seeking

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.390
new and unfamiliar experiences is a fundamental
behavioural tendency in humans and animals”.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.599
And if you remember some earlier DNews episodes,
you might know that dopamine is often called

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.530
the pleasure hormone, since it’s released
during pleasurable experiences like eating

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.560
sweets and yes sex. We get little rewards
when we do certain things that benefit us.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.930
Dopamine is a complex neurotransmitter, and
it does more than just reward us, it also

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.150
drives our desires and it’s released with
the anticipation of a pleasurable experience,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.379
even if that experience never happens. Anticipation
can be pleasurable all on it's own. So, a

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.470
new experience with your loved one might prime
the brain for a pleasurable experience to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.470
come.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.090
So get your of your relationship rut and go
check into the nearest hotel and get your

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.090
love on!

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.470
Sex is such a huge part of the human experience,
heck it’s a huge part of the experience

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.239
of all life. But why?

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.780
Why do we have sex at all?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.080
