00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.457
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:03.790
SPEAKER 1: When you think
about the future of aerospace,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.880
your mind might
go someplace big.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.460
Taking a commercial flight to
Mars at the speed of light,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.260
commuting to work on a passenger
drone, or living in an aeroship

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.990
the size of a small city.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.170
All good ideas, albeit
a bit far fetched.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
So then what if I told you
the real future of aerospace,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.500
it's happening right now.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.736
And it's all about, well, you.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.160
For the past couple
of years, the world

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.620
has been abuzz with news
that we may be getting closer

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.080
to commercial space travel.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.540
Private space companies
seem to be breaking barriers

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.380
every week, getting us closer
to the dream of spending

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.180
your holiday orbiting the earth.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.160
Yes, that is one vision
of the future of flight.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.140
But there are other huge steps
in the world of aerospace

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.200
that are being taken to
help improve holidays

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200
down here on Earth.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.500
GUY NORRIS: The future in
the next five or six years,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.140
you're going to see a lot more
tiny features on aeroplanes

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.110
that the normal person in the
street wouldn't appreciate,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.570
but they make a huge
difference to both

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.330
the emissions of an aircraft in
terms of noise and fuel burn.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.400
And generally it's going to
be a drive towards a more

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.320
sustainable future in aviation.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.220
Because the
emissions that you're

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950
going to put into
the atmosphere,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.550
the drive to reduce
that is going

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.124
to be absolutely critical.

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:21.540
SPEAKER 1: The
future of aerospace

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.120
is dependent on protecting
our planet and the people that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.870
live here.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.600
That's why there is a push
for changes big and small.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410
From hybrid planes that use both
electric and traditional fuel

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.610
sources to propel aircraft
through the air to new winglet

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.340
designs that help increase fuel
efficiency, even a little bit.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.060
We've experienced a turn
toward sustainable energy

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.960
on the ground, either in
our cars or in our homes.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.080
So why not in the air?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.030
The future of
aerospace might also

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.750
mean not sitting in
an airport all day.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.710
ED WILSON: So the
future of airlines,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.520
aircraft in the commercial
world is all about

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.010
getting people efficiently
from point to point.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.120
So we're finding that we're
improving our technologies

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.760
on the flight deck to enhance
the capabilities to getting

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.650
an airplane in and
out of airfields

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.155
sometimes when the
weather is poor.

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:10.530
SPEAKER 1: And in
the future when

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.010
you arrive at your
destination, you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.260
won't even feel like you've just
flown halfway across the world.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.050
GUY NORRIS: Boeing, for
example, has led the drive

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.050
to reduce the cabin
altitude so that instead

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.210
of being at the top of
an 8,000 foot mountain,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.919
you're sitting at 5,000 feet.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.710
It doesn't sound that
much of a difference,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.560
but believe me on an
eight hour journey

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.726
you're going to feel more
human when you get there.

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:34.350
SPEAKER 1: It's all
these small changes

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.176
that the average traveler
may never notice.

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.050
The price of your ticket
may go down a little

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.870
because a new lighter plane
is using less fuel to get you

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.170
where you need to go.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.070
You'll notice fewer
planes flying overhead,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.210
because they're too quiet
to draw your attention.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.960
You'll wake up from a
cross country flight

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.720
feeling refreshed because the
cabin lights have synced up

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.210
with your diurnal clock.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.120
Many people think the
future of aerospace

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.760
will be big bold steps
to take us beyond what

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220
we thought was capable.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.040
And it will be.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.540
But first aerospace
is going to make

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.580
your journey more
comfortable and try and help

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.370
the planet along the way.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.120
But don't worry, you may
still get that space vacation

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.645
to Mars.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.060
This is the Farnborough
International Air Show,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390
one of the biggest
air shows in the world

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.390
and a place that is as connected
to flying in aeronautics

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.640
as any other place on Earth.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.970
And over 100 years later, it is
still synonymous with flight.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.660
SPEAKER 2: It's a
celebration of flying.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.710
And as I drove in today, I
saw people already lined out

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.455
with their cameras ready to take
pictures of these aircrafts.

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:34.830
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for watching

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.750
