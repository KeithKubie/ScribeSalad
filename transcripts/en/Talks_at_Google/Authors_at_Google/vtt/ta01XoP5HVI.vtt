[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.400
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: This
is from the second book,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.335
but the only spoiler in it
is that my main character is

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:12.710
an astronaut at
this point, which

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.080
I trust is not a spoiler
since the title of the series

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.930
is the "Lady Astronaut" series.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.680
So, you know-- so
everything is ruined now.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.250
So this is from "The Faded Sky."

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.570
And part of the reason that
I'm reading this section is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.720
because it takes place in
the Neutral Buoyancy Lab,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.530
and I actually got to go to the
Neutral Buoyancy Lab and watch

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.770
a full dev run--
development run--

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.850
with an astronaut.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.860
And the astronaut,
Kjell Lindgren,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.670
said when he was inviting me--
he was like, do you want to--

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.355
do you want to come
and watch me do this?

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.480
You'll be able to watch
the suit up and everything.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.521
You can hang out all day.

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.760
But you probably won't want to
because it'll be really boring.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.210
And I'm like, so,
Kjell, you know how

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.710
I'm a professional puppeteer?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.510
Next time you're
in New York, if you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.712
want to go hang out on
Sesame Street, let me know,

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:07.670
but you probably won't
want to hang out all day

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.060
because it'll be really boring.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.820
He acknowledged I had a point.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940
And spoiler, not boring at all.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.830
So I also do the audiobooks.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.690
And what you're
going to see, aside

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.000
from the presence of a
microphone and headphones,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.315
is actually the way I
recorded this in the studio.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.350
"The thing about wearing
a space suit on Earth

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.720
is that it's designed
for lower gravity.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.180
Even being in the Neutral
Buoyancy Lab's pool

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.700
didn't change the fact
that gravity pulled at me.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.830
Sure, it didn't
pull at the suit,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.420
but inside, I slid around every
time I change orientation.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.269
As a woman, I was
smaller than the men

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:52.810
the suits had been
designed for, so I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.050
had to wear padding around my
hips to sort of wedge me in.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.760
This kept the air
bubble surrounding me

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.800
inside the suit
distributed evenly,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.260
allowing me to move from
horizontal to vertical

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.530
over the course of the NBL
run without fighting gravity.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.450
Without the padding,
the air bubble

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.030
acted like a giant beach
ball strapped my stomach,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.880
always wanting to be pointed
up toward the surface.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.600
It made it difficult to
roll in any other direction.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.970
In truth, having an air
bubble inside the suit

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.270
wouldn't be a problem
in space, but the NBL

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.070
was where people
decided if you had

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.800
what it took to do a
spacewalk, so neither I,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.050
nor any of the other
women, would complain.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.280
No, sir.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.180
Everything was splendid, and we
were happy to be in the pool.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.790
I hung sideways in the water
with the fiberglass shell

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.710
digging into my armpit.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.040
My neck burned from holding
my head up inside my helmet.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.490
My fingers ached from forcing
my stiff gloves to close

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.050
on the edge of the solar panel.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.580
We were practicing repairing.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.380
With the suits pressurized at
4.9 PSI above ambient pressure,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.070
every movement felt like working
against a heavy duty spring.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.560
It wasn't exactly like
working in a vacuum,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.590
but it gave us a sense of
how exhausting it would be.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.690
A wrinkle in my glove felt like
a metal wire across my knuckle,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.420
as the pressure made it rigid.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.920
But if you asked
me how I was doing,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.820
I would be so
very, very chipper.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.550
On the other side of the
panel, Rafael Avelino

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.180
swore in Portuguese as his
gloves slid off the wrench.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.580
Our support divers
floated in a pod around us

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.040
and let the wrench drift away.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.290
Their job was to keep
us safe, and ours

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.110
was to learn how to
do repairs in zero g.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.350
Tethered to the MWS or
'mini-workstation' on the chest

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.660
of a spacesuit, the
wrench didn't go far,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.650
but it was still a
pain reeling it in.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.140
As Rafael's curses
buzzed over the comm,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.420
I grinned inside my helmet.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.590
'I'm beginning to understand why
Parker is learning Portuguese.'

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.570
On my left and
slightly below me,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.880
Leonard helped me steady
the panel as Rafael

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.750
got the wrench back into place.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.110
'We all need more
languages to swear in.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.750
I've just got Latin and Greek,
and there's only so far that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.590
can take you.'

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.400
Oh, yeah?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.020
What's a Latin curse like?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.440
Rafael placed the wrench
again and receded his feet

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.580
in the foot restraint secured
in a WIF mechanical receptor

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.010
on the mock-up
exterior of our craft.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.079
What does WIF stand for?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.370
No idea.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.579
At a certain point, the
acronyms just become the name.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.390
WIF was Widget Interface
Fuggedaboutit."

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.030
That's the actual answer that
I got from an actual astronaut

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.630
when I asked what that meant.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.120
"One of the many benefits to
building the ships in space

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.910
was that we didn't have to
worry about aerodynamics.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.970
Whiffs and grips covered
the surface of the ship.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.020
Rafael's wrench slipped again,
but he didn't lose his grasp.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
'Because I could use some
more curses right now.'

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.980
Leonard hesitated,
and then, chuckled.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.330
'Actually, most of them aren't
things I can say in mixed

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.250
company.'

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.030
'Please.' I braced against
my foot restraint as Rafael

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.900
finally got the wrench engaged.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.270
'Say the fucking Latin.'

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.640
That got a huge
laugh from both men,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.220
though my face flamed
at having said it.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.190
Thank god the helmets meant
they couldn't see me clearly.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.110
Even for a laugh,
that kind of language

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.900
was not in my normal vocabulary.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.230
And then, predictably, Jason
Tsao, our Sim Sup du jour,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.280
crackled into our ears.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.310
'Language.' 'Va me, puto,
concacavi me,' Leonard intoned

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.940
with great solemnity.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.215
Rafael's head came
up in his helmet.

00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:28.900
'Huh.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.000
That is close enough to
Portuguese that I actually

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.390
understood it, mostly.'

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.440
'Gentlemen.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.520
Lady.'

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.030
For a guy from Chicago, Tsao
could be so prim sometimes.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.970
'We have visitors, and
they are listening.'

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.460
The three of us exchanged
glances and Rafael

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.170
rolled his eyes.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.550
'What language do they speak?'

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.945
'English.' Through
the microphone,

00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:54.320
we could just make out someone
talking in the background,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.960
but not the substance
of the conversation.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.110
The Sim Sup's response
was sharp and biting.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.570
'No bringing them up
early is absolutely out

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.110
of the--' and then
his mic cut off.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.317
What had that been?

00:06:07.317 --> 00:06:09.650
Through the water, I couldn't
see what the guys thought,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.050
so I just stood there
bracing the panel.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.110
It wasn't like the Sim Sup
to leave his mic open, which

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.480
raised the question of
what sort of visitors

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.760
would distract him
that badly, to say

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.180
nothing of who might be asking
us to come out of the NBL

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.380
early.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.390
Rafael got that bolt tightened
down, and we moved on as a unit

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.580
to extend the next
piece of the panel.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.520
This was the fourth time we'd
done this particular NBL run,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.560
and each time, we
got a little faster.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.690
Of course, it
wasn't likely that I

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.510
would be the one doing
the EVA, but the IAC

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.480
believed in overpreparation.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.950
And after my late start,
I supported them in that.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.610
Besides, it would make being the
IV person, the intravehicular

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.730
person, easier if I knew
what they were facing.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.430
Given the communication lags we
would have during the mission,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.020
we couldn't rely
on ground control

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.200
to coach the EV team
in every scenario.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.600
'Folks, we're going to stand
down on extending the array.'

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.510
The Sim Sup's voice
crackled, then

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.280
the microphone
rustled and shifted,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.500
as though he were
handing it off.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.860
We floated underwater with the
constant hum of fans and sound

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.720
of our own breath as company.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.270
Then Director Clemons
came on the comm.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.190
'We have to pull
Dr. Flannery out,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.740
but Dr. York and Captain
Avelino will stay and work

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.730
through the cleanup.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.680
Dr. Flannery, I need you
out of the pool pronto.'--

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.440
Leonard drew a breath as
if he was going to argue,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.250
then snapped his mouth shut so
hard I heard his teeth click.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.420
'Yes, sir.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.360
See you topside.'

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.720
I am ashamed to say that
my primary emotion was not

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.960
curiosity or even annoyance
that our training had

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.010
been interrupted, but relief
that for once, it wasn't me.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.290
Leonard turned from us and
let the divers drag him

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.150
through the water
to the platform that

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.250
would carry him to the surface.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.680
Rafael and I
floated in the pool.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.230
I let my head slump against
the side of my helmet

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.510
and closed my eyes for a
moment while our support

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.760
divers reconfigured
the ship mockup

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.710
to the end state of the run.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.517
It took so long to
get into the suits

00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:04.850
that it made sense to let us
practice the end of the run

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.370
while we were
already down there.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.370
I kept listening to the
calm, waiting for Tsao

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.990
to tell us something
else about what

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.514
was happening with Leonard.

00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:14.930
When the divers
were ready for us,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.520
we started the run again,
but kept conversation

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.240
to the bare minimum
required for work.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.930
After I got over my relief,
I had a huge case of,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.174
what the devil is going on?

00:08:25.174 --> 00:08:26.840
I've been pulled out
of training before,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.750
but not an actual NBL run.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.600
That required restarting
the entire thing, which

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.140
was expensive and an enormous
loss of training time.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.419
Heck, the way the
suits were configured,

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.240
it took two days just to
replace a crew member.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.140
Short of a medical emergency or
equipment malfunction, nothing

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.570
interrupted an NBL run.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.790
So what would Clemons
think was so important

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.210
that it couldn't wait, and
why weren't they telling us?

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.682
The lift out of the
NBL's pool took ages.

00:08:56.682 --> 00:08:58.640
As my helmet breached
the surface of the water,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.670
the stand I was strapped to
supported the 140 kilograms

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.960
of my suit.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.240
Trying to walk in a full
suit in Earth's gravity

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.770
is not possible.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.930
Even just the bottoms are like--

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.420
well, it's like wearing diapers
in a snowsuit made of lead.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.142
The robot in 'Lost in Space'
had more grace than we did.

00:09:18.142 --> 00:09:20.690
I hung in the donning stand
as a swarm of suit techs

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.460
helped us to disrobe.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.410
When you want
answers, everything

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.240
seems to take longer.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.300
I waited for my suit tech to
remove the tools and tethers

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.130
and leg weights.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.050
As much as I wanted to
rush her, everything

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.966
had to be done in sequence.

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:36.590
On the other side of
the donning stand,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.160
Rafael was going through the
same slow, careful extraction

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.990
from his space suit.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.830
It was like my suit tech
was moving underwater

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.610
as she opened the
valve on the side

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.820
to depressurize the space
suit down to below one.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.340
Sure, I could talk now,
and she could hear me,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.400
along with everyone else
listening on my comms.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.430
My suit tech but her hands
on the release of my gloves.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.090
'Breathe out.' I exhaled as the
remaining bit of delta pressure

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.554
popped, released when
she popped the glove.

00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:06.470
It wasn't likely that I
would blow out a lung,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.640
but overprecautions were
the IAC's stock and trade.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.280
The suit settled around me
as she pulled the glove away.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.950
Then, finally, she
reached for the helmet.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.850
The moment it was off, I
asked her, what's going on?

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.190
She glanced over her
shoulder at the control room.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.570
We were told to get you
cleaned up as fast as possible.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.422
'It's the FBI.'"

00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:32.398
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:34.075 --> 00:10:35.700
JASON GESSNER: Thanks
for that reading.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.037
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Sure.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.870
JASON GESSNER: So one
of the first questions

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.750
I want to ask you about,
since this was looking back

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.320
at kind of an alternate
history of the space race--

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.640
how much research
did you end up doing?

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.920
What was your favorite
bit of research?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.040
And was there a piece that
just didn't make the cut?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.390
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Oh.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.110
So researching this was a lot
of reading autobiographies.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.030
I focused mostly on the
Mercury and Apollo era.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.270
And then, also, I looked at the
WASPs, the Women Air Force--

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.700
or the Women Air
Service Pilots--

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.130
from World War II.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:19.324
So those were kind of the
primary areas of book research.

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:21.240
The other thing that I
did was that I lined up

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.230
some topic experts.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.910
So I had Steven Grenada.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.390
I used him as my science
consultant for the whole thing.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.780
He read the entire book.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.020
He does rocket science.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.370
He does robotics.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.540
He was a chemistry
major at NASA Goddard.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.770
He's done all of that.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.580
Then, I also had a
couple of astronauts--

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.280
Kjell Lindgren, who was the
one who invited me to the NBL,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.120
and Cady Coleman, who is
a shuttle era astronaut

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.742
and an actual lady astronaut.

00:11:52.742 --> 00:11:55.200
She's the one who gave me a
lot of the details about having

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.390
to put the padding around
the hips in the NBL,

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.264
which is something the
guys don't have to do.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.710
And then, also had people--

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.050
like, I had a Judaism consultant
because my main character

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.120
is Jewish, and I'm not.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.770
So it was lots of
that sort of reading.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.840
One of the things that I would
say was kind of surprising

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.020
was I was aware
of the Mercury 13

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.270
and kind of like
very loose-- like,

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.270
I think someone has
mentioned something about it

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.040
at some point.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.390
But I didn't actually know
really anything about them.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.800
And so the Mercury
13 were women who

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.220
were put through the
Mercury testing program

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.450
to see how women performed.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.366
And some of the things
that I was surprised by

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:50.509
was that we actually performed
better than the guys.

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:52.300
And there are a couple
of reasons for that.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.240
One is that we
tend to be smaller,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.060
but also, the way our
circulatory system works,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.610
partly because they're
designed for carrying

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.350
babies and things like that--

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.510
we handle G-Forces
significantly better than men.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.020
The other thing-- and this
was my favorite thing--

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.780
was that when they did
the stress testing,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.352
all of the women
performed better

00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:12.810
than the men in
the stress testing.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.460
And the one that I
was like, oh, well,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.250
that's why, and the delightful
surprise, was one of them

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.240
was a mother of eight.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.750
So I just imagine her getting
into the stress testing

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.738
and being like, what?

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.370
Oh, there's unexpected
noises going off?

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.370
Oh, OK.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.140
I have to do a complex
task while someone

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.640
is trying to get my attention?

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.470
Whatevs.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.460
Is it nap time now?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.710
I mean-- so I loved that.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.734
And I do-- I mention
her in there.

00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:42.900
I wanted to actually get
her in as a major character

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.010
and couldn't quite get her in.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.320
And there were
other things that--

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.080
like, one of the
things that I really

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.550
wanted to get into
the books that I

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.520
couldn't find a spot
for it was astronauts

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.540
do survival training.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.080
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.830
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
So they sent them out,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.246
and they're like, OK, we're
going to drop you in a desert,

00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:01.830
or we're going to drop you
in this snowy wasteland.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.160
We'll see you in seven days.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.110
Bye bye.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.455
And couldn't-- just
could not-- work that in.

00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:07.830
There was a lot
of training stuff

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.910
that was like, oh, I want this.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.701
I want this so bad.

00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:12.100
Like, no space in space.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.780
[LAUGH]

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.710
JASON GESSNER: For
the Mercury 13--

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.168
MARY ROBINETTE
KOWAL: A pity laugh.

00:14:15.168 --> 00:14:17.880
JASON GESSNER: For
the Mercury 13,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.180
what was the sort of conclusion
from some of that research?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.030
How did they couch, yeah,
thanks for showing up,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.620
but like, no, thanks.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.720
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
So what happened

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.587
is they got through
the initial testing.

00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:31.920
They were getting ready to
go into the next stage, which

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.800
required using some
special equipment at NASA.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.980
And went to NASA, and NASA
went to Lyndon Johnson.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.100
And he said, no, absolutely not.

00:14:44.054 --> 00:14:46.470
So he drafted a letter saying,
let's shut this thing down.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.990
He never sent the letter.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.180
What the letter he sent
was, well, of course,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.110
I'll leave it up to you.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:58.890
And strangely, that meant
that nothing happened.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.780
The requirements, then, for
who could become an astronaut

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.830
shifted so that you had to have
right around in this time--

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.860
and I'm sure it's
completely coincidental--

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.170
that shifted so you had
to have so many hours

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.160
as a pilot in command of
a jet, which was something

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.500
that only people in the military
fighter pilots could have.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.120
So it goes on to have--

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.590
they go on to have
congressional hearings.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.950
Like, they fought
this to continue

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.590
the training and the testing.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.740
And they go to
congressional hearings.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.490
And the congressional hearings
are basically lots of things

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.954
like, men go into space.

00:15:40.954 --> 00:15:42.120
Women take care of the home.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.740
And other things
like, well, you know,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.616
of course we'd take any woman
who met the qualifications.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.740
JASON GESSNER: That we just
very carefully crafted.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.950
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Right.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.630
Right.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.327
So lots of things like that.

00:15:56.327 --> 00:15:58.410
And one of the things,
actually, that also came up

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.225
in those hearings was--

00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:03.390
so John Glenn was there,
and one of the women

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.340
was like, you know,
but you wouldn't

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:11.160
have qualified with the
standards that they have now.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.540
Because when he qualified,
when they put him--

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.030
their first orbit.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.270
Their first man really--

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.580
Shepard was the first up, but
Glenn was the first to orbit.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.790
When you did that, they
didn't have the requirement

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.840
for advanced degrees.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.950
And he got an
advanced degree later,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.510
but he wouldn't have qualified.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.843
And they're like, well, you did.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.550
Why not look at
equivalent things?

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.390
And the other thing was
that most of the women

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.480
had more flight time than
any of the astronauts

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.360
did before they went in
because the air service--

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.750
the WASPs were
flying constantly.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.870
A lot of them--

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.430
I think all of the Mercury 13
had over 1,000 hours of flight

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.590
time clocked.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.981
They were very
impressive pilots.

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:06.230
JASON GESSNER: So let's take
a step back for a second.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.300
So we read that
section of the book.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.599
Could you just talk a
little bit about why

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.160
you chose the particular point
in time to start the series,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.624
and what were some of the
decisions around that?

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:19.790
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Right.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:25.700
So the series starts in
1952 when I slam a meteor

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.890
into the Chesapeake Bay.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:28.826
This is not a spoiler.

00:17:28.826 --> 00:17:30.950
I literally do this on the
first line of the novel.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.850
And that's my cusp point.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.990
There is actually
technically a cusp point

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.410
before that, which is that I
have Dewey as the president,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.660
because I needed the space
program to be slightly more

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.430
advanced.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.340
The reason I chose the 1950s
is that this was a point

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.270
at which computers were women.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.260
If you said computer, you
meant someone who did math.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.190
And mechanical computers
were not really--

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.850
I mean, they existed,
but they were definitely

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.680
far from reliable.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.870
So if you wanted a computer
in space, at that point,

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.040
it had to be a woman.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.900
And what I was
looking at, basically,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.120
was what are the
things that would

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.745
make people change their mind
about sending women into space?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.300
Having a task that was
defined in that era

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.360
as a woman's job, which was
computing, that was one thing.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.150
Making it an
extinction level event

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.840
so that we had to be
talking about colonies.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.310
And again, one of
the conversations

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.240
they have in the book is, if
you want a colony, you kind of--

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.090
there's this component
that you need there

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.540
that guys don't have.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.980
Maybe you want to send some--

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.000
JASON GESSNER: One time colony.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.583
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
You know, just--

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.190
but mostly, it was
because of the computing.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.050
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.670
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: I needed
technology to be at a point

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:09.390
at which we had the
ability to go into space,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.370
but before we had
mechanical computers.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:22.160
And 1952 also--
there's a short story

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.160
that comes before the novels
that no one in the universe

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.010
of the novels is aware of.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.140
And for that, there
needed to be a plot point

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.070
that it revolved around
leap year and miscalculating

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:40.040
something based on leap day,
which no one in their universe

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.740
knows about.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.910
So that's why it's 1952
specifically, and March 3rd.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.070
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.570
Yeah.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.110
I mean, the events of the
book take place in an arrow

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.810
that a lot of us are
familiar with, right?

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.910
And one thing as a reader--

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.081
it is a sci-fi series,
but at the same time,

00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:01.080
you don't have to spend
a lot of time explaining

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.480
magical infinite power
sources or faster than light

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.360
travel or other nonsense, right?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.160
How did you make
choices about what

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.430
to go into detail on on
the sort of hard sci-fi

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.310
side versus the story
elements or the characters?

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.420
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: I
am very sneaky about this.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.150
So I am--

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.060
I was an art major in college.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.660
I'm a professional puppeteer.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.270
I read books out loud for
a living and write things.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.350
Math is a magic system,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.200
It's like people can do
amazing things with math,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.560
and I understand that
intellectually, and bully

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.960
for them.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.816
So I treated it
like a magic system.

00:20:44.816 --> 00:20:47.190
One of the things that I did
was to set up the rules very

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.273
clearly and to establish
my character's competence

00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:50.470
right at the beginning.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.930
There is a scene very early
on in which Elma is trying

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.050
to calculate the size of
the meteor because it's gone

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.135
into the Chesapeake Bay-- try
to figure out how big it was

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.510
because she's trying to prove
that the Russians could not

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.130
have moved it and
aimed it at the--

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.355
because it is Cold War.

00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:07.230
JASON GESSNER: Right.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.250
Of course.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.310
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: So she's
trying to demonstrate this.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.820
And Stephen Grenade gave
me this very long email

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.920
in which he walked me
through how this equation--

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.030
I found the equation.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.264
I can tell that this
equation does this thing.

00:21:20.264 --> 00:21:22.680
But I don't understand any of
the things that are actually

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.304
happening here.

00:21:23.304 --> 00:21:26.230
So he did the math,
walked me through it.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.349
And then, I just gave
that to my characters,

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:30.390
and there's a conversation
where they're throwing

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.267
technical terms at each other.

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:34.350
And you know how when
you're working on something,

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.350
and you'll just be like, so--

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.660
and then, number of jules--

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.420
and you just say
occasional words out loud?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.100
So I have my characters
do that, which

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.675
makes them sound super smart.

00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:50.430
And all of the math that
they're saying out loud

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.040
is correct, right?

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.146
And then, later, I can
get away with saying,

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:56.520
and then, I did
the calculations.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.145
And people are like,
oh, she totally no

00:21:58.145 --> 00:21:59.550
the calculations are, obviously.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.490
So I would explain it enough
to establish competence.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.120
And then, the only other
times that I would explain it

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.980
is if it was something
that you needed

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.700
to know in order to understand
something further down

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.750
the line.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.080
So the NBL scene is
basically establishing

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.300
competence in space.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.860
JASON GESSNER: Right.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.900
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
And also giving me the--

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.020
it's like, this is what a
WIF is, so that later, when

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.390
the WIF is important, I
don't have to stop and say,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.500
while this incredibly
tense scene is happening,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.786
a WIF, by the way, is a
widget interface-- no.

00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:36.660
JASON GESSNER: Right.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.680
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: I
can't remove what it actually

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.760
does stand for.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.460
He did tell me later, but
he had to go look it up.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.480
JASON GESSNER: The first
answer is pretty good.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:42.840
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: It is.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.590
Widget interface.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.040
I told him.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.690
I was like, you know that's
going directly in the book.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:46.990
He's like, abort, abort.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.820
I'm like--

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.159
JASON GESSNER: Too late.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.200
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: In.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.033
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

00:22:51.033 --> 00:22:54.120
Well, I like that in the
book, a lot of that does

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.520
feel very natural,
and it is introduced

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.720
when it helps the story.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.775
And yeah, it's not--

00:23:01.775 --> 00:23:04.410
there's no sort of long
winded section about,

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.100
oh, let me geek out on
this particular detail.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.160
As a reader, I could tell
you did a lot of fun research

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.582
around that, but it also
fits so well into the story

00:23:14.582 --> 00:23:16.790
and what the characters are
up to at any given point.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.160
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Awesome.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.300
Thank you.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.670
So I find that is
very much about focus,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.470
just providing it
when the character is

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.990
thinking about it naturally.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.290
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.257
So let's go back and
forward a little bit.

00:23:27.257 --> 00:23:28.590
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: All right.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.089
I'm excited.

00:23:29.089 --> 00:23:31.140
JASON GESSNER: So is it
correct that "The Lady

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.959
Astronaut of Mars" was the first
piece you did in this world?

00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:36.000
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: No.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.800
JASON GESSNER: Oh, OK.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.180
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: It's the
one that I won the Hugo for.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.690
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.231
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
The first piece

00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.470
that I wrote in this
world is a story

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.590
that's called "We
Interrupt This Broadcast."

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.090
And this is the one that I said
that no one in this universe

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.380
knows.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.430
And I wrote something that I
jokingly called my punch card

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.700
punk universe.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.840
And the story is basically
a computer engineer

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.980
who has decided that society
is going nowhere good

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.860
and that it needs a hard
reset, and the meteor

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.230
is actually aimed and targeted.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.590
But he dies in the blast,
so no one in this timeline

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.280
knows it ever.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.780
It's never going
to be a plot point.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.949
No one will ever know it.

00:24:19.949 --> 00:24:21.990
As far as everyone in this
universe is concerned,

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.950
it was an act of God.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.680
But that's the first
thing that I wrote.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.620
And then, "Lady Astronaut of
Mars" is the second thing.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.680
And for that, I--

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.690
and that's what
prompted these books.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.920
So I knew that she
had this story,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.030
but that story itself
came up because I needed

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.470
to write something for an audio
anthology called RIP-OFF, where

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.360
we took a famous first line.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.610
And I took the first
line of "Wizard of Oz,"

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.705
and then, wrote this story.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.410
Honestly, the reason I said
it's in the punch card punk

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.950
universe for that one was
that I had a deadline,

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.900
and I had this universe
already created.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.400
JASON GESSNER:
That's a good choice.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.330
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
So I was like, why

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.670
do this additional work
when this is just here?

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.720
And also, I like it.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.810
Like, I like the idea of what
we were able to do in that era.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.880
The fact that my cell phone has
more computing power than we

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.510
had in the entire planet, and
we sent people to the moon

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.880
in basically these Jiffy Pop
containers, it's amazing.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.450
And all of the calculations
were done with people just doing

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.770
calculations.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.970
So anyway, that's--

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.730
I don't think that
answered your question.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:45.990
JASON GESSNER: No, no, no.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.075
That was good.

00:25:47.075 --> 00:25:49.550
I clearly have to go back
and read the other piece,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.830
because I have not
read that one yet.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.370
One of the things I love about
"The Lady Astronaut Mars" story

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.630
is it feels very much
like it could be kind of,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.150
in some ways, a lost chapter
of "The Martian Chronicles"

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:02.960
or something.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.310
Has that same vibe.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.140
You bring some
Bradbury in later.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.450
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.630
JASON GESSNER: And, you know,
me, as a fan of that stuff,

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.880
I was very excited about that.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.670
But also, it sets up this really
rich world with so little.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.160
Like, it is a very
short story, and it

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.150
has a really, really
powerful arc to it,

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.690
but it also is not
heavy on detail.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.000
Like, it sets up just
enough so that you

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.810
can connect the dots and
kind of know how we got there

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.270
or how those
characters got there.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:37.280
But then, also, when the first
novel came out, knowing that.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.970
Since that is set farther in
the future than the first novel,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.105
I instantly cared a lot
about those characters, too.

00:26:44.105 --> 00:26:45.230
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.020
I'm so glad that you felt the
Bradbury vibe, because that

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.925
was actually a very--

00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:54.350
I thought of it as my homage to
Bradbury when I was writing it.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:59.454
I want "The Martian Chronicles,"
but with more women.

00:26:59.454 --> 00:27:00.620
JASON GESSNER: Solid choice.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.745
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:02.410
Yeah.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:06.659
And basically, the novels
are I would like "The Martian

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:09.200
Chronicles," but with more women
and people of color, please.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.270
Just not all white
dudes all the time.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:21.020
But one of the things that was
interesting about coming back

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:28.375
to write this original
was figuring out--

00:27:31.236 --> 00:27:34.590
there's a 40 year
gap between them,

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.924
so trying to figure out who
Elma was, who Nathaniel was.

00:27:37.924 --> 00:27:39.590
One of the things
that I knew going back

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.480
was that I wanted
their relationship

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.640
to always be rock solid.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.310
I did not want the
marriage to ever

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.940
be in jeopardy, partly because
I hate that trope a lot.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.770
The oh no, we fight.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.770
We're going to break up.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.390
No, no, we're deeply
in love again.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:59.040
I'm like, well, that's
not predictable.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.350
So I didn't want to do that.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.730
So I thought about
those things and kind

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.510
of how she would get
there over that time.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.570
And also, how do you become
the lady astronaut of Mars?

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.600
Like, how does that
become your name?

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.650
What happened?

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.210
JASON GESSNER: As a moniker,
it's a solid moniker.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.570
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: It is.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.387
It's pretty good.

00:28:22.387 --> 00:28:23.220
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.741
It was also fun in the books
to see a really exciting,

00:28:26.741 --> 00:28:28.740
solid married couple, as
well, and there's a lot

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.980
of fun in that relationship.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.480
Yeah.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.750
As a longtime married person, I
was like, oh yeah, that's good.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.050
Anyway, so you have also
written-- so you're not

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.340
exclusively a sci-fi writer.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.810
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Correct.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.270
JASON GESSNER: You've written
in several different styles

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.770
and genres.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.380
How do you think about
what story is right?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.540
Or do you start with
your story idea?

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.825
Do you start with a setting?

00:28:52.825 --> 00:28:55.200
Like, could you just talk a
little bit about your process

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.500
there?

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.625
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:28:56.625 --> 00:28:59.260
So it varies from
story to story.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.736
Sometimes, I'll come into
it, and I know the world,

00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:04.110
and I know the setting, and
I have to find the character.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.430
Sometimes, I know
the character, and I

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.138
need to figure out
the world around them,

00:29:07.138 --> 00:29:12.420
or I just like a scene that
I know that I want to write.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.290
And so, then, it's finding
the other pieces of it.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.200
A lot of times, we
liken this to gardening.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.180
But in terms of whether
I do science fiction

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.060
or fantasy, these are, for me--

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.470
I think of them very
much as set dressing.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.640
So there are some
stories that have

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.550
a specific inherent structure.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.910
Like, heist stories have a
specific inherent structure.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.560
Romances have a specific
inherent structure.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.542
But science fiction, fantasy,
these are the set dressing.

00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:48.750
This is the layer that goes
on top of that structure.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.790
Because you can have a
science fiction story

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.940
that is a hardcore
romance, and you can also

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.710
have one that's a heist novel.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.830
Same with fantasy.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:05.014
So what I tend to do is I think
about the interstitial layers,

00:30:05.014 --> 00:30:05.930
the connective tissue.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.551
Because what I find
both things do,

00:30:07.551 --> 00:30:09.050
the science fiction
and the fantasy,

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.940
is they allow me to
take the natural world,

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.150
tip it to the side so I can
see all that connective tissue.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.280
And then, it also allows
me to explore things

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.580
that I am thinking about
from the real world,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.010
and it allows me to talk
about them without all

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.450
of the emotional baggage.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.390
So I can approach them much more
as a thought experiment, which

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.260
then also allows my readers to
engage with it more naturally.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.284
So what I look for then is
kind of what scenic design is

00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:35.200
going to support that.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.275
It's very much the same
process I go through when

00:30:37.275 --> 00:30:38.150
I'm designing a show.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.390
It's like, what is the aesthetic
that is going to serve this?

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.820
Is this a story that's going
to be served by something

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.120
that's darker and grittier?

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.310
Is this a story that
mechanics are going to serve?

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.360
Do I feel like I really
need communication

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.620
to be a difficult thing?

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.260
In which case, fantasy is going
to work for me much better

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.700
than science fiction.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.450
All of the things, I'm
like, why don't you

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.270
just call them on a cell phone?

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.070
The difficulty and
disabling cell phones

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.750
and removing communication,
that is one of the number

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.220
one problems with writing
science fiction today.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.329
It's like, why
are you just not--

00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:18.120
JASON GESSNER:
Instantaneous communication.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.190
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.515
It's always like having to
put people in Faraday boxes.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.790
So I look at that kind of thing.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.540
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.050
So "Calculating
Stars" and "Fated Sky"

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.600
are the two most recent novels.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.770
We were talking
about it earlier.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.160
You didn't intend it to be
two novels originally, right?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.440
MARY ROBINETTE
KOWAL: I did not, no.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.800
My plan with this was to write
a single novel, which I had just

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.754
titled "The Lady
Astronaut Book."

00:31:50.754 --> 00:31:52.420
Had no idea what it
was going to-- there

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.610
was a point where it
was "Artemis One."

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.780
Like, ridiculous.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.300
I went through 20
titles for this.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.200
I'm not kidding.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.990
But what happened
was that my idea had

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.930
been that I was going to
structure it as three novellas

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.840
because "The Lady Astronaut
of Mars" was a novella,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.600
and I was like, I'll structure
it as three linked novellas

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.230
to mimic the structure of
"Lady Astronaut of Mars."

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.780
And part one of
"Calculating Stars"

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.600
is that first novella,
more or less untouched.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.810
And I had finished part two
and was starting part three,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.930
and it just felt awful.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.060
And what I realized
was happening

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.510
was that I was having
to skip emotional beats

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.510
in the second novella in order
to save them for the third one

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.720
so I didn't have
repetition points.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.500
And the other thing was that
people read short fiction

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.119
for a different thing
than they read novels for.

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:48.660
People read short fiction for
kind of a swift emotional punch

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.080
to the gut, and people
read novels for immersion.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.910
And structuring it
as three novellas--

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.580
if I had actually published them
as three independent novellas,

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.670
I think it would have been fine.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.370
I think it would have been
able to hit all of the things

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.660
I wanted to hit.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.550
But because it
was in novel form,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.610
I was having to skip the
immersion aspect of it,

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.590
and this is not going to be
satisfying for a novel reader,

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.900
reading these back
to back like this.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.000
So I went to my
editor, and I'm like--

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.890
so I said all of those things.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.930
And they were
great, and they let

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.460
me split it into
two books, which

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.010
allowed me to unpack
everything so that part two is

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.780
significantly more robust.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.240
I was able to do a lot
more of the training stuff

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.531
that I was going to have to--
that in the original one,

00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:33.390
I had to skip, and then, could
really unpack the third one

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.070
to include a lot
of, again, training

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.980
and some additional things
that otherwise, I just

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.050
would have had to skip in
order to have that quick in you

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.942
would have four a novella.

00:33:43.942 --> 00:33:45.180
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.700
And you've had some
exciting news recently

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.320
on the new book's front, right?

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:49.920
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yes.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.720
JASON GESSNER: So we have
more "Lady Astronaut" books.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.880
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yes.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.009
We just sold three
new novels to tour.

00:33:56.009 --> 00:33:57.300
JASON GESSNER: Congratulations.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.050
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
Thank you very much.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.130
And it's a six figure deal,
which I'm extremely excited by.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.530
Thank you.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.250
It's my first.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.840
It's very exciting.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.560
And thank you.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.650
Thank you for the sympathy
clap there, as I do humble

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.339
brags up here.

00:34:15.339 --> 00:34:16.380
JASON GESSNER: Feel free.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.713
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Thank you.

00:34:17.713 --> 00:34:18.939
I appreciate it.

00:34:18.939 --> 00:34:21.480
For those of you who watch "Good
Place," I am totally Tahani.

00:34:24.917 --> 00:34:25.500
Oh, fork yeah.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.790
So the first book--

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.239
or I should say the third book--

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.130
is called "The Relentless Moon."

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.870
That'll come out in 2020.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:42.510
I have to turn it in June, which
I'm exhilarated and terrified

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.130
by.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.580
But that one is a parallel novel
to "The Faded Sky," so it's

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.500
taking place while everybody--

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.159
"The Faded Sky"--
again, I don't feel

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.860
like this is a spoiler,
if you look at the cover

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.520
and you know that the books
are coming from a series that

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.350
began with "The Lady
Astronaut of Mars,"

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.660
the fact that they
are going to Mars.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.420
And it's a red cover
of someone standing

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.440
on the surface of Mars.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.542
I feel like-- surprise.

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.000
JASON GESSNER: It's
a safe spoiler.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.541
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
Safe bet there.

00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:17.940
Anyway, this takes place while
the first Mars expedition

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.830
is going on.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.990
And it focuses on Nicole
Wargin and Myrtle Lindholm,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.180
who are two of the
side characters

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.430
in the first and second book.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.290
And then, basically,
it's like, hello.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.890
We are on the moon, and we're
trying to establish life here,

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.520
and bridge parties are difficult
because gravity is so low.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.100
And oh no, sabotage.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.200
So it's much more in the--

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.700
it's going to have
a little bit more

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.000
of a thriller vein that
some of the other ones.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.720
And then, in 2021, we have
a non "Lady Astronaut"

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.489
book, which is "The Spare
Man," which is basically--

00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:57.030
if anyone seen "The
Thin Man" movies,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.230
it's basically "The
Thin Man" in space.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.990
It's an interstellar
cruise ship.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.610
It's a locked room
murder mystery.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.510
Happily married couple
and their dog, Astra.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.394
Thank you.

00:36:10.394 --> 00:36:12.810
Someone has watched "The Thin
Man" movies and knows Latin.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:22.410
And then, in 2022, which does
not sound like a real date

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.710
at all, we will have "The
Derivative Base," which

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.740
picks up after the
close of "Fated Sky,"

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.430
and it's Elma and
Nathaniel again.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.670
JASON GESSNER: Awesome.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.330
Yeah.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.080
Congrats again.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:33.590
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Thanks.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:34.550
JASON GESSNER: That's big news.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.110
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
I'm super excited by it.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.943
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

00:36:36.943 --> 00:36:41.660
So I want to talk a little bit
about some of the other stuff

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.450
around being an
author now, right?

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.670
So people probably
still have some notion

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.760
of the author as like, you
know, locked in a writing

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.260
cabin in the woods somewhere.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.810
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
That's not inaccurate.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.300
JASON GESSNER: But you
as a modern author,

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.280
and especially in
popular fiction,

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.730
have a lot of
interaction with people,

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:07.290
probably partly as an
obligation and partly for fun.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.060
Could you talk a little bit
about how you balance that out?

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.184
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:37:11.184 --> 00:37:13.446
So one of the interesting
things about being an author

00:37:13.446 --> 00:37:15.070
is that the interaction
with the public

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.660
has always been
part of the game.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.247
The reason that Charles
Dickens became so popular

00:37:21.247 --> 00:37:23.080
and Mark Twain was
actually because they did

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.730
public readings all the time.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:30.130
So that was a lot of what
drove their fame and fortune.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.940
So that audience engagement
kind of is always there.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.970
It's just so much
easier now, and harder,

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:40.160
all at the same time.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.250
So I spend a surprising amount
of time on the road, things

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.180
that they don't
tell you when you

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.520
sign these standard rich
and famous contracts,

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.200
that you are going
to have to be--

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.241
thank you for the people
who watch "The Muppets."

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.050
So you kind of
travel all the time.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:03.970
Like right now, I have
been home for two weeks.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.880
Before that, I had been
on the road for 20 days.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.190
I had been home for
a day before that.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.780
And then, two weeks prior
to that, three days home.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.910
And this year has just
kind of been like that.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:25.400
And it is partly my own fault
because I will say, yes,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.207
I'd love to come do that thing.

00:38:27.207 --> 00:38:29.540
Also partly because I have a
couple of different careers

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.289
running in tandem.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.950
The thing that's nice about
it is that you actually

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.970
can have a career without
doing that, in theory,

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:45.710
through the internet,
which is both good and bad.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.010
When I go to an event,
the people who attend--

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.680
there's a certain
buy in that they

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.810
have to do to just show up.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.870
So everybody that
I'm interacting with

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:58.880
is generally very pleasant.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.200
I've had the occasional
stalker, but not terrible

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.020
compared to some friends.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:14.210
On the internet, I will have
trolls come at me for reasons.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.020
And as far as I can tell,
it's just because they

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.980
felt like it that day.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.050
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.630
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
And it is interesting,

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.060
trying to do that balancing
act of wanting to be present

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.490
and wanting to engage,
and also, needing

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.160
to preserve aspects of self.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.170
So the thing that I talk
about is that mostly

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.680
what I think about it is it's
not that I put on a persona,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.980
but that I decide which
parts of my life are public

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.000
and which parts of
my life are private.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.685
Like, I rarely talk
about my family.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.440
And one of the things--

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.450
when I do, it's always
just bragging about them.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.130
One of the things we were
talking about at lunch

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:04.840
was that I had shingles
during this 20 days of travel,

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.180
and I did not want to talk
about it because as soon

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.760
as you talk about anything
health related on the internet,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.340
everyone will give you advice.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.300
Like, everyone.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.050
I have a hangnail.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.585
Well, have you tried--

00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:18.270
I think at this
point in my life,

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.400
I know how to deal
with a hangnail.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.316
JASON GESSNER: You seem
like a sensible adult.

00:40:21.316 --> 00:40:22.910
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
You know, I try.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.984
But I also had to cancel things.

00:40:24.984 --> 00:40:26.400
And I didn't want
to just be like,

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.100
oh, I'm just canceling things.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.620
And I didn't want people to
go, she's canceling things.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.910
Is she dying?

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.950
Because they will
also go there because,

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.640
in fairness, that has happened.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:44.810
So unfortunately-- so trying to
decide how much to talk about.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.610
So I'll tell people,
I had shingles.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.304
I do not talk about--

00:40:48.304 --> 00:40:48.845
actually, no.

00:40:48.845 --> 00:40:51.053
In the blog post, I did talk
about the degree of pain

00:40:51.053 --> 00:40:52.336
that I was in.

00:40:52.336 --> 00:40:54.710
But I talked about-- what I
tried to do was talk about it

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.810
in terms of here's a
learning experience for you.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.610
The show does not have to go on.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.640
Don't use my
puppeteer's work ethic.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.790
Take care of yourself.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.250
Be healthy.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.860
So it's learning to couch
things and shift them

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:14.370
so that I maintain control
of the conversation, which

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.430
I'm very grateful for having
years of theater before.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:22.590
Like, I learned all of this
from dealing with third graders.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.210
JASON GESSNER: Excellent.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:30.060
So you're-- there's a lot of--

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.790
looking back at the events
of the past in the most

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.690
recent novels with a modern
lens and from the perspective

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.530
of people struggling
through that era,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.600
how has the reception
been to that,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.880
or has that sort of like
attracted some of the more

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.130
unsavory fan elements?

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:52.260
Because you are criticizing
some of their golden ideas

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.720
or whatever nonsense
is coming up.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.250
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.780
The thing that-- like, when
people complain about these

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.710
books--

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.020
for the most part, it has
been very, very positive.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.570
I have to say, really
super positive.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.180
And one of the things--

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.790
I do deal with
sexism and racism.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.440
I deal with mental
health issues.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.340
But at the same time, I
feel like it's not so much--

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.890
in my head, I'm writing a
book about these things.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.390
I'm not.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.310
I'm writing a book
about space, but I'm not

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.620
ignoring those things.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.290
And because so many
books do ignore them,

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.750
I think that's what makes it
feel like they're very, very

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.792
present.

00:42:31.792 --> 00:42:33.750
These are things that
affect the way characters

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.240
move through the
world, and so I'm

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.490
letting it affect the way
they move through the world,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.100
but I'm not--

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.840
for the most part, they aren't--

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.610
there's like one or two places
where it's a plot point,

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:49.500
but for the most
part, it's like, this

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.720
is the way they move
through the world.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.940
Sexism is a plot point
for Elma because it's

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.870
a plot point for me.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.500
When I was vice president
of SFWA, Science Fiction

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.500
and Fantasy Writers of America,
and John Scalzi was president,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.490
I got the hate mail.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.530
He didn't.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.210
It's not that he
didn't get any, but I

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.950
would get the majority of it.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.450
So it just affects the way
you move through the world.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.280
So I was dealing
with those things.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.400
So when people
complain about it,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.320
what they complain
about is, oh, she's

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.250
shoehorning in
these social issues.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.400
I'm like, no, really not.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.382
That's just daily life.

00:43:29.382 --> 00:43:30.840
That's the complaint
that I'll get.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.050
The other one that I'll get
is Elma, the main character,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:37.380
has social anxiety disorder.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.750
So she's in a plane,
and it's going down,

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.280
and she's totally fine.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.440
You ask her to speak
to a roomful of people,

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.430
and she's like, nuh--

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.182
I clearly do not have
social anxiety disorder.

00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:48.140
JASON GESSNER: Theater.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.260
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Theater.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.510
Although, there are a lot
of people in theater who do.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.200
But what I would get-- the
other pushback that I'll get

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.710
is, I don't believe that someone
gets this upset about talking

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.527
to people.

00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:05.110
Like, no one gets
that upset about it.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.730
I'm like, yeah, actually.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:09.340
And what I have found is that
people with anxiety disorders

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.130
are the best people in crises
because they're like, what,

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:12.981
stress hormones?

00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:13.480
Come on.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.890
Bring it.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:15.430
I got this.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.930
Totally.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.509
That's my daily life.

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:19.300
JASON GESSNER: So I
have one more question,

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.330
and then, I think we've
got time for Q&amp;A. Sort

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.810
of on that topic of working
through a challenge, earlier,

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.520
we were also talking
about how you

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.510
approach writing
as sort of a craft,

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.190
as well as a creative endeavor.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.100
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Right.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.850
JASON GESSNER: Could
you talk a little bit

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:41.335
about how you view that and how
it related to any of your work?

00:44:41.335 --> 00:44:42.460
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Sure.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.610
So because I come
at it from theater,

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.760
where you couldn't wait
for the muse to arrive,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.290
it's like if I'm
creating something

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.042
if, I'm designing
something, I have

00:44:52.042 --> 00:44:53.500
to be able to
produce on a deadline

00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:00.400
because I put other
people's schedule behind.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.490
It's not a good team
player thing to do.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:07.330
So I had to learn to
be creative on demand.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.790
And I also have depression.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.180
So one of the things
that I've learned

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.480
is that I can work
through a depression,

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:24.310
but it's incredibly difficult.
And the whole creator

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.490
as the depressed genius,
it's like I just--

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.160
every time that one
comes up, I get stabby.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.030
Because what happens for me
is that my productivity just

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.350
crashes and burns.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.560
And I mentioned briefly at
lunch "Forest of Memory,"

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.140
which is a novella
that was on tor.com.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.130
I wrote that during the
worst depressive episode

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.305
that I've had.

00:45:50.305 --> 00:45:51.370
My grandmother had died.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:55.930
My cat had died unexpectedly
right after that.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.630
Multiple deaths right in a row,
a whole bunch of other things,

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.300
chemical imbalance, all of that.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.970
And upon realizing finally
what was happening to me--

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.460
this was the episode that
finally made me admit it,

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.732
that I had depression
and had it all my life.

00:46:10.732 --> 00:46:12.190
In the middle of
that, I was trying

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.930
to drop everything, and
there this one anthology,

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.240
"METAtropolis: Cascadia."

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.450
And my friend, Jay
Lake, was the editor.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.840
And it was the second book
in a shared world anthology,

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.340
so replacing me was already
going to be difficult.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.800
And Jay was in the process
of dying from colon cancer.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.050
He was terminal.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.430
There was no way I was
going to back out of this.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.860
Really, this was not something
I could do to my friend.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.020
So that meant that I
just had to write it.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.050
And I crafted my way
through that story.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.730
And people read
it, and they can't

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.400
tell, at the end of the day,
because I understand my craft,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.720
because I understand audience,
storytelling, structure.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.239
But I wrote that--

00:47:00.239 --> 00:47:01.780
there were some days
that I wrote it,

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.370
I could only write
three sentences.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:04.703
That was my bargain with myself.

00:47:04.703 --> 00:47:05.960
I'm like, three sentences.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.660
You can do three
sentences a day.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.760
And there's some days
where I would catch fire,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.600
and I could go longer,
and other days where

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.850
I would write three sentences.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.433
And there are a couple of days
where the three sentences were,

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:17.270
I hate everything.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.840
I'm tired.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.626
I'm going to bed.

00:47:18.626 --> 00:47:20.000
But I sat down,
and I wrote them.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:29.990
And for me, this is important
because I can write that way,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.870
but I don't enjoy it.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:37.810
And my feeling now is if I am
not writing and not loving it,

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.240
like if I am dealing with
depression, unless there

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.350
is a really serious reason that
I need to push through that,

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.620
it is better for me
to take care of myself

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:55.241
and to go and do self care,
and then, come back to it when

00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:56.240
there's still joy there.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.989
Because honestly, we
don't get paid enough

00:47:57.989 --> 00:48:01.380
to write when it's not fun,
even with a six figure deal.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.110
It's spread out
over multiple years.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.650
But it is good to
know that I can,

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:13.940
that the time that I've
put in learning my craft

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.040
allows me to actually
do this thing.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.510
So it is kind of both.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.840
It's like one of
the things that I

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.300
try to pay attention to when
I start bogging down is like,

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.830
am I bogging down
because there's

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.830
a problem with the story,
or am I bogging down

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.120
because of something external?

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:37.360
And you handled those
in different ways.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.751
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:48:38.751 --> 00:48:39.350
Well, great.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.300
Thank you.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:47.220
So first off, let's give a round
of applause for Mary Robinette.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.720
Thank you.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.053
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Thank you.

00:48:49.053 --> 00:48:50.820
JASON GESSNER: So we
have a mic over here,

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.280
so we have time for questions.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.379
We've got, like, 14, 13 minutes.

00:48:54.379 --> 00:48:56.420
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: And
I will answer questions

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.620
about anything.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.690
So if you want to know--

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:00.710
we didn't talk about puppetry.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:02.168
If you want to know
about puppetry,

00:49:02.168 --> 00:49:04.400
if you want to know
about Regency underwear,

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.010
if you want to know about
going to NASA and the NBL,

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:10.850
if you want to know about trying
on a space helmet, anything.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.120
I'll talk about depression.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.570
Anything.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.780
I will also just sit here
and stare at you awkwardly.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.760
AUDIENCE: I'd like to hear about
more than a dozen typewriters.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.010
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Ah, yes.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.260
More than a dozen typewriters.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.290
So we have 19
manual typewriters.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.440
First of all, I do not recommend
that you collect typewriters.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.000
They are heavy.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.030
When you move, they
are very heavy.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.530
All of your friends hate
you if you have those.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.600
But our earliest typewriter
is a Blickensderfer, which

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.000
is a typewriter from 1890--

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.830
I think ours is
1893 model, or 1894.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.934
But it has a rotary head, and
it's not a QWERTY keyboard.

00:49:51.934 --> 00:49:53.600
And the cool thing
about the rotary head

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.110
is you remember
the IBM Selectrics?

00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:00.470
This predates an IBM
Selectric by 70 years

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.510
and has a rotary head.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:04.970
You can replace it to
change the type font.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.760
Really, really cool.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.180
My favorite is the
Corona number 3,

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.900
which was the typewriter
that Hemingway took--

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.150
I don't have his.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.540
That would be awesome.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.100
It's the typewriter
that he used when

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.410
he was doing war reporting
in the First World War.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.040
And it's a folding typewriter,
so it's this tiny thing.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.950
It's like about
that big footprint.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.480
Weighs about three pounds.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.770
There's an aluminum one
that's just stupidly light.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.920
And then, the top
flips back and forth.

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:48.350
I have the Corona number 3
Special, which is forest green.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:49.280
It's beautiful.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.320
And it has the extended
keyboard that has

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.810
mathematical functions on it.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.100
It's very cool.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:59.210
I will not give you a rundown
of all of the typewriters,

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.561
probably.

00:51:01.561 --> 00:51:04.060
JASON GESSNER: Does having 19
of them help you write faster?

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.900
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
You know, it is--

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.960
no.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.050
But I will actually
bring out the typewriter

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:10.300
to write sometimes
because it changes

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.770
the rhythms with
which you write,

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.380
and there are times
when just changing

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.020
the medium of communication is
enough to shake a story idea

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:21.190
loose or you want that rhythm.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.630
Because with a
manual typewriter,

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:24.040
because you have to
hit the carriage return

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.420
at the end of each
line, there's a moment

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.370
where you're doing
a little composition

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.510
at the end of each line.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.010
And then, when you have
to change the paper,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:31.610
there's another
moment of composition.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.976
So it does completely
change the way I write.

00:51:33.976 --> 00:51:34.906
Yeah.

00:51:34.906 --> 00:51:37.030
AUDIENCE: I saw you at the
American Writers Museum.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.350
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Oh, yeah.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.910
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty sure
you gave this anecdote

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.860
from your research
where you found out

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:49.990
that the voice for a computer in
"Star Trek" is really modeled--

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.584
that was really
surprising to me,

00:51:51.584 --> 00:51:52.750
but it actually makes sense.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.250
Can you say more
about that and what

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.560
you learned when you found
that bit of information?

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.110
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: All right.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.650
Some of this is
me extrapolating,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.440
so let's be clear.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.802
So one of the interesting
things about computer voices

00:52:06.802 --> 00:52:09.010
in the United States is that
they tend, by and large,

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.240
to be women.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:18.620
And we know that the
people with Siri and Alexa

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.210
and these other
things, the people

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.430
have said very specifically
that they were thinking

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.520
about the computer
on "Star Trek"

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.290
when they assigned
the female voice

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.150
and when they were
thinking about it.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:35.520
What's interesting is that "Star
Trek," California, JPL, Jet

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.030
Propulsion Laboratory-- so
if you're doing research

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.820
on space travel,
JPL is the closest

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.370
place that you're going to be
able to go when "Star Trek" was

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.480
coming out.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.450
JPL had a policy
that the only people

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:49.640
they hired for the computer
department were women.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.970
They did not hire
men as a policy,

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.780
and from early, early days.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.479
So the computer voices--

00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:02.520
so that means that you've
got this roomful of men

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.490
at a launch, and
someone will say,

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.000
computer, give us the velocity.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.430
And this one lone woman's
voice will come out and answer.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:15.660
When you look at Germany,
their computer voices

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.680
tend to be male.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.200
When you look at their
early space program,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.430
their computers
tended to be men.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.230
Now, I don't know
that there is--

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.110
I mean, I have correlation,
which is not the same as

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.270
causation, but there
certainly seems

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.770
to be a pattern
there where it looks

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:38.580
very much like art imitating
life, imitating art again.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.470
So I find this back and
forth really fascinating.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.180
AUDIENCE: So I have a daughter,
who I stole this scarf from,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.620
that I was telling you about,
and she's in a Girl Scout

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.270
group that's focused--

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:54.430
they're doing this Lego robotics
focused on space exploration.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.260
And I would love to
hear your thoughts

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.490
on a topic that would be--

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.340
as you did all
this research, what

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.060
would be an interesting topic
that, especially a group

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.600
of girls in kind of
those dynamics with all

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.820
those challenges
that were there early

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.430
on-- what would be an
interesting topic for them

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:15.200
to pick as a research project?

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.150
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
So it's interesting.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:18.566
One of the things
that you make me

00:54:18.566 --> 00:54:22.270
think about when you ask that
is that when I was researching

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.090
this, I watched a number
of episodes of "Mr. Wizard"

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.190
from the 1950s.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:29.050
And then, I also
wound up watching

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:34.190
some of the reboot, the
later reboot from the 70s,

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.516
and there was one
in the 80s, as well.

00:54:36.516 --> 00:54:38.890
And the interesting thing is
that the one in the 80s, all

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:40.848
of the science that
they're having the girls do

00:54:40.848 --> 00:54:41.860
is very gendered.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.190
It's like, let's see about
the science of lipstick.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:46.000
I'm not kidding.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.500
I don't think that
was "Mr. Wizard,"

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.110
but I have actually seen the
science of lipstick, and again,

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.450
very stabby.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.900
The 1950s one is
not gendered at all.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.140
The little girls are in skirts,
absolutely, but they're like,

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.260
let's look at thermodynamics.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.060
Let's look at how
we create batteries.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.600
He speaks to them and
addresses them exactly

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.550
as he would little boys.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:14.660
So in terms of spaceflight, I
think space is a great topic.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:23.354
In terms of something that
is specifically about women,

00:55:23.354 --> 00:55:24.770
one of the things
that I would say

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.735
is have them look at the
early aviation pioneers.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.880
Her name is not in
my head right now,

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:41.260
but does anyone want to make
a guess about what year--

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:46.922
so first of all, the first
professional aeronaut, and that

00:55:46.922 --> 00:55:48.380
should give you a
clue right there.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.110
The first professional
aeronaut was a woman.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:56.120
Does anyone want to guess
about what year this was?

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.170
1811.

00:55:59.170 --> 00:55:59.860
Right?

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.940
1811.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.891
This woman was employed by
Napoleon for her ballooning

00:56:04.891 --> 00:56:05.390
skills.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.965
So I would say--

00:56:10.965 --> 00:56:12.340
I wish I could
remember her name.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.080
I would also say look
at Bessie Coleman.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.600
Bessie Coleman was the first
African-American woman pilot.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.356
It was not legal for her to be
a pilot in the United States.

00:56:21.356 --> 00:56:22.480
She couldn't get a license.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:28.780
And this is in, I want
to say, 1911, 1912.

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.210
Very, very early.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:36.160
So the only place she could get
a license to fly was in Paris.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.740
So she taught herself
French, went to France,

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:45.120
got the pilot's
license, came back.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:49.890
So looking at the
early pioneers--

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:52.911
I think that they are the ones
who often are most written out

00:56:52.911 --> 00:56:55.410
of history because we've had
the most time to write them out

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.020
of history.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.760
So I would look at those.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.100
There's a great book
called "Black Wings," which

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.150
is about African-American
aviation, that

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.880
talks about Bessie Coleman.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.550
I would also say
"Promise to the Moon,"

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.180
which is the story of
the Mercury 13 women.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.670
There's a good
documentary about them.

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.860
So mercury 13 is also--

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.920
what would space look
like if that program

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.090
hadn't been shut down?

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.660
I think about this all the time.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.300
AUDIENCE: I'm interested in
kind of like the release timing

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.982
between "Calculating Sky" and--

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.690
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
"Calculating Stars"

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:34.880
and "Fated Sky."

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.000
AUDIENCE: "Calculating
Stars" and "Fated Sky,"

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.166
which were only three months
apart in release dates.

00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:41.430
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
Not even three months.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.552
AUDIENCE: My wife just
read Maureen Johnson's most

00:57:43.552 --> 00:57:46.010
recent book, only to discover
that it's really half a book,

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.384
and that the rest
of the thriller

00:57:47.384 --> 00:57:49.600
is still not yet to be released.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.020
What was your sort
of thought process

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:55.290
behind let's get that
out in this time frame

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:58.587
and not wait six
months or whatever?

00:57:58.587 --> 00:58:00.420
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
So "Calculating Stars"

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:01.680
came out July 3rd.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.600
"Fated Sky" came out August
21st, which is very fast.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.240
My basic thought process on
that was that my publisher said,

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.573
would you like to do this thing?

00:58:10.573 --> 00:58:12.990
And I said, yes, I would
like to do that thing.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:19.286
The reason that this is an
interesting publishing strategy

00:58:19.286 --> 00:58:21.660
to try when you have an author
who can turn two books out

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.370
that fast--

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.000
I wrote the second
book in six months,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.020
which is very fast for
hard science fiction.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:34.790
The reason is because
there is a known phenomenon

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:37.820
that when the first book
in a series comes out,

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.790
there's a bump.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.310
There's something we call
the series death spiral.

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:48.410
So the fifth book in my
series did not sell as well as

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.970
the first book by a lot.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.880
But the moment I have a book
come out in a new series,

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.540
there's a bump,
and we know that.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.740
So you want you want
new books coming out.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.710
And then we also know that a
lot of people are completists.

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.080
They will wait until an
entire series is finished

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.590
before they buy any of them.

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:08.980
And then, when the
last book comes out,

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.600
there's a bump in the
sales of the first book.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.930
So if you can get both
of them coming out

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:18.120
within about a
month of each other,

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.750
you have both of those phenomena
happening at the same time,

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:25.450
and the book sells
significantly better.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.450
So that's basically--
that was the experiment

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:28.650
that they wanted to try.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:29.860
And it has worked.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.900
Like, when I look at the
diagram of my book sales,

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.750
it's like, these books
are doing very nicely.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:40.380
And then, "Calculating Stars"
happens, and it's way up here.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.259
So it definitely worked.

00:59:42.259 --> 00:59:43.800
There's also a number
of other things

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.674
that are happening with
"Calculating Stars"--

00:59:45.674 --> 00:59:47.790
bringing out a space
book the same year

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:53.130
as the 60th anniversary of
NASA and, the year before,

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.320
the 50th anniversary of Apollo.

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.290
There's a lot of--

00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.550
the timing is good.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.437
I hit "Zeitgeist," as well.

01:00:01.437 --> 01:00:03.270
But that's why they
wanted to bring them out

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.494
back to back like that.

01:00:04.494 --> 01:00:05.910
JASON GESSNER: And
as a reader, it

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:09.012
was so exciting to get to the
end of the first book and go,

01:00:09.012 --> 01:00:10.970
oh, I only have to wait
a short amount of time.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.095
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL: Yeah.

01:00:12.095 --> 01:00:13.300
Yeah.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.880
The other thing that
we did not think

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.610
through when I said,
yes, that sounds great

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:20.430
was that it meant that I had to
do all that promotion, as well.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:23.820
Because usually, you promote the
first book for about two weeks

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.830
before it comes out.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.139
Then, there's another two
weeks of rah, rah, new book.

01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:28.680
When they're coming
out back to back,

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.710
it's just basically
like just promotion

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.520
all the time, which
was, I mean, fun.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.820
It's a good problem to have.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.070
But, whoa, was not expecting it.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.140
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.720
Well, thanks again for coming
out and for the reading

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.022
and for adding us to
your promotional docket.

01:00:46.022 --> 01:00:47.730
MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL:
Thank you for being

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:48.690
in the city I live in.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.523
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

01:00:49.523 --> 01:00:50.510
Happy to.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.299
Well, great.

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:51.840
Thanks a lot.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.680
Mary Robinette.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.730
