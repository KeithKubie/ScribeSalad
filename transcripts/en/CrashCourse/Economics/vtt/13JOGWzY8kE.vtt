Jacob: I’m Jacob Clifford

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.480
Adriene: and I’m Adriene Hill and welcome
to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.230
Jacob: In the last few videos we’ve said
a lot of nice things about how competitive

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.299
markets allocate resources. You know, they
do a pretty good job.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.480
Adriene: But nobody’s perfect. Sometimes
markets get it wrong. Sometimes they fail.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.860
Sometimes the byproducts of production make
people sick. Today we are going to talk about

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.800
those market failures, and how economists
address them.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.720
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.500
In 2105, a story made the rounds online about
a University of Maryland professor and an

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.079
extra credit question: "Select whether you
want 2 points or 6 points added onto your

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.060
final paper grade. But there’s a small catch...if
more than 10% of the class selects 6 points,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.610
then no one gets any points." So, what would
you do?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.239
The question alludes to one of the biggest
problems with free markets: sometimes people

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.480
have a personal incentive to do something
that is against the collective interests of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.200
the group. Obviously, everyone wants at least
some extra credit, but there is also an incentive

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.700
to get even more points. In this situation,
the professor reported that too many people

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.969
chose 6 points and no one got extra credit.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.200
Let's say that your local government sent
a similar proposition to every household in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.189
your city, “Select whether you want to pay
$20 or $100 to fund the local fire department,

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.299
but there’s a small catch: if more than
50% of citizens choose $20 there's not going

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.429
to be enough money to have a fire department.”

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.579
This is the free rider problem. Free riders
are people who benefit without paying. They

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.740
are not necessarily evil, let’s face it,
you probably know someone that's illegally

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.260
downloaded Game of Thrones, but they're responding
to incentives -- why pay more, if I can get it for less?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.920
If too many people think like this, then we're
all worse off and we're going to end up not

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.469
getting the things we want like fire protection
or a satisfying ending to Game of Thrones.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.009
So how do most cities get around the problem
that some people will benefit even if they

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.700
don’t pay. The city doesn’t ask for money,
they demand money in the form of taxes. The

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.159
reasoning is that fire protection is so essential
that people shouldn’t be allowed to opt out.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.890
Jacob: So things that are for our collective
well being, like fire protection, schools,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.989
and national defense are often funded by the
government. When markets alone fail to provide

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.170
enough of these things, that's called market
failures. These are often called public goods,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.090
but the technical definition of a public good
is anything that has two characteristics:

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.480
non-exclusion and non-rivalry. Non-exclusion
is the idea that you can't exclude people

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.780
that don’t pay. For example, it's impossible
to limit the benefits of national defense

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.480
to only people that pay their taxes. People
who pay no federal taxes still get the benefit

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.909
of protection from bombs, and people who pay
a lot of federal taxes don’t get extra protection.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.239
Non-rivalry is the idea that one person’s
consumption of the good doesn’t ruin it

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.359
for other people. So, public parks are a great
example. You can use it today, I can use it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.320
tomorrow; it can be shared. Ideally.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.599
If a good or service meets these two criteria
it's unlikely that private firms will produce

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.439
it, no matter how essential it is. Street lights and
organizations that track and prevent the spread of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.520
diseases are pretty important, and if the government
doesn’t step in, we probably won’t get them.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.939
Adriene: The incentive to do what's best for
you, rather than what's best for everyone

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.129
is the root cause of something economists
call the Tragedy of the Commons. This is the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:29.290
idea that common goods that everyone has access
to are often misused and exploited. It explains

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.019
the cause of most of our environmental problems
like air pollution, deforestation, the killing

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.499
of endangered species, and overfishing.

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.799
In many places in the world, there are more
fish being pulled out of rivers, lakes, and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.219
oceans than are being born. This is not just
bad for the fish; it’s bad for the people

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.739
doing the fishing. As these resources are depleted,
fishermen find themselves without a job.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.260
So why aren’t they conserving? Allowing fish
to reproduce and generate more fish resources

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.799
for the future? Well, look at the incentives.
If a few environmentally conscious fishermen

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.579
decide to give the fish time to spawn, then
some other fisherman will harvest them instead.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.239
If you can’t prevent other people from exploiting
the resource, then you have an incentive to

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.699
exploit it yourself and take as much as you
can, as quickly as you can.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.120
But, with everyone following that logic, the
finite resource gets pillaged. The Tragedy

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.620
of the Commons explains why fish stocks get
depleted, the rainforest get cut down, and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.060
why endangered species get hunted for their
hides or horns. There is an entire subfield

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.190
of economics focused on address and solving
these issues, it is called environmental economics.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.820
Jacob: The problem here is that unregulated
markets sometimes don’t produce the outcome

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.530
that society wants. Remember, sometimes markets
misallocate resources because they don't have

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.260
the right price signals. There is no better
example of this than what economists call

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.950
externalities. Externalities are situations
when there's an external costs or external

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.070
benefits that accrue to other people or society
as a whole. When other people are made worse

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.460
off that's called a negative externality.
When other people are made better off

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.940
that's called a positive externality. Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.940
Let’s look at a TV factory that pollutes
a river with toxic chemicals. This is definitely

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.380
a negative externality. The factory has internal
costs: it has to pay its workers, buy raw

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.560
materials, pay for energy; and it uses those
costs to determine how many TVs to produce.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.810
But there are also external costs associated
with polluting the waterways, like dead fish,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.250
contaminated drinking water, and people getting
sick. Those external costs are paid by people

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.430
downstream, and they are likely to be ignored
by the factory owner. The free market assumes

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.750
that all the costs associated with producing
TVs are accounted for within the price of

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.430
those TVs, but, in this case, the market is
wrong. The end result is a market failure

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.610
because the factory is producing too many
TVs.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.780
As for positive externalities. Think of
education. More education is great for you.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.770
You'll likely generate more income and it
makes you more interesting to talk to at parties.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.090
But there are also external benefits of your
education. Everyone is actually made better off.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.810
With more education you're more likely be
a positive and productive member of society.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.190
And if you earn a higher income, that means
more tax revenue.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.310
Now in both cases, negative and positive externalities,
economists often look to the government to

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.840
step in and solve the problem. For example,
the government could tax the TV factory or

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.250
subsidize education. In fact, externalities
are the justification for almost everything

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.470
the government does. When politicians, tax
cigarettes, fund education, subsidize fuel

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.370
efficient cars, or regulate financial markets,
it's because they are convinced that free

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.400
markets alone are not adjusting for externalities.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.830
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. We’ve tried
to explain the problem of externalities, now

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.340
let’s talk about the solutions. When the
government tries to fix externalities they

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.580
can use regulatory policies or market-based
policies.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.080
Regulatory policies are simply rules established
by government decree. Some people complain

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.560
about regulation. They say, “the government
can’t tell me what to do.” But let's be

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.760
honest, it can. The government also spends
a ton of time and money telling you what you

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.240
can’t do. Don’t drive too fast. Don’t build
a house in Yellowstone. Don’t kill anybody.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.150
It seems like the government probably should
regulate some stuff. The question is, “how

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.120
much should they regulate?” Even people
who adamantly oppose government regulation

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.570
probably agree that nuclear weapons and nerve
gas shouldn't be on the shelves at Target.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.720
Let’s go back to the TV factory example.
To help solve the pollution externality, the

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.470
government could ban the use of certain types
of chemicals or set a production quota to

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.030
limit the production of TVs or regulate what
can be dumped in the river. In the US, the

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.750
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
pushed for laws to control pollution, and

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.430
these regulations have worked.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.520
Regulation can also create positive externalities.
In some cases, the external benefits are perceived

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:43.550
to be so high that the government essentially
takes over the market. Consider education.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.120
Most countries have compulsory education which
requires citizens to be educated up to a specific

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.650
age and the government pays for schools through
taxes.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.310
If the government didn’t get involved, all
education would be provided by private schools

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.930
that would charge tuition; there might not
be enough affordable schools to educate young

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.920
people. The government funds education because
they think that the external benefits, like

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.740
literate, well-informed, erudite citizens,
are so high it's worth forcing everyone to pay.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.420
Jacob: Another way that governments try to
solve externalities is with market-based policies.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.280
These are policies designed to manipulate
markets, prices, and incentives to correct

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.660
for market failures. The best examples are
taxes and subsidies. A tax on the production

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.920
of TVs or on the chemicals the factory is
using will decrease production and limit pollution.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.200
Federal grants that help subsidize college education
will increase the amount of education people buy.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.620
In general, economists tend to prefer market-based
policies. Take cigarettes. Cigarettes generate

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.460
high external costs on society. There's second
hand smoke and there's higher healthcare costs

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.570
for everyone, due to smoking related illnesses.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.310
The government could force cigarettes companies
to produce less, or just shut them down entirely,

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.840
but instead they tax cigarettes. The tax drives
up the price, consumers buy fewer cigarettes,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.920
and this addresses the negative externality.
Now, this market-based approach has one key

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.650
advantage over the regulatory approach. Instead
of spending money on enforcing regulations,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.770
the government is earning tax revenue that
can be used for purposes. In real life, though,

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.610
governments often use both policies. In the
US, the government taxes cigarette producers

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.590
and regulates where people can smoke. It also
restricts how tobacco companies can advertise,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.330
and supports anti-smoking campaigns
designed to convince people to quit smoking.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.890
Seriously, you should stop smoking.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.580
Market-based approaches to reduce negative
externalities are also used to fight climate

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.480
change. Many economists argue that taxes on
carbon-based fuels like coal, oil, and gas

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.330
are a more effective way to deal with air
pollution.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.140
Adriene: One oft-discussed market-based policy
is emissions trading or “cap and trade.”

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.480
The government issues pollution permits and
if your factory doesn’t hold one of those

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.010
permits, it can’t pollute. But companies
can buy or sell those permits.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.910
This sets up incentives to go green: if you
can produce without pollution, you can make

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.510
money by selling your permits. But if you
operate a dirty plant, you have to pay for

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:57.400
those extra permits. As controversial as cap
and trade can be among American politicians,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.800
it’s interesting to note that it's already
been used successfully in the US.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.520
A cap and trade program to reduce acid rain
pollution -- it worked! It cut sulfur dioxide

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.440
emissions. According to a 2003 report from
the Office of Management and Budget, “the

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.110
Acid Rain Program accounted for the largest
quantified human health benefits of any major

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:25.140
federal regulatory program implemented in
the last 10 years, with benefits exceeding

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.500
costs by more than 40:1.”

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.620
Remember that extra credit question? What
if the world’s largest economies were given

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:39.560
a similar proposition: “Select whether you
want to decrease your pollution by 5% or 30%,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:47.600
with a small catch; if more than 50% of counties choose
only 5% then climate change will make Earth unlivable."

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.840
That simplifies the issue, but it does illustrate
why it's so hard to address climate change.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.250
Individual countries might work to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, but they can’t

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.490
prevent other countries from polluting. It’s
the Tragedy of the Commons.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:08.240
In an unregulated global economy, where producers
want to make products as cheaply as possible,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.260
there's an incentive to ignore international
environment to get ahead. Global issues like

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:18.170
climate change, human rights abuses, and nuclear
proliferation can't be effectively addressed

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.100
if countries don’t work together. But that
requires a lot of trust and a lot of commitment.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.850
Jacob: So markets aren't perfect. There are
many cases when the government should get

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.110
involved, and there's even some situations
when the government should just take control.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.130
Adriene: The question isn’t “which is
better: free markets or government?” The

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.760
question is “how can they work together
to make our lives better?”
