[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:07.740
KELLY MARSHALL: But we would
love to know a little bit more

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.590
about you before we get into
RX's story, so talk to us

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.540
a little bit about where
was Sam before RXBAR

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.120
and how did you land at RXBAR?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.770
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.160
So I grew up in the western
suburbs outside Chicago.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.920
Ever since I was a
kid, I loved business.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.810
And when I graduated
from college,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.150
the best way to pursue
that was through finance.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
And so I started my career in
finance doing health care M&amp;A,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.990
and pretty quickly realized I
didn't want to stay in finance.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.340
It just wasn't--

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.300
I had no edge.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.520
I wasn't going to be
the best finance person.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.320
It just wasn't the
right path for me.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.660
I learned that very fast.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.410
And so I called a guy
who'd been a mentor for me,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.200
and he had found a home
security business to buy.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.080
And it was a consumer business,
direct to consumer home

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.030
security concept,
basically 100% digital.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.590
And so it was an
interesting concept

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
and that was my first
foray into operating

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.790
and really entrepreneurship.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.670
So we bought a very small
company west of Topeka

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
in Kansas, rebuilt it as a
completely new concept called

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.840
LiveWatch Home Security, and had
a great, successful run there.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.050
Ultimately, that company was
acquired by a strategic buyer.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.987
And I thought a
lot of the concepts

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:23.820
we had used at LiveWatch,
I thought actually

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.890
could apply well
to a food company.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.250
And Jared and Peter, who we'll
talk about, had founded RXBAR.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.000
And so that's how the
conversation started

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.458
and that's how I
ended up at RXBAR,

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:38.047
was sort of talking through the
connection between how we built

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.130
a home security business
and how it could actually

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.769
apply to a food company.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.310
So I think we'll
get into that, but--

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.180
KELLY MARSHALL:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.990
So I don't know if
all of you know this,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.890
but RXBAR is more
than just bars, right?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.980
So they have grown to be
an international company.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.270
They operate in the United
States, Canada, and the UK.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.385
So they've got the bars,
they've got nut butters,

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.570
and they also have
the RX kid line.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.350
So if you haven't
had an opportunity,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.460
you probably do on your
chairs, but they're also

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.710
in a store near you.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.670
So, all right.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.887
So what do you think?

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:08.720
Could I be in sales?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.460
SAM MCBRIDE: You're doing great.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.021
KELLY MARSHALL: So you
have this prior experience,

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:15.270
and they start talking to you.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.962
So what was your first job?

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:19.920
As an HR person, did you
have a job description

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.240
that you agreed to or--

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.050
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.750
So our first office was
actually down the street,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.440
and this was before
you all were here.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.110
So this is like maybe 10 blocks
west of here, which I think

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.550
is technically
West Loop, but it's

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.450
not like the cool part of West
Loop that you guys work in.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.380
And we worked out
of our warehouse

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.800
so we were surrounded
by pallets.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.490
It was Peter, who
is our CEO, Jared,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.430
who is Peter's co-founder,
myself, and Jessie Stewart.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.590
And Jessie is also a
childhood friend of ours,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.490
so all four of us have known
each other since grade school.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.730
And at that point,
everyone's in sales

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.769
because the only
thing you're doing

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.810
is thinking about how you
get the brand out there

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.970
and how you get the
product in people's hands.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.340
Everyone's sort of in marketing,
but marketing is really

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.040
not a conceptual thing.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.080
It's really fundamentally
to drive sales.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.330
It's like really cause and
effect kind of marketing,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.700
not like brand building stuff.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.600
And then Peter and
Jared had a lot

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.690
of familiarity with the supply
chain manufacturing process

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.050
because they built the
business manufacturing by hand.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.477
So long answer is not really.

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.310
When there were four
of us, everyone kind of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.950
did a bit of everything and
the business was very simple.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.516
It was make bars and sell bars.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:39.539
And that was basically it.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.580
And then like in between
there, hopefully there's

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.270
enough cash to buy enough
raw materials to make

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.867
more bars the next time.

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:48.450
But that was essentially
the business,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.874
and it was really not much more
complex than that at the time.

00:03:51.874 --> 00:03:53.790
KELLY MARSHALL: So jack
of all trades probably

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.240
would've been at the top
of that job description?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.000
SAM MCBRIDE: Probably everyone's
job description back then,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.499
yeah.

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.840
KELLY MARSHALL: So you talked
about it started by hand.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.510
Say a little bit more about
the innovation by hand part.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.510
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.940
So Peter's family is
in the food space,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.750
and so he had deep
intimacy with the food

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.140
just growing up with a
family in the food business.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.980
And basically what
Jared and Peter

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.610
saw in the market was that
there were clean bars,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.950
but there really weren't
clean protein bars.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.560
So the question that they
asked and the problem that they

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.220
solved with RXBAR
was, why isn't there

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.350
a protein bar that's clean?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.040
And so the original way
that they manufactured

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.150
was taking a 5-quart mixer
like you have at your house,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.750
putting in dates, at the
time, it was half a fig,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.410
some egg white, and then
depending on the flavor,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.150
you would have almonds
and blueberries

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.060
or you might have
coconut or some cacao.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.520
All the chocolate flavors
used to be called cacao,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.679
but no one knew
what cacao was so we

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:56.970
started calling them chocolate.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.791
People would be like,
what's "kuh-koe-uh?"

00:04:58.791 --> 00:04:59.790
We were like, all right.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.920
This is not good.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.170
But so they manufactured
them by hand.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.110
Hand pressed them
into bar molds,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.360
put them into
resealable pouches,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.880
and then initially
drove them around

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.680
to CrossFit gyms in the area.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.930
And then later, in the
next version the business,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.600
they actually shipped some
product around the country

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.750
to different CrossFit gyms
mostly and then direct

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.500
to people's homes.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.980
But the business was
built in its infancy

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.050
on two guys hand forming with
their thumbs protein bars.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.580
KELLY MARSHALL: Wow.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.870
That brings some interesting
pictures to light.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.490
And probably some trial and
error happened in that kitchen?

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.920
SAM MCBRIDE: Yes, definitely.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.650
KELLY MARSHALL: If that
kitchen could talk.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.399
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.870
Mrs. Rahal was--

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.730
I still call her Mrs.
Rahal because she

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.770
was the first person
fired from the company.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.642
She was putting front
labels on both sides.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.100
But yeah, a lot of
trial and error.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.120
KELLY MARSHALL: You had some
HR early on, it sounds like.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.540
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.623
KELLY MARSHALL: Very good.

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:57.710
Well it's fun to see
how it all started.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.040
So you know, one of
the biggest things

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.450
that Peter Rahal,
so the founder,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.980
talked about in an
article recently

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.080
with Forbes was just all
the naysayers and all

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.913
the challenges and
people, all the doubters.

00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:09.470
So you know, you
are just coming off

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.942
of a pretty successful
experience prior to joining RX.

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.150
Do you recall kind of like,
how did you guys get over

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.730
those hurdles?

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.150
How did you get over that
hurdle to join the organization?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.020
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.760
So it's actually become--

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.790
so my first experience
operating is in home security.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.080
And the home security
company was like 50 miles,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.230
maybe 100 miles west
of Topeka in Kansas.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.730
So how many people have been 100
miles west of Topeka in Kansas?

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.560
Yeah, OK, so not a ton.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.900
So this small, you
know, rural area.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.750
And I still
remember, my wife was

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.065
working for a private
equity firm at the time,

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:45.440
and I would go to
their meetings.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.600
And you know, private equity
people are pretty cool.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.183
And so I would tell
them like, yeah, I

00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:51.700
sell home security
systems from Topeka.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.560
And they were just like,
wow, like who is this loser?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.100
But it actually has
become a filter for me.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.940
So I think any kind of early
stage company or product,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.090
if it's not met with enough
people that don't get it

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.472
or if it's not like kind
of uncomfortable for you

00:07:08.472 --> 00:07:10.930
and a little bit embarrassing
to explain what you're doing,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.340
probably too many people
are already doing it.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.230
And so when I think
about LiveWatch,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.360
that was for sure true,
and the same thing

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.406
was true in a different
way for RXBAR, where

00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.030
number one, the first
reaction is like,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.290
why do we need another bar?

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.290
There's hundreds of bars.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.410
And then from there, once
you explain like, hey, there

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.230
actually is a product position
here, then it's like, OK,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.820
how are you can
actually execute?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.080
None of you are from food.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.385
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:40.010
And then when it came
to the packaging,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.190
this is my favorite one.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.250
So the packaging is what
we're famous for now.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.380
You know, we win awards for it.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.960
People are like, oh my god,
the packaging is genius.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.150
And when we first did the--

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.769
who's eaten them in
the old packaging?

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:53.060
There's probably like a couple.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.320
Yeah, OK.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.500
KELLY MARSHALL: The
resealable ones, right?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.710
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.060
Well the resealable
were the first,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.268
and there's a second version.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:01.190
But if you look them up online,
they're not good looking.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.590
And it was only because we
were marketing to a very, very

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.550
specific niche that it worked.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.600
But when we made that change, we
showed people the new packaging

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.280
that you see today.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.185
Everyone was like, this is the
worst thing I've ever seen.

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:16.100
They were like,
this is terrible.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.530
We even showed it
to retail buyers

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.600
who we were ultimately
going to have to sell to.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.060
And they were like,
we will never--

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.830
like, I can't be
clear about this.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.600
We will not take your product
if it looks like this.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.820
So it's just another
example where

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.740
we were so confident
in it because we

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.909
were so close to the consumer.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.726
And we were selling
direct to consumer.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.100
We were taking their phone
calls, answering their e-mails

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.059
when they had problems.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.850
We were so tightly
connected to the consumer

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.510
that we knew that
it would resonate.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.480
We knew it would work.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.450
So even in the face of
people literally saying

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.300
like, I'll never buy
this product from you,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.110
we still did it.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.600
But I think it goes to
the theme of like people

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.336
who are doubters, sometimes that
can actually be a good signal.

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:01.922
KELLY MARSHALL:
And so how did you

00:09:01.922 --> 00:09:03.297
win the hearts
and minds of them,

00:09:03.297 --> 00:09:05.080
of the retailers that
eventually, clearly,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.480
have bought some of your bars?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.840
SAM MCBRIDE: So
ultimately, the retailers

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.060
are servicing their customers.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.589
And so if there's
enough customer demand,

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:14.880
they're going to respond to it.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.504
And we knew our
customers intimately.

00:09:17.504 --> 00:09:18.920
And when we think
of customers, we

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.290
think of individual
people, not retailers.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.630
I mean, retailers are our
customers too, but really,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.610
the consumer.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.300
And so the consumer responded
so well to the product.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.580
And our customers who
were buying online

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.980
or who were posting on
Instagram, they loved it.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.290
You could just see that
they were so excited

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.540
about the packaging, and so
eventually, the retailers

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.039
came around.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.336
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:42.140
You know, numbers talk, right?

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.740
Let's be honest.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.740
So I mean, you kind of
hit the nail on the head.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.410
It was a really saturated
market when you guys decided,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.090
we're going to take
up this charge.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.940
So like, did you ever imagine
you'd be this successful?

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.770
And what really-- the
packaging is great,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.170
but what really distinguishes
the RXBAR from you name it?

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.100
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.770
So I think one of the key
distinguishing-- number

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.380
one, the product does
solve a clear problem.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.550
So Peter and Jared's
insight was right,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.100
that there wasn't
a protein bar that

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.090
was as clean as what
you'd get out of

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.990
like, say, a LARABAR, which just
doesn't have as much protein

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.890
but is a clean product.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.530
So the first thing
is the product,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.290
just it totally
solved a problem.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.330
And we always talk
about it now, if you're

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.130
solving a problem
with a product,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.690
you're running downhill.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.930
You know, that is
like essential.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.910
But then the big
differentiating factor for us

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:41.480
was that we spent about two
and a half years exclusively

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.080
selling to CrossFit gyms,
other fitness studios,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.290
and then direct to consumer.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.650
And so we understood
our product's value

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.290
from the perspective
of our customers

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.650
so intimately that we
had a great instinct

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.200
for the business,
and it was because we

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.630
were talking directly to
the people consuming it.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.060
So if you think about it, if
you go a traditional route

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.534
and you sell in the
grocery stores first,

00:11:10.534 --> 00:11:12.200
you're selling to a
distributor and then

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.000
a grocery store
and then someone's

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.840
walking in and eating it.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.695
And most people, like who's ever
called an 800 number for a food

00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:20.570
product that you bought
in the grocery store?

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.880
Like nobody, no one does that,
so you don't get any feedback.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.930
And so we were so
tight with the consumer

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.290
that we understood
it intimately.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.030
And so the big
differentiating factor

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.300
was when we went into
the traditional channels,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.970
in grocery, we
went in a way that

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.640
was speaking to our
consumers really

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.441
clearly, the packaging
being the biggest form.

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.690
So I think that was the
biggest differentiating factor

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.740
in the business.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.720
We thought it'd be
successful, but we never

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.880
really like set out, what
are our expectations?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.510
But if you'd asked us
four years ago, for sure,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.040
this is faster and
more successful

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.340
than we would have bet
back then for sure.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.840
KELLY MARSHALL: So
one last question

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.130
related to the early
days, and then we're

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.210
going to move
forward a little bit

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.668
to kind of where
you guys are today

00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:15.300
and what's happened in
the last year or so.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.350
If you can, what are some
of your earliest just

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.130
funny memories of
like, oh my gosh,

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.190
I can't believe
we made that work,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.680
or oh my god, I can't
believe I had to do this,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.660
but we pulled it off?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.931
Just what are some good
memories from the early days?

00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:29.540
SAM MCBRIDE: So my
favorite-- and this

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.140
speaks a lot to the
company culture,

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.880
but it's just also a good story.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.260
So we went to Expo West
for our first time in 2015,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.460
and Expo West is the biggest
food convention in the country.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.910
Every natural brand that you've
ever heard of is at Expo West.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.780
I think 150,000 people were
there last year, so it's

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.150
like the Super Bowl of food.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.790
And so we're still
in the old packaging.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.955
We have no retail
distribution at this point

00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.810
because we're a
dot.com business,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.150
and we're really thought
of as a CrossFit brand

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.440
by anybody who's heard of it.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.480
But most people just
hadn't heard of it,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.550
so we're like not
on the map at all.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.660
And we've rented this 10 by
10 space, and like KIND bar

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.400
next to us has
like a city block,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.060
and there's like fireworks
going off and roller coasters,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.630
and we're just like, oh my god.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.360
Like, we are massively
outgunned here.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.250
So Peter and I flew
in the day before,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.470
and we didn't even have a booth.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.670
So we had reserved the space,
but we're just running so fast

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.570
at that time that we
didn't even have time

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.100
to like design
and build a booth.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.820
And so we had like a
backdrop that had the bars,

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.644
and like a little, you know,
slogan or something like that.

00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:41.810
And we were like, all right.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.380
We'll fly into LA a day ahead
and we'll build this booth.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.160
Like we'll go to Home
Depot and wherever else.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.920
And so we built a booth
and it was honestly decent.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.430
Like you wouldn't be
super impressed by it,

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.910
but it wasn't terrible.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.730
And so the night before,
we all huddled up.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.030
And so it was Jessie, Jared,
Peter, and I at the time.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.670
And we huddled up, and
we were like, all right.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.500
We don't really have
that great of a booth.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.550
Nobody knows us.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.750
We have no retail distribution
to speak of, but if we--

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.270
we had walked the show
the night before, another

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.890
show that was adjacent.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.660
And we were like, if
we bring good energy

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.390
and we engage people
and we share our product

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.950
and we share the
story and we're like

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.090
genuinely good to be
around, it won't really

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.256
matter what the booth
looks like, right?

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:29.630
And one of the
key things-- and I

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.550
see Megan smiling because she
knows what I'm about to say.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.830
So one of the key things
that we figured out

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.250
was that when you walk up
to people's booths, often,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.830
they will look at your badge,
figure out whether or not

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.440
you're worth talking to,
and then either talk to you

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.180
or kind of like dismiss you.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.550
And we were like, god,
that's like so rude.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.070
You know, they're just sizing
me up based on my title

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.784
and company and whatever.

00:14:50.784 --> 00:14:52.700
And so we came up with
this rule that morning.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.700
We were like, all right.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.019
We are not badge fucking people.

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.560
Because like that's
what's happening.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.960
They're badge fucking you,
and they decide whether or not

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.390
they want to spend
time with you.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.890
And so we're like, this is like
a hard rule for the company,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.620
like no badge fucking.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.180
And so we have this
little sign that

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.450
hangs in our booths today
that says no badge fucking

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.860
with a little red thing.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.400
Am I allowed to swear here?

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.350
This whole recording
might be just thrown out.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.670
KELLY MARSHALL: Equal
opportunity to anyone

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.110
who came to your booth
is what I'm hearing.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.235
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.396
But so that was something like,
number one, the scrappiness

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.020
and entrepreneurial
spirit to just like

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.050
go out there and build this
thing the day before, but then

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.910
also to think about like, OK.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.504
Who are we engaging and what's
the right way to engage them,

00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:42.670
and remembering that every
single person that we met

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.050
was a potential consumer.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.810
Even if they weren't
Kroger's buyer,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.940
they might be somebody
who goes into a Kroger

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.250
and buys bars who,
ultimately, is actually

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.160
more important than
Kroger's buyer anyways.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.930
So that's one of
the early stories

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.597
that I think we still
think a lot about.

00:15:57.597 --> 00:15:58.471
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:15:58.471 --> 00:15:59.350
That's fabulous Yeah.

00:16:02.025 --> 00:16:02.525
I love it.

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:03.460
I love it.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.860
So, you know,
humble roots, right?

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.659
That's a theme here
and that's just

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.200
what's so inspiring
about this story,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.286
is you guys were literally in
the trenches figuring it out.

00:16:12.286 --> 00:16:14.410
You were learning as fast
as you were doing, right?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.440
And clearly some good
learnings on that first trip.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.620
So let's talk a little bit
more about the product.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.790
So we've talked about
the packaging is amazing.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.210
It filled a need.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.676
So how have you guys kind
of evolved the product

00:16:25.676 --> 00:16:27.550
when you think about
innovation, specifically

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.710
the bar and kind of what's
continuing to distinguish it

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.293
in the market?

00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:32.440
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah,
so the bar itself

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.510
is very close to the
original formula.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.870
The big difference is
we've replaced half a fig

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.964
with cashews.

00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:44.380
And the reason for that was
we kept hearing from consumers

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.090
that, hey, it
sticks to my teeth.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.490
And so one of the
ways to help mitigate

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.680
that was to replace
fig with cashew.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.120
But in a larger sense, we're
always looking at like,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.510
how do we make the product
incrementally better,

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.960
so we're always
improving the bar.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.864
Even if the ingredient
isn't changing,

00:17:03.864 --> 00:17:05.530
we're just thinking
a lot about like how

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.377
do we make those small
incremental improvements.

00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:10.210
And then when we think
about new innovation,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.630
like the nut butters
that were on your chairs,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.550
we really think about
it from the same lens

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.410
that we looked at the
bar category, which

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.160
is, is there a crowded category
where there is an opportunity

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.770
add value, so adding protein
into a category that maybe

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.620
doesn't have that
offering, or is there

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.810
an opportunity to add
simplicity and simplify

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.070
a category with a
product like RXBAR that

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.575
was significantly simpler
from an ingredient standpoint.

00:17:39.575 --> 00:17:40.534
KELLY MARSHALL: Got it.

00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:42.533
And so congratulations
on the nut butter launch.

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:45.070
It's been great and I'm pretty
sure our family might keep it

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.244
in business.

00:17:46.244 --> 00:17:48.410
But they're delicious, so
please, everyone try them.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.080
They're fantastic.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.440
You know, the market
is changing, consumers

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.210
are changing, so
there's a lot of GMO

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.380
this, non-this, non-that,
different diet trends, vegan,

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.567
Keto, all of those things.

00:18:01.567 --> 00:18:04.150
How are you guys thinking about
that and what kind of approach

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.355
are you taking?

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:08.470
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah,
and especially-- so

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.320
our early adopters, many
of them were either doing

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.100
a Whole30, which is a
type of nutritional reset,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:20.210
maybe they're a paleo eater,
so a lot of our early adopters,

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.930
they are cutting edge
eaters in the sense

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.090
that they'll experiment
with different diets

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.220
and figure out what
works well for them.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.860
So we definitely
pay attention to it.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.784
Instagram's an amazing
source of information

00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:33.700
when it comes to that.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.320
Like you can just
see trends and you

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.620
can see how people talk about
it, so we watch it closely.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.780
But we don't overreact
to any trend because--

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.890
and the packaging
actually reflects that.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.820
So it would have been very
easy for us to put paleo

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.060
on the front so that we would
attract paleo consumers,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.970
or put gluten free on
the front so we'd attract

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:00.820
gluten free consumers, but we
kept the labeling extremely

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.180
simple because we wanted to
appeal to people who wanted

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.650
clean, simple ingredients.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.500
And our thought was, if
you're a paleo consumer

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.120
or a gluten free
consumer, you're

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.940
going to see the ingredients
and know that you can eat it.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.220
We don't really need to
spell that out for you.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.520
And so we keep an eye on trends.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.200
We don't overreact
to them, but we

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.280
think generally, the
trend that's here to stay

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.000
and will grow significantly
is really just clean eating

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.910
and whole food
ingredients, really trying

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.424
to simplify the
foods that people

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:35.590
are putting in their bodies.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.670
So we'll always be
tied to whole foods,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.230
clean simple ingredients.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.420
And sometimes we'll
hit a trend, but it

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.256
won't be intentional to
just like chase a trend.

00:19:46.256 --> 00:19:47.380
KELLY MARSHALL: Sure, yeah.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.754
And talk to us a
little bit-- how

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.860
do you guys come up
with the flavors, right?

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.220
So pumpkin spice is the fall
one, but talk to us a lot

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.120
about the innovation.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.010
And you guys have stayed pretty
consistent on the core bar

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.000
flavors, so what
brings about, maybe

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.860
let's introduce another
flavor into the market?

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.190
SAM MCBRIDE: So honestly,
it's a lot of just

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.570
internal experimentation.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.270
So we have a team
at our office here

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.840
in Chicago that experiments
with different flavors.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.940
And one rule that has been
a firm rule since day one

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.380
is that it has to taste good.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.480
So we're not going to
look at the category

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.486
and say, hey, we're
missing X, Y, or Z flavor,

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:28.360
and just say we have to
formulate that flavor

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.880
and you have to get
it out by March.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.960
It's really driven
by the product.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.430
And because our roots are
digital and direct to consumer

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.970
and direct to independent
CrossFit gyms,

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.720
we don't necessarily
build flavors

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.940
for a retailer's
reset schedule, which

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.450
is a very common thing
in big food companies.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.910
Once the food is ready
and it tastes great

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.950
and we feel really
good about the product,

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.780
we can launch it on our website
before we go into a retailer.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.540
So the process is really
designed around the food.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.390
And when something tastes great
that we feel awesome about,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.290
then we'll launch it.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.248
KELLY MARSHALL: Got it.

00:21:06.248 --> 00:21:08.290
What are some favorite
flavors in the audience?

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.960
Who's a chocolate
sea salt person?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.520
Peanut butter chocolate?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.750
That's me.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.600
Who's loving the new
blueberry in the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.791
Yeah.

00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:19.040
What is the number one seller?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.373
SAM MCBRIDE: Chocolate sea salt.

00:21:20.373 --> 00:21:21.490
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.510
Sweet and salty
gets us every time.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.060
So it's been a busy
past year for you guys.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.210
I don't know if anybody's
aware, we probably are,

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:35.050
but you guys had a pretty
successful 2017, being acquired

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.520
by Kellogg's for a mere $600
million so congratulations

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.300
on that.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.850
That's something to very proud
of, but that's a big change.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.367
So my previous career
was in CPG as well

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.700
and, you know, I've gone
through kind of the acquisition

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.900
experience.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.714
And so I would just love to hear
your perspective, and you know,

00:21:52.714 --> 00:21:53.380
Peter and Jared.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.880
What were you guys
thinking when you

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.971
thought about kind of going
public and joining a bigger

00:21:58.971 --> 00:21:59.470
brand?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.415
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:02.290
The biggest thing that
we were thinking about

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.500
was values alignment, so we
learned early in the business--

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.920
so because we'd all known each
other, we grew up together,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.128
it's kind of like you never
sit down with your family

00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:13.200
and write out your core
values, you know I mean?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.330
They just sort of like are
what they are and everybody

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.470
knows them.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.470
And that was how it was
in the early days for us

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.230
because we'd all grown up
together, so it was easy.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.000
But once we got to a
certain number of people,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.480
we realized we really
needed to be really

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.449
thoughtful about core values
and make sure that we all

00:22:31.449 --> 00:22:33.740
knew what they were, we were
communicated consistently,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.430
we were hiring around it, we
were firing because of it,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.390
promoting all that stuff.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.210
And so the same thing
was true when we

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.080
went through the sale process.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.560
Anybody that we spoke with, we
were really clear about what

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.870
our values were and that
we felt like alignment

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.190
was really important.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.330
And then Kellogg had had
experience with Kashi

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:59.260
where they bought
Kashi and ended up

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.960
integrating Kashi, sort
of taking Kashi back out

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.180
of Kellogg and making
it a standalone.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.180
And through that
process, they were

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.637
really committed to keeping
RXBAR as a standalone business.

00:23:10.637 --> 00:23:12.970
So that was a huge thing for
us as we talked to Kellogg,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.940
is they had had experience that
they didn't want to repeat,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.450
and so they were really
thoughtful about communicating

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.230
with us about maintaining
RXBAR's autonomy and ability

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.740
to operate as a
standalone business.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.781
So that was a huge thing.

00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.657
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:28.031
And so something
that strikes me,

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:29.510
you know, you guys
are so principal

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.218
and it's about what
you guys really think

00:23:31.218 --> 00:23:32.590
and listening to your consumers.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.650
You know, becoming part of
a much larger organization

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.586
is really impactful actually
to the consumer potentially, so

00:23:38.586 --> 00:23:40.960
how did you think about talking
to your consumers as well

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.700
as your employees
who kind of started

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.950
with this entrepreneurial,
loved what they were doing,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.824
and like significant
change probably for them

00:23:46.824 --> 00:23:48.670
even though you'd
remained a standalone?

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.440
How did you guys think
about that communication?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.190
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.471
So it had to be--

00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:55.720
so it's a tricky thing because
you get a lot of advice

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.400
on it, and competing advice.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.500
But ultimately,
it came down to we

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.750
had to be-- so your
values and your principles

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.290
are tested not when
things are easy and good,

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.640
but when there's a
tricky situation.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.990
And so we leaned on those
and we built a culture

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.840
that's extremely transparent.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.000
We talk about
authenticity a lot,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
and so it would have been
totally against our culture

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.520
had like, you know, we showed
up on a Thursday morning

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.550
and been like, hey,
Kellogg has bought us.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.390
The announcement's
happening tomorrow.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.030
And so we brought the team
along from the earliest

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.460
stages so everybody-- at that
time, we were 100 people or so.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.260
Everybody knew
about the process.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.700
We would update people on where
the process was at generally,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.660
without disclosing
anything confidential.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.690
But we were really
transparent with the team,

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.650
I think way more transparent
than a typical company is

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.835
during an acquisition process.

00:24:52.835 --> 00:24:55.210
And so that was the biggest
thing, was being transparent.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.730
And then we did the same
thing with our customers.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.027
So we thought the
exact same thing.

00:25:02.027 --> 00:25:03.860
We were like, you know,
we're proud of this.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.443
We think it was good
for the business.

00:25:05.443 --> 00:25:07.290
We think it was the
right thing to do.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.030
And so why wouldn't we tell
the most important stakeholder

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.970
in the business, which is
that people that eat the bars?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:19.190
And so we sent out an
email that was so on brand

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.500
for us that was
just super direct,

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.920
and I think the subject
line was, Kellogg bought us,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.330
or something like that.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.160
But it was just
super direct, and we

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.769
weren't going to like,
hope nobody heard

00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:32.560
about it or something
like that, because we

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560
were really proud of it.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.280
And so the whole process was
really driven by thinking,

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.880
how can we be totally
transparent and authentic?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.755
And overall, it was
received really well.

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:46.790
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.500
That level of
transparency, I think

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.769
that's something that we share
similarly here at Google.

00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:53.810
And so just curious, you
know, what were you guys

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.230
looking for in deciding to
join a larger organization,

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.470
assuming things are on scale
which we're experiencing

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.410
as we continue to grow, but what
has Kellogg brought for you?

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.160
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.170
So I mean, they're a 100
plus year old global--

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.900
Kellogg was really one of
the first food companies

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.500
to be a global company.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.580
And so they have
international expertise

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.130
that's second to
none and in basically

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.750
every corner of the world.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.510
And so they brought
a global perspective

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.900
that would have been really
hard to build internally, really

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.220
hard to build as fast as
we needed to build it.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.400
So that's one of
the biggest things,

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.140
is they just bring an incredible
global perspective for us.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.015
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:26:35.015 --> 00:26:35.990
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.010
And curious, you
know, what do you

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.300
think you have brought
to them, right?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.740
Because you guys have
had some great successes

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.204
and some learnings at that.

00:26:41.204 --> 00:26:42.620
A smaller group
is able to kind of

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.890
fail fast and, again,
former CPG, it's

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.199
slower to respond to things.

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:49.490
So what do you think they're
benefiting from having you

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.210
under their wings?

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.960
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.750
So Kellogg is used to
operating in a world where

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.540
the brands are huge and
they're fully distributed

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.980
and they're global.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.550
And most of our time,
until the last 12 months

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.390
or so, we were a
small challenger brand

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:14.430
that was coming into a set, that
was operated incredibly lean,

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.600
and went to market
in a unique way.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.010
And so when they're thinking
about new brand launches,

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.800
there's a lot that they're able
to glean from us because that's

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.770
really where we're
really strong.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.710
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.231
And from what we've heard,
it's gone really well.

00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:29.730
Right?

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:30.966
Which isn't always the case.

00:27:30.966 --> 00:27:33.090
Sometimes, you know, you're
kind of the case study,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.140
the poster child for
successful acquisitions.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.260
So you know, they've
kind of allowed

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.341
you to remain kind of your
own operating business,

00:27:40.341 --> 00:27:40.840
if you will.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.262
But what else is going well,
or what is a day like at RXBAR

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.720
today, maybe
different or similarly

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.700
than it was a year ago?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.090
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.860
So it's different than
it was a year ago,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.090
but not because of Kellogg.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:56.372
So Kellogg has been amazing
in that they've really

00:27:56.372 --> 00:27:58.080
done everything that
they said they would

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.300
throughout the
acquisition process,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.650
but the company has grown.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.110
So the company is
twice as big as it

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.510
was when the
acquisition happened

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.910
which was about a year ago.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.570
And so the day to day has
changed just because we're

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.560
a bigger organization.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.200
I mean, it's nothing like you
all, but we have 250 people.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.320
We're now sold in
international markets.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.710
There are more people on the
team that have specialties

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.532
than we've ever had before.

00:28:24.532 --> 00:28:26.990
So the business has changed,
but it's all just sort of-- it

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.080
would have changed
whether or not

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.220
we were acquired by Kellogg.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.178
KELLY MARSHALL: Got it.

00:28:30.178 --> 00:28:32.550
And what are some challenges
that you guys are maybe

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.040
dealing with today that
having greater scale

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.110
has presented that, you
know, two years ago, it

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.049
wasn't something maybe
even on your radar?

00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:40.590
SAM MCBRIDE: Challenges
we're dealing

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.156
with today because of scale?

00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:44.280
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah, just
as you continue to grow.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.395
It's not always easy.

00:28:45.395 --> 00:28:51.360
SAM MCBRIDE: Well we have more
customer stakeholders now.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.080
So we're sold in
almost every retailer.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.800
We're sold in Canada,
the UK, and working

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.540
on more and more GOs.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.020
And so the business just
takes more coordination.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.260
Like if you picture when there
were four of us in a warehouse,

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.150
it's just easy because you know
what everybody else is doing.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.475
And essentially, there
are company shared goals

00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:14.850
and there's four people, and
so each of those four people

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.010
have one top
priority for the day,

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.890
let's say, so you have four
organizational top priorities.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.540
So once you have 250 people,
now, even though everybody's

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.639
marching in the same direction,
there are more stakeholders

00:29:28.639 --> 00:29:30.180
and more people
working on a project.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.400
So I think the biggest
change has been coordination

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.275
internally.

00:29:33.275 --> 00:29:34.650
KELLY MARSHALL:
And so how has it

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.660
changed how you've had to
lead, or the leadership

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.070
has had to lead the
business differently?

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.820
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.230
So in the early stage--

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.540
I always think of
it as a continuum,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.420
and there's like
execution and strategy.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.760
And this isn't perfect,
but in the early days,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.090
you're like 95
execution, 5 strategy.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.220
You know at a high level
where you're going,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.530
but really all you're
doing is executing.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.750
And then as the
business grows, you

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:02.520
have to spend more time on
strategy because now you're

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.640
driving a much larger
organization towards a goal.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.530
And so that, we've
definitely shifted a bit more

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.376
and added more strategic
long-term thinking,

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:16.500
but I'd say that's probably
the biggest difference.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.860
KELLY MARSHALL:
Yeah, interesting.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.190
It's a different muscle, right?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.940
I mean, you're growing
in your leadership,

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.542
the whole team, so
I'm sure it's been

00:30:23.542 --> 00:30:24.750
a pretty interesting journey.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.090
Hopefully you have some
good HR around you.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.840
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.040
And as a leader, it's
different because you

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.680
go from being able
to touch everything

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.166
to almost being able to have
your hands on nothing almost.

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.040
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.840
You have to let go and delegate.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.590
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:43.770
And so you have to be able to
trust your team, empower them,

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.080
but you just can't--

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.242
you literally can't
micromanage it.

00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:49.200
And so I think that's
one of the hardest things

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.270
as a leader is making
that transition from,

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.030
hey, I get to put my head
down and just go do stuff.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.000
And doing stuff gives you
instant gratification.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.790
Like you go and sell it
into a Costco region,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.310
and they say yes, and you're
like, yes, like in the moment.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.780
But the other side of
it, you get very little

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:11.740
instant gratification and
it's almost all setting things

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.840
in place to
hopefully make things

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.340
work six or 12 months from now.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.200
And so that's a very
different thing.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.170
And especially just
that feedback loop

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.370
is a little harder
to digest honestly,

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.305
because the instant
gratification feels good.

00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:26.680
KELLY MARSHALL:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.960
So while we're on the topic
of just people and talent,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.334
we'll come back
a little bit more

00:31:30.334 --> 00:31:32.660
to the product and the business.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.630
You know, my understanding
is that you guys

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.130
take your talent
and the development

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.130
very seriously, which is
something that's really

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.280
important to us at Google.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.040
But I hear you've got some
interesting maybe people,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.054
talent development
practices at RX

00:31:44.054 --> 00:31:46.470
that would be interesting for
the group, I think, to hear,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.240
in terms of, while we're on the
topic, a bit of transparency.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.990
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.860
Yeah.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.550
So as I sort of
briefly mentioned

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.760
before, we got to a stage
where we could feel like,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.720
wow, we've outgrown
our clothes basically.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.220
And a lot of it was
people who had previously

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.600
been working seamlessly,
all of a sudden it was like,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.200
man, this just doesn't feel
as smooth as it once did.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.100
And so we brought in a
coach who started out

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.800
as an executive coach, and
the first thing that she did

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.600
was had us take a tool called
DiSC, which is kind of a comm--

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.694
and I see some nods so maybe you
guys have tried it or used it.

00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:26.360
You guys use it?

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.080
KELLY MARSHALL:
Personality profile.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:27.355
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:32:27.355 --> 00:32:28.150
KELLY MARSHALL: Some groups.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.525
SAM MCBRIDE: And like a lot
of it is personality profile,

00:32:30.525 --> 00:32:32.650
but a lot of it's tied
in to communication.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.570
And so that was the
first thing that

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.960
helped us take a step back
and sort of look at the team

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.930
and the way it was
built and say, OK.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.630
I can see where we might have
some gaps because we have

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.830
all drivers and no people
who are like detail oriented

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.000
and slower, right?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.470
And that's not
exactly what we had,

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.720
but you could start to like
see where the holes were

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.170
in the organization.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.260
And so that was the first
time that we used it,

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.830
but what that
started was we focus

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.370
a lot on the individual
employee, what they're

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.240
naturally really good
at, how they show up,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.180
and what are the
areas that they need

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.820
to be aware of as derailers.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.060
And so as a part
of that process,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.630
we want people to be vulnerable
because you sort of have to be

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:24.685
in order to really understand
what's-- because you know,

00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:27.970
the way you work and like you
as a human is being put on this

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.670
piece of paper and it's
kind of like unnerving.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.100
And so you have to build
an environment where people

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.990
are vulnerable enough to receive
that openly and then act on it,

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.290
and then hopefully share it
and be transparent enough

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.110
with it to use it and let
the other people around

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.160
them use it.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.450
And so one of the ways that
we were talking about it--

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.420
and one of the things
is that everybody

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.510
who has a direct report has
one on ones weekly with them.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.570
And we sort of felt like
one on ones and reviews

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.950
are probably just not going
as well as they should be,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.870
and part of it is probably
because new managers are

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.600
uncomfortable giving
tough feedback,

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.030
probably people are not
that good at receiving it,

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.880
but there's this
feedback loop problem.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.440
And so Peter and I were like,
all right, what if we just

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.440
do my annual review in
front of the whole company

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.270
at an all hands meeting?

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:28.030
Because there couldn't be a
more public way to do my review.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.030
And also, so in addition to
me just like putting my money

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.060
where my mouth is and say like,
hey, you should be open to this

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.000
and you should share
your flaws and be

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.900
open with the team
about them, it

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.290
also showed them that like
I have legitimate weaknesses

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.460
and like legitimate areas
where I had to improve.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.250
And so it was really good,
and it was amazing afterwards.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.550
So many people came up and
were like, that was amazing.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.240
And we actually had one guy in
the room who was from Kellogg,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.520
and he was like,
that was ridiculous.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.070
He's like, you would
never have seen

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.570
that like at a bigger company.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.030
And so it was really,
really effective

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.580
in getting the idea that
like being vulnerable is OK

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.837
and everybody's got pretty
decent sized weaknesses.

00:35:12.837 --> 00:35:14.920
KELLY MARSHALL: So who's
signing up for that here,

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.730
next time around?

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:16.301
Anyone?

00:35:16.301 --> 00:35:16.800
No?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.140
OK, we'll come back to that.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.640
So let's switch back a little
bit more to kind of the market

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.660
and what's going
on in the industry.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.440
So technology is
changing things,

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.376
so let's talk a little bit about
e-commerce, club, traditional.

00:35:29.376 --> 00:35:31.750
How are you guys going to
market a little bit differently

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.220
and how are you thinking
about some of those things?

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.928
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah, so
our route to market

00:35:34.928 --> 00:35:37.300
was different so we
started with e-comm

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.850
and we started with
building relationships

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.780
direct to CrossFit gyms
and things like that.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.696
And so that's something
that's very hard to go

00:35:43.696 --> 00:35:45.670
backwards and do,
because no matter

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:51.450
what, Costco is going to be a
bigger revenue driver than one

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.150
CrossFit gym.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.960
And so it's really
hard for companies

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.302
to go the opposite way.

00:35:55.302 --> 00:35:57.760
Once they've already built
their Kroger business and Costco

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.770
business and Walmart
business, I haven't

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:02.140
seen any companies go backwards
and decide like, hey, we

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.170
need to invest in individual
points of distribution

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.100
that we're going to
ship directly to.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.340
So the big thing is that,
foundationally, we're

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.850
built completely, call
it upside down compared

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.820
to what a normal food
company has built.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.860
And so we still think
about distribution

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.740
in that same way, which is,
first is the person that's

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.580
going to eat it.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.160
So we think about
them before we think

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.250
about the retailer
that ultimately

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.850
gets them the product.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.850
And so when we roll
out new products,

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.620
we will go bottoms up.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.500
So we'll sell it in our
direct to consumer first.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.060
We'll sell to our CrossFit
gyms and other independents.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.740
And we'll bring it
out to retail quicker

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.260
than we did for the
bars, but we still

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.120
think about it in
the sense that it

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.130
has to service the
person eating it.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.640
It doesn't do anybody any
good to do a massive launch

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.610
in all retailers until you
know that the product's going

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.500
to be well received.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.930
It just doesn't make sense.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.030
So we still think
about it that way.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.680
KELLY MARSHALL:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.990
It makes good sense.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.420
So let's bring it home, and
what's coming down the line?

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.800
What does the future look like?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.840
You guys, I think one of
things you're best at is like,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.550
you see the white
space before any of us

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.211
as consumers are probably even
thinking there's a problem.

00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:15.210
And so you've really led
some incredible trends.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.290
So what's on the
whiteboard at the office

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.940
and ideas we should
be thinking about?

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.690
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.200
So when we think about
the future, the way

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.610
we think about it
is that the way

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.026
that we went to
market and the way

00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:29.240
that we built the
business, which is also

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.910
a bit unique compared
to most food companies

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.304
where finance, supply chain,
and sales have an equal seat

00:37:35.304 --> 00:37:36.470
at the table with marketing.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.360
Traditionally in
big food, marketing

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.290
is really general management
in most food companies.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.270
But so we think that
there's opportunity

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.240
to leverage the team
that we've built

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.370
and bring in more
brands that are leading

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.860
edge in their category and where
we think the consumer is going.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:01.430
And so by this time next
year, if we execute well,

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:06.230
the team that's leading
RXBAR should also

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.690
be managing other brands too.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.620
KELLY MARSHALL: OK.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.650
You can't tell us anymore
about that, can you?

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.722
Just thought I'd ask.

00:38:14.722 --> 00:38:16.430
And so as you think
about that, you know,

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.210
the company is going
to continue to grow.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.335
How do you make sure you
keep the center of gravity

00:38:20.335 --> 00:38:21.200
in terms of values?

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.340
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.160
I think it's the hardest
thing to do, honestly.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.750
So scaling a business,
the hardest thing to do

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.420
is to keep the ways of
working and the values

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:38.810
and the principles, keeping
them true and alive.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.050
So we try to do it in a bunch of
different ways, the onboarding

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.100
process.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.430
When you join RXBAR, you spend
two weeks in customer service.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.990
And the rationale there is when
we were back at the old office,

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.370
everybody was in
customer service

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.410
because we all had
phones at our desk,

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.290
and when someone called the 800
number, everybody's phone rang.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.540
And we had a rule
that it was one ring.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.289
It had to be answered
before that second ring.

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:03.830
And you would see
people all the time

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.454
running across the room
to go pick up a phone.

00:39:06.454 --> 00:39:08.620
If we had an all hands
meeting, which was, you know,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.300
six people, somebody
was like next

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.980
to the door to man the phones.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.190
And so we try to keep a
lot of that stuff relevant,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.430
like the badge
example that I gave.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.690
Just in case they have
to cut out that segment,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.596
you guys know what
I'm talking about.

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:26.070
You know, stuff like that.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.060
So we try to keep a lot of those
principles relevant in the way

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.110
that we work, the way people
are brought into the company.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.200
But it's really tricky.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:34.590
It's really hard.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.798
KELLY MARSHALL: Yeah, I know.

00:39:35.798 --> 00:39:36.350
Absolutely.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.490
And it's one of those
things, you just

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.864
have to continue
to refresh them.

00:39:38.864 --> 00:39:41.610
And you have to continue
to practice them as leaders

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.240
and ultimately, it's every
employee's accountability

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.140
to live them.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.685
So in five years, five,
10, what kind of company

00:39:49.685 --> 00:39:51.660
is RXBAR going to be?

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.200
SAM MCBRIDE: So it will be
a global multi-brand company

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.000
that--

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.780
the hope is is that-- actually,
we learned a lot from you all.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.470
So OKRs was a
concept that I know

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.910
you guys are familiar with.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.730
And so when we think about
running the business, that's

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.430
one of the big
differentiators over time

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:14.930
is how you actually work.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.370
It might be the
differentiator over time.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.210
And so I think, to
the market, RXBAR

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.270
will be multi-brand and global.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.890
But internally, I
think what you'll

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.310
see is some best
operating practices that

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.970
are pretty common in tech
that are not as widely adopted

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:32.750
in food.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.250
So if you were on
the inside, you

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.380
would see that we
work in a way that's

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.230
very different from a
traditional big food company.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.230
KELLY MARSHALL: Awesome.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.247
Good.

00:40:41.247 --> 00:40:43.580
Well, I think we'd love to
open the floor up to you all.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.955
Hopefully there's
some questions.

00:40:44.955 --> 00:40:47.820
We will have a mic that is
going to be passed around,

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.095
so you get two seconds
for a breather.

00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:51.470
And so if anyone
has a question--

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.350
Megan, we've got one
here in this row.

00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.870
AUDIENCE: Is there
any kind of story

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.110
around that amazing
Ice-T commercial?

00:41:05.812 --> 00:41:07.520
KELLY MARSHALL: Maybe
explain what it is.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.490
SAM MCBRIDE: Oh, yeah.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.040
OK, so the Ice-T commercial.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.050
So Ice-T, if you
haven't seen him,

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.110
if you're on
Instagram or Facebook,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.270
it looks like you're
just looking at a bar.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:21.360
And then he kind of comes out
of it and says something witty

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.610
and then goes back in the bar.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.640
It's like a little door.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.680
The idea was that we
wanted the product

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.080
to be front and center,
which it is in those ads.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.590
And then we wanted to take the
same approach to advertising

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.600
that we've taken
to the packaging.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.240
So we say no BS on the
packaging and that's

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.910
kind of a filter for the company
in terms of the way we work.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.030
But then also, when we
think about advertising,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.002
we wanted it to be true to
that, and you know, sort

00:41:48.002 --> 00:41:49.460
of shine some light
on some things.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.084
Like I don't know if you've seen
the AdWords that we're running

00:41:52.084 --> 00:41:55.340
with you guys, but it's
like, you searched paleo,

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.961
here's an RXBAR bar ad.

00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.460
And just things
like that where it's

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.339
like very sort of in your face
in the way that we're doing it.

00:42:01.339 --> 00:42:02.630
KELLY MARSHALL: Matter of fact.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.380
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:42:06.372 --> 00:42:08.940
AUDIENCE: So obviously,
Google is a big data company.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.400
Can you talk about how you
guys use data internally

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.030
to move forward,
develop strategies,

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.400
think about product innovation?

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.150
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:23.700
So the data that we
try really hard--

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.250
and this is one of the more
challenging things with scale,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:30.720
that we try really hard to
build muscles internally

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.460
for is actually subjective data.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.790
So one of the biggest
learnings that we ever had

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.840
was when we would
sample with customers,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.120
and they would eat the
product, and depending

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.310
on how they would react,
that would tell us a lot.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.960
And so one of the times that
I remember most vividly,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.150
Peter and I were demoing
at a condo association

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.500
meeting in River North.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.690
And a condo association
meeting is like six people,

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.470
so that tells you like we
would literally demo anywhere.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.554
But we were like trying
different lines on people,

00:43:00.554 --> 00:43:01.053
you know.

00:43:01.053 --> 00:43:03.810
We'd say like, real food protein
bar, whole food protein bar,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:06.820
no added sugar, or
gluten free, whatever.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.820
And you could just
watch people react

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.710
or not react to these lines.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.350
And so now, we get
more of that data

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.560
than ever because we have
field teams out interacting

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.887
with people all the time.

00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:19.470
So that's one of the
things that we're

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:23.100
focused on really figuring out,
how do we scale that behavior?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.412
Because ultimately, our
products need to fill a void

00:43:26.412 --> 00:43:27.870
and we need to
communicate in a way

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:31.830
that, the people who eat
them, that it resonates with.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.279
And so that's one form of data.

00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:35.820
And then we also do
a pretty good job

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.030
of managing our
independent business,

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.360
so like the CrossFit
gyms, using data

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.620
in terms of what do we
expect them to be selling,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.960
are they buying, are they
using the right flavors?

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.227
So it's not like super
complicated data,

00:43:51.227 --> 00:43:53.310
but it's one of the ways
that we manage a business

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.020
with thousands of
distribution points.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.830
So yeah.

00:43:59.675 --> 00:44:00.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.810
I heard that you were
responsible for getting

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:04.620
into Whole Foods.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.525
Could you tell a
little bit about that?

00:44:06.525 --> 00:44:08.760
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.900
I wouldn't say I was--

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.320
I mean, you know,
the product is really

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.490
responsible for most of it.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.830
But so the process
for Whole Foods,

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.880
when we were selling
into Whole Foods,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.660
it was broken into
regions and so

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.640
we would have to call
on every single region.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.470
So there's SoCal,
there's NorCal,

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.960
there's PacNorthwest,
Rocky Mountain, Texas,

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.670
on and on and on,
and so you'd have

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.920
to sell into each one of
those Whole Foods regions.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.340
And so our journey within Whole
Foods went region to region

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.710
and it started in the Northeast.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.050
A guy named John
Lawson saw the product

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.280
and understood it
immediately, and was like,

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.304
hey, we've got to have
you in our region.

00:44:44.304 --> 00:44:45.720
And then there
were some regions--

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.060
there was one region
that wouldn't take us

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.100
because it said no BS.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.860
And she said, I have too
many evangelical Christians

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.030
in my territory.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.410
I can't take you.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.320
And we were like, I
think they'll be fine,

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.540
but you know your customer
better than we do.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.360
So Whole Foods was really like a
region by region kind of thing.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.450
And now, they do a lot
more national buying,

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.460
but back then, it was
a regional sell in.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.942
And so you'd have to go
in and pitch to the buyer,

00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:12.900
and then six months later,
they would reset it.

00:45:23.358 --> 00:45:25.400
AUDIENCE: So we know
which products you have,

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.525
and I'm sure you can't
really speak to the products

00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:30.170
that are coming soon, but what
are some examples of products

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.169
that you guys have
brainstormed in the past that

00:45:32.169 --> 00:45:34.405
didn't make it, and why
did they not make it?

00:45:34.405 --> 00:45:36.951
KELLY MARSHALL: Or flavors.

00:45:36.951 --> 00:45:39.150
SAM MCBRIDE: So from
a flavor standpoint,

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:44.360
we've tried almost
everything under the sun.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.880
Products that we-- I mean,
so once the bar took off--

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.640
so the packaging changed,
and once we went into retail,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.270
the business like
shot up really fast.

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.060
And so honestly, during that
period, we brainstormed things,

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.970
but we really were
like, we have to execute

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.580
this, which was no
small feat because we

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.250
have to make a physical thing.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.540
Like, you know, we have
to make lots of bars

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.440
and they need to be consistent.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.170
So during that phase, we
were honestly just like,

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.042
let's just make sure we
execute the adult bar.

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:20.750
And then the kid's
bar was an opportunity

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.260
that came after that, but there
wasn't a lot in that time frame

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.350
that we said no to, because
we were just totally focused

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.950
on executing the core business.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.970
There is always stuff
that we're playing with.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.950
I wouldn't say anything's
ever like shut down,

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:38.090
because it's all-- maybe there's
like an ingredient barrier.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:41.570
So for us, because
our promise is

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.880
on the front of the label
in terms of the ingredients

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.660
that we use, we have a
relatively constrained

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.680
innovation map because we
can't add just anything

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.270
to the product, right?

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:57.830
So to some extent,
we have to innovate

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:01.460
within a relatively narrow
set of ingredient options.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.550
So everything that's
in the market right now

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.100
is what we've gotten close
to, like we made it work

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.540
once we know it's going to go.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.854
But anything else, we're sort
of like playing with still.

00:47:11.854 --> 00:47:13.103
Sorry if that was super vague.

00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:20.170
AUDIENCE: I'm so curious.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.090
In the beginning, you said
you were at a home security

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.640
company, but you felt that
there were so many learnings you

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.170
could take to a food company.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.430
What were those?

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.710
SAM MCBRIDE: So LiveWatch
Home Security was the name

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:32.470
of the company, and it's now
been rebranded as Brink's.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.960
So the company that owns
Brink's, the armored trucks

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.840
and the security is
who bought LiveWatch.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.850
So the way that we
built LiveWatch was, at

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.120
the time, very, very cutting
edge for that industry.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.050
So the way the home
security industry works

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.137
is the business is
constrained by the installer.

00:47:50.137 --> 00:47:51.970
So if you think about
a traditional business

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.680
where an installer has
to go out to the home

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.360
and put up the sensors
and everything,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.800
that business is constrained
by the number of homes

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.740
that that installer
can go to in a day.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.270
So like the growth
of the business

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:03.640
is literally like number
of installers times homes

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.380
they can get to, and
that's all they can do.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.070
And so we took the approach
of taking the installer out

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.460
of the business.

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.120
And so what we did
was we built a--

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.370
in those days, it was
called a DIY system,

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.884
but we wouldn't call it that
because DIY scares people away.

00:48:17.884 --> 00:48:19.300
It was just a home
security system

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.250
that you would install yourself.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.264
And so immediately, we were
a national direct to consumer

00:48:24.264 --> 00:48:25.930
home security business
instead of having

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:29.780
to buy trucks and hire
installers and all that stuff.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.840
And the way that
we went to market

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:38.530
was we used digital, so 95% of
our spend was through Google.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:42.970
And then we managed our
pipeline with email,

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.665
and we did it in
a way that was--

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.930
So we had an inside
sales team that

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.750
would call and help people
customize their system,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.620
close the sale, and then we had
a team that would ship it out.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.200
So what we tried to do was
to scale that inside sales

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.900
team through email, because
we thought, you know,

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.050
if you're a great home
security sales rep on our team,

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.370
what are you doing well?

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.280
And ultimately, it came
down to you're following up

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.590
with relevant information
at the right time,

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.250
and usually through email
because most people don't want

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.245
a call from a sales person
at 9:00 AM on a Thursday

00:49:18.245 --> 00:49:19.820
because they're working.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:26.314
And so we used email, and it
was plain text, personalized,

00:49:26.314 --> 00:49:28.730
and what it was meant to do
was to scale that inside sales

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:29.510
team.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:31.926
And so we had done two things
that were pretty innovative.

00:49:31.926 --> 00:49:33.650
One, we took the
installer out so we

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:35.630
could scale fast right away.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:39.350
And then the second thing was we
lowered our cost of acquisition

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.300
because our conversion
rate, the number

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.010
of leads that a
salesperson could

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.860
work themselves
was 10X what you'd

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.010
be able to without this great
email engine that we'd built.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:54.260
And so I thought, if you guys
are selling in the CrossFit

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.200
space, there's actually
a good opportunity

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.980
to use digital
marketing and email

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.290
and put an inside
sales team in it,

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.860
and we could scale the business
through that channel instead

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.720
of going right into retail.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.550
And scaling in
those channels meant

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.730
that we were more
profitable than we would

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.870
have been going
through distribution,

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:16.320
our cash flow was much better.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.200
Because if you go
through a distributor,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.722
you're usually net 30,
net 45, net 60 terms,

00:50:20.722 --> 00:50:22.430
whereas someone paying
with a credit card

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.290
is paying you net
negative 1 basically.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:28.950
And so we talked about
it, and we thought,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:30.800
boy, some of those
same principles

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.984
could be applied here
to this food company.

00:50:32.984 --> 00:50:34.400
And what was
exciting about it was

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.483
the same thing at LiveWatch,
which was no one else

00:50:36.483 --> 00:50:37.490
was doing it.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.960
And so we could--

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.030
everybody, oh, why
another bar, right?

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:42.710
It's such a crowded category.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.619
Well actually, we
weren't in the category.

00:50:44.619 --> 00:50:46.160
We were just selling
to CrossFit gyms

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.170
and there were no
bars at CrossFit gyms.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.330
Or we were selling
straight to your home

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.810
and we were reaching
you through a paid ad

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.750
or on Instagram
through influencers.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.450
And we couldn't use influencers
in the home security business

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:03.180
because no one wants to post
about their home security

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.620
system, but we could use
influencers really effectively

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.700
for food.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.020
And we were on the total cutting
edge of influencer marketing.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.290
No one was doing it
when we were doing it.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.770
So those were kind
of the core things

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.740
that we could translate
from home security to food.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.150
I'll tell you guys
a funny story.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.800
My wife is in the audience.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.940
And so our influencer
strategy was literally

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:34.160
like me laying in bed direct
messaging people on Instagram.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.320
And so in our space,
there's a lot of like,

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.660
it's health and foodies, right?

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.150
And so there's a lot of
like really good looking

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.320
fit women in this space.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.860
So I'm like laying in
bed next to my wife DMing

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.630
all these like really good
looking fitness women,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.157
and she's like,
what are you doing?

00:51:52.157 --> 00:51:53.240
KELLY MARSHALL: All right.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.790
We probably have time for one or
two really quick ones, I think.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:57.290
One.

00:52:01.709 --> 00:52:03.900
AUDIENCE: This is kind
of a specific question,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.660
but could you talk about
dates for a second?

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.660
I remember that's kind
of like my first question

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.400
that I had when I
first tried an RXBAR

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.910
and never really
grew up with dates.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.925
And specifically, I wonder
what the supply chain

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.300
looked like for
dates, especially

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.920
as you grew in scale,
like whether you

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.365
had an impact on the date
industry or date farmers?

00:52:23.365 --> 00:52:24.115
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:52:24.115 --> 00:52:26.073
KELLY MARSHALL: It's had
an impact on them too.

00:52:26.073 --> 00:52:26.910
SAM MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.701
We're talking about
date, the fruit, right?

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:35.310
So in the US,
basically 100% of dates

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.790
are grown in the Coachella
valley in Southern California.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:42.330
And actually one of the
things, while we were scaling,

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:50.520
this is in 2017 I think, we
used to just call date farmers

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.800
and say, hey, we need
a truckload of dates

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.300
or whatever it was.

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.220
And then we picked
up the phone and we

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.340
tried to place our
order, and they

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.810
were like, that's too many.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.180
We don't have-- and we
were like, oh, my god.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.300
We've outgrown the
US date supply.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.730
And that was a huge
eye opener for us.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.170
Like we'd never thought--

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.290
we'd honestly just never
even really thought about it.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:18.670
And so one of the things that
we knew but hit home for us,

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.150
is that dates are an
agricultural product that

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.350
is harvested.

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:28.390
So it's not like eggs where
hens lay eggs all the time.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:32.350
Dates get harvested once a
year, and you either have enough

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.610
dates for the year or you don't.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.900
And so when that
happened, we realized

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.790
there's no more
supply in the US,

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:43.030
so we just had to
broaden the way that we

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.510
look at that raw material.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:48.640
And so we expanded our
sourcing beyond the US,

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.910
and we've had to be really
thoughtful about where they

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:53.410
come from and who we work with.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.420
But the date industry
in particular

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:01.511
was one where we like first
felt a pinch on raw materials.

00:54:01.511 --> 00:54:02.510
KELLY MARSHALL: Awesome.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.010
Well, I think that's
our time today.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.982
So thank you so much,
everyone, for being here.

00:54:05.982 --> 00:54:06.940
SAM MCBRIDE: Thank you.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.690
[APPLAUSE]
