SCOTT MCMULLAN: Welcome,
everyone.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.990
My name is Scott McMullan.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.420
I'm the Google Apps Partner Lead
with Google Enterprise.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.380
Welcome to our session.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.840
Thanks for hanging out
with us today.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.920
There's a lot of amazing
sessions happening right now,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.490
so appreciate you attending.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.270
I share the stage today with
three awesome co-presenters,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.250
Cameron Henneke, founder of
GQueues, Jim McNellis, CEO and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.660
founder of Dito, and Matt
Trifirio, SVP of

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.780
Marketing at Assistly.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.910
So today's session is going
to be a bit high level.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.439
We're not going to
do a lot of code.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.170
We'll talk a little tech, but
it's mainly around the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.240
Marketplace, and the business
opportunities, and some of the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.400
product opportunities that
exists, as facilitated by the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.580
Marketplace.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.350
So quick housekeeping.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.420
Our feedback link is here.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.840
We'd love your feedback
live as we go.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.940
And hashtags for this are
io2011 and googleapps.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.950
So before we start--

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.490
This is not made for
someone my height.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.700
Before we start talking about
the Marketplace, we need to do

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
a little level set on
what Google Apps is.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.480
How many folks use Google Apps
in their business or--

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.260
OK, we've got a few hands
that didn't go up.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.890
So we'll work on that.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.900
So Google Apps is hosted
messaging and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.330
collaboration product.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.660
It consists of things like
Gmail, Google Calendar, Google

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.440
Contacts, Google Docs, Google
Video, Google Sites, a whole

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000
suite of applications hosted
by Google serving

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.780
customers of all sizes.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.370
So small, medium, and large
businesses, as well as

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.860
educational institutions
and governments.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.170
So we've got two price points
for this product.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.210
We have a free edition, which
we give to educational

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230
institutions and nonprofits
and small companies.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.990
And a paid addition.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.960
And that's $50 a user a year.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.750
In fact, I think we just
announced an also monthly

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.680
pricing as well, but that's
a paid addition product.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
And what we're really happy to
talk about in general is the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.990
context of adoption.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.400
So we've seen really,
really strong

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.800
adoption of Google Apps.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.690
It's getting stronger every
month, every quarter.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.180
And these are potential
your customers.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.250
We've got over 30 million
users, and 3 million

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.290
businesses, and 3,000 more
signing up each day.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.370
And these folks are getting
core, mission critical

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.240
messaging collaboration
applications on

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.910
the clock from Google.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.550
And they want a lot more.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.180
So this is the opportunity.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.280
They come asking for us, hey, do
you have this application?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.290
Can you do that application?

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.350
How do I do this?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.270
And we say, look, we do
what we've got here.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.330
We've got these great
applications, but we cannot

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.550
serve everything.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.530
And that's what you
guys are doing.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.250
You guys are out there
innovating in all kinds of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.760
areas, and so the mission of the
Marketplace is to make it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.260
really easy for those 30 million
users, 3 million

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.210
businesses to find more great
web based applications to run

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.090
their businesses and
organizations.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.000
And this is across, again,
anything you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.780
guys want to sell.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.450
Anything you guys want to do
based on your expertise and

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.920
the markets you're addressing.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.810
You team with us to extend that
Google Apps suite with

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.580
your application.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.760
And so we want to make that
easy as a few clicks.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.960
And we'll talk about--

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.515
I'll give you a demo of
that in a second.

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:18.080
So that's the basic mission.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.350
That's the basic opportunity is
to work together to serve

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.320
those customers.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.010
Before we go into some of the
details, I want to step back

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.940
and talk a little bit about
the context of the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.090
Marketplace, and how it fits
in with larger Google

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.300
Enterprise.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.000
So 100% web.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.090
That's really a vision and a
strategy we've got that says

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.140
simply, in 2011, a business
should be able to run their

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.480
entire business using nothing
more than a web browser.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.970
So with that as a mental
model-- we

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.390
call that 100% web--

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.870
a bunch of things need to come
together to make that happen.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.590
So you need, first of all at
the top, great devices.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.020
You need great physical
devices.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.315
You need great browsers, which
is why we're investing in

00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:03.100
Chrome OS and Chrome.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.910
And you certainly great mobile
experiences around, and we're

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.930
investing in Android for tablets
and smartphones.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.760
But once you've got access to
a modern browser, you need

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.630
obviously apps.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.870
So the three tiers in
the middle here.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.120
So in the left, we've
Google Apps.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.290
These are the applications that
we are selling directly

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.920
to customers.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.430
You've got applications that
customers want to build for

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.940
themselves.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.740
So IT developers, custom
programmers, SIs, VARs, people

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.450
who want to build custom
applications.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.340
We offer Google App Engine
as the platform as

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.380
a service for that.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.890
And there's lots of other
great options

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.730
out there for that.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.840
But we offer App Engine.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.290
And then the third pillar
here is the Marketplace.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.200
So packaged applications ready
to roll from you all.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.620
And of course, we've got
our investment in the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.670
infrastructure, global
infrastructure for the cloud.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.560
I do want to make one point
here, even though the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.840
Marketplace is sitting on our
platform, App Engine and our

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.030
hosting services are not
a requirement to use

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.100
Marketplace.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.130
You can host your application
anywhere you want.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.340
So how are we doing?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.870
So the good news is adoption
is growing.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.160
It's growing strongly.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.350
We've got over 300 apps
in the Marketplace.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.990
Today again, these are
web applications.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.460
They may have mobile companions,
but these are

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.830
primarily web applications
serving businesses and

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.310
educational institutions.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.180
And to give you a sense
of what to expect, in

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.950
terms of how much--

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.640
What download rate, what
sort of install

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.980
rate, as we call it.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.600
The top applications today are
seeing north of 1,000 new

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.780
businesses a week.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.680
So these are businesses.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.520
These aren't users.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.730
So one business may have 5
users, may have 50 users, may

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.650
have 500 users, but this is an
indication where we are in our

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.050
adoption of the Marketplace, and
our customers' discovery

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.500
of how these applications
work.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.230
So let me give you a quick demo
just to see the customer

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.680
experience.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.610
What it's like for a user to
browse the Marketplace and to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.870
install an application
to their domain.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.000
So here's the homepage.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.540
We've got categories on the
left, different types of

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.260
applications.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.010
We also have our partners, our
VARs, our professional

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.360
services partners offering
professional services in here.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.240
Featured and notable.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.610
So we do promotions of certain
applications in the center.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.710
Users can scroll through that.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.890
And then some of our
top applications

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.070
listed on the right.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.160
So let's just say today
that I'm a Google Apps

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.810
administrator.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.680
I'm looking for project
management application.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.710
I hit search.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.280
I've got a bunch of choices.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.210
I'm going to take a quick
look at the first one.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.440
Manymoon, this is one of our
launch partners from a little

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.590
over a year ago.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.070
As a user, I can certainly read
about the application.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.350
I can watch videos.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.930
You're free to put a lot of
your collateral and your

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.020
marketing materials in here.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.430
I can look at some ratings
reviews, 266.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.580
And let's just say I'm
interested in making this

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.440
happen and bringing
this to my users.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.700
So again, I'm an administrator
of a Google Apps domain.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.800
This button right here is where
all the action happens.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.230
So the Add It Now button is
the main call to action.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.910
You want users to click on this,
and it's going to ask

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.510
them to log in.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.330
So I need to authenticate
against my domain.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:28.060
So as an admin, scott@ehit.com
is my personal domain.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.330
So it's a three-step process.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.340
First, there's terms
of service.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.300
So I can review of Manymoon's
terms of service.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.290
These would be your
terms of service.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.210
I can review it here,
agree to continue.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.450
The next step is pretty much
the most important.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.090
So the main premise of these
applications is that they're

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.680
not only just listed in a
directory, but they actually

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.410
integrate in together.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.980
They build common integrated
features, sharing data,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.960
sharing UI.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.470
So Manymoon happens to be a
highly integrated application.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.610
They integrate with Google Docs,
Google Spreadsheets,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.260
Google Calendar, Contacts,
and e-mail.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.570
And so these are all of the
API endpoints that they're

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.050
asking access to.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.720
And so by clicking Grant
Data Access here, as an

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.550
administrator, I gave a 2-legged
OAuth data access

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.300
grant to Manymoon to access my
domain data listed here.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.610
So that one click goes to--

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.590
The Manymoon application and my
domain are now authorized

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.480
to speak to each other.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.260
And the final step here to
enable the application.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.789
This gives it all my users in
the universal navigation

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.070
language, which I'll show
you in a second.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.190
So that's it.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.659
So we've just taken a suite of
maybe 8 Google Apps, 7 Google

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.179
Apps, and we've expanded it by
one to include Manymoon.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.130
So they have their own
settings page.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.480
And I'm going to show you two
quick things again, just to

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.400
give you sense of what
the users experience.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.870
On my dashboard page, again,
I can review all the Google

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.600
applications here, as well
as a couple Marketplace

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.020
applications that I've
gotten installed.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.900
So they're all holistically
given to the admin

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.030
to see in one place.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.040
And as it--

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.880
Actually let me point out here
that we also do some

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.470
promotions.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.220
So one of the benefits to
Marketplace is we get a lot of

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.550
information about what the
applications are, and how they

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.535
work, and the types of customers
that use them, and

00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:17.510
like them, and the different
adoption rates.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.240
So we're starting to take these
applications out of the

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.460
Marketplace browsing experience,
and bring them

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.260
into other experiences
where users lives.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.460
So in this case, it's
the dashboard.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.080
I'm an admin.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.170
I have four applications
recommended for me that I can

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.710
either click on and add them
immediately, or I can go and

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.970
visit their page in
the Marketplace.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.780
So where it's not just about
going and sending people to

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.350
Marketplace, we want to make
sure that recommendations and

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.110
personalization work really
well for users.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.200
So let me flip over to one
last bit to my Inbox.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.920
So as a user, I can take a look
here in the upper left,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.330
and I certainly can browse to my
calendar, Google Docs, what

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.625
have you, but now I've got in
the More menu, I've got links

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.180
to apps from the Marketplace.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.080
Here's Manymoon.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.080
I click on that, and
I'm logged in.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.780
The other thing I actually
haven't mentioned yet is that

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.790
the single sign on is a core
experience for all Marketplace

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.430
applications.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.120
So that need to--

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.640
No need to provision,
create extra

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.220
counts, add user passwords.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.200
Every Marketplace app comes
with a single sign on

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.570
experience at a minimum.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.250
And this is done through OpenID,
which is something

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.360
that you all would need
to develop to.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.050
So that's a quick tour of
installing an application.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.320
Let me flip back to
the presentation.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.750
So how does this work?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.690
So the first thing, of course,
build your application.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.420
Again, this can be an existing
application that you are

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.540
selling in market for the last
month, year, 10 years, brand

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.870
new applications, whatever.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.050
But you build it on the stack of
your choice, no dependency

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.660
on App Engine.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.350
Of course, we love App Engine,
but no dependency there.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.130
The second, and the most
interesting part-- and I think

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.620
some of our co-presenters will
talk about this-- is the

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.370
integration.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.470
Again, this is not a directory
of applications on the web.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.740
These are directory of
applications that have the

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.610
ability to do online
provisioning, and most

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.010
importantly, offer an
integrative experiences.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.820
And we have a couple more talks
to really drill into how

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.780
to create those integrative
experiences in the APIs later

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.640
on today and tomorrow.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.750
So I encourage you
to attend those.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.560
But this is the step where you
would start to work on making

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.940
those customers love our
applications together.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.270
And so again, the first one,
single sign on is a

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:27.840
requirement.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.310
All applications must become
OpenID reliant parties.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.620
And then we have well over a
dozen APIs for all of our

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.230
applications beyond that, where
you guys can optionally

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.990
choose to create integrated
features.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.260
And then sell.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.020
The whole point is we're
trying to take existing

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.520
applications and sell them to
3 million businesses, 30

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.090
million users, and

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.920
increasingly engage our resellers.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.770
We have over 2,000 valuated
retailers who are trained on

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.400
Google Apps.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.370
They're selling Google Apps.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.650
They're deploying
their training.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.210
And they are increasingly
looking to add additional

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.840
applications to their
portfolios.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.650
And they're looking to
Marketplace for a great source

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.000
of complementary application.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.450
So this is an opportunity we'll
be talking about more

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.430
later on this year.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.780
But it's already happening
today.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.520
And I think Jim will actually
talk a little bit about this

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.760
in his session.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.860
So what do we ask?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.200
We ask for two things.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.240
$100 fee.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.100
So anti-spam fee.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.190
Think of that as making sure
you are really you.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.630
And you can make one or more
listings to the Marketplace

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.870
after paying us $100.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.300
And then 20% recurring
revenue share.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.750
This is where we ask to share
20% revenue you would get for

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.480
any new customers that you
acquire through the

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.940
Marketplace.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.160
Your existing customers could
come in use these

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.540
integrations, no problem.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.220
New customers that we help
you get, when they

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.030
pay, we'll share 20%.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.000
And we're going to implement
this through a billing API,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.670
which is actually not
yet released.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.180
We're still working on it.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.470
So we're in exemption
mode right now.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.570
No one's paying rev share to
date, all 300 applications.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.960
But that's coming out
later on this year.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.630
So in terms of how this
works for developers.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.880
Again, build, integrate,
list and sell.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.810
Let's talk a little bit more
about the integration step.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.140
We use a manifest file to
essentially describe the set

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.070
of integrations that you've done
with our application in

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.750
our application.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.020
So things like terms of service,
where does that live?

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.390
Support URL, simple stuff.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.270
But then the API endpoints that
you want to access, you

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.730
list them here as API scopes,
in addition to your OpenID

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.250
information.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.380
So this all gets declared
in a simple XML file.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.650
And then when you're ready to
actually start to test it, and

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.240
start to get it out to users,
two more forms to fill.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.820
First is you're going
to become a vendor.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.870
And that's where that
$100 fee comes in.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.530
Name, address, company
name, logo.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.090
But then you create a listing,
and this is your application.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.240
This is your marketing page,
your homepage on the

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.180
Marketplace.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.930
All your collateral goes in
here, but then that manifest

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.990
file in the lower left, that's
where you paste that in.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.100
So once you do that,
you hit save, and

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.010
you've got your page.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.890
You can make sure you like it,
make sure it looks good.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.630
Of course, add it now and
start to test the

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.450
provisioning process.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.710
When you first save
it, is not live.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.030
You get to tweak it into
your heart's desire.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.830
When you're ready to
actually engage

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.060
customers, you publish it.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.340
And that tells our application
approval team to

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.260
take a look at it.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.490
We'll look, and we have a
lightweight vetting process to

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.950
make sure that you have OpenID
implemented, that there's no

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.400
bugs, and our basic terms of
service are adhered to.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.150
And then we'll approve it.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.260
3 to 5 business days right
now is the current time.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.410
And then you're live.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.770
Then you're launched.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.680
And that's where things
obviously get interesting.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.760
We want to get to that point
as soon as possible.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.280
So let me just run through a
couple more things around the

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.750
acquisition process, and what
it looks like to engage

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.040
customers, and some of the
promotions that we do for the

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.620
Marketplace.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.350
So the first basic tip is don't

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.130
skip your launch marketing.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.070
You may be an application,
again, that exists, and you've

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.860
been selling for years.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.910
But these are new users.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.250
These are 3 million new
businesses that may not have

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.560
heard of your application, and
maybe you have new features.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.900
So make sure that you give them
a proper launch to get

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.130
yourself visibility within that
group beyond just being

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.390
in the Marketplace.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.680
So high quality listing page,
landing pages on your sites,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.955
blogging, tweeting, press
outreach, based on your intent

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:35.550
and budget.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.950
But this is something that
we really highly

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.010
recommend you not skip.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.950
And then after you're live,
what do you expect?

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.030
So pretty high level, but this
is really nothing different

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.990
than what you do today
on your own website.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.310
So it's a funnel.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.390
Listing pageviews.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.970
You can plug your analytics
code into your Marketplace

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.420
listing to get some intelligence
about referrers,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.040
and pageviews, and
things like that.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.170
Tracking the Add It Now call
to action, and then driving

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.560
app usage and covering to paid
is really where a lot of the

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.040
work goes from an execution
standpoint.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.740
And again, I think some of my
co-presenters have some

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.300
interesting tidbits
to share here.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.580
So that's a super quick
tour of Marketplace--

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.060
what it is up to what customers
are using it and

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.420
engaging with you.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.870
In terms of our promotion, the
big value add here is that

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.910
we're going to not only provide
this platform for

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.720
integration, but we're going to
make sure people know about

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.300
the Marketplace and
drive usage.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.120
So we do that in a
handful of ways.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.580
And we're always looking for
creative ideas, and looking to

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.120
get better at this.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.270
So first one, the first major
way we do promotion, is in our

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.800
products themselves.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.430
So as you saw, whether it's in
the upper left, or we have a

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.290
Find More Services link, if
you're in the universal

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.960
navigation, that will get
to the Marketplace.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.360
Our Setup Wizard,
which launched a

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.820
couple of months ago.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.220
All new customers come through
this and essentially walk

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.730
through a wizard to set
up Google Apps.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.780
And there's a very explicit area
where we talk about the

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.140
Marketplace, what it is, and
recommend some applications to

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.660
that user, right in
that set up flow.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.290
And of course, I just showed
you in the dashboard.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.290
So admins who go to the
dashboard will see recommended

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.460
apps right now.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.079
Of course, the format may
change, and we're going to

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:19.790
always to tune this.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.740
But the main take away here is
that we're selling into a

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.839
group of users, who are using
Google Apps and clearly want

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.960
and have requested more.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.170
And so we're trying to get
better and better at taking

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.670
things in the Marketplace that
are great, and helping people

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.620
discover them while they're
using our products, as well as

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.330
just shopping the Marketplace.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.790
So that includes our
products site.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.270
We drive a lot of users here,
of course to educate them

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.120
about our products and part
of our core product is--

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.750
One of our pillars is the
Marketplace you see will help

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.960
educate customers about what's
there in the lower left.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.060
We do Adwords campaigns.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.760
We love Adwords.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.560
People are searching.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.310
We take out campaigns around
keywords that relate to Google

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.510
Apps, drive traffic to
categories, drive traffic to

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.150
search terms that may
essentially surface your

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.180
application in that
search term.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.060
And we do all that good stuff,
blogging and tweeting.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.870
We have a YouTube channel, where
you can host a video of

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.640
your application working
with ours.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.780
And of course, the press.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.950
So back to the 100% web.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.950
We're really--

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.045
The mission is to get customers
excited, to get

00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:29.350
customers to adopt, and really
help benefit their business.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.090
And so to the extent that you
have interesting customer

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.860
stories, we should be sharing
these stories and helping not

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.440
only bloggin and tweeting about
them, but also engaging

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.920
the press and making sure the
press understands what it

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.022
looks like as these businesses
are moving more and more of

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:46.920
their business to the cloud.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.900
So that's it for me.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.680
Get to the real meat, the real
content of the presentation,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.502
I'd like to invite up Cameron.

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:56.840
CAMERON HENNEKE:
Thanks, Scott.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.230
Hello, my name is
Cameron Henneke.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:10.140
I'm the founder and
CEO of GQueues.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.390
First, today I'll tell you a
little bit about GQueues, and

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.090
why we joined the Marketplace.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.060
Then we'll go to a quick demo,
and I'll follow it up with

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.580
some Marketplace tips.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.720
So back in 2008, I decided it
was time to move my paper

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.030
to-do list to the cloud.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.750
I tried several products, and
found them either overly

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.010
complex, or simple yet lacking
the features I

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.630
needed to stay organized.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.120
So I did what most developers
do in this situation, I set

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.370
out to create something new.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.080
GQueues is an online task
manager that people use to

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.250
actually get things done.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.450
So it's simple, yet powerful,
has just the right

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.040
features you need.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.140
Basically no learning curve.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.310
And it integrates with other
products you use day to day.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.710
As you'll see, GQueues is
very Google-centric.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.600
It's built on App Engine, using
Python and uses almost

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.330
all of the service provided
by that platform.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.720
Users can log in with Gmail
or Google Apps.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.110
And it uses a number of other
Google data APIs as well.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.820
So why did we join
the Marketplace?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.090
GQueues was started about a year
before the Marketplace

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.370
launched, and already
offered Google

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.000
Apps login using OpenID.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.280
So when I first heard about the
Marketplace from Scott,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.490
the decision to join was really

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.780
easy for several reasons.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.300
First, integration
is really simple.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.350
It took very little investment
on my part, in terms of

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.310
development time and testing,
to get GQueues listed on the

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.970
Marketplace.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.400
If your app already supports
OpenID, basically integration

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.830
is just one step--

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:56.250
writing the manifest XML file,
as Scott showed you earlier.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.430
Secondly though,
the Marketplace

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.780
serves a great audience.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.830
GQueues already targeted
consumers using Google

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.910
products, and with the
Marketplace, I was able to

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.940
reach 30 million business
customers

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.080
using Google products.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.510
And these customers already
realized the benefits of

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.680
software as a service.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.800
And they're willing to pay for
products that integrate with

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.720
Google Apps.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.650
So by listing on the
Marketplace, GQueues gained

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.870
access to a huge audience that
is essentially predisposed to

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.120
buying the service.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.030
So let's check out a demo now,
and we'll see how it works.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.250
So you came to Google IO, and
you had a lot of fun.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.740
And you learned a bunch
of cool new things.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.290
Let's pretend that you're
responsible for planning the

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.250
lessons learned meeting for your
group when they get back

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.750
from the conference.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.070
So you have your e-mail
opened here.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.990
And you can just click on
GQueues and start planning

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.170
your tasks.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.395
There's basically two tasks
you need to do.

00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:21.850
The first is to book
a meeting room.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:27.770
And the second, of course,
is to order lunch food.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.200
And we'll go ahead and assign
this to our coworker Julie.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.390
And we can create a couple
subtasks too,

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.550
just so we don't forget.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.310
Now, the tasks here with
dates automatically

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.020
show up on your calendar.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.370
So pull that up here.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.060
The Google Calendar API is
used for integration.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.400
And GQueues actually supports
two way syncing, so you can

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.960
change the task from the
calendar itself.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.960
Actually we should probably
order lunch food on Thursday.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:11.220
And if we go back here and
refresh, we see that the task

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.110
has been updated with
the new date here.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.240
So you just saw how easy it is
to create a list of tasks

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.300
within GQueues itself.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.750
But a lot of times our work
comes to us through e-mail.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.930
So let's switch back
here to e-mail.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.650
And here's a new message
which requires action.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.890
You need to invite the
new hires to the

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.730
lessons learned meeting.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.050
So you can actually go down here
to the GQueues gadget,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.670
and we'll transform this
e-mail into a task.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.450
And choose our lessons learned
list. And we'll just say,

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.540
invite new hires.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.360
And there we go.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.250
And then we can archive
this e-mail to get

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.140
it out of our Inbox.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.780
Or let's say a task just
pops into your head.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.265
You can actually record it
by chatting with GQueues.

00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:07.310
If we pull up chat
here, you need to

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.155
submit conference receipts.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.790
The item's been added.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.940
We'll switch back to GQueues.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.310
First we'll refresh
lessons learned.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.230
There's the new task that we
created out of the e-mail.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.260
And there's a link to the
email for reference.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.900
And then if we go to our Inbox,
here's the task that we

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.450
chatted, and we can just drag
that to our to-do list. And

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.940
there we go.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.440
So that's just a quick overview
of GQueues, and some

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.712
of its Google product
integrations.

00:24:45.712 --> 00:24:48.460
Flip back here.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.750
Let's talk about tips
for the Marketplace.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.500
You saw from Scott earlier how
easy it is to get your apps

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.390
listed on the Marketplace with
the required single sign on

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.410
integration.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.680
My number one tip for being
successful on the Marketplace

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.040
is to add as many integration
points as possible with other

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.820
Google products.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.100
And this has benefits
on many levels.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.610
First, it's great
for the user.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.980
If your service works seamlessly
with other products

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.610
that they already use, then
there's no learning

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.650
required for them.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.600
For instance, Google Calendar
users already know how to drag

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.450
and drop events around.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.270
So dragging GQueues tasks around
just seems intuitive.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.300
No learning required.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.680
Integration also increases
user adoption within the

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.810
organization.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.440
So having your app listed in the
navigation menu, it really

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.950
does make it easy for anyone
within a company to discover

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.290
your app, and to test it out.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.220
So this all seems intuitive, but
how do I know that users

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.180
want integration?

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.520
Back when GQueues was in beta,
I actually surveyed users to

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.890
find out which features were
most important to them.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.460
By far the number one feature
was Google Calendar

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.170
integration, followed
by sharing

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.980
lists with their contacts.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.850
So I put these features in the
full version of GQueues.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.540
Users can do almost everything
else for free in GQueues Lite,

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.600
whether it's create subtasks or
tagging, repeating tasks,

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.190
published lists.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.130
But if they want the
integration, they have to pay,

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.340
and they do.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.450
If you look here at the
difference between GQueues

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.930
Lite and the full version,
almost all the premium

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.320
features here relate
to integration.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.510
Google Calendar, Contacts,
Gmail.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.160
People value products
that work with

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.410
their existing tools.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.390
So secondly, more integration
helps your apps listing in the

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.180
Marketplace itself.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.010
Each listing here has a set of
icons that represent the

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.120
product integration.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.980
So customers can easily see
how closely your app works

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.030
with others.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.060
A deeply integrated app
means their users are

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.050
going to save time.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.640
Plus customers can search the
Marketplace based on product

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.220
integrations.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.450
So the more you have, the
broader your presence in the

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.700
Marketplace.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.970
Lastly and most obvious,
integrating with existing

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.730
products speeds up
development.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.530
So sure, I could have
created a separate

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.900
calendar system for GQueues.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.720
This would have taken a lot of
development time, not to

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.740
mention the fact that users
don't want yet another

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.440
calendar that they
have to check.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.320
So since Google Calendar exists,
it's been field tested

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.200
by millions of users worldwide,
it really just make

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.250
sense to build on top
of this work.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.930
Plus, since GQueues was built
on App Engine, adding

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.070
integration is even easier.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.730
For instance, App Engine has
XMPP services built in, so the

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.670
GQueues chat bot that I demoed,
it really only took me

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:57.030
about two days to develop
and test.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.220
So how has the Marketplace
helped?

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.990
GQueues is based on
a premium model.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.060
So an important metric to look
at is conversion rate.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.740
And the average conversion rate
for a typical premium

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.810
product is between 3% and 5%.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:15.260
So I pulled data for GQueues
from the past 10 months, and

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.010
for all the regular channels,
the average

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.670
conversion rate was 6.4%.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.570
That's from free users
to paid subscribers.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.450
So a little bit higher
than expected.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.720
But the GQueues users from the
Marketplace convert at a rate

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.520
of 30.3%, which is huge.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.550
I said earlier that the
Marketplace really targets an

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.260
audience that is ready to buy.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.970
And I think the data
backs this up.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.180
So conversion rate is great,
but how much traffic do I

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.430
actually get from
the Marketplace?

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.560
So in addition to the
Marketplace, GQueues gets new

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.620
users from its own website, the
Google Chrome Web Store,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.580
and a bunch of word of
mouth referrals.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.800
Looking at the data from the
same 10 month period, it turns

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.990
out that 27% of all GQueues
users are acquired via the

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.530
Marketplace.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.000
So this is not a majority,
but it's still a

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.570
very substantial channel.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.540
And when you combine that data
with the conversion rate of

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.770
the last line, and you do all
the math, you'll see that the

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.770
Marketplace is actually
responsible for 63% of all

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.430
paid GQueues users.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.250
So this is a very impressive
number.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.990
And I must say that I'm quite
pleased with the results I've

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.690
seen on the Marketplace
so far.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.755
So just to recap, in case you're
looking to follow a

00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:37.980
similar path.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.560
Create a product that solves
a real problem for users.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.760
Integrate with their
existing tools.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.270
And lastly, join the Marketplace
to gain access to

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.530
a targeted and growing
audience.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.010
If you have questions for me,
I'll be in the Sandbox today

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.480
and tomorrow.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.360
Thank you very much.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.009
And I'll turn it over now
to Jim with Dito.

00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:03.106
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:03.106 --> 00:30:06.440
JIM MCNELLIS: Thanks, Cameron,
that was great.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.600
Hi, my name is Jim McNellis.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.530
I am the CEO and founder
of Dito.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:15.290
We established ourselves in
2007 as a web design firm.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.130
I immediately set up Google Apps
for my own domain, and I

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.650
realize I got into the
wrong business.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.660
And so for the next year and a
half, I actually worked on

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.070
creating a business
around providing

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.330
Google Apps to customers.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.720
I'm one of the resellers that
Scott mentioned earlier.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.750
So we've been a Google Apps
authorized reseller since

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.850
October 2008.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.620
We were one of the first, and
now there's thousands.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.250
We also have 100% certified
Google Apps deployment team,

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.900
which means that our deployment
team has been

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.950
certified by Google to deploy
Google Apps to customers.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.790
So we're bringing customers to
the Marketplace essentially.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.920
We're creating customers
for this Marketplace.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.470
In addition to being a reseller,
we're also an ISV.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.890
And we were a launch partner
for the Google Apps

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.070
Marketplace last year.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.280
And we're in the Sandbox again
this year, so if you do have

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.765
any questions for me about our
application after this, you

00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:08.210
can feel free to come
check us out.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.060
But basically, we were working
with customers setting them up

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.790
on Google Apps.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.460
And they were coming and telling
us the things that

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.650
they wanted to Google
Apps to do.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.480
And there weren't a lot of
applications at this time that

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.730
were serving that, so we set
out to develop our own

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.200
application called
Dito Directory.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.550
And Dito Directory is basically
a contact manager

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.100
for Google Apps customers.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.310
It's built for Google
Apps customers.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.020
It's built on App Engine, and
it lives in the Google Apps

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.110
Marketplace.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.920
It's very Google-y.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.340
And essentially, our customers
came to us and said, Jim, we

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.010
like the Contacts in Google, but
we really want to be able

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.990
to share our groups of contacts
with other people in

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.950
our organization.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.400
And we can't do that today
in Google Apps.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.680
So what we set out to do is to
develop a interface in order

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.120
to allow users to go in and
share their existing contact

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.720
groups with other users
in their organization.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.150
Let me show you that
real quick.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.170
This is actually a demonstration
of our upcoming

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.190
version of Dito directory.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.390
Today we have an older version
in the Marketplace.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.650
On this version, we'll
be launching

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:14.620
sometime in the next month.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.050
This functionality
is brand new.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.630
If you're interested in testing
out ahead of time,

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.530
again, come check us out in the
Sandbox, we'll be able to

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.500
give you advanced access.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.200
But so today, what I want to do
is I just want to take this

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.780
group of---

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.490
Let me refresh the
page real quick.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.480
I just want to take a group of
contacts and I want to share

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.190
with another user in
my organization.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and click on

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.550
the Google IO group.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.050
And I just want to make sure
this is the right group, so I

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.340
have these four users in here.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.600
And I'm going to add Rene.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.400
Save the group.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.370
And you can see that Rene is
listed here as having the

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.720
group shared with him.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.710
So now I'm just going
to go really

00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:03.260
quickly, sign in as Rene--

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.460
the demo gods are out, huh?

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.290
Here we go.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.540
Navigate to my mailbox.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:41.040
And we'll go into Rene's
contacts, and we should see in

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.290
just a moment--

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.990
There we go.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.820
Google IO.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.170
And we will see these four
contacts in here.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.760
So we sync these contacts up.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.030
The synchronization will
continue to happen if I change

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.650
my contacts.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.170
It'll update on Rene's side.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.870
So it's just a quick
demonstration of what our

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.980
application does.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.780
Now I want to talk to you a
little bit about some tips on

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.775
the Marketplace that we've
learned since we launched on

00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:10.449
the Marketplace, and
specifically around ratings

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:11.900
and reviews.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.739
Ratings and reviews
tell a story.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:17.199
So what I have here is that
I have two lines today.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.790
The red line is the rating, and
where it starts out is the

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:20.670
highest rate you can get.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.219
That's a five star rating.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:25.969
And then I have a relative line
for the number of pro

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.540
versions of our Dito
Directory sold.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.880
You can see here that in the
beginning, we had started out

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.630
with some really great reviews,
and we had an uptick

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.830
in our sales.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.820
And then shortly thereafter,
sometime in November, we

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.889
released a new version that
didn't really work that great.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:43.090
And our customers told us that
it didn't work that great and

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.860
via the reviews on
the Marketplace.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.179
And then we noticed that our
sales actually shadowed that.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.929
About a month later,
our sales dropped.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.010
And we worked really hard to
improve those reviews and to

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.370
work on the problems that were
brought up in those reviews.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.430
And as a result, our reviews
started to rise back up.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.620
And as a result of that, our
sales also have gone back to

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.270
about normal.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.950
So we're today at a four star
rating on the Marketplace.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:09.150
We started out with a
five star rating.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.550
So reviews are really
important.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.130
And so people leave reviews.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.770
You don't get to choose what
reviews they leave you.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.100
You can only develop a great
product and hope that people

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.180
leave an appropriate review.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.110
But you can manage
your reviews.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.610
And what do I mean by that?

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.990
So first of all, negative
reviews.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.280
When you see a negative review,
one thing we do is to

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.090
reach out to the customer, and
we try to solve the problem.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.420
And then once we solve their
problem, we ask them to go

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.280
back and amend their review.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.320
They can just basically
edit their review.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.520
If they're already on there, the
Marketplace is smart, and

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.000
knows they've already left
a review for you.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.880
So they go back, and they
amend their review.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.340
So we're successful with
that sometimes.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.290
And that definitely helps bring
your average back up.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.890
It erases that negative
review essentially.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.130
And of course, another way
that you can reach your

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.340
customers is there's several
different times where you can

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.950
ask them to review you--

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.370
after they purchased your app
and used it for a period of

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.470
time, after you've provided
some level support for the

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.800
application, and then of course
if they've given you

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.710
that positive feedback via phone
or e-mail, asking them

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.940
to go to the Marketplace
and review you.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.670
And we just suggest having a
nice templated instructions

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.100
available explaining exactly how
to leave those reviews in

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.780
the Marketplace, just to
make it really easy

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.850
for them to do it.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.070
But reviews are very
important.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.470
And we've had the exact impact
of having negative reviews and

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.070
having our sales drop
off a cliff.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.330
So have a lot of experience
with working with those

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.520
reviews as well.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.955
Also as Cameron mentioned
earlier, typical premium is

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:32.120
somewhere between 3% and 5%.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.540
Dito Directory has actually
converted much

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.420
better, around 12.5%.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.180
So we're not actually listed
anywhere else.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.100
The only place we list our
application is on the

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.750
Marketplace.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:44.150
And this is representative of
since the 1st of the year.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.050
And there's another thing
we really like about the

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.820
Marketplace, and that is that
we get a lot of traffic.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.210
The web is all about getting
people to look at your

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.680
products and services.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.860
And the Marketplace provides
us with an excellent

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.030
destination on the web
for our products and

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.350
professional services.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.550
So you can see here, this is
since the beginning of this

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:10.200
year, we've had approximately
10,000

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.210
visitors to our website.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.060
We've had a little bit more
than that to our Dito

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.210
Directory listing on
the Marketplace.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.990
So just that one listing for
our application alone

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.450
overshadows all of our
professional services and

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.590
listings on our own website,
which has a

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.680
pretty good page rank.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.480
It's page rank 5.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.440
It's listed very well in
the search engine.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.910
So just want to point
out here--

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.730
And then this last bar here
actually shows, we have our

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.280
professional services, where
Scott touched on very briefly,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.700
listed on the Marketplace
as well.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.570
So there's 8 other listings in
our Dito Directory listing.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.020
We've had at least three times
the amount of traffic that we

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.365
have on our own website.

00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:47.500
So we get a lot more eyeballs
on our product and on our

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.760
services just from the Google
Apps Marketplace.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.820
And so what does this mean?

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.180
This means that this
is a place that--

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.080
Google Apps Marketplace is a
place where us as a reseller

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.520
are pointing our customers to
go purchase third party

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.100
applications when they tell us
they need something that

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.330
Google Apps doesn't fit.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.570
And it also means that it's a
place for me, as a vendor, to

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.130
list our applications,
and then people--

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:16.520
It gives us credibility
as a vendor in

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.980
the Google Apps ecosystem.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.030
That's all I have for today.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.820
Now I'm going to turn you over
to Matt, and he's going to

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.068
tell you Assistly.

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:25.318
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:28.442 --> 00:38:30.620
MATT TRIFIRO: Thank you, Jim.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.330
This is Dan Stern from
Assistly also.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.790
I'm Matt Trifiro, so he's going
to drive my demo in a

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:35.660
few minutes.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.180
I'm the SVP Marketing
of Assistly, and--

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.030
So what is Assistly?

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:47.250
Assistly is a all-in-one
customer service system.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.370
Plug it into your website, and
start wowing your customers on

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:56.860
e-mail, live chat, self service
FAQ, social media

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.560
channels, like Facebook and
Twitter, and even phone.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.770
And it is everything you need
to provide support.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.625
So why do we choose to enter the
Google Apps Marketplace?

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:14.080
The first thing is Google has
done the heavy lifting of

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.770
finding some terrific
customers.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.760
We're a business to business
application.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.470
We're an enterprise
grade application.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.580
We target small to medium
sized enterprises.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.200
B2B lead generation is
really, really hard,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.610
and it's really expensive.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.030
So Google has provided this
environment of highly

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.550
targeted, ready to
buy customers.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.770
The people that use Google
Apps have already made a

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.740
decision to use it throughout
the organization.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.090
And they're looking to leverage
that investment.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.640
And so they go to the Google
Apps Marketplace to find those

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.550
opportunities to leverage it.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.280
Gmail is the number one
application used in the Google

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.770
Apps Suite.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.000
So if you like Assistly, and
you integrate with e-mail,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.930
you're golden.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.390
It's an absolutely powerful
way of tapping

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.780
into that user base.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.370
And then finally, people that
use Google Apps tend to have a

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.820
company wide mindset.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.860
And so for a company like
Assistly that believes in

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.160
collaborative support delivering
to customers, that

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.810
having that hard work already
done of convincing an

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.570
organization that they should
deploy tools throughout their

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.220
organization saves a lot of time
and energy and effort to

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.650
argue that.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.820
So customer service doesn't
get siloed in the service

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.150
organization.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.920
It's actually distributed
throughout the entire

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.430
organization.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.710
And because we to sell by the
user, it ends up being higher

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.960
ring totals for our customers.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:51.420
So look, Gmail is a great tool
for support when you're tiny.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.660
But as soon as you start hitting
any volume, you get a

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.120
dozen or two e-mails from
your customers a day.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.830
You have maybe a few people
trying to provide support

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:00.990
within your team.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.600
It's not the right tool
for the task.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.380
It tends to break down.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.400
So you go to Google Apps
Marketplace, you'll find a

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.280
tool like Assistly.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.400
You notice it's got
five star reviews.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.385
People love the product.

00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:13.650
You hit the Add Now button.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.170
And we've done some really
neat things in this on

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.820
boarding process.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.580
Now we skipped a couple strings
just to make the demo

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.530
tolerable, but there's a good
series of the terms of service

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.040
and the authentication
on the Google side.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.090
But as soon as you get into our
on boarding process, we

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.580
query the Google API to
find your site domain.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.140
So we populate the site that
says where you go to use

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:40.410
Assistly, and then we actually
do another query.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:49.020
And we pull up all the users on
your system, and lets you

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.680
check off users that you want
invite to collaborate with you

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.490
on your support to trial the
product, to use the product.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.720
And then again, because we
wanted to be an instant wow

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.510
experience for customers that
are trying Assistly, we look

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.970
to try to find an e-mail box
that's probably the support

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.510
Inbox, support@mycompany.com
or help@mycompany.com.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.960
We automatically populate
that in the box.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.040
We make it one click to hook
that channel up and import

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.180
your existing e-mails.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.650
And then again, we've got other
channels like the social

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.650
media channels that are one
or two clicks away.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:36.460
And then you're done.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.440
You're in Assistly as soon
as you enable it.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.780
This is the collaborative
agent desktop.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.020
It's optimized for customer
support work flow.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.240
All of your customer inquiries
from all your channels,

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.520
whether it be social media, or
e-mail, or phone, or organized

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.600
in priority order.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.690
You can click on any
one of them.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.850
And you've got all the tools
you need to handle your

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:57.520
customer inquiries.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.580
You have customer records.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.850
You have all the history
of that customer.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.550
You have any status
of that customer.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.590
Every case has a priority.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.680
Every case has an owner.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.210
Every case has a status.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.920
And that means you have this
air tight capability for

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.900
providing support.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.570
Yet it's an interface that
looks a lot like e-mail.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.940
So you tend to have the
familiarity that you normally

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.540
get from that.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:19.840
That's it.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.090
That's for the demo.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.720
[LAUGHING]

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.330
Yeah, the sneaker net.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.330
So I have two tips for
the Marketplace.

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.610
The first one is, there are a
lot of applications on the

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:33.820
Marketplace.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.330
Scot mentioned 300.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.010
Spend a good part of a day
actually installing

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.140
applications and trying
them out.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.790
There are some that have really
terrific worked flows,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.080
and others that don't have
such terrific work flows.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.840
Some of the product listing
pages are a

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.010
lot better than others.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.730
Some of them are very careful
to rank for the right SEO

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.540
terms in the Marketplace,
which is important.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.160
People are searching.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.870
Some are written really well.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.250
Got great copywriting.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.730
So identify the ones you think
are the best practices, look

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.590
at the applications that are
successful in the Marketplace,

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.110
and really spend the time to
study the on boarding process

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.110
to identify how you can make it
easier for your customer to

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.240
get to that moment of wow
as fast as they can when

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.390
installing your application.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.770
And then tap your community.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.200
One of my favorite application

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.170
installations was by Tungle.me.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.720
I wrote a love note to the
CEO, ended up spending 20

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.805
minutes on the phone with him,
gave me some absolutely

00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:22.610
terrific tips.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.060
It's still a small community.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.130
And I found you can reach out
to people, and get some some

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.280
great advice.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.050
And then don't forget
your analytics.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.150
There's an ability to add Google
Analytics profile to

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.590
your listing page.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.720
Absolutely create that profile
and add that page.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.560
And then treat your listing page
and all the links on that

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.000
page like you would any
other campaign.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.315
And attach Google UTM codes.

00:44:47.315 --> 00:44:49.430
If you don't know what that is,
Google it and find out.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:53.720
But you can attach tracking
codes to your links.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.560
Because that's how you
figure out where the

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.720
value is coming from.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.150
And that's how you justify your
return on investment in

00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.740
the Marketplace.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.630
And I'll give you one
clear example.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.370
So you look at this page,
you say, well,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:04.900
where's the money button?

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:05.350
Well, it's this one.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:08.530
Yes, of course, that's where
the money comes from.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.230
But it's also at this link.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.400
Because people click
that link, and they

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.550
come to your website.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:13.340
And this link?

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.470
Same thing.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.340
And these two links that
come to your website.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.840
And because we've coded all
those to track them from

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.945
Google Apps Marketplace, what
we found is that in addition

00:45:21.945 --> 00:45:25.030
to all the great business that
Google Apps Marketplace was

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.810
bringing us directly through the
Add It Now button, we also

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.010
had another 30% lift.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:34.130
So there was another 30%
additional customers that were

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.610
finding about Assistly from the
Google Apps Marketplace,

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.850
but were becoming our customers

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.940
through some other mechanism.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.670
Or at least trying the product
through some other mechanism.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.050
And so we're getting this
additional justification for

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.000
participation in the
Marketplace.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.740
And we're absolutely thrilled
with the support that Google

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.900
has given us, and with the
success in the Marketplace.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.320
So it's been a absolutely
terrific channel for us within

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:55.680
the first--

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.290
We've been on the Marketplace a
little over 60 days now, and

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.150
within the first three days,
it was one of our top five

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.860
performing channels.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.700
So like I mentioned earlier,
terrific community.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.470
I've done a lot of applications
for a lot of

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:10.670
different platforms. Had
relationships with a lot of

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:11.930
different developer
relationships.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.170
Google's is world class.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.710
We've been able to get our
technical questions answered.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.630
We've got great support
on the marketing side.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.330
Absolutely world class.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.890
And then a ton of indirect
benefits.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.130
The traffic and visibility to
Assistly that's brought to us

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.960
from the Marketplace, in
addition to the lift of

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.390
organic sign ups that we saw,
that we can attribute, at

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.910
least partially back to our
presence in the Google Apps

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.630
Marketplace.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.076
So thank you, and I think
Scott's got some Q&amp;A here.

00:46:37.076 --> 00:46:38.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:40.804 --> 00:46:42.636
SCOTT MCMULLAN: All right,
thanks, guys.

00:46:42.636 --> 00:46:43.700
Awesome presentations.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.900
Thank you for sharing.

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.060
So we're going to go into Q&amp;A
for the next 13 or so minutes

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.240
we've got left.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.130
You've got a question for any
of us up here, please--

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.160
Actually if could come to the
mic, that would be great.

00:46:59.646 --> 00:47:03.360
AUDIENCE: Hi, as someone on
the Marketplace, these are

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.890
some great tips, great
advice, thank you.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.980
Quick question, Scott you
mentioned about billing.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.626
You said that if you acquire
users Apps Marketplace, then

00:47:11.626 --> 00:47:12.720
you pay the 20% recurring.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.220
If you don't, then you don't.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:19.360
So is it just fine to have
people using your gadget or

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.840
your connection points if
they're paying you somewhere

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.660
else as long as they weren't
acquired on the page?

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.640
In other words, you get all the
integration, even if the

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.165
billing didn't come
from there?

00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:30.290
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Great
question.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.850
And we are a little bit light
on the details here, so in

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.900
general, billing through the
Marketplace will eventually be

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.980
a requirement.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.180
So when we have our billing
APIs, and they're fully rolled

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.290
out-- and there will be a grace
period-- but you will

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.720
need to adopt to billing
APIs when that we put

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.620
out, when they come.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.020
Is that--

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.900
AUDIENCE: And I didn't
mean to--

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.650
I know that you guys are
changing billing stuff.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.150
I wasn't as much referring
to that.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.700
It's more just the
acquisition part.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.640
In other words, you can
always have a free

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.130
product, I'm guessing.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.530
And there's definitely
a paid version.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:05.120
But are you saying that if you
have a paid version, and they

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.310
use your market thing, then the
pay will go through you?

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:10.250
SCOTT MCMULLAN: It's
for new customers.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.240
So your existing--

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.170
Customers can come and add the
additional integration, using

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.070
the Add It Now button, that
provisioning flow.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.180
And there's no rev share for
their existing customers.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.040
If they're new to you, then
there is a rev share.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.650
AUDIENCE: I guess, it's just
to me, the whole idea of

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.180
what's new.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.590
I might have a customer, but you
don't know whether they're

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:30.070
new or not when they click
the Add It Now button.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.990
SCOTT MCMULLAN: So
yeah, we'll--

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.690
So in the terms of service say
new, we don't define it as new

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:38.080
in the last second, in the last
day, it's a good point.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.020
But in general, the spirit
of it is new.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.760
So literally if they just came
through and said, hey, this is

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.430
a great application, let
me check it out.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:45.510
That's a new customer.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.085
If they were a customer a month
ago, and they come to

00:48:48.085 --> 00:48:49.630
the Marketplace and say,
I would also like--

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.830
I'm now a Google Apps customer,
and I'd like to hook

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:52.700
these two things up.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.350
That's an existing customer.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.590
AUDIENCE: So somewhere or
another, there's some sort of

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.520
trusting in there.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.810
It's not necessarily--

00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:58.640
Just because they--

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.840
Because for example, in iTunes,
it doesn't matter

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.940
where you came from, you pay.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.180
Whereas here you're saying,
there's some fuzziness about

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.330
where the customer came from.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:05.750
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Correct.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:08.630
And we'll try it de-fuzz that
as we launch it out.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:09.100
Thanks

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.630
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Tim.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.930
We are a Google Apps partner and
distributor in Chile and

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.160
Latin America.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.100
We're also developing apps
now for the Marketplace.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.580
And one thing that was very
interesting I found was, what

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.120
you guys mentioned about
the conversion

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.920
rates to paying customers.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.990
Because one thing is that you
drive traffic and you say, the

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.720
Google Apps--

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.060
I don't know who said it.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.650
The Google Apps customers
that use the Marketplace

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:34.990
are ready to pay.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.720
That makes them more
qualified to get

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.340
higher conversion rates.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.460
Have you--

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.770
I just wanted to see if you
can go into more detail--

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.420
each one of you-- and just
really quickly, if there's a

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.960
big difference in percentages
of the Google Apps customers

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.265
and the premium users
of Google Apps.

00:49:51.265 --> 00:49:53.970
So those that are already paying
for Google Apps, versus

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.070
the guy said are using
the free version.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.410
Have you done any and
analysis on that?

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.870
So that would be very
interesting.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.420
So somebody uses Google Apps
free edition is likely to

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:08.500
convert that 10%, but somebody
who is already using premium

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.170
edition is already paying.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.425
Should be easier, right?

00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.700
JIM MCNELLIS: Yeah, so I can
answer that really quickly.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.590
From our experience, our
application actually

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:20.030
interfaces with APIs that are
only available with the

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.720
business edition
of Google Apps.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.370
So all of our customers, our
actually paying customers are

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.430
premiere edition customers, are

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.220
business edition customers.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.500
So they have already paid
for the application.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.870
CAMERON HENNEKE: Yeah, for
GQueues, I don't have the

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:36.100
stats on the differences between
maybe the free Google

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.850
Apps users versus premium.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.770
But I do know that a large
majority of my customers,

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:43.600
they're smaller businesses
between, I don't

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.200
know, 5 and 25 users.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.110
And a lot of those then are
falling under the free Google

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.290
Apps, and they seem to
be converting just

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:54.190
as much as the paying.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.960
So for us, we haven't
seen a difference.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.610
If they're on Google Apps, and
they want products, then

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.910
they'll pay for them, even if
they're not paying for Google

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:04.160
Apps itself.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.320
MATT TRIFIRO: Yeah, we've only
been in the Marketplace for 60

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.510
days, so I don't have
statistically relevant data.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.590
We're seeing a pretty uniform
conversion rate though, so

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.461
we'll see if that holds out as
we get more conversions.

00:51:17.461 --> 00:51:19.185
Thanks.

00:51:19.185 --> 00:51:20.720
AUDIENCE: Great, thank,
everybody.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.640
Great tips.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.040
Good follow on question actually
around who you're

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.420
seeing around the Marketplace.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.300
I'm curious--

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.450
You mentioned small
businesses.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:31.460
I'm curious what the mix is
between very small business

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.710
range that you mentioned versus
the larger, midsize or

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:35.930
enterprise companies.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.260
And also the mix you're
seeing between--

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.540
All your tools have a lot
of end user appeal.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.790
I'm curious what you're seeing
between the admin and the end

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.130
user appeal, and how you're
bridging that divide.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.680
Or maybe the companies are so
small that it doesn't make a

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.990
difference.

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:55.690
MATT TRIFIRO: OK, so
I'll take a stab.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.550
I think I understand.

00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:00.020
So the first question--

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.226
I forgot the first question.

00:52:01.226 --> 00:52:02.310
AUDIENCE: Company size.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.540
MATT TRIFIRO: So company size.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.800
So essentially targets companies
that are between 15

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.930
and 150 employees, which means
their support staff is 5, 10,

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.250
15, 20, and so on.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:16.490
We get a pretty wide range of
company sizes, and so Assistly

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:19.540
license sizes from the Google
Apps Marketplace.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:23.100
I would say a fairly meaningful
percentage-- again,

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.200
I'm talking about small
sample sizes still--

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.220
are in that organization size
that's a 150 or less.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.110
But I'm not seeing all of them
being on the free tier of

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:33.550
Google Apps.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.870
I'm seeing a pretty wide mix.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:38.490
We've got some fairly sizable
customers from the Google Apps

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.740
Marketplace.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.550
That's another reason this
is exciting to us.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.490
What was the second question?

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.640
AUDIENCE: Just the mix between,
especially for those

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.510
larger companies, the admin who
actually needs to do the

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.010
Add It Now--

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.370
MATT TRIFIRO: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.110
So I don't--

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:56.870
So the question, I think, is
the admin may not be the

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.370
actual consumer of
the application.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.680
OK, so Assistly is
a good example.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.970
So you're a large
organization.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:05.530
Your customer service
organization might be 20% of

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:06.670
your overall organization.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:10.070
The customer service manager
is probably not the admin.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:10.930
Well, I think--

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:12.270
This is my hypothesis.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.050
I don't know the answer.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.750
But I think part of what
accounts for the 30% lift that

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:19.120
I showed you are people that
are in the customer service

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.710
organization.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:22.280
They aren't the administrator,
but they might be the decision

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.300
maker, or certainly a key
influencer, are finding us on

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.660
the Marketplace but don't have
the admin privileges.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.490
So they're coming to our
website, signing up through

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:30.800
our normal process.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.950
What I don't know yet is to
see if those folks go back

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.580
with the administrator
and actually sign up.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.990
I've seen that happen once.

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.160
But I'll have to see if
there's a trend there.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.130
But I think that is an
interesting question how we

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:44.015
should solve it.

00:53:44.015 --> 00:53:47.080
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Just to add to
that topic, so definitely

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.890
we're very well aware that the
buyer isn't always the admin.

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:53.080
And we released and rolled
out a feature that lets a

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.320
non-admin notify their admin.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.180
That's a small step to making
that flow easier, but we're

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:02.920
working on also other ways
to enable all buyers.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.690
JIM MCNELLIS: Yeah, I just want
to add that we definitely

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:08.210
see a variety of customers,
small and large.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.480
I think most of them are
smaller customers, just

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.280
because most of the customers
on Google Apps are smaller

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.685
customers in general.

00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:15.950
So a large majority of them
are smaller customers.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:18.610
Our tool is actually an
admin-focused tool.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:19.820
We do have end user
capabilities, but we're

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.490
actually targeting the admin
in the admin tools section.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.873
So it's definitely used more
by admins than end

00:54:26.873 --> 00:54:29.902
users, in our case.

00:54:29.902 --> 00:54:30.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.980
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Thanks
for the question.

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.550
MATT TRIFIRO: I just want to
add something to that.

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.400
If you have an application that
has targeted the smaller

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.690
organization, you've actually
got this triple benefit.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:40.570
Because the person who does the
install also tends to be

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.320
the decision maker.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.260
And so these 30 to 50--

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.020
50 employees or fewer,
that's often

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:52.676
concentrated in one person.

00:54:52.676 --> 00:54:55.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks, guys,
for the great tips.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.170
We are actually a Google Apps
Marketplace vendor.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.360
I have a couple of suggestions
about one of the things that

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.890
we find difficulties to get
support for technical aspects

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.920
of our application, especially
when we work

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.670
with enterprise customers.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:12.100
We tend to send e-mails
to general support.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.530
We wonder would be great if
there is a special channel

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:20.130
where Marketplace vendors can
have a better support through

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.030
technical support or other
stuff that would be very

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.510
interesting.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.040
Is there anything like that
planned or what are your

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:26.740
thoughts about that?

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.930
Because some of you, you
probably have your

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:30.760
applications running.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.565
Do you get a special channel?

00:55:32.565 --> 00:55:35.570
Or if there are technical issues
or critical issues, do

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:36.170
you get appropriate support?

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:39.040
And how do you actually deal
with those things when they're

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.255
really critical?

00:55:40.255 --> 00:55:43.660
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Just to clarify,
are these typically

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.100
questions with the purchase
process of the Marketplace, or

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:50.730
things like APIs being slow or
not working the way you expect

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:51.135
them there?

00:55:51.135 --> 00:55:52.110
AUDIENCE: It's both.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:55.380
In the sense, in general, what
we find is we have to go

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.050
through these various channels,
but since we are

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.830
actually signing up, say for the
Marketplace partnership,

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.210
if there is a special channel
where there is a dedicated

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.820
support, and we can get through
in e-mail, or some

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.930
other contact.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.260
It's not just for billing.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.100
I think billing and
provisioning is

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.625
one, but even otherwise.

00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:15.150
SCOTT MCMULLAN: So it's
a great question.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.650
It's an important topic.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:17.810
I'll be the first to
admit that it's

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:18.960
not a simple process.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:24.720
We've got, I'd say, a dozen
forums across different APIs,

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.490
including a main forum, which
is really for Marketplace as

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.740
in umbrella as a process.

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:34.140
So right now your best bet is
to engage with us in the

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.800
Google Apps Marketplace forum,
if it's some sort of question

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.520
around anything that's
non-API specific.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.420
And then also engage with us
in the forums for APIs.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.990
We don't have any other kind
of paid or per ticket

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:49.220
support right now.

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.390
But it's a request we
get a lot, so we're

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:52.385
thinking about it.

00:56:52.385 --> 00:56:57.790
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Steph.

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.870
I'm a vendor in Europe,
in France.

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:06.710
And we are targeting a
lot of customers that

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:09.260
are not English speakers.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.405
And I would like to know if
there is a plan to localize

00:57:13.405 --> 00:57:17.115
the Marketplace for non-English
speakers.

00:57:17.115 --> 00:57:18.640
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Great
question.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.600
There is a plan.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.340
Unfortunately, there's
no concrete date

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.770
that I can give you.

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:28.480
But absolutely, we've seen a
huge adoption of Google Apps

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.420
and the Marketplace in all kinds
of countries that don't

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.940
speak English as their
primary language.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.665
So even though we're global,
we're English only.

00:57:34.665 --> 00:57:37.710
But we know that's not going
to serve our purposes.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:41.570
So nothing to share in terms of
a date, but it's definitely

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:43.990
something that's a high
priority for us.

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.470
AUDIENCE: I have another
question.

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:51.730
What's the process for being
showcased on the admin panel

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:52.500
of customers?

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.280
Is it something that
we have to pay?

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.050
Or is it like you recommend
a the application?

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:02.000
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Yeah, I was
waiting for that question.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.300
That's usually the first
question I get.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.700
In general, there are two areas
where we're showcasing,

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.450
or where individual
applications are

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:11.820
being singled out.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.630
The home page in the Marketplace
is the one, and

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.740
that's featured in notable.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.330
That is an editorially
chosen set of apps.

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.980
And we look at things like
mainly customer adoption.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:27.500
Customer adoption, reaction,
quality of the experience, and

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.100
we try to surface things that
we see are being adopted or

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:34.060
being ramping up in adoption
there first. So

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.680
that's the home page.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.080
On the control panel and the
Setup Wizard, which I showed,

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.760
that's actually an algorithmic
decision.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.800
So we'll have a recommendation
algorithm that basically looks

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.550
at things about the customer,
looks at the applications,

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:49.960
again takes all kinds of
signals like any good

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.680
recommendation algorithm
would.

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.110
But it's not a paid placement.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:58.170
It's chosen by that algorithm to
basically try to match that

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.586
application with that user.

00:59:00.586 --> 00:59:03.312
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:03.312 --> 00:59:04.380
SCOTT MCMULLAN: All right.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.810
Time for one more question.

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:07.240
Anyone else?

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.620
We've got a lot of brain
power and experience up

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.380
here for the panel.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.380
Anything else?

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.650
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me?

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.990
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Yes.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:21.220
AUDIENCE: So of the three
companies, is there any

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.350
preference on the language, like
say Python or JAVA, and

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:30.170
then external site is using
Google App Engine.

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.110
Do you guys have
a preference--

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.990
SCOTT MCMULLAN: The
question was--

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.960
Can you repeat the question--

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.690
AUDIENCE: The language between
Python or JAVA,

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.530
implementation wise.

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:43.660
And what was the difficulties?

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.940
JIM MCNELLIS: So what I demoed
today was Python, and our

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.350
current version is
actually JAVA.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:49.880
That's part of the reason it's
taken a long time to

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.620
redevelop, so--

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.540
But both are on App Engine.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.260
CAMERON HENNEKE: And just to
point out, you don't have to

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.290
create your app on App Engine.

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.690
It can be on any kind
of platform.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:04.390
And then the integration
is just that XML file.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:08.670
I'm on Python, because I love
it with App Engine, but you

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.005
can do it on anything.

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:12.080
DAN STERN: And we're probably
the odd man out here.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.900
We're actually running Ruby on
Rails at Amazon, and the

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.010
integration couldn't
have been easier.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.696
We're up and running, I
think, in three days.

01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:22.030
SCOTT MCMULLAN: Awesome.

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:23.190
Well, thank you all.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.370
And thanks to our awesome
speakers.
