00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.210
As an amateur
photographer, I wanted

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.500
to find out when is the
sun going to rise or set

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.710
at a particular landmark.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.710
My name's Adam Ratana.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.730
My day job, I work
for a large insurance

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.000
company as a software lead.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.060
And in my spare time I
developed an Android and iOS

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.890
app called Sun Surveyor for
helping predict and visualize

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.590
positions of the sun and
moon, which has applications

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.760
in photography, architecture,
real estate, earth

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.440
science, and any other
use you can think of.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.380
I used the Google Maps
APIs for Android and iOS.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.070
And that's been
incredibly easy to use.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.610
The maps experience
has changed over time.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.480
People are used to now being
able to zoom in and tilt

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.960
and rotate maps and be able
to have a lot of overlays

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.590
and a lot of
interactive elements.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.640
And so they've given
that to us as developers

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.470
to integrate in
our own apps, which

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.955
is an improvement
over the other APIs.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:57.770
If a photographer wants to get
a picture of the sun crowning

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.960
the top half Half Dome using
Google Time Zone API and Google

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.863
Elevation API, I
can provide them

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.640
with the information they
need to plan it correctly.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.730
What users of the
app really love

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.550
is the map and now
with Street View.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.080
The Street View API is a
pretty big game changer

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.780
in that it lets you bring
a really powerful visual

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.630
of a remote location
right into an app

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.880
and really lets you
visualize the sun and moon

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.690
paths somewhere where you may
not be for weeks or months.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.610
It's gone way beyond what I
imagined I could use it for.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.610
It's pretty delightful.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.020
It's pretty unexpected.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.570
