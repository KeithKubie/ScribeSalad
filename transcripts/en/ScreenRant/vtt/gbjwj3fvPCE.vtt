00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.760
A film review is just one person’s opinion
of a movie, but it has the potential to start

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.240
a firestorm on the Internet.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.100
In this day and age, fans have become obsessed
with what critics think of the most anticipated

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.930
blockbusters, and any pundit who says the
next comic book movie isn’t the best thing

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.199
since sliced bread draws the ire of audiences.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.890
Wild accusations of bribes, petitions to shut
down Rotten Tomatoes, and even death threats,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.140
have become far too commonplace these days.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.290
But moviegoers aren’t the only ones who
will voice their displeasure with critics.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.300
Actors and directors never like it when their
work is ripped to shreds, so sometimes they

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.480
strike back.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.760
Here are 10 actors and directors who publicly
fought with critics.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.090
Suicide Squad

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.570
Many hoped David Ayer’s Suicide Squad would
be the critical hit the DCEU needed, but it

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.840
proved to be just as polarizing as its predecessors.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.200
As the negative reviews stacked up, the cast
and crew defended their movie.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.570
Cara Delevingne claimed that critics don’t
like superhero movies, and David Ayer reignited

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.220
the old “I make movies for fans, not critics,”
debate – implying that reviewers can’t

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.110
also be fans of the material.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.360
Actor Jay Hernandez took it another step forward
by saying, “The critics can kiss my ass.”

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.270
They were all obviously frustrated, but at
least Suicide Squad is a box office hit.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.570
The Avengers

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.860
Those who feel Marvel is in the pocket of
film critics should give A.O. Scott a call.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.950
The New York Times reviewer was one of the
few who didn’t like the first Avengers movie,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.290
saying it was full of “bloated cynicism”
and “grinding, hectic emptiness.”

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.820
Many disagreed with this take, including Samuel
L. Jackson.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.070
The actor took to Twitter to say Scott needed
a new job, one he could “actually do.”

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.290
Scott and Jackson went back-and-forth on social
media for a while before they let it go.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.140
The Avengers is considered one of the best
superhero films of all-time, so it’s safe

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.530
to say Jackson “won.”

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.910
The Lone Ranger

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.819
This reboot of a classic property was a notorious
box office bomb, and it certainly didn’t

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.950
help matters that the word-of-mouth was fairly
toxic.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.819
The reviews for Lone Ranger were pretty awful,
and stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer took

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.870
issue with the levels of criticism lobbied
at the film.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.879
Depp felt that a majority of the reviews were
written months before the movie premiered,

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.230
and Hammer felt that reviewers were purposely
lashing out against it due to its budgetary

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.230
woes.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.160
The two blamed critics for The Lone Ranger
flopping, but critics were quick to point

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.640
out that they didn’t make the final product.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.249
Godzilla

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.749
Roland Emmerich typically delivers big scale
spectacle, but he’s hardly a critical darling.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.069
The late great Roger Ebert frequently gave
Emmerich’s films negative reviews, which

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.249
rubbed the filmmaker the wrong way.

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.950
For his Godzilla reboot in 1998, Emmerich
created the character of “Mayor Ebert,”

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.939
an ineffectual politican whose actions endangered
the people of New York.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.560
To top it off, the mayor had an advisor named
“Gene,” after Ebert’s partner Gene Siskel.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.599
It definitely wasn’t a subtle jab, and it’s
one Ebert found amusement with, joking that

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.790
he thought he’d get killed by Godzilla.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.080
Neither Siskel nor Ebert gave Godzilla two
thumbs up.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.150
Titanic

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.651
James Cameron’s romantic drama epic tied
a record by winning 11 Oscars in 1997, but

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.379
not everyone was a fan of the film.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.430
The LA Times’ Kenneth Turan was particularly
critical of it, saying that it “reeks of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.370
phoniness and lacks even minimal originality.”

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.010
Cameron wrote a lengthy tired against Turan,
ultimately accusing the reviewer of insulting

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.980
the moviegoing public with his feelings on
Titanic.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.540
Turan smartly stayed out of it, but when the
heat died down, he then claimed that Cameron

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.080
had written to the Times in an attempt to
get Turan fired.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.799
The critic got to keep his job, but it’s
safe to say he won’t be exchanging pleasantries

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.549
with Cameron anytime soon.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.480
Gods of Egypt

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.870
Even before this film came out, Gods of Egypt
stirred up controversy due to its whitewashed

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.870
cast.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.069
When it finally premiered, the movie was a
forgettable box office disaster that hardly

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.629
impressed critics.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.520
Director Alex Proyas took great offense to
the panning of his movie and fired back on

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520
Facebook.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.030
In his meltdown, he referred to movie pundits
as “deranged idiots” and “diseased vultures,”

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.610
while calling them “less than worthless.”

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.510
He also accused many of writing their reviews
to fit into the general consensus, an erroneous

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.380
claim since most reviews are written prior
to there being a consensus.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.450
If and when Proyas makes another film, he’ll
have a hard time getting critics on his side.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.160
Trainwreck

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.500
Amy Schumer has become one of the leading
ladies of comedy, and she parlayed the success

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.200
of her TV show into a romantic-comedy.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.100
In 2015, she headlined Trainwreck, which was
well-received overall.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.700
But one person who wasn’t fond of it was
Jeffrey Wells, who spent most of his review

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.730
explaining how the “not conventionally attractive”
and “chubby” Schumer didn’t make for

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.890
the most convincing rom-com lead.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.720
He doubled down in a second post, where he
said the actress wasn’t “grade-A or even

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.870
B-plus material” in terms of prettiness.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.640
Schumer got the last laugh by taking the controversy
and turning it into a hysterical Inside Amy

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.370
Schumer sketch where men determine if she’s
sexy enough to be on TV.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.830
Identity Thief

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.560
The box office numbers indicate that audiences
love watching Melissa McCarthy on the big

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.400
screen, but some critics would rather she
not be in movies anymore.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.240
While reviewing Identity Thief, Rex Reed made
his criticism personal by calling McCarthy

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.860
a “female hippo” and “tractor sized.”

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.560
He felt that McCarthy’s weight was used
as a gimmick for cheap laughs.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.620
McCarthy responded by saying Reed was “in
a really bad spot.”

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.400
The reviewer went on to say he had lost many
friends to obesity, but that didn’t excuse

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.900
the harshness of his words.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.710
Identity Thief was a financial hit and McCarthy
is in the midst of a successful career.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.880
Black Swan

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.600
Film buffs may be familiar with Armond White,
a notorious contrarian critic who praises

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.440
panned films and pans praised films.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.330
During the 2011 New York Film Critics Circle
awards dinner, White expressed his displeasure

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.340
for many of the films the group was honoring
– even with the filmmakers of those projects

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.520
in attendance.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.570
One of the films he had disliked was Darren
Aronofsky’s Black Swan, and the director

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.280
fought back, saying at the event that White’s
reviews gave him “another reason to not

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.760
read the New York Press,” White’s outlet.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.590
White responded by saying Aronofsky does read
him and “because he reads me, he knows the

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.630
truth.”

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.920
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.780
The DCEU had a rough year with critics, as
Batman V Superman couldn’t live up to the

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.260
high hopes of many.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.850
As the film was picked apart, members of the
franchise came to their colleague’s defense.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.680
Ray Fisher, who plays Cyborg in Justice League,
Instagramed a meme riffing on a Batman V Superman

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.210
scene, where Ben Affleck’s Bruce Wayne implies
that the critics are uniting to wipe out the

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.480
DC film slate and it’s up to the Justice
League to destroy them.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.150
That was enough to make many people cringe,
since a lot of critics want the movies to

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.150
be good.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.570
Hopefully Justice League is a step in the
right direction and brings people together.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.790
Those are just some of the actors and directors
who have feuded with critics in their careers.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.160
Are there any we missed?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.020
