00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.520
See those three bars sticking up in the middle

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.860
of the road? So why are they there? What

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.490
are their affordances? Well, maybe they're for stretching and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.100
turning. Maybe you're supposed to run around them as fast

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.250
as possible, in loops for five minutes. It's part

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.160
of an exercise course. Or maybe you can lean your

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.692
bicycles on them. Or maybe they they're stands for

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:26.000
a net that you stretch between them, and play games.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.780
So what do you think?
