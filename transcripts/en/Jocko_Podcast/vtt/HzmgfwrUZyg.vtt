00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.800
Well, there's so much knowledge out there, so much information,

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.110
so many ways to get better

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
and we make, we make so many mistakes.

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.770
We're the,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.770
we're the product of our mistakes and oftentimes the lesson is sitting there

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.380
right in front of our face. It's there to be learned,

7
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.640
but we miss it or we don't pay attention to it or we think we know better

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.990
until it punches in the face.

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.010
And the most important thing to learn is that we have so much to learn.

10
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.163
We all do.

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.980
And we can learn from school and from people and from experience and we learn

12
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:57.940
from life.

13
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.150
But you have to process the information,

14
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.270
you have to absorb it, you have to accept it,

15
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.300
you have to open your mind and you've got to free your mind so that you can

16
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.583
learn.

17
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.060
<v 0>And make real progress</v>

19
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.880
in as far as regrets and things.

20
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.820
I wish I would've done differently. Of course,

21
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.003
hindsight,

22
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.810
hindsight is 2020 and looking back of course,

23
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:44.070
who wouldn't want to take another go at something and improve on the first try

24
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.750
by doing it again and then why not do it again?

25
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:50.670
And again and again.

26
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:55.671
And why not just do it over and over again until you have it perfect.

27
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930
But the fact is you don't get that chance.

28
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.870
You get one shot,

29
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.570
one shot at this gig right here. Life,

30
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.210
one life. That's all you've got

31
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
and regret in and of itself,

32
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.163
<v 1>okay?</v>

33
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.070
<v 0>It's worthless. It does nothing for you. In fact,</v>

34
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
the only valuable thing and regret is the lesson you learned,

35
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.420
<v 1>okay?</v>

36
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.490
<v 0>The knowledge that you gained,</v>

37
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.793
<v 1>okay?</v>

38
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.570
<v 0>But walking around filled with regret gets you nothing.</v>

39
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.880
So learn and move on.

40
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.000
Don't let regret beats you down. Don't be a slave to regret.

41
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.500
No. Let it teach you.

42
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.600
Let it make you better.

43
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.770
Let the fear of regret fueled you to take action today.

44
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.083
Now,

45
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.983
<v 1>okay.</v>

46
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.920
<v 0>To take action now to become a better person.</v>

47
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.720
Not filled with regret,

48
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.810
but filled with knowledge,

49
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.050
filled with knowledge and strength and power and filled with

50
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.820
<v 1>light.</v>
