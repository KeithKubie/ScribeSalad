people who resist the insights of

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599
people who resist the insights of
 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.840
people who resist the insights of
science and I think a lot of this has to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
science and I think a lot of this has to
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810
science and I think a lot of this has to
do with how we teach science to young

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
do with how we teach science to young
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.250

kids in school right for many people and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
kids in school right for many people and
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.890
kids in school right for many people and
I'm talking from experience people have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
I'm talking from experience people have
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.740
I'm talking from experience people have
told me this that science for them in

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
told me this that science for them in
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.340
told me this that science for them in
school they didn't understand it as a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
school they didn't understand it as a
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.170
school they didn't understand it as a
body of investigative knowledge that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
body of investigative knowledge that
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790
body of investigative knowledge that
gives us insights into how the world

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
gives us insights into how the world
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.630
gives us insights into how the world
works no for them it was some facts that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
works no for them it was some facts that
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610
works no for them it was some facts that
they were made to memorize and spit back

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
they were made to memorize and spit back
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.910
they were made to memorize and spit back
on an exam that had no direct relevance

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
on an exam that had no direct relevance
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.180
on an exam that had no direct relevance
to anything that they could directly see

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
to anything that they could directly see
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549
to anything that they could directly see
or touch in some sense it was just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
or touch in some sense it was just
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.610
or touch in some sense it was just
abstract nonsense that they were forced

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
abstract nonsense that they were forced
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.310
abstract nonsense that they were forced
to memorize and the tragedy of that is

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320
to memorize and the tragedy of that is
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.060
to memorize and the tragedy of that is
when a young kid realizes that science

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070
when a young kid realizes that science
 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.719
when a young kid realizes that science
reveals the hidden underside of reality

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
reveals the hidden underside of reality
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.899
reveals the hidden underside of reality
and what it reveals is so exciting when

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
and what it reveals is so exciting when
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320

holes tell them about the Big Bang

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
holes tell them about the Big Bang
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840
holes tell them about the Big Bang
tell them about quantum mechanics and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
tell them about quantum mechanics and
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.940
tell them about quantum mechanics and
quantum tunneling how particles can go

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

thought possible I can't tell you the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
thought possible I can't tell you the
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.929
thought possible I can't tell you the
number of times kids will say to me that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
number of times kids will say to me that
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.580
number of times kids will say to me that
science that's cool and science needs to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
science that's cool and science needs to
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310
science that's cool and science needs to
have that experience for kids where it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
have that experience for kids where it
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.789
have that experience for kids where it
just grabs them as the most exciting

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
just grabs them as the most exciting
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490
just grabs them as the most exciting
dramatic story of discovery and if you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
dramatic story of discovery and if you
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.480
dramatic story of discovery and if you
have that experience as a young kid

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
have that experience as a young kid
 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.940
have that experience as a young kid
science is not a subject it's not a test

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
science is not a subject it's not a test
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.179
science is not a subject it's not a test
that you have to take science is your

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
that you have to take science is your
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.480
that you have to take science is your
ticket to understanding the world and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
ticket to understanding the world and
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490
ticket to understanding the world and
the universe and then it's with you for

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
the universe and then it's with you for
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.010
the universe and then it's with you for
life

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020
life
 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.780
life
if you can have that experience it

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790
if you can have that experience it
 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.450
if you can have that experience it
changes everything
