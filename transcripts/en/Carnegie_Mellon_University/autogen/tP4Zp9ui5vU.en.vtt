one thing you know I got a chance to
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.120
one thing you know I got a chance to
come here three or four months ago as

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
come here three or four months ago as
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.460
come here three or four months ago as
part of a tour that myself and a number

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470
part of a tour that myself and a number
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.840
part of a tour that myself and a number
of my colleagues did around the country

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850
of my colleagues did around the country
 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.789
of my colleagues did around the country
where we we engaged with with more than

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799
where we we engaged with with more than
 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.339
where we we engaged with with more than
130 top innovation organizations all

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349
130 top innovation organizations all
 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.500
130 top innovation organizations all
around the world and one thing I really

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
around the world and one thing I really
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.589
around the world and one thing I really
want to kind of emphasize in terms of

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599
want to kind of emphasize in terms of
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.059
want to kind of emphasize in terms of
what breakthrough is all about and in

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069
what breakthrough is all about and in
 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.620
what breakthrough is all about and in
terms of the partnerships that we can

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630
terms of the partnerships that we can
 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.530

form is when you know we had that you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540
form is when you know we had that you
 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.020
form is when you know we had that you
know big clean tech investment boom many

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
know big clean tech investment boom many
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.020
know big clean tech investment boom many
of you will remember

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
of you will remember
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.540
of you will remember
about a decade ago they kind of had a

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550
about a decade ago they kind of had a
 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.000
about a decade ago they kind of had a
bit of a crash and you know we're coming

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010
bit of a crash and you know we're coming
 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.290
bit of a crash and you know we're coming
back out of that right now in a pretty

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300
back out of that right now in a pretty
 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.210
back out of that right now in a pretty
exciting way but one thing I've noticed

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220
exciting way but one thing I've noticed
 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.270
exciting way but one thing I've noticed
is I think that people were encouraged

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280
is I think that people were encouraged
 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.890
is I think that people were encouraged
during those leaner years you know a

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
during those leaner years you know a
 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.930
during those leaner years you know a
couple three a few leaner years in there

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940
couple three a few leaner years in there
 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.280
couple three a few leaner years in there
where there wasn't a lot of venture

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290
where there wasn't a lot of venture
 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.840
where there wasn't a lot of venture
investment in the space to think a

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850
investment in the space to think a
 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.700
investment in the space to think a
little smaller and so if there's one

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710
little smaller and so if there's one
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.870
little smaller and so if there's one
thing I want you to take away from my

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880
thing I want you to take away from my
 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.540
thing I want you to take away from my
talk today is that in my mind it turns

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550
talk today is that in my mind it turns
 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.920
talk today is that in my mind it turns
over kicking with us it's time to think

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930
over kicking with us it's time to think
 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.659
over kicking with us it's time to think
big again and so I want to tell you

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669
big again and so I want to tell you
 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.770
big again and so I want to tell you
about some of the problems that we're

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
about some of the problems that we're
 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.330
about some of the problems that we're
really interested in but most

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340
really interested in but most
 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.740
really interested in but most
importantly we want you know I know many

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750
importantly we want you know I know many
 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.720
importantly we want you know I know many
of you have really big ideas and often

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730
of you have really big ideas and often
 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.920
of you have really big ideas and often
you can't get support for those ideas

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
you can't get support for those ideas
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.110
you can't get support for those ideas
those are the ideas that that we want to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120
those are the ideas that that we want to
 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.750
those are the ideas that that we want to
talk to you about a breakthrough

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760
talk to you about a breakthrough
 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.370
talk to you about a breakthrough
so to tee this up you know the way we

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380
so to tee this up you know the way we
 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.960
so to tee this up you know the way we
view this is that energy and climate are

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
view this is that energy and climate are
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.670
view this is that energy and climate are
the defining challenge of our time you

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680
the defining challenge of our time you
 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.040
the defining challenge of our time you
know they're about on the order of seven

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050
know they're about on the order of seven
 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.800
know they're about on the order of seven
billion people on earth today and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810
billion people on earth today and
 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.770
billion people on earth today and
interestingly almost six billion of

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780
interestingly almost six billion of
 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.820
interestingly almost six billion of
those people are in less developed

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
those people are in less developed
 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.040
those people are in less developed
countries countries that aren't they

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050
countries countries that aren't they
 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.360
countries countries that aren't they
don't have very high GDP that aren't

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370
don't have very high GDP that aren't
 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.270
don't have very high GDP that aren't
using a lot of energy by 2050 the UN

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280
using a lot of energy by 2050 the UN
 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800
using a lot of energy by 2050 the UN
projects that will have closer to ten

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810
projects that will have closer to ten
 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.530
projects that will have closer to ten
million people on this planet and all of

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540
million people on this planet and all of
 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.730
million people on this planet and all of
those two billion people we're going to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740
those two billion people we're going to
 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.130
those two billion people we're going to
add are going to be people in those less

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140
add are going to be people in those less
 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.170
add are going to be people in those less
developed countries and so we've got

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180
developed countries and so we've got
 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.420
developed countries and so we've got
about 33% more people coming on board

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
about 33% more people coming on board
 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.320
about 33% more people coming on board
between now and 2050 and if you look at

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
between now and 2050 and if you look at
 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.120
between now and 2050 and if you look at
the aspirations of those people to get

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130
the aspirations of those people to get
 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.490
the aspirations of those people to get
to kind of Human Development Index that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500
to kind of Human Development Index that
 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.219
to kind of Human Development Index that
that's that's up around what we see in

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229
that's that's up around what we see in
 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.930
that's that's up around what we see in
more developed countries they're gonna

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940
more developed countries they're gonna
 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.969
more developed countries they're gonna
have to increase their their energy

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979
have to increase their their energy
 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.620
have to increase their their energy
services that they're consuming on a per

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630
services that they're consuming on a per
 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.290
services that they're consuming on a per
capita basis by at least five times so

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300
capita basis by at least five times so
 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.650
capita basis by at least five times so
we have 33% more people all of those in

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660
we have 33% more people all of those in
 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.420
we have 33% more people all of those in
these less developed countries all those

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430
these less developed countries all those
 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.640
these less developed countries all those
people are looking for a 5x increase in

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650
people are looking for a 5x increase in
 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.159
people are looking for a 5x increase in
the amount of energy services and and

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169
the amount of energy services and and
 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.600
the amount of energy services and and
other resource services that they are

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610
other resource services that they are
 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.060
other resource services that they are
that they want to consume to live a life

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070
that they want to consume to live a life
 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.600
that they want to consume to live a life
that's I think that's at a par in terms

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610
that's I think that's at a par in terms
 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.180
that's I think that's at a par in terms
of quality of life with what many folks

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190
of quality of life with what many folks
 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.830
of quality of life with what many folks
in more developed countries have at the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840
in more developed countries have at the
 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.890
in more developed countries have at the
same time our greatest scientists are

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900
same time our greatest scientists are
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.300
same time our greatest scientists are
telling us well we need to be providing

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310
telling us well we need to be providing
 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.400
telling us well we need to be providing
so many more resources over the next 30

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410
so many more resources over the next 30
 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.770
so many more resources over the next 30
years the best scientists in the world

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780
years the best scientists in the world
 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.690
years the best scientists in the world
have made it clear to us now that we

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700
have made it clear to us now that we
 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.010
have made it clear to us now that we
need to reduce our greenhouse gas

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020
need to reduce our greenhouse gas
 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.610
need to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x
 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.070
emissions by at least 80 percent or 5x
over the next just over the next 30

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
over the next just over the next 30
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.399
over the next just over the next 30
years going to 2050 so to me this is our

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409
years going to 2050 so to me this is our
 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:21.749
years going to 2050 so to me this is our
finding challenge right we've got to

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759
finding challenge right we've got to
 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.939
finding challenge right we've got to
provide a lot more resources and

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949
provide a lot more resources and
 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.070
provide a lot more resources and
services to people so we can get the

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080
services to people so we can get the
 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.739
services to people so we can get the
global middle class growing and create

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749
global middle class growing and create
 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:31.290
global middle class growing and create
human wellbeing at the same time we've

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300
human wellbeing at the same time we've
 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.779
human wellbeing at the same time we've
got a 5x challenge in terms of reducing

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789
got a 5x challenge in terms of reducing
 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.790
got a 5x challenge in terms of reducing
our emissions so this is a huge

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800
our emissions so this is a huge
 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.309
our emissions so this is a huge
challenge a huge opportunity and the way

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319
challenge a huge opportunity and the way
 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.839
challenge a huge opportunity and the way
I like to frame this up is in the

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849
I like to frame this up is in the
 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.169
I like to frame this up is in the
context of a 70 Gigaton per year

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:43.179
context of a 70 Gigaton per year
 

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.439
context of a 70 Gigaton per year
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if
 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.790
greenhouse gas emissions gap and so if
you look at just about where we are

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800
you look at just about where we are
 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.859
you look at just about where we are
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:49.869
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per
 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.799
today we're at about 50 Giga tons per
year of emissions and if you look at all

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:52.809
year of emissions and if you look at all
 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.489
year of emissions and if you look at all
of the projections for where we might go

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:55.499
of the projections for where we might go
 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.290
of the projections for where we might go
the middle case projection which i think

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300
the middle case projection which i think
 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.629
the middle case projection which i think
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at
 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.119
is a little bit unoptimized ik is at
about 80 and so if you look at that

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:03.129
about 80 and so if you look at that
 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.329
about 80 and so if you look at that
future where we may be headed versus

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:06.339
future where we may be headed versus
 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:08.729
future where we may be headed versus
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:08.739
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga
 

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:11.749
where we need to go to there's a 70 Giga
ton gap which is pretty significant and

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759
ton gap which is pretty significant and
 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.759
ton gap which is pretty significant and
the way that we view this is that we're

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:14.769
the way that we view this is that we're
 

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:15.899
the way that we view this is that we're
quite optimistic there are a lot of

a number of others so this is truly a
 

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.179
a number of others so this is truly a
global group and I actually did the

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:25.189
global group and I actually did the
 

00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:27.730
global group and I actually did the
rough calculation yesterday this group

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:27.740
rough calculation yesterday this group
 

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.879
rough calculation yesterday this group
represents on the order of 500 billion

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:30.889
represents on the order of 500 billion
 

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:32.980
represents on the order of 500 billion
dollars of net worth and so these kind

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:32.990
dollars of net worth and so these kind
 

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.540
dollars of net worth and so these kind
of people taking this problem seriously

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:34.550
of people taking this problem seriously
 

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.759
of people taking this problem seriously
and putting real money into it is a big

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:36.769
and putting real money into it is a big
 

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:39.309
and putting real money into it is a big
deal and and so breakthrough energy

00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:39.319
deal and and so breakthrough energy
 

00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:40.840
deal and and so breakthrough energy
ventures was launched at the beginning

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.610
of 2017 with a led by these investors
and there are a few things are a little

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.620
and there are a few things are a little
 

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.110

what we're doing compared to what's been
 

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.710
what we're doing compared to what's been
done in the past the the first I'd say

so this isn't a ten-year fund like we're

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:11.860
so this isn't a ten-year fund like we're
 

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.990
so this isn't a ten-year fund like we're
used to in venture capital this is a

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000
used to in venture capital this is a
 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.390
used to in venture capital this is a
20-year fund so we have the ability to

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:15.400
20-year fund so we have the ability to
 

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.450
20-year fund so we have the ability to
build companies over the long haul to

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.460
build companies over the long haul to
 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.800
build companies over the long haul to
build incredibly valuable companies

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:19.810
build incredibly valuable companies
 

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.690
build incredibly valuable companies
we're not constrained by that that kind

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:21.700
we're not constrained by that that kind
 

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.660
we're not constrained by that that kind
of short window that I think is hurt

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.670
of short window that I think is hurt
 

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.010
of short window that I think is hurt
hurt the venture industry as it relates

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.020
hurt the venture industry as it relates
 

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.769
hurt the venture industry as it relates
to clean tech in the in the 1.0 boom

00:11:28.769 --> 00:11:28.779
to clean tech in the in the 1.0 boom
 

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:30.720
to clean tech in the in the 1.0 boom
we're also taking a different approach

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.730
we're also taking a different approach
 

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.579
we're also taking a different approach
in terms of team building we have about

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:32.589
in terms of team building we have about
 

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:35.940
in terms of team building we have about
20 people on board now who have a very

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:35.950
20 people on board now who have a very
 

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.910
20 people on board now who have a very
broad spectrum of expertise all the way

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920
broad spectrum of expertise all the way
 

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.470
broad spectrum of expertise all the way
from investors and entrepreneurs and

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480
from investors and entrepreneurs and
 

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.170
from investors and entrepreneurs and
company builders to people who have

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:43.180
company builders to people who have
 

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.000
company builders to people who have
government experience policy experience

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.010
government experience policy experience
 

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.160
government experience policy experience
people who are scientists and

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.170
people who are scientists and
 

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.480
people who are scientists and
technologists and engineers and folks

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.490
technologists and engineers and folks
 

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.190
technologists and engineers and folks
from industry and so we have a very

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200
from industry and so we have a very
 

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.570
from industry and so we have a very
different view in terms of assessing

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:51.580
different view in terms of assessing
 

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.010
different view in terms of assessing
companies and in terms of helping those

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.020
companies and in terms of helping those
 

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.500
companies and in terms of helping those
companies succeed when they go forward

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.510
companies succeed when they go forward
 

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.699
companies succeed when they go forward
I'd say the most significant element of

00:11:59.699 --> 00:11:59.709
I'd say the most significant element of
 

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:01.199
I'd say the most significant element of
this fund is that it is exclusively

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:01.209
this fund is that it is exclusively
 

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:04.890
this fund is that it is exclusively
focused on backing companies that are

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:04.900
focused on backing companies that are
 

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.810
focused on backing companies that are
working on solutions that have

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:06.820
working on solutions that have
 

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.280
working on solutions that have
entitlement who have that have

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.290
entitlement who have that have
 

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.199
entitlement who have that have
possibility to have a huge impact on

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:10.209
possibility to have a huge impact on
 

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.620
possibility to have a huge impact on
greenhouse gas emissions and the the

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:13.630
greenhouse gas emissions and the the
 

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.840
greenhouse gas emissions and the the
filter or the the bogey that we're

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:15.850
filter or the the bogey that we're
 

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.800
filter or the the bogey that we're
putting out there is that we're

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:16.810
putting out there is that we're
 

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.840
putting out there is that we're
interested in companies that are

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:18.850
interested in companies that are
 

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.310
interested in companies that are
developing solutions or sets of

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320
developing solutions or sets of
 

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.590
developing solutions or sets of
solutions that if fully deployed in 2050

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600
solutions that if fully deployed in 2050
 

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.570
solutions that if fully deployed in 2050
could have at least half a Giga ton of

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:24.580
could have at least half a Giga ton of
 

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.690
could have at least half a Giga ton of
impact on reducing greenhouse gas

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:27.700
impact on reducing greenhouse gas
 

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.360
impact on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and that's about 1% of today's

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.370
emissions and that's about 1% of today's
 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.690
emissions and that's about 1% of today's
of today's emissions and so from our

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:33.700
of today's emissions and so from our
 

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.579
of today's emissions and so from our
perspective that's the the opportunity

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:35.589
perspective that's the the opportunity
 

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:39.000
perspective that's the the opportunity
to challenge the partnership that we

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.010
to challenge the partnership that we
 

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.829
to challenge the partnership that we
want to put forward to you and other

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839
want to put forward to you and other
 

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.930
want to put forward to you and other
innovators all around the world is one

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:42.940
innovators all around the world is one
 

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.530
innovators all around the world is one
of those half Giga ton impact problems

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.540
of those half Giga ton impact problems
 

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.140
of those half Giga ton impact problems
and what are your ideas to build great

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.150
and what are your ideas to build great
 

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.760
and what are your ideas to build great
companies around those and we call this

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:50.770
companies around those and we call this
 

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.940
companies around those and we call this
the half Giga ton year challenge and so

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:53.950
the half Giga ton year challenge and so
 

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.710
the half Giga ton year challenge and so
what you just kind of abstract what's

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720
what you just kind of abstract what's
 

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.680
what you just kind of abstract what's
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:58.690
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to
 

00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.970
half a Giga ton right and so I wanted to
kind of frame it up for you

00:12:59.970 --> 00:12:59.980
kind of frame it up for you
 

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.179
kind of frame it up for you
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:03.189
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts
 

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:09.660
half a Giga ton is about 250 gigawatts
of wind or solar replacing call or about

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:09.670
of wind or solar replacing call or about
 

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.609
of wind or solar replacing call or about
50 billion gallons per year of zero

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:11.619
50 billion gallons per year of zero
 

00:13:11.619 --> 00:13:13.530
50 billion gallons per year of zero
carbon transport fuels like like second

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:13.540
carbon transport fuels like like second
 

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.479
carbon transport fuels like like second
generation biofuels so this kind of

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:15.489
generation biofuels so this kind of
 

00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:18.030
generation biofuels so this kind of
frames up how big we're talking here and

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040
frames up how big we're talking here and
 

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.849
frames up how big we're talking here and
to put that in comparison 2016 over the

00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:20.859
to put that in comparison 2016 over the
 

00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:23.039
to put that in comparison 2016 over the
history of mankind we deployed about 500

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:23.049
history of mankind we deployed about 500
 

00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:26.069
history of mankind we deployed about 500
gigawatts of wind power about twice that

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079
gigawatts of wind power about twice that
 

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:28.679
gigawatts of wind power about twice that
half gig at time and then if you look at

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:28.689
half gig at time and then if you look at
 

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:30.539
half gig at time and then if you look at
how you know the 50 billion gallons is

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:30.549
how you know the 50 billion gallons is
 

00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:32.400
how you know the 50 billion gallons is
about a third of all of us gasoline

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.410
about a third of all of us gasoline
 

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.829
about a third of all of us gasoline
demand today so you know a half a Giga

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839
demand today so you know a half a Giga
 

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:37.769
demand today so you know a half a Giga
ton win is is a really just put it in

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:37.779
ton win is is a really just put it in
 

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:39.239
ton win is is a really just put it in
perspective is it really it's a high bar

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:39.249
perspective is it really it's a high bar
 

00:13:39.249 --> 00:13:41.159
perspective is it really it's a high bar
there aren't a huge number of problems

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:41.169
there aren't a huge number of problems
 

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:43.409
there aren't a huge number of problems
that if you solve them our half Giga ton

00:13:43.409 --> 00:13:43.419
that if you solve them our half Giga ton
 

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:44.429
that if you solve them our half Giga ton
kind of problems but those are the

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:44.439
kind of problems but those are the
 

00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:45.989
kind of problems but those are the
problems we're interested in and in

00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:45.999
problems we're interested in and in
 

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:48.869
problems we're interested in and in
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:48.879
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I
 

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:50.970
terms of this 70 Giga ton per year gap I
wanted to also frame up the economic

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:50.980
wanted to also frame up the economic
 

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.159
wanted to also frame up the economic
opportunity and I was trying to think of

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:53.169
opportunity and I was trying to think of
 

00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:54.960
opportunity and I was trying to think of
a good comparison about you know how

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:54.970
a good comparison about you know how
 

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.419
a good comparison about you know how
many large companies are likely to be

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:57.429
many large companies are likely to be
 

00:13:57.429 --> 00:14:00.960
many large companies are likely to be
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:00.970
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton
 

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.970
formed if we succeed in this 70 Giga ton
gap closing and so I looked at Exxon

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:02.980
gap closing and so I looked at Exxon
 

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.919
gap closing and so I looked at Exxon
Mobil if you look at their amount of

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:04.929
Mobil if you look at their amount of
 

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:06.869
Mobil if you look at their amount of
production of fossil fuels it was about

00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:06.879
production of fossil fuels it was about
 

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:09.509
production of fossil fuels it was about
0.6 around a half a Giga ton per year

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519
0.6 around a half a Giga ton per year
 

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:11.759
0.6 around a half a Giga ton per year
last year and that company's worth about

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:11.769
last year and that company's worth about
 

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:14.220
last year and that company's worth about
80 billion dollars and so if you take

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.230
80 billion dollars and so if you take
 

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.889
80 billion dollars and so if you take
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:16.899
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's
 

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:19.650
about just say 70 Giga tons so there's
140 your seventy divided by 0.5 half

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:19.660
140 your seventy divided by 0.5 half
 

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.169
140 your seventy divided by 0.5 half
Aggie ton more than a hundred Exxon

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:22.179
Aggie ton more than a hundred Exxon
 

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:24.449
Aggie ton more than a hundred Exxon
Mobil kind of economic opportunities are

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:24.459
Mobil kind of economic opportunities are
 

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.579
Mobil kind of economic opportunities are
on the table out to 2050 so this is a

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:26.589
on the table out to 2050 so this is a
 

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:29.189
on the table out to 2050 so this is a
big huge opportunity so that's why we

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199
big huge opportunity so that's why we
 

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:30.389
big huge opportunity so that's why we
think we can create a huge impact but

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399
think we can create a huge impact but
 

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.329
think we can create a huge impact but
also create huge companies by doing what

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:33.339
also create huge companies by doing what
 

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.409
also create huge companies by doing what
we're looking to do at breakthrough

00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:34.419
we're looking to do at breakthrough
 

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:36.989
we're looking to do at breakthrough
energy ventures so I wanted to frame it

00:14:36.989 --> 00:14:36.999
energy ventures so I wanted to frame it
 

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:38.429
energy ventures so I wanted to frame it
up you know that we were trying to think

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:38.439
up you know that we were trying to think
 

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:39.689
up you know that we were trying to think
a little bit differently you know there

there were some successes but a lot of
failures in clean tech 11.0 so we've

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:44.289
failures in clean tech 11.0 so we've
 

00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:45.869
failures in clean tech 11.0 so we've
been trying to think hard about how are

00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:45.879
been trying to think hard about how are
 

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.460

at where it can go we think can go a lot
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.470
at where it can go we think can go a lot
lower so we're very bullish about where

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480
lower so we're very bullish about where
 

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.930

developed there is been on its own kind
of exponential learning curve and that's

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:01.060
of exponential learning curve and that's
 

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.100
of exponential learning curve and that's
something that we're paying a lot of

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.110
something that we're paying a lot of
 

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.890
something that we're paying a lot of
attention to distributed and modular

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:04.900
attention to distributed and modular
 

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.670
attention to distributed and modular
everything and the Internet of Things so

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:07.680
everything and the Internet of Things so
 

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.020

one of the big challenges that I saw in

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.030
one of the big challenges that I saw in
 

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.670
one of the big challenges that I saw in
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.680
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go
 

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.670
clean tech 1.0 is when you had to go
build these really big plants and you

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:14.680
build these really big plants and you
 

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.410
build these really big plants and you
know let's say a biofuels plant you put

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:16.420
know let's say a biofuels plant you put
 

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.670
know let's say a biofuels plant you put
a bunch of money a new company you do

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:17.680
a bunch of money a new company you do
 

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.710
a bunch of money a new company you do
the science you do the engineering it

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720
the science you do the engineering it
 

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.090
the science you do the engineering it
looks like it works then you go build a

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.100
looks like it works then you go build a
 

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.340
looks like it works then you go build a
pilot then you go build a demo then you

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:23.350
pilot then you go build a demo then you
 

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.260
pilot then you go build a demo then you
build a first commercial and none of

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.270
build a first commercial and none of
 

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.579
build a first commercial and none of
those are profitable

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:26.589
those are profitable
 

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.860
those are profitable
that is a lot of risk to take on and so

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:28.870
that is a lot of risk to take on and so
 

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.480
that is a lot of risk to take on and so
one thing that we're particularly

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.490
one thing that we're particularly
 

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.860
one thing that we're particularly
interested in is investing in

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:31.870
interested in is investing in
 

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.960
interested in is investing in

PBA's we are being told that people
 

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.560
PBA's we are being told that people
expect to see some of the first 1 cent

north america coming up soon and you
 

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.190
north america coming up soon and you
know we it's slowing but we see this

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200
know we it's slowing but we see this
 

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.770
know we it's slowing but we see this
continuing to move so what are the

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:40.780
continuing to move so what are the
 

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.630
continuing to move so what are the
opportunities and challenges that you

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640
opportunities and challenges that you
 

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.400
opportunities and challenges that you
get when you can when you are in a world

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.410
get when you can when you are in a world
 

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.280

factor wind and solar and so one of the

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760
factor wind and solar and so one of the
 

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.050
factor wind and solar and so one of the
areas that we're really interested in is

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:54.060
areas that we're really interested in is
 

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.810
areas that we're really interested in is
in ultra long duration grid storage so

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:57.820
in ultra long duration grid storage so
 

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.610
in ultra long duration grid storage so
this is as you're getting higher and

00:20:59.610 --> 00:20:59.620
this is as you're getting higher and
 

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.590
this is as you're getting higher and
higher penetrations of wind and solar

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600
higher penetrations of wind and solar
 

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.660
higher penetrations of wind and solar
you know what are the challenges you get

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.670
you know what are the challenges you get
 

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.070
you know what are the challenges you get
is that these are bidding into the

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080
is that these are bidding into the
 

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.780
is that these are bidding into the
market when they're available right and

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:06.790
market when they're available right and
 

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.420
market when they're available right and
so essentially they bid in at zero

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:09.430
so essentially they bid in at zero
 

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.130
so essentially they bid in at zero
because they have no marginal cost no

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.140
because they have no marginal cost no
 

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.170
because they have no marginal cost no
fuel costs and so as you bid in more and

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:13.180
fuel costs and so as you bid in more and
 

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.660
fuel costs and so as you bid in more and
more you where you're you know if you're

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:15.670
more you where you're you know if you're
 

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.310
more you where you're you know if you're
a solar plant and you're bidding in the

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320
a solar plant and you're bidding in the
 

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.240
a solar plant and you're bidding in the
middle of the day the more and more

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.250
middle of the day the more and more
 

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.740
middle of the day the more and more
solar there is the lower the price is

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:19.750
solar there is the lower the price is
 

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.410
solar there is the lower the price is
getting there's a bit of a falling knife

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:22.420
getting there's a bit of a falling knife
 

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.120
getting there's a bit of a falling knife
problem I think that when you get to

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.130
problem I think that when you get to
 

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.500
problem I think that when you get to
higher and higher penetrations of wind

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:25.510
higher and higher penetrations of wind
 

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.270
higher and higher penetrations of wind
and solar the price that you're gonna

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280
and solar the price that you're gonna
 

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.950
and solar the price that you're gonna
get paid is getting lower and lower

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960
get paid is getting lower and lower
 

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.570
get paid is getting lower and lower
lower and you're kind of chasing that

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:30.580
lower and you're kind of chasing that
 

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.510
lower and you're kind of chasing that
cost curve and so you need other

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520
cost curve and so you need other
 

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.940
cost curve and so you need other
technologies in our view like grid

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:35.950
technologies in our view like grid
 

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.490
technologies in our view like grid
storage to help ameliorate the the

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:38.500
storage to help ameliorate the the
 

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.200
storage to help ameliorate the the
issues that you face around getting

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.210
issues that you face around getting
 

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.960
issues that you face around getting
really high penetrations of wind and

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:42.970
really high penetrations of wind and
 

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.830
really high penetrations of wind and
solar that you're going to need to

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840
solar that you're going to need to
 

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.820
solar that you're going to need to
dramatically decarbonize the grid and so

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:46.830
dramatically decarbonize the grid and so
 

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.320
dramatically decarbonize the grid and so
lithium ion is going coming down so fast

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:51.330
lithium ion is going coming down so fast
 

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.330
lithium ion is going coming down so fast
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a
 

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.130
we've done a lot of analysis Jays done a
lot of analysis in this area but you

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140
lot of analysis in this area but you
 

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.990
lot of analysis in this area but you
know when we talked to experts they say

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000
know when we talked to experts they say
 

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.060
know when we talked to experts they say
10 years from now they wouldn't be

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.070
10 years from now they wouldn't be
 

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.940
10 years from now they wouldn't be
shocked if a fully installed grid

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:01.950
shocked if a fully installed grid
 

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.519
shocked if a fully installed grid
storage plant with lithium ion is $150

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:04.529
storage plant with lithium ion is $150
 

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:06.350
storage plant with lithium ion is $150
per kilowatt hour and they definitely

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360
per kilowatt hour and they definitely
 

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.690
per kilowatt hour and they definitely
wouldn't completely bet against it being

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700
wouldn't completely bet against it being
 

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.000
wouldn't completely bet against it being
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.010
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more
 

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.799
at $100 per kilowatt hour and we're more
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:12.809
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour
 

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:15.500
like at about $500 per kilowatt hour
today and so you know that is low enough

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.510
today and so you know that is low enough
 

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.289
today and so you know that is low enough
to cover multiple hours right so let's

00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299
to cover multiple hours right so let's
 

00:22:18.299 --> 00:22:20.510
to cover multiple hours right so let's
say five six seven eight hours that you

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520
say five six seven eight hours that you
 

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.100
say five six seven eight hours that you
might need to provide some buffering of

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:24.110
might need to provide some buffering of
 

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.500
might need to provide some buffering of
renewable power provide some firming and

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:27.510
renewable power provide some firming and
 

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.210
renewable power provide some firming and
so I'd say on one hand were very

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220
so I'd say on one hand were very
 

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.789
so I'd say on one hand were very
interested in any technology solution

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799
interested in any technology solution
 

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.399
interested in any technology solution
that can get below that about $100 per

00:22:34.399 --> 00:22:34.409
that can get below that about $100 per
 

00:22:34.409 --> 00:22:36.769
that can get below that about $100 per
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:36.779
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to
 

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:38.750
kilowatt hour any solutions that come to
us that are higher than that we think

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760
us that are higher than that we think
 

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.720
us that are higher than that we think
it's probably a big gamble in terms of

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:41.730
it's probably a big gamble in terms of
 

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.700
it's probably a big gamble in terms of
where we see with the amaya I'm going so

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:43.710
where we see with the amaya I'm going so
 

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.460
where we see with the amaya I'm going so
that's kind of a floor so it we're

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:46.470
that's kind of a floor so it we're
 

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.110
that's kind of a floor so it we're
interested in things that are below $100

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120
interested in things that are below $100
 

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.980
interested in things that are below $100
for kilowatt hour that have that

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:48.990
for kilowatt hour that have that
 

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.450
for kilowatt hour that have that
entitlement five to ten years from now

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460
entitlement five to ten years from now
 

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.659
entitlement five to ten years from now
but I'd say something that we aren't

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:53.669
but I'd say something that we aren't
 

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:54.889
but I'd say something that we aren't
seeing a lot of people think about that

00:22:54.889 --> 00:22:54.899
seeing a lot of people think about that
 

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:56.000
seeing a lot of people think about that
we're thinking about and this is a bit

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.010
we're thinking about and this is a bit
 

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.029
we're thinking about and this is a bit
of a noisy chart but you know you can

00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039
of a noisy chart but you know you can
 

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.950
of a noisy chart but you know you can
see lithium ion and the blue there where

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960
see lithium ion and the blue there where
 

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.630
see lithium ion and the blue there where
we think this is a the duration of

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640
we think this is a the duration of
 

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.060
we think this is a the duration of
storage versus the installed cost of

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.070
storage versus the installed cost of
 

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.220
storage versus the installed cost of
capital cost upfront $1.00 per kilowatt

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:07.230
capital cost upfront $1.00 per kilowatt
 

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.399
capital cost upfront $1.00 per kilowatt
hour and when you get to higher and

00:23:10.399 --> 00:23:10.409
hour and when you get to higher and
 

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:12.740
hour and when you get to higher and
higher penetrations a big opportunity we

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:12.750
higher penetrations a big opportunity we
 

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.110
higher penetrations a big opportunity we
see are kind of two use cases that would

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120
see are kind of two use cases that would
 

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.750
see are kind of two use cases that would
be in the like hundreds to thousands of

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760
be in the like hundreds to thousands of
 

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.940
be in the like hundreds to thousands of
hours not just you know five to ten

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:19.950
hours not just you know five to ten
 

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.970
hours not just you know five to ten
hours but what that means is that these

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980
hours but what that means is that these
 

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.799
hours but what that means is that these
are these applications you know are

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:24.809
are these applications you know are
 

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:27.470
are these applications you know are
needed let's say for let's say if you

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480
needed let's say for let's say if you
 

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.139

prices that it could get in terms like a
 

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.149
prices that it could get in terms like a
base load asset but in order to do that

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159
base load asset but in order to do that
 

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:39.740
base load asset but in order to do that
you need something that's on the order

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:39.750
you need something that's on the order
 

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.279
you need something that's on the order
of $20 per kilowatt hour and then when

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:43.289
of $20 per kilowatt hour and then when
 

00:23:43.289 --> 00:23:44.870
of $20 per kilowatt hour and then when
you get to really high penetrations of

you get to really high penetrations of
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.870
you get to really high penetrations of

are moving in that direction that you
actually have this seasonal imbalance

00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860
actually have this seasonal imbalance
 

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.430
actually have this seasonal imbalance
right like the the amount of Sun that

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440
right like the the amount of Sun that
 

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.370
right like the the amount of Sun that
you get on an average day in Germany and

you get on an average day in Germany and
 

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.700
you get on an average day in Germany and
higher

in the winter than it is in the summer
 

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:09.710
in the winter than it is in the summer
so you need to find ways to buffer

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720
so you need to find ways to buffer
 

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.740
so you need to find ways to buffer
energy over over months you know over a

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:12.750
energy over over months you know over a
 

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.769
energy over over months you know over a
thousand hours and so the when you're

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:15.779
thousand hours and so the when you're
 

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:17.299
thousand hours and so the when you're
looking at the kind of base load

00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:17.309
looking at the kind of base load
 

00:24:17.309 --> 00:24:19.580

renewables case you need about something

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:19.590
renewables case you need about something
 

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.580
renewables case you need about something
like 20 cycles a year not a daily cycle

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:22.590
like 20 cycles a year not a daily cycle
 

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.169
like 20 cycles a year not a daily cycle
but something like 20 deep cycles a year

00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179
but something like 20 deep cycles a year
 

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:25.760
but something like 20 deep cycles a year
and you need to get down to about like I

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:25.770
and you need to get down to about like I
 

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.169
and you need to get down to about like I
said $20 per kilowatt or if you want to

00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179
said $20 per kilowatt or if you want to
 

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:28.730
said $20 per kilowatt or if you want to
do that seasonal you need to get into

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740
do that seasonal you need to get into
 

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.889
do that seasonal you need to get into
the realm of like $1 per kilowatt hour

00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:30.899
the realm of like $1 per kilowatt hour
 

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:32.750
the realm of like $1 per kilowatt hour
and so when we've been out talking to

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760
and so when we've been out talking to
 

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.130
and so when we've been out talking to
the community this is a use case that a

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140
the community this is a use case that a
 

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.419
the community this is a use case that a
lot of people hadn't thought of and

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:35.429
lot of people hadn't thought of and
 

00:24:35.429 --> 00:24:37.760
lot of people hadn't thought of and
basically what it means is there are an

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:37.770
basically what it means is there are an
 

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.399
basically what it means is there are an
extremely limited set of materials that

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:40.409
extremely limited set of materials that
 

00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:44.029
extremely limited set of materials that
are cheap enough to even go $20 per hour

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039
are cheap enough to even go $20 per hour
 

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:46.250
are cheap enough to even go $20 per hour
or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so you

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260
or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so you
 

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.690
or $1.00 per kilowatt hour and so you
end up having to try to figure out

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700
end up having to try to figure out
 

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.820
end up having to try to figure out

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.450
cost materials and make a storage system
 

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.350
cost materials and make a storage system
that can be at that kind of cost and

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
that can be at that kind of cost and
 

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.060
that can be at that kind of cost and
what's also interesting is it really

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.070
what's also interesting is it really
 

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.440
what's also interesting is it really

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:01.850
internal and so you know geothermal has
been really niche right it's like a

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860
been really niche right it's like a
 

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.180
been really niche right it's like a
couple gigawatts it's you know 1% or

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:05.190
couple gigawatts it's you know 1% or

if you look at most projections almost

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:09.750
if you look at most projections almost
 

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.419
if you look at most projections almost
all projections it's there for the next

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:11.429
all projections it's there for the next
 

00:26:11.429 --> 00:26:14.539
all projections it's there for the next
3040 years out to 2050 but when you look

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:14.549
3040 years out to 2050 but when you look
 

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:18.500
3040 years out to 2050 but when you look
at when you look at the shale boom

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:18.510
at when you look at the shale boom
 

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.440
at when you look at the shale boom
there were projections at do-e of where

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:21.450
there were projections at do-e of where
 

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.970
there were projections at do-e of where
natural gas production would go and when

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980
natural gas production would go and when
 

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.940
natural gas production would go and when
shale came in it diverged exponentially

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:25.950
shale came in it diverged exponentially
 

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.800
shale came in it diverged exponentially
and so we think there's a really

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:27.810
and so we think there's a really
 

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.690
and so we think there's a really

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:46.800
the oil and gas industry that's moving
 

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.230

on an exponential curve into the

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240
on an exponential curve into the
 

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.420
on an exponential curve into the
geothermal space and we're working with

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:50.430
geothermal space and we're working with
 

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.560
geothermal space and we're working with
some innovators in this area we actually

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:51.570
some innovators in this area we actually
 

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.840
some innovators in this area we actually
think this there's a real shot that this

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:53.850
think this there's a real shot that this
 

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.300
think this there's a real shot that this
could be a game-changer that rides that

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:56.310
could be a game-changer that rides that
 

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.670
could be a game-changer that rides that

curve in terms of transportation big you
know actually interesting is about 15

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740
know actually interesting is about 15
 

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.020
know actually interesting is about 15
percent of global greenhouse gas

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.030
percent of global greenhouse gas
 

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.550
percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions which is kind of low as a

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:07.560
emissions which is kind of low as a
 

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.500
emissions which is kind of low as a
sector but that's gonna go up like crazy

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.510
sector but that's gonna go up like crazy
 

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.250

as the rest of the world adopts

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:12.260
as the rest of the world adopts
 

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.240

automotive automobiles everyone starts

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.250
automotive automobiles everyone starts
 

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.310
automotive automobiles everyone starts
buying cars all around the world and so

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320
buying cars all around the world and so
 

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.750
buying cars all around the world and so
we've done a lot of analysis here as I

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760
we've done a lot of analysis here as I
 

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.150
we've done a lot of analysis here as I
mentioned we're quite bullish in our

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:20.160
mentioned we're quite bullish in our
 

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.670
mentioned we're quite bullish in our
kind of internal analysis on the rate of

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:22.680
kind of internal analysis on the rate of
 

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.250
kind of internal analysis on the rate of
deployment of electrified vehicles and

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260
deployment of electrified vehicles and
 

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.080
deployment of electrified vehicles and
so we tend to agree more with these

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.090
so we tend to agree more with these
 

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.750
so we tend to agree more with these
these kind of higher projections here

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760
these kind of higher projections here
 

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.060
these kind of higher projections here
that at about 2030 gets you to about 20

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.070
that at about 2030 gets you to about 20
 

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.490
that at about 2030 gets you to about 20
million new evie sales light duty

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500
million new evie sales light duty
 

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.150
million new evie sales light duty
vehicle sales per year and so what we

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:38.160
vehicle sales per year and so what we
 

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.980
vehicle sales per year and so what we
started thinking about is well you know

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:39.990
started thinking about is well you know
 

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.810
started thinking about is well you know
let's not think too near-term you know

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820
let's not think too near-term you know
 

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.890
let's not think too near-term you know
there are definitely challenges for this

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900
there are definitely challenges for this
 

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.030
there are definitely challenges for this
industry in the near term there are a

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:44.040
industry in the near term there are a
 

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.010
industry in the near term there are a
lot of companies getting after those but

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020
lot of companies getting after those but
 

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.260
lot of companies getting after those but
in terms of you know what are the things

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.270
in terms of you know what are the things
 

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.210
in terms of you know what are the things
that could slow this down right in five

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220
that could slow this down right in five
 

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.040
that could slow this down right in five
years 10 years 15 years what are the

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.050
years 10 years 15 years what are the
 

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.900
years 10 years 15 years what are the
things that when you do your analysis

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:53.910
things that when you do your analysis
 

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.180
things that when you do your analysis
and you think forward could turn this

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.190
and you think forward could turn this
 

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.940
and you think forward could turn this
exponential into a into and do an

00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:58.950
exponential into a into and do an
 

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.760
exponential into a into and do an
up-and-down or a long flat flat part and

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:01.770
up-and-down or a long flat flat part and
 

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.320
up-and-down or a long flat flat part and
so we've been looking at both the

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:03.330
so we've been looking at both the
 

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.860
so we've been looking at both the
downstream so you know what kind of

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:06.870
downstream so you know what kind of
 

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.970
downstream so you know what kind of
charging infrastructure what kind of

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980
charging infrastructure what kind of
 

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.500
charging infrastructure what kind of
charging rates are people going to need

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:09.510
charging rates are people going to need
 

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.600
charging rates are people going to need
to get like to get all those different

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:11.610
to get like to get all those different
 

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.070
to get like to get all those different
segments of people be willing to adopt

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080
segments of people be willing to adopt
 

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.550
segments of people be willing to adopt
v's what kind of what kind of what kind

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:16.560
v's what kind of what kind of what kind
 

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.430
v's what kind of what kind of what kind
of a range are you gonna need you know

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440
of a range are you gonna need you know
 

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.750
of a range are you gonna need you know
increasing the range increasing the

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760
increasing the range increasing the
 

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.460
increasing the range increasing the
charging rate but then the other thing

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:22.470
charging rate but then the other thing
 

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.280
charging rate but then the other thing
we look at is upstream and so when an

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:25.290
we look at is upstream and so when an
 

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.750
we look at is upstream and so when an
industry is moving this fast it can

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760
industry is moving this fast it can
 

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.669
industry is moving this fast it can
often be limited by the availability of

00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679
often be limited by the availability of
 

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:30.419
often be limited by the availability of
the fundamental materials

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:30.429
the fundamental materials
 

00:28:30.429 --> 00:28:31.889
the fundamental materials
go into the thing and so we've

00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:31.899
go into the thing and so we've
 

00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:33.960
go into the thing and so we've
identified both cobalt and lithium as

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:33.970
identified both cobalt and lithium as
 

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.930
identified both cobalt and lithium as
two essential elements that that could

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:36.940
two essential elements that that could
 

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.489
two essential elements that that could
end up being a bottleneck for the growth

00:28:38.489 --> 00:28:38.499
end up being a bottleneck for the growth
 

00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:41.580
end up being a bottleneck for the growth
of this industry and so to look at just

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:41.590
of this industry and so to look at just
 

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.139
of this industry and so to look at just
one of those lights which I say is the

00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:43.149
one of those lights which I say is the
 

00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:45.980
one of those lights which I say is the
more severe is cobalt if you look at a

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:45.990
more severe is cobalt if you look at a
 

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.730
more severe is cobalt if you look at a
projection where you're at about 20

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:47.740
projection where you're at about 20
 

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.609
projection where you're at about 20
million EVs per year in that 2030 time

00:28:50.609 --> 00:28:50.619
million EVs per year in that 2030 time
 

00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:52.139
million EVs per year in that 2030 time
frame it's pretty shocking what happens

00:28:52.139 --> 00:28:52.149
frame it's pretty shocking what happens
 

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:54.359
frame it's pretty shocking what happens
in terms of cobalt demand it goes from

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:54.369
in terms of cobalt demand it goes from
 

00:28:54.369 --> 00:28:56.430
in terms of cobalt demand it goes from
this kind of $100 per kiloton level

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440
this kind of $100 per kiloton level
 

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.080
this kind of $100 per kiloton level
that's been reasonably flat for a number

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.090
that's been reasonably flat for a number
 

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.049
that's been reasonably flat for a number
of years and to up to 400 or more

00:29:01.049 --> 00:29:01.059
of years and to up to 400 or more
 

00:29:01.059 --> 00:29:04.470
of years and to up to 400 or more
kilotons per year of demand and so any

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480
kilotons per year of demand and so any
 

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.029
kilotons per year of demand and so any
of you that are familiar with with kind

00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:06.039
of you that are familiar with with kind
 

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:09.749
of you that are familiar with with kind
of mineral or mining ore or metals kind

00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:09.759
of mineral or mining ore or metals kind
 

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:12.629
of mineral or mining ore or metals kind
of industries a 4x over 10 years or so

00:29:12.629 --> 00:29:12.639
of industries a 4x over 10 years or so
 

00:29:12.639 --> 00:29:14.850
of industries a 4x over 10 years or so
is huge you know it's it's really hard

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:14.860
is huge you know it's it's really hard
 

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.619
is huge you know it's it's really hard
to deal with and particularly

00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:16.629
to deal with and particularly
 

00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:19.830
to deal with and particularly
interesting as we've dug in is almost

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840
interesting as we've dug in is almost
 

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.930
interesting as we've dug in is almost
all of the supply up to that up to now

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:21.940
all of the supply up to that up to now
 

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.029
all of the supply up to that up to now
up to about the 100 kilotons has been as

00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039
up to about the 100 kilotons has been as
 

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:26.460
up to about the 100 kilotons has been as
a byproduct of other mining so you got

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.470
a byproduct of other mining so you got
 

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.019
a byproduct of other mining so you got
big copper mines you got big nickel

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:28.029
big copper mines you got big nickel
 

00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:29.700
big copper mines you got big nickel
mines and they just kind of Slough this

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:29.710
mines and they just kind of Slough this
 

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.609
mines and they just kind of Slough this
stuff off and sell it as a co-product

00:29:31.609 --> 00:29:31.619
stuff off and sell it as a co-product
 

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:34.169
stuff off and sell it as a co-product
but as the demand for cobalt grows like

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:34.179
but as the demand for cobalt grows like
 

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:35.519
but as the demand for cobalt grows like
crazy in the demand for copper and

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:35.529
crazy in the demand for copper and
 

00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:38.279
crazy in the demand for copper and
nickel does not go nearly as fast it's

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:38.289
nickel does not go nearly as fast it's
 

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:40.769
nickel does not go nearly as fast it's
no longer enough just to get the the Co

00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:40.779
no longer enough just to get the the Co
 

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.359
no longer enough just to get the the Co
production of the cobalt from those so

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:42.369
production of the cobalt from those so
 

00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:44.580
production of the cobalt from those so
for the first time in history over the

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:44.590
for the first time in history over the
 

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.259
for the first time in history over the
next number of years we're gonna have to

00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:46.269
next number of years we're gonna have to
 

00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:49.019
next number of years we're gonna have to
go invent the technologies and go out

00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:49.029
go invent the technologies and go out
 

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:51.779
go invent the technologies and go out
and have businesses go find cobalt

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:51.789
and have businesses go find cobalt
 

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.669
and have businesses go find cobalt
driven resources and find ways to

00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679
driven resources and find ways to
 

00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:55.350
driven resources and find ways to
cost-effectively extract them so this is

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360
cost-effectively extract them so this is
 

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.210
cost-effectively extract them so this is
an area that we're looking at and are

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:57.220
an area that we're looking at and are
 

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.019
an area that we're looking at and are
very interested in but as bullish as we

00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:01.029
very interested in but as bullish as we
 

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:03.389
very interested in but as bullish as we
are in electrification when you look at

00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399
are in electrification when you look at
 

00:30:03.399 --> 00:30:05.659
are in electrification when you look at
things like air transportation or

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:05.669
things like air transportation or
 

00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.159
things like air transportation or
international and coastal shipping which

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:08.169
international and coastal shipping which
 

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:10.279
international and coastal shipping which
are each well over half a Giga ton of

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:10.289
are each well over half a Giga ton of
 

00:30:10.289 --> 00:30:13.680
are each well over half a Giga ton of
emissions today electrification is not

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:13.690
emissions today electrification is not
 

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.659
emissions today electrification is not
happening for these you know even when

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:15.669
happening for these you know even when
 

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:17.009
happening for these you know even when
you're very bullish about electric

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:17.019
you're very bullish about electric
 

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:19.560
you're very bullish about electric
aviation short-haul it work when you're

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:19.570
aviation short-haul it work when you're
 

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.389
aviation short-haul it work when you're
bullish about you know a long-haul

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399
bullish about you know a long-haul
 

00:30:21.399 --> 00:30:23.310
bullish about you know a long-haul
trucking electrification in which we

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320
trucking electrification in which we
 

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.739
trucking electrification in which we
think is is kind of a you know it's a

00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:25.749
think is is kind of a you know it's a
 

00:30:25.749 --> 00:30:27.509
think is is kind of a you know it's a
it's a middle-of-the-road kind of

00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519
it's a middle-of-the-road kind of
 

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:28.859
it's a middle-of-the-road kind of
proposition these are not going to be

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:28.869
proposition these are not going to be
 

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:31.649
proposition these are not going to be
electrified so what are we going to do

00:30:31.649 --> 00:30:31.659
electrified so what are we going to do
 

00:30:31.659 --> 00:30:33.779
electrified so what are we going to do
to get after these applications these

00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:33.789
to get after these applications these
 

00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:35.700
to get after these applications these
emissions and that is where we see the

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:35.710
emissions and that is where we see the
 

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.470
emissions and that is where we see the
need for cost-effective

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480
need for cost-effective
 

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.389
need for cost-effective
low greenhouse gas emissions liquid

00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399

fuels and the two areas the way that

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:41.740
fuels and the two areas the way that
 

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.080
fuels and the two areas the way that
we're thinking about this is that if you

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.090
we're thinking about this is that if you
 

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:44.270
we're thinking about this is that if you
really want these to be carved

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:44.280
really want these to be carved
 

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.100
really want these to be carved
neutral greenhouse gas neutral you've

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.110
neutral greenhouse gas neutral you've
 

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.470
neutral greenhouse gas neutral you've
got to take co2 out of the air and put

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480
got to take co2 out of the air and put
 

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.290
got to take co2 out of the air and put
it back in it's a cycle right and so the

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:51.300
it back in it's a cycle right and so the
 

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.640
it back in it's a cycle right and so the
two ways that we see that you can do

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:52.650
two ways that we see that you can do
 

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.980
two ways that we see that you can do
that is biofuels so we're taking a very

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:54.990
that is biofuels so we're taking a very
 

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.100
that is biofuels so we're taking a very
serious look basically there was a lot

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.110
serious look basically there was a lot
 

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.140
serious look basically there was a lot
of carnage as we all know in the in the

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:00.150
of carnage as we all know in the in the
 

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.940
of carnage as we all know in the in the
recent kind of biofuels wave for second

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:01.950

generation biofuels like cellulose and

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:03.540
generation biofuels like cellulose and
 

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.540
generation biofuels like cellulose and
biofuels a lot of progress but they

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:05.550
biofuels a lot of progress but they
 

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.490
biofuels a lot of progress but they
didn't quite get that and so we're

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500
didn't quite get that and so we're
 

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.200
didn't quite get that and so we're
taking a fresh look at that and seeing

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:09.210
taking a fresh look at that and seeing
 

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.430
taking a fresh look at that and seeing
are there ways that we can put together

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440
are there ways that we can put together
 

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.340
are there ways that we can put together
the puzzle pieces of the really amazing

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:13.350

parts of the supply chain and put those

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980
parts of the supply chain and put those
 

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.100
parts of the supply chain and put those
together in creative ways and also

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.110

perhaps leverage the latest

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:20.160
perhaps leverage the latest
 

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.280
perhaps leverage the latest
breakthroughs in synthetic biology to

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.290

actually deliver at cost that scale and
 

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.790
actually deliver at cost that scale and
you know we've also been looking

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:28.800
you know we've also been looking
 

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.450
you know we've also been looking
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels
 

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.010
seriously at co2 other co2 to fuels
technologies and so we're very

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020
technologies and so we're very
 

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.630
technologies and so we're very
interested in carbon capture and

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640
interested in carbon capture and
 

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.230
interested in carbon capture and
conversion to fuels and in the long run

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240
conversion to fuels and in the long run
 

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.490
conversion to fuels and in the long run
if you want that to be carbon neutral

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500
if you want that to be carbon neutral
 

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.410
if you want that to be carbon neutral
you have to be looking at air capture

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:42.420
you have to be looking at air capture
 

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.750
you have to be looking at air capture
and so we're looking quite seriously at

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760
and so we're looking quite seriously at
 

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.490
and so we're looking quite seriously at
air capture as an important long term

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500
air capture as an important long term

which is a really potent greenhouse gas
 

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.120
which is a really potent greenhouse gas
as well which is you know those are

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.130
as well which is you know those are
 

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.970
as well which is you know those are
about 50/50 in terms of impact of that

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980
about 50/50 in terms of impact of that
 

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.030
about 50/50 in terms of impact of that
sector so we're very interested in

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.040
sector so we're very interested in
 

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.919
sector so we're very interested in
looking at you know this is an

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:36.929
looking at you know this is an
 

00:33:36.929 --> 00:33:38.660
looking at you know this is an
exponential technology domain on the

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:38.670
exponential technology domain on the
 

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.000
exponential technology domain on the
nitrogen fixation side focusing maybe

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.010
nitrogen fixation side focusing maybe
 

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.240
nitrogen fixation side focusing maybe
more on the on the field we see a lot of

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.250
more on the on the field we see a lot of
 

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.860
more on the on the field we see a lot of
opportunities and a lot of great ideas

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:45.870
opportunities and a lot of great ideas
 

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.270
opportunities and a lot of great ideas
in the area of applying kind of

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.280
in the area of applying kind of
 

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.030
in the area of applying kind of
synthetic biology and microbiome to

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.040
synthetic biology and microbiome to
 

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.280
synthetic biology and microbiome to
nitrogen fixation you know there are a

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:52.290
nitrogen fixation you know there are a
 

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.630
nitrogen fixation you know there are a
very limited set of plants that could

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640
very limited set of plants that could
 

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.180
very limited set of plants that could
actually fix their own nitrogen but

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:56.190
actually fix their own nitrogen but
 

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.470
actually fix their own nitrogen but
people haven't been able to port those

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480
people haven't been able to port those
 

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.010
people haven't been able to port those
traits over to major crops like corn or

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:01.020
traits over to major crops like corn or
 

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.710
traits over to major crops like corn or
others and so we're excited about

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720
others and so we're excited about
 

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.810
others and so we're excited about
looking at a number of companies that

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820
looking at a number of companies that
 

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.580
looking at a number of companies that
are trying to tackle this issue of of

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:07.590
are trying to tackle this issue of of
 

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.349
are trying to tackle this issue of of
either dramatically improving the

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359
either dramatically improving the
 

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.570
either dramatically improving the
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or
 

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.599
utilization efficiency of fertilizer or
even a big vision of completely

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:14.609
even a big vision of completely
 

00:34:14.609 --> 00:34:16.220
even a big vision of completely
eliminating the need for fertilizer by

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:16.230
eliminating the need for fertilizer by
 

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.129
eliminating the need for fertilizer by
pulling nitrogen straight out of the air

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:18.139
pulling nitrogen straight out of the air
 

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.690
pulling nitrogen straight out of the air
in terms of food waste I'll admit this

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700
in terms of food waste I'll admit this
 

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.639
in terms of food waste I'll admit this
is a tough space this is a very

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:22.649
is a tough space this is a very
 

00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:24.500
is a tough space this is a very
disaggregated space so it goes all the

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:24.510
disaggregated space so it goes all the
 

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.409
disaggregated space so it goes all the
way from losing crops in the field you

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419
way from losing crops in the field you
 

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:28.580
way from losing crops in the field you
know where people have creative ideas

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:28.590
know where people have creative ideas
 

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.980
know where people have creative ideas
around around imperfect produce you know

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:30.990
around around imperfect produce you know
 

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:33.970
around around imperfect produce you know
like markets for carrots with two legs

innovations that would involve which the
worst place to waste food is when it's

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:49.590
worst place to waste food is when it's
 

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.570
worst place to waste food is when it's
right on your plate because you've

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580
right on your plate because you've
 

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.340
right on your plate because you've
already invested so much in getting it

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:52.350
already invested so much in getting it
 

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.530
already invested so much in getting it
there and so ideas around like

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540
there and so ideas around like
 

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.849
there and so ideas around like
innovative delivery models or other

00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:55.859
innovative delivery models or other
 

00:34:55.859 --> 00:34:58.520
innovative delivery models or other
models are all being considered there

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:58.530
models are all being considered there
 

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.780
models are all being considered there
but I'd say we're a little bit early and

00:34:59.780 --> 00:34:59.790
but I'd say we're a little bit early and
 

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.040
but I'd say we're a little bit early and
our thinking there would be really open

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.050
our thinking there would be really open
 

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.290
our thinking there would be really open
to your creative and big ideas I'd say

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300
to your creative and big ideas I'd say
 

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.640
to your creative and big ideas I'd say
the biggest opportunity we're pursuing

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:04.650
the biggest opportunity we're pursuing
 

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.440
the biggest opportunity we're pursuing
right now is in this low GH g protein

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:06.450
right now is in this low GH g protein
 

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.810
right now is in this low GH g protein
area and so two-thirds of this is the

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820
area and so two-thirds of this is the
 

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.520
area and so two-thirds of this is the
cow about half

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:11.530
cow about half
 

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.620
cow about half
that cow emission comes from the whole

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:13.630
that cow emission comes from the whole
 

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.270
that cow emission comes from the whole
supply chain of just keeping that cow

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280
supply chain of just keeping that cow
 

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.910
supply chain of just keeping that cow
alive and growing and the other half is

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920
alive and growing and the other half is
 

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.700
alive and growing and the other half is
from an enteric fermentation so this is

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:20.710
from an enteric fermentation so this is
 

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.600
from an enteric fermentation so this is
the burping of methane and so we're

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:24.610
the burping of methane and so we're
 

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.670
the burping of methane and so we're
looking seriously at innovative ideas

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680
looking seriously at innovative ideas
 

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.800
looking seriously at innovative ideas
for addressing you know the the methane

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:28.810
for addressing you know the the methane
 

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:29.850
for addressing you know the the methane
emissions are there microbiome

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:29.860
emissions are there microbiome
 

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.620
emissions are there microbiome
approaches that instead of emitting

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:31.630
approaches that instead of emitting
 

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.840
approaches that instead of emitting
methane would allow a methane conversion

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:33.850
methane would allow a methane conversion
 

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.250
methane would allow a methane conversion
in the gut

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:35.260
in the gut
 

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.930
in the gut
that's an interesting area to look at

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:36.940
that's an interesting area to look at
 

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.940
that's an interesting area to look at
the other is just to completely

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:38.950
the other is just to completely
 

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.250
the other is just to completely
eliminate the cow the other half of the

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:41.260
eliminate the cow the other half of the
 

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.830
eliminate the cow the other half of the
emissions and so we're looking seriously

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:43.840
emissions and so we're looking seriously
 

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.210
emissions and so we're looking seriously
at opportunities to provide at scale

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:48.220
at opportunities to provide at scale
 

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.170
at opportunities to provide at scale
you know palatable you know solutions

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:52.180
you know palatable you know solutions
 

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.570
you know palatable you know solutions
for food that would have much lower

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:54.580
for food that would have much lower
 

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.430
for food that would have much lower
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around
 

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.370
greenhouse gas so there are ideas around
using plant-based materials and then

00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.380
using plant-based materials and then
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.820
using plant-based materials and then
adding in small amounts of of kind of

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:02.830
adding in small amounts of of kind of
 

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.100
adding in small amounts of of kind of
specialty materials like heme like

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.110
specialty materials like heme like
 

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.960
specialty materials like heme like
impossible foods you may know about it

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:06.970
impossible foods you may know about it
 

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.850
impossible foods you may know about it
as a has a burger that is plant-based

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:08.860
as a has a burger that is plant-based
 

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.460
as a has a burger that is plant-based
but it actually tastes like a real

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:11.470
but it actually tastes like a real
 

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.440
but it actually tastes like a real
burger because it introduces these heme

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.450
burger because it introduces these heme
 

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.320
burger because it introduces these heme
or blood like additives at very small

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.330
or blood like additives at very small
 

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.720
or blood like additives at very small
percentages and then you've got

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:18.730
percentages and then you've got
 

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:19.770
percentages and then you've got
companies out there who are actually

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:19.780
companies out there who are actually
 

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.930
companies out there who are actually
taking mammalian cells and culturing

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:21.940
taking mammalian cells and culturing
 

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.160
taking mammalian cells and culturing
them in the lab and have a vision of

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.170
them in the lab and have a vision of
 

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.730
them in the lab and have a vision of
actually making you your whole steak

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740
actually making you your whole steak
 

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.980
actually making you your whole steak
without the cow turns my stomach a

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:28.990
without the cow turns my stomach a
 

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.420
without the cow turns my stomach a
little bit right now but I think it's

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:30.430
little bit right now but I think it's
 

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.650
little bit right now but I think it's
very interesting it could have a huge

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:31.660
very interesting it could have a huge
 

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.940
very interesting it could have a huge
impact and then you know I think those

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:35.950
impact and then you know I think those
 

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.170
impact and then you know I think those
are some of the areas that we think are

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:37.180
are some of the areas that we think are
 

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.090
are some of the areas that we think are
a really big opportunity but another

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.100
a really big opportunity but another
 

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.000
a really big opportunity but another
thing that was really new to me coming

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.010
thing that was really new to me coming
 

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.010
thing that was really new to me coming
to this is that you know when you look

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:44.020
to this is that you know when you look
 

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.300
to this is that you know when you look
at all the emissions from the cow half

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:45.310
at all the emissions from the cow half
 

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.270
at all the emissions from the cow half
is from beef you know which half is

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280
is from beef you know which half is
 

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.010
is from beef you know which half is
ground beef and the rest is kind of

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:50.020
ground beef and the rest is kind of
 

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.720
ground beef and the rest is kind of
different forms of beef the other half

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:51.730
different forms of beef the other half
 

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.210
different forms of beef the other half

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:54.220
is dairy and so if we can find really
 

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.000
is dairy and so if we can find really
innovative ways to create dairy either

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.010
innovative ways to create dairy either
 

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.030
innovative ways to create dairy either
like use fermentation or other

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040
like use fermentation or other
 

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.680
like use fermentation or other
approaches to take plant-based molecules

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:01.690
approaches to take plant-based molecules
 

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.480
approaches to take plant-based molecules
and makes things that are the functional

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:03.490
and makes things that are the functional
 

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.000

equivalent of milk or if we can develop

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.010
equivalent of milk or if we can develop
 

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.310
equivalent of milk or if we can develop
other kind of milk substitutes that are

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320
other kind of milk substitutes that are
 

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.020
other kind of milk substitutes that are
really preferable or palatable to people

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.030
really preferable or palatable to people
 

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.790
really preferable or palatable to people
that would have a huge impact on the

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800
that would have a huge impact on the
 

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.310
that would have a huge impact on the
space as well so I think hopefully a

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320
space as well so I think hopefully a
 

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.840
space as well so I think hopefully a
number of problems that that are kind of

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:15.850
number of problems that that are kind of
 

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.310
number of problems that that are kind of
new to you but these are areas that we'd

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.320
new to you but these are areas that we'd
 

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.870
new to you but these are areas that we'd
love to engage with innovators on

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880
love to engage with innovators on
 

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.630
love to engage with innovators on
and then the final sector I wanted to

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640
and then the final sector I wanted to
 

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.490
and then the final sector I wanted to
talk about is the what I think is the

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:23.500
talk about is the what I think is the
 

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.480
talk about is the what I think is the
hardest sector and this is

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.490
hardest sector and this is
 

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.790
hardest sector and this is
the industry sector this is making stuff

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800
the industry sector this is making stuff
 

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.810
the industry sector this is making stuff
at scale and and so I consider that you

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:30.820
at scale and and so I consider that you
 

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.240
at scale and and so I consider that you
know there aren't a lot of really great

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:32.250
know there aren't a lot of really great
 

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.620
know there aren't a lot of really great
scalable ideas out there for these

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:34.630
scalable ideas out there for these
 

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.530
scalable ideas out there for these
sectors and this represents a third of

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:37.540
sectors and this represents a third of
 

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.540
sectors and this represents a third of
global emissions and I think there's I

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:39.550
global emissions and I think there's I
 

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.810
global emissions and I think there's I
think there's relatively less attention

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:42.820
think there's relatively less attention
 

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.880
think there's relatively less attention
paid by entrepreneurs and innovators in

this sector then there needs to be it we

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480
this sector then there needs to be it we
 

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.940
this sector then there needs to be it we
really love to engage with people in

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:47.950
really love to engage with people in
 

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.890
really love to engage with people in
this area and the three big problems

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:49.900
this area and the three big problems
 

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.800
this area and the three big problems
that I'd say we it would our most

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:52.810
that I'd say we it would our most
 

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:55.080

cement is a really tough one and I say
 

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.900
cement is a really tough one and I say
like steel we're not seeing a lot of

the real challenge is the Portland

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:44.890
the real challenge is the Portland
 

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.710
the real challenge is the Portland
cement you know like order of ten

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720

incredibly emission intensive and

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.050
incredibly emission intensive and
 

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.270
incredibly emission intensive and
basically you take calcium carbonate

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280
basically you take calcium carbonate
 

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.250
basically you take calcium carbonate
like chalk and you have to heat it up to

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:56.260
like chalk and you have to heat it up to
 

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.170
like chalk and you have to heat it up to
make calcium oxide and that not only

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:58.180
make calcium oxide and that not only
 

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.690
make calcium oxide and that not only
requires energy heat which about half

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:00.700
requires energy heat which about half
 

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.550
requires energy heat which about half
the emissions but you're also in that

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560
the emissions but you're also in that
 

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.050
the emissions but you're also in that
chemical conversion making a lot of co2

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:04.060
chemical conversion making a lot of co2
 

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.200
chemical conversion making a lot of co2
and so you know innovative ways to

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:07.210
and so you know innovative ways to
 

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.430
and so you know innovative ways to
reduce the amount of Portland cement

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440
reduce the amount of Portland cement
 

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.550
reduce the amount of Portland cement
that's needed completely new approaches

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560
that's needed completely new approaches
 

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.890
that's needed completely new approaches
to cement alternatives to cement wood

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:13.900

things are all things that we're very
 

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.510
things are all things that we're very
interested in and then in ammonia we see

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520
interested in and then in ammonia we see
 

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.400
interested in and then in ammonia we see
some you know I think almost all the

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:23.410
some you know I think almost all the
 

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.230
some you know I think almost all the
emissions for ammonia are from making

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240
emissions for ammonia are from making
 

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.270
emissions for ammonia are from making
hydrogen from natural gas so again I

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280
hydrogen from natural gas so again I
 

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.710
hydrogen from natural gas so again I
think a game-changer there would be if

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720
think a game-changer there would be if
 

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.780
think a game-changer there would be if
we could find ways to make hydrogen we

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:30.790
we could find ways to make hydrogen we
 

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.609
we could find ways to make hydrogen we
think you know if it's $1 to $2 per

00:39:32.609 --> 00:39:32.619
think you know if it's $1 to $2 per
 

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:35.010
think you know if it's $1 to $2 per
kilogram you change the world and so

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:35.020
kilogram you change the world and so
 

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.690
kilogram you change the world and so
these are all areas we're very

I'd love to engage with top innovators

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:17.430
I'd love to engage with top innovators
 

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.460
I'd love to engage with top innovators
out there on and Jay and I would love to

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:19.470
out there on and Jay and I would love to
 

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.039
out there on and Jay and I would love to
do that with you is how do we take this

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:22.049
do that with you is how do we take this
 

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:24.640
do that with you is how do we take this
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:24.650
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour
 

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.720
1 to 2 cent per kilowatt hour
intermittent renewable electricity low

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:26.730
intermittent renewable electricity low
 

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.299
intermittent renewable electricity low
capacity affect electricity that we were

00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:29.309
capacity affect electricity that we were
 

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:31.880
capacity affect electricity that we were
seeing come on in a larger larger scale

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:31.890
seeing come on in a larger larger scale
 

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.859
seeing come on in a larger larger scale
and more and more places and how do we

00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:33.869
and more and more places and how do we
 

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:36.289
and more and more places and how do we
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas

00:40:36.289 --> 00:40:36.299
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas
 

00:40:36.299 --> 00:40:39.170
bridge that to make zero greenhouse gas
emissions stuff how do we bridge that to

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180
emissions stuff how do we bridge that to
 

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.039
emissions stuff how do we bridge that to
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could

00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:43.049
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could
 

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:44.809
make steel hydrogen ammonia if we could
do that in a cost-effective manner and

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:44.819
do that in a cost-effective manner and
 

00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:46.940
do that in a cost-effective manner and
that power is really cheap which makes

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:46.950
that power is really cheap which makes
 

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.430
that power is really cheap which makes
it really possible especially using the

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440
it really possible especially using the
 

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.349
it really possible especially using the
the most promising platform I see is at

00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359
the most promising platform I see is at
 

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:52.490
the most promising platform I see is at
electrochemistry things like an

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500
electrochemistry things like an
 

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.089
electrochemistry things like an
electrolyzer electrolysis unit the big

00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099
electrolyzer electrolysis unit the big
 

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:59.180
electrolyzer electrolysis unit the big
technology challenge an opportunity here

00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.190
technology challenge an opportunity here
 

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.250
technology challenge an opportunity here
is that that people haven't really

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260
is that that people haven't really
 

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.829
is that that people haven't really
thought about using renewable

00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839
thought about using renewable
 

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:06.319
thought about using renewable
intermittent low capacity factor energy

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:06.329
intermittent low capacity factor energy
 

00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:08.720
intermittent low capacity factor energy
to directly power industrial processes

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:08.730
to directly power industrial processes
 

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.210
to directly power industrial processes
and so the big difference here is you'd

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220
and so the big difference here is you'd
 

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.640
and so the big difference here is you'd
have a factory you'd have a plant that

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:13.650
have a factory you'd have a plant that
 

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.710
have a factory you'd have a plant that
would only be able to operate 40% of the

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720
would only be able to operate 40% of the
 

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.440
would only be able to operate 40% of the
time 50% of the time 25% of the time and

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:18.450
time 50% of the time 25% of the time and
 

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:20.599
time 50% of the time 25% of the time and
so you have to think in a completely new

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:20.609
so you have to think in a completely new
 

00:41:20.609 --> 00:41:22.670
so you have to think in a completely new
way about dramatically reducing the

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680
way about dramatically reducing the
 

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.319
way about dramatically reducing the
capital cost of these systems because

00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:24.329
capital cost of these systems because
 

00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:26.480
capital cost of these systems because
you're only using them part of the time

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:26.490
you're only using them part of the time
 

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.640
you're only using them part of the time
you're getting super cheap energy but

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:28.650
you're getting super cheap energy but
 

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.750
you're getting super cheap energy but
you're only getting a part of the time

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760
you're only getting a part of the time
 

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.130
you're only getting a part of the time
so you've got to build it you got to

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140
so you've got to build it you got to
 

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.990
so you've got to build it you got to
envision a new kind of factory that is

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000
envision a new kind of factory that is
 

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.279
envision a new kind of factory that is
completely different that is

00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:34.289
completely different that is
 

00:41:34.289 --> 00:41:36.589
completely different that is
dramatically lower capital cost and so

00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599
dramatically lower capital cost and so
 

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:38.059
dramatically lower capital cost and so
this is something that that Jay and I

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:38.069
this is something that that Jay and I
 

00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:39.799
this is something that that Jay and I
are gonna be looking at together so with

00:41:39.799 --> 00:41:39.809
are gonna be looking at together so with
 

00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:42.140
are gonna be looking at together so with
that I want to thank you for your time I

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.150
that I want to thank you for your time I
 

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.450
that I want to thank you for your time I
hope you got to know a little bit about

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460

tackling with us
bottom line I want to put out there is

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.100
bottom line I want to put out there is
 

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.150
bottom line I want to put out there is
is that we are we are here to support

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160
is that we are we are here to support
 

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.340
is that we are we are here to support
your big ideas and it's really about

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:58.350
your big ideas and it's really about
 

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:02.260
your big ideas and it's really about
those big half Giga ton ideas and so

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:02.270
those big half Giga ton ideas and so
 

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.180
those big half Giga ton ideas and so
we've got a lot of work to do but we've

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.190
we've got a lot of work to do but we've
 

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.800
we've got a lot of work to do but we've
got a good amount of capital we've got

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:06.810
got a good amount of capital we've got
 

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.200
got a good amount of capital we've got
some great investors and we think

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:09.210
some great investors and we think
 

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.210
some great investors and we think
there's a tremendous opportunity to

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:11.220
there's a tremendous opportunity to
 

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.520
there's a tremendous opportunity to
build some of the biggest and most

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:13.530
build some of the biggest and most
 

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.470
build some of the biggest and most
successful companies in the world that

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480
successful companies in the world that
 

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.690
successful companies in the world that
will go help us tackle this 70 Giga ton

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700
will go help us tackle this 70 Giga ton
 

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.870
will go help us tackle this 70 Giga ton

fantastic thanks again for coming and
 

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.130
fantastic thanks again for coming and
we've got a number of questions from the

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140
we've got a number of questions from the
 

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.120
we've got a number of questions from the
audience so I'm just going to sort of

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.130
audience so I'm just going to sort of
 

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.570
audience so I'm just going to sort of
sit here and recite some of them mm-hmm

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:41.580
sit here and recite some of them mm-hmm
 

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.030
sit here and recite some of them mm-hmm
first what actually is another think big

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040
first what actually is another think big
 

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.370
first what actually is another think big
point that some folks have raised as a

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380
point that some folks have raised as a
 

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.100
point that some folks have raised as a
potential for geoengineering instead of

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.110
potential for geoengineering instead of
 

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.870
potential for geoengineering instead of
reducing carbon emissions I mean which

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880
reducing carbon emissions I mean which
 

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.160
reducing carbon emissions I mean which
is obviously the right fight to fight

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:52.170
is obviously the right fight to fight
 

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.410
is obviously the right fight to fight
other folks are considering injecting

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420
other folks are considering injecting
 

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.120
other folks are considering injecting
certain like sulfur species or other

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:56.130
certain like sulfur species or other
 

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.340
certain like sulfur species or other
things in the high atmosphere to reduce

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:58.350
things in the high atmosphere to reduce
 

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.890
things in the high atmosphere to reduce
the impact of the Sun and to reduce

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900
the impact of the Sun and to reduce
 

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.810
the impact of the Sun and to reduce
global warming in a different way are

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:02.820
global warming in a different way are
 

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.160
global warming in a different way are
you guys considering that sort of thing

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.170
you guys considering that sort of thing
 

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.680
you guys considering that sort of thing
at all are you more focused on

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:05.690
at all are you more focused on
 

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.550
at all are you more focused on
mitigating the problem through carbon

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560
mitigating the problem through carbon
 

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.040
mitigating the problem through carbon
reduction yeah you know we haven't

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:10.050
reduction yeah you know we haven't
 

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.350
reduction yeah you know we haven't
explicitly put it off the table but I'd

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:12.360
explicitly put it off the table but I'd
 

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.080
explicitly put it off the table but I'd
say for now we are very very focused on

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.090
say for now we are very very focused on
 

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.350
say for now we are very very focused on
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:17.360
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation
 

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.700
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation
and so there definitely a few folks out

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:19.710
and so there definitely a few folks out
 

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.410
and so there definitely a few folks out
there including high net worth folks who

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420
there including high net worth folks who
 

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.480
there including high net worth folks who
are backing some teams that are looking

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:23.490
are backing some teams that are looking
 

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:25.250
are backing some teams that are looking
at some of these geoengineering things

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260
at some of these geoengineering things
 

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.830
at some of these geoengineering things
but say for now we're completely focused

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:27.840
but say for now we're completely focused
 

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.860
but say for now we're completely focused
on reducing emissions and not focusing

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:30.870
on reducing emissions and not focusing
 

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.870
on reducing emissions and not focusing
on geoengineering great

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880
on geoengineering great
 

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.680
on geoengineering great
what about what's your view on fusion

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:35.690
what about what's your view on fusion
 

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.890
what about what's your view on fusion
you know like I said I think that zero

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900
you know like I said I think that zero
 

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.960
you know like I said I think that zero
zero greenhouse gas emissions

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:41.970
zero greenhouse gas emissions
 

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:45.380
zero greenhouse gas emissions
dispatchable generation which in a world

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:45.390
dispatchable generation which in a world
 

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.450
dispatchable generation which in a world
of high renewables penetration you're

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460
of high renewables penetration you're
 

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.640
of high renewables penetration you're
going to need you're going to need very

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:49.650
going to need you're going to need very
 

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.180
going to need you're going to need very
low-cost technologies that are

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.190
low-cost technologies that are
 

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.340
low-cost technologies that are
dispatchable or firm and so you know we

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:55.350
dispatchable or firm and so you know we
 

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.780
dispatchable or firm and so you know we
believe that it is absolutely critical

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:56.790
believe that it is absolutely critical
 

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.260
believe that it is absolutely critical
for us to develop some number of

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:00.270
for us to develop some number of
 

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.180
for us to develop some number of
solutions that are going to scale you

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.190
solutions that are going to scale you
 

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.340
solutions that are going to scale you
know to at least kind of ten ten percent

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:04.350
know to at least kind of ten ten percent
 

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.700
know to at least kind of ten ten percent
or you know 15 percent of capacity that

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:07.710
or you know 15 percent of capacity that
 

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.410
or you know 15 percent of capacity that
can support those high of renewable

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420
can support those high of renewable
 

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.620
can support those high of renewable
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:12.630
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear
 

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.980
penetrations and so I'd say nuclear
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:14.990
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture
 

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.540
fusion nuclear fission carbon capture
geothermal are all on the table but I'd

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:17.550
geothermal are all on the table but I'd
 

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.580
geothermal are all on the table but I'd
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer you

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:19.590
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer you
 

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.520
say there aren't a lot of no-brainer you
know obvious wins in that area so I

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:22.530
know obvious wins in that area so I
 

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:23.660
know obvious wins in that area so I
think we gonna have to look at a lot of

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:23.670
think we gonna have to look at a lot of
 

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.070
think we gonna have to look at a lot of
a lot of different things one thing

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:25.080
a lot of different things one thing
 

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.440
a lot of different things one thing
that's interesting though is that one

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:27.450
that's interesting though is that one
 

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:28.490
that's interesting though is that one
thing we been realizing is if you do

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500
thing we been realizing is if you do
 

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.840
thing we been realizing is if you do
believe in a high or at least in

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:29.850
believe in a high or at least in
 

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:30.920
believe in a high or at least in
geographies that would have high

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:30.930
geographies that would have high
 

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.870
geographies that would have high

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880
renewable intermittent renewable
 

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.390

penetration like wind and solar it's no

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400
penetration like wind and solar it's no
 

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.520
penetration like wind and solar it's no
longer enough to just think of like an

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:37.530
longer enough to just think of like an
 

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.480
longer enough to just think of like an
LCOE

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:38.490
LCOE
 

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.870
LCOE
a base load plant LCOE for these kind of

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880
a base load plant LCOE for these kind of
 

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.100
a base load plant LCOE for these kind of
dispatchable things because they're

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.110
dispatchable things because they're
 

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.930
dispatchable things because they're
gonna go up and down they're gonna be

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940
gonna go up and down they're gonna be
 

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.300
gonna go up and down they're gonna be
operating at lower capacity factor and

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:47.310
operating at lower capacity factor and
 

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.640
operating at lower capacity factor and
so I think we're beginning to work on

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:49.650
so I think we're beginning to work on
 

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.640
so I think we're beginning to work on
some more appropriate metrics that we

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:52.650
some more appropriate metrics that we
 

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.260
some more appropriate metrics that we
should be having these kind of plants

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:54.270
should be having these kind of plants
 

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.180
should be having these kind of plants
target and so like the one thing I would

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:56.190
target and so like the one thing I would
 

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.280
target and so like the one thing I would
say is it like you know LCOE base load

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:58.290
say is it like you know LCOE base load
 

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.800
say is it like you know LCOE base load
that's not the right metric for these

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:00.810
that's not the right metric for these
 

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.150
that's not the right metric for these
dispatchable sources that we should be

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160
dispatchable sources that we should be
 

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.700
dispatchable sources that we should be
targeting so someone else asked you know

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:04.710
targeting so someone else asked you know
 

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.930
targeting so someone else asked you know
this is actually a hybrid of a couple

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940
this is actually a hybrid of a couple
 

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.950
this is actually a hybrid of a couple
different questions that I'm going to

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960
different questions that I'm going to
 

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.680
different questions that I'm going to
put together you have to think big right

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:09.690
put together you have to think big right
 

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.080
put together you have to think big right
and and there is so much like many of

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.090
and and there is so much like many of
 

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.420
and and there is so much like many of
these solutions bridge outside the realm

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:14.430

there need to be some global or at least

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:22.860
there need to be some global or at least

this are you guys looking at ways to do
 

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.440
this are you guys looking at ways to do
that as well you can't maybe there's a

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:33.450
that as well you can't maybe there's a
 

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.630
that as well you can't maybe there's a
you know not just a technical solution

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640
you know not just a technical solution
 

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.790
you know not just a technical solution
that's purely economically beneficial it

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800
that's purely economically beneficial it
 

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.290

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160
thinking that occurred to me I remember
 

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.249
thinking that occurred to me I remember
early on when I was talking to a mentor

00:48:16.249 --> 00:48:16.259
early on when I was talking to a mentor
 

00:48:16.259 --> 00:48:17.720
early on when I was talking to a mentor
of mine and I was saying well what was

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:17.730
of mine and I was saying well what was
 

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:18.920
of mine and I was saying well what was
different about this fun and was

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:18.930
different about this fun and was
 

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.749
different about this fun and was
exciting one of the things I said is and

00:48:20.749 --> 00:48:20.759
exciting one of the things I said is and
 

00:48:20.759 --> 00:48:22.400
exciting one of the things I said is and
we've got a billion dollars that's big

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:22.410
we've got a billion dollars that's big
 

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.220

and he reminded me in the in the area of

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:25.230
and he reminded me in the in the area of
 

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.200
and he reminded me in the in the area of
Energy and Climate a billion dollars is

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:27.210
Energy and Climate a billion dollars is
 

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.420
Energy and Climate a billion dollars is
not that big and so I think one thing

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:29.430
not that big and so I think one thing
 

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.089
not that big and so I think one thing
that we're very aware of is this hast if

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.250
associated heating and cooling that's a
 

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.670
associated heating and cooling that's a
huge portion of all of the energy we use

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680
huge portion of all of the energy we use
 

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.160
huge portion of all of the energy we use
in buildings my personal opinion is that

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.170
in buildings my personal opinion is that
 

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.859
in buildings my personal opinion is that
lighting with the advent of LEDs and the

00:50:30.859 --> 00:50:30.869
lighting with the advent of LEDs and the
 

00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:34.880
lighting with the advent of LEDs and the
rapid penetration is maybe less of an

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:34.890
rapid penetration is maybe less of an
 

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.499
rapid penetration is maybe less of an
important area for us to focus but I

00:50:36.499 --> 00:50:36.509
important area for us to focus but I
 

00:50:36.509 --> 00:50:38.720
important area for us to focus but I
don't think we have a similar innovation

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:38.730
don't think we have a similar innovation
 

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.049
don't think we have a similar innovation
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space

00:50:41.049 --> 00:50:41.059
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space
 

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:43.249
on a similar cost curve in HVAC space
we've also been looking at you know kind

00:50:43.249 --> 00:50:43.259
we've also been looking at you know kind
 

00:50:43.259 --> 00:50:44.900
we've also been looking at you know kind
of creative things around the the

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:44.910
of creative things around the the
 

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.240
of creative things around the the
embedded footprint of buildings that

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:47.250
embedded footprint of buildings that
 

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.200
embedded footprint of buildings that
looks back at materials and so one of my

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:51.210
looks back at materials and so one of my
 

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.180
looks back at materials and so one of my
colleagues is looking very seriously at

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:53.190
colleagues is looking very seriously at
 

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.529
colleagues is looking very seriously at
how do you expand the envelope of wood

00:50:54.529 --> 00:50:54.539
how do you expand the envelope of wood
 

00:50:54.539 --> 00:50:56.839
how do you expand the envelope of wood
based construction where you know you're

00:50:56.839 --> 00:50:56.849
based construction where you know you're
 

00:50:56.849 --> 00:50:59.630
based construction where you know you're
actually you get a two-bagger where

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640
actually you get a two-bagger where
 

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.620
actually you get a two-bagger where
you're you're you're displacing steel

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:02.630
you're you're you're displacing steel
 

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.950
you're you're you're displacing steel
and concrete and you're also

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960
and concrete and you're also
 

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.299
and concrete and you're also
sequestering carbon there through

00:51:07.299 --> 00:51:07.309
sequestering carbon there through
 

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:11.650
sequestering carbon there through
biomass and so I'd say that there are a

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:11.660
biomass and so I'd say that there are a
 

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.430
biomass and so I'd say that there are a
number of areas that were very

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440
number of areas that were very
 

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.690
number of areas that were very
interested in buildings but I think

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:13.700
interested in buildings but I think
 

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.460
interested in buildings but I think
buildings are tough and I ran the

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:15.470
buildings are tough and I ran the
 

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.019
buildings are tough and I ran the
buildings program at DOA it's a tough

00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:17.029
buildings program at DOA it's a tough
 

00:51:17.029 --> 00:51:18.999
buildings program at DOA it's a tough
space and so you know we're definitely

00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:19.009
space and so you know we're definitely
 

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.109
space and so you know we're definitely
going to be in there but I think we're

00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119
going to be in there but I think we're
 

00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:21.700
going to be in there but I think we're
gonna have to do some creative things to

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:21.710
gonna have to do some creative things to
 

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.529
gonna have to do some creative things to
make a real difference there all right

00:51:23.529 --> 00:51:23.539
make a real difference there all right
 

00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:25.720
make a real difference there all right
so last question this is a riff on one

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:25.730
so last question this is a riff on one
 

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.950
so last question this is a riff on one

that that someone submitted that I'll
add a bit to having fought the fight

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119
add a bit to having fought the fight
 

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.730
add a bit to having fought the fight
personally or not personally but the

aqueon we went up against multinationals

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:36.380
aqueon we went up against multinationals
 

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.539
aqueon we went up against multinationals
in the battery storage space and

00:51:37.539 --> 00:51:37.549
in the battery storage space and
 

00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:39.910
in the battery storage space and
eventually had a difficult ending

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920
eventually had a difficult ending
 

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.460
eventually had a difficult ending

investors are in the game and one of the
 

00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:48.759
investors are in the game and one of the
things that we thought of or you know

00:51:48.759 --> 00:51:48.769
things that we thought of or you know
 

00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:50.319
things that we thought of or you know
towards the end was wow we really should

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:50.329
towards the end was wow we really should
 

00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:51.249
towards the end was wow we really should
have aligned ourselves with a

00:51:51.249 --> 00:51:51.259
have aligned ourselves with a
 

00:51:51.259 --> 00:51:54.519
have aligned ourselves with a
multinational early on to co-develop and

00:51:54.519 --> 00:51:54.529
multinational early on to co-develop and
 

00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:55.660
multinational early on to co-develop and
make sure that our particular

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:55.670
make sure that our particular
 

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:57.970
make sure that our particular
manufacturing and our approach was

00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:57.980
manufacturing and our approach was
 

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.670
manufacturing and our approach was
amenable to what was happening globally

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680
amenable to what was happening globally
 

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.289
amenable to what was happening globally
with these huge companies that have were

00:52:02.289 --> 00:52:02.299
with these huge companies that have were
 

00:52:02.299 --> 00:52:04.720
with these huge companies that have were
bankable and had a lot more cash are you

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:04.730
bankable and had a lot more cash are you
 

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.700
bankable and had a lot more cash are you
guys looking to encourage this kind of

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:06.710
guys looking to encourage this kind of
 

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.829
guys looking to encourage this kind of
collaboration early on with these new

00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839
collaboration early on with these new
 

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:11.410
collaboration early on with these new
companies yeah a double meaning of that

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.420
companies yeah a double meaning of that
 

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.299
companies yeah a double meaning of that
I mean this is a situation because at

00:52:13.299 --> 00:52:13.309
I mean this is a situation because at
 

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:15.609
I mean this is a situation because at
some point if it's a real thing in this

00:52:15.609 --> 00:52:15.619
some point if it's a real thing in this
 

00:52:15.619 --> 00:52:17.289
some point if it's a real thing in this
competition it's difficult to keep your

00:52:17.289 --> 00:52:17.299
competition it's difficult to keep your
 

00:52:17.299 --> 00:52:19.720
competition it's difficult to keep your
current flow no I'm I agree with you

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:19.730
current flow no I'm I agree with you
 

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.349
current flow no I'm I agree with you
wholeheartedly the you know

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359
wholeheartedly the you know
 

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:25.509
wholeheartedly the you know
interestingly so we chose not to have

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:25.519
interestingly so we chose not to have
 

00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:27.579
interestingly so we chose not to have
companies as limited partners and our

00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:27.589
companies as limited partners and our
 

00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:30.640
companies as limited partners and our
fund and I think because we appreciate

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:30.650
fund and I think because we appreciate
 

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.430
fund and I think because we appreciate
that we do need to work with a large

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440
that we do need to work with a large
 

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.339
that we do need to work with a large
number of these companies to partner you

00:52:36.339 --> 00:52:36.349
number of these companies to partner you
 

00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:38.759
number of these companies to partner you
know I think that might have been a

00:52:38.759 --> 00:52:38.769
know I think that might have been a
 

00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:43.299
know I think that might have been a

cleantech one auto weakness in strategy
 

00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:44.410
cleantech one auto weakness in strategy
was is like we're gonna go head-to-head

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:44.420
was is like we're gonna go head-to-head
 

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.120
was is like we're gonna go head-to-head
with these companies as opposed to

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.130
with these companies as opposed to
 

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.809
with these companies as opposed to
finding win-win ways to collaborate and

00:52:48.809 --> 00:52:48.819
finding win-win ways to collaborate and
 

00:52:48.819 --> 00:52:52.420
finding win-win ways to collaborate and
you know I teach a energy ventures class

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:52.430
you know I teach a energy ventures class
 

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.910
you know I teach a energy ventures class
at Stanford where we try to teach the

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920
at Stanford where we try to teach the
 

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.740
at Stanford where we try to teach the
next generation of entrepreneurs the

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:56.750
next generation of entrepreneurs the
 

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.440
next generation of entrepreneurs the
lessons you know of 1.0 and and what are

00:52:59.440 --> 00:52:59.450
lessons you know of 1.0 and and what are
 

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.749
lessons you know of 1.0 and and what are
what is a playbook a new playbook that

00:53:01.749 --> 00:53:01.759
what is a playbook a new playbook that
 

00:53:01.759 --> 00:53:03.370
what is a playbook a new playbook that
we should be thinking of as company

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:03.380
we should be thinking of as company
 

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.529
we should be thinking of as company
builders and entrepreneurs in this space

00:53:05.529 --> 00:53:05.539
builders and entrepreneurs in this space
 

00:53:05.539 --> 00:53:07.990
builders and entrepreneurs in this space
to have better outcomes and you know I

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000
to have better outcomes and you know I
 

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.309
to have better outcomes and you know I
kind of feel like as I look at that

00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319
kind of feel like as I look at that
 

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:10.990
kind of feel like as I look at that
playbook you know let's say they're you

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000
playbook you know let's say they're you
 

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.460
playbook you know let's say they're you
know 10 chapters it kind of like we have

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:12.470
know 10 chapters it kind of like we have
 

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.289
know 10 chapters it kind of like we have
five of them the five or six of them

00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:14.299
five of them the five or six of them
 

00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:16.150
five of them the five or six of them
that are reasonably well worked out

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160
that are reasonably well worked out
 

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.130
that are reasonably well worked out
but I would say that the chapter on on

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:18.140
but I would say that the chapter on on
 

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.319
but I would say that the chapter on on
like how do you do

00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:20.329
like how do you do
 

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:22.690
like how do you do
these win-win strategic partnerships

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:22.700
these win-win strategic partnerships
 

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.660
these win-win strategic partnerships
with the big corporates in a way that

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:24.670
with the big corporates in a way that
 

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.549
with the big corporates in a way that
that can preserve and make sure you can

00:53:27.549 --> 00:53:27.559
that can preserve and make sure you can
 

00:53:27.559 --> 00:53:28.599
that can preserve and make sure you can
still make money and build great

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:28.609
still make money and build great
 

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:30.670
still make money and build great
businesses but leverage the the

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:30.680
businesses but leverage the the
 

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.990
businesses but leverage the the
capabilities of those big companies is

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000
capabilities of those big companies is
 

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.950
capabilities of those big companies is
still being written

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960
still being written
 

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.289
still being written
so we're gonna be engaging in a big way

00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:35.299
so we're gonna be engaging in a big way
 

00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:37.120
so we're gonna be engaging in a big way
but I think that there's still a lot of

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.130
but I think that there's still a lot of
 

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.650
but I think that there's still a lot of
back-and-forth that needs to happen to

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:38.660
