00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The last question asked, what is the maximum clustering coefficient for a node in B?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's the formula for a clustering coefficient.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If you look at any node in the left side say the middle one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We know that all of its neighbors will be in the right group,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and since B is a bipartite graph, they're can't be any edges in between numbers of the right group.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This implies that Nv will always be zero, which means the clustering coefficient will always be zero.
