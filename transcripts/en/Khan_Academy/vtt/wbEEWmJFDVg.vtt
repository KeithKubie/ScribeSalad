00:00:01.318 --> 00:00:02.200
- [Voiceover] This video's going to be

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.650
a quick review of complex numbers.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.480
If you studied complex numbers in the past

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.079
this will knock off some of the rust

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.661
and it will help explain
why we use complex numbers

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.730
in electrical engineering.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.812
If complex numbers are new to you,

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:17.985
I highly recommend you go look

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.754
on the Khan Academy videos that Sal's done

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:26.091
on complex numbers and those
are in the Algebra II section.

00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:27.612
So let's get started.

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:30.157
The complex numbers are
based on the concept

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:32.907
of the imaginary j, the number j,

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.161
in electrical engineering
we use the number j

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.910
instead of I.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.327
And j squared is defined to be minus one.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.341
So that's the definition of j.

00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:54.811
And that's referred to
as an imaginary number.

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:56.399
I don't really like the name imaginary

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.351
but that's what we call it.

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.250
It's a real useful concept
in electrical engineering.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.032
So with that definition we define

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.958
a complex number and the usual variable

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.643
we often use for that is a z,

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:12.367
and a complex number has a real part,

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.340
we'll call that x and
it has an imaginary part

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.423
that we're gonna call jy.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.170
So j is explicit out here.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.141
This is the imaginary part of the number.

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.391
This is the real part of z.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.091
So based on what this number looks like,

00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.661
this suggests that we can maybe plot this

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.321
on a two dimensional plot.

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.522
And we'll call this the complex plane.

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.592
And the complex plane looks like this.

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:37.568
We can plot two parts,

00:01:37.568 --> 00:01:40.331
we'll have a real part over here

00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:42.609
on what is usually the x axis.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.276
And we'll have an imaginary part

00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:48.130
which is the vertical axis.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.140
So this is referred to
as the complex plane.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.942
And if I have a complex number z,

00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:54.782
I could represent it on this plane

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:58.161
by basically going over x like this,

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.078
going over a distance x

00:02:01.232 --> 00:02:02.899
and up a distance y.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.391
That will give me an imaginary number

00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:08.474
and that's z.

00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:13.823
So z is a location in this complex space.

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:18.301
And that's one representation
of a complex number.

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:21.532
So the other common way to
represent a complex number

00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:24.949
is by drawing a line from the origin here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.243
and going right through z, like that.

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.352
And then we basically have some radius,

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:38.159
r, from the origin to distance out to z

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.330
and it's measured by some angle like that.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.640
That angle would be theta.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.730
So in the orange is r and theta

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.272
and in the blue here we have x and y

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:49.933
and those are two
different ways to represent

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.130
exactly the same number z.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.047
So over here I can say,

00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:58.518
I can say z equals r at some angle,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.047
that's the angle symbol of theta.

00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:06.192
Now I can go over here and I can work out

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:07.751
how we convert between the two,

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.810
how do I convert from r to y and x

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.022
and how do I go the other way.

00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:14.650
So one thing I notice is I just used

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.710
some simple trigonometry.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.360
So this distance here if I know r,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.889
say I know r, this distance here x,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.556
is equal to the cosine of theta,

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.799
times the distance r,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.591
r cosine theta.

00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.174
So I can say x equals r cosine of theta.

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:40.302
So if I want to figure
out the y distance here

00:03:40.302 --> 00:03:42.052
and I know r already,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.592
let me just move, here's
the y distance right here.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:50.259
I can say y equals r
times the sin of theta.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.127
That's this distance here.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.772
Okay, so if I know r and theta
this is how I get x and y.

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:06.651
Now let's go the other way.

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:11.420
Suppose I know x and y and
I want to know r and theta.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.082
So r, this is a right triangle here,

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:16.250
there's our right triangle,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.840
so I use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.022
So to convert from x and y to r

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:23.341
I use the Pythagorean theorem,

00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:27.091
r squared equals x squared plus y squared.

00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:33.131
And now if I want to
find theta I use another

00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.261
little bit of trigonometry,

00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.094
tangent is opposite over adjacent,

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:43.101
opposite over adjacent is y over x,

00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.101
so tangent of theta equals y over x.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.110
So if you're gonna do
this on your calculator

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.329
you would say that theta equals

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:01.996
the inverse tangent of y over x.

00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.672
So there's two conversions

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:13.505
between two different forms of the

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.362
of the complex number.

00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:19.150
We want to be able to
use these conversions

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.529
and we want to be able to use either

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.181
of these two representations freely

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:26.528
and go back and forth between them.

00:05:26.528 --> 00:05:29.340
Now there's a third representation

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.451
that's also gonna be really useful to us.

00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:32.992
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take

00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:35.411
this x and y expression here

00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.701
and I'm gonna put it back into this way,

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:41.811
this rectangular way of writing z.

00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:44.381
What that looks like is,

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.464
z equals x is r times cosine theta

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.497
and y is equal to r, I'll
put the r out front here,

00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:01.621
r sin theta with a j in front of it.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.437
So I can write plus j sin theta.

00:06:13.363 --> 00:06:16.991
Now if you look closely at
this expression right here,

00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:18.041
we recognize this.

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:22.781
We recognize this as one
side of Euler's Formula.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:24.682
And the other side of Euler's Formula

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:28.515
I could rewrite z as r
times e to the j theta.

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:36.693
And this is called the exponential form

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:38.520
of a complex number.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.089
All this means, what does this mean here,

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.288
what is this thing?

00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:43.801
This means exactly the same thing as this

00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:45.723
and this is one of the two ways

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:48.312
we can write complex numbers.

00:06:48.312 --> 00:06:52.395
So this r e to the j theta,
that is z right here,

00:06:53.243 --> 00:06:57.173
that means a complex
number sitting out here

00:06:57.173 --> 00:07:00.756
at radius r from the
origin at angle theta.

00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.121
That's what you think of when you see

00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.650
e to the j something written down.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.270
It's just a representation
of a complex number.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.770
And this form is going
to be particularly useful

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.432
because if you remember
when we were solving

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:17.490
all those differential equations,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.657
we always liked exponential solutions.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.790
So I want to put some
squares around these guys.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.623
These are the three ways
that we can represent

00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:33.276
a complex number and
they're all equivalent.

00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.507
And I'll go over here
just as a reminder note,

00:07:38.507 --> 00:07:41.174
I'll write down Euler's Formula.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.071
That's where that comes from.

00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:51.461
And let me write that down over here.

00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:54.961
Euler's Formula is e to the j theta equals

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.850
cosine theta plus j sin theta.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.352
The other form has a negative exponent.

00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:17.519
E to the minus j theta equals
cosine theta minus j sin theta

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:27.687
So that's Euler's Formula.

00:08:27.687 --> 00:08:31.542
And Sal has videos on how
to derive this equation

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:35.433
and you would search on this
term here in Khan Academy.
