00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:01.650
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can figure out the limit

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.521
of x over natural log of
x as x approaches one.

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.443
And like always pause this
video and see if you can

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:09.319
figure it out on your own.

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.355
Well we know from out limit
properties this is going to

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.001
be the same thing as the limit

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.918
as x approaches one of x over

00:00:19.055 --> 00:00:20.721
over

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:21.554
the limit,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.003
the limit

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.645
as x approaches one

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:29.567
of the natural log

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:30.400
of x.

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:33.962
Now this top limit, the
one I have in magenta,

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:36.304
this is pretty straight forward,

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:39.106
if we had the graph of y equals x

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.857
that would be continuous everywhere

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.768
it's defined for all real
numbers and it's continuous

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:44.152
at all real numbers.

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:47.491
So it's continuous to limit
as x approaches one of x.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.013
It's just gonna be this
evaluated x equals one.

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:52.049
So this is just going to be one.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.447
We just put a one in for this x.

00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:57.697
For the numerator here we
just evaluate to a one.

00:00:57.697 --> 00:00:59.696
And then the denominator,

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:03.888
natural log of x is not
defined for all x's,

00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:06.373
therefore it isn't continuous everywhere.

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:10.000
But it is continuous at x equals one.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.094
And since it is continuous
at x equals one,

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.334
then the limit here is just
gonna be the natural log

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.245
evaluated at x equals one.

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:19.770
So this is just going
to be the natural log

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.171
the natural log of one.

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.149
Which of course

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.371
is zero.

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:26.483
E to the zero power is one.

00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:29.659
So this is all going to be equal to

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.981
this is going to be equal to

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.328
we just evaluate it

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:34.429
one

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.772
over

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:36.951
one

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:37.931
over

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.357
zero.

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:41.518
And now we face a bit of a conundrum.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.075
One over zero is not defined.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:47.127
It is was zero over zero,
we wouldn't necessarily be

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.163
done yet but it's indeterminate form

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:51.968
as we will learn in the future
there are tools we can apply

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:54.372
when we're trying to find
limits and we evaluate it

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:56.361
like this and we get zero over zero.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:57.861
But one over zero.

00:01:58.846 --> 00:02:00.269
This is undefined

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:01.901
which tells us that this limit

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.151
does not exist.

00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:05.135
So does

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:08.380
not

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.803
exist.

00:02:09.803 --> 00:02:10.946
And

00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:11.946
we are done.
