00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.463
As a child, did you ever skin your knee and
fear telling your parents, afraid of your

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:20.340
mom breaking out the brown bottle of pain
containing hydrogen peroxide to “help heal”

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.630
your wound?

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.480
Given the agony it caused, you might have
wondered whether the fizzing liquid was actually

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.640
helping, and why hydrogen peroxide bubbles
when it comes in contact with your skin.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
If you’re still wondering today, well, wonder
no more.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.640
To begin with, hydrogen peroxide does indeed
kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and a whole

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.290
host of pathogens thanks to the fact that
it is a powerful oxidizing agent.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.300
So in theory it seems like a great idea to
pour it on a fresh cut to help prevent infection.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.829
It turns out, however, that while this has
been a staple home treatment for cleaning

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.530
various cuts and abrasions for nearly a century,
you probably shouldn’t use hydrogen peroxide

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.579
to disinfect your wounds.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.220
To better understand why not, we’ll need
to look at what hydrogen peroxide is and how

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.150
it manages to kill microorganisms.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.420
hydrogen-peroxideChemically speaking, hydrogen
peroxide, which is a naturally occurring molecule

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.950
within the human body, is two parts hydrogen
and two parts oxygen (H2O2), with the molecule

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.369
held together by the two oxygen atoms.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.090
As a result of these oxygen atoms having a
very weak bond, the molecule breaks down rather

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.900
easily, potentially introducing free radicals
into your system.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.530
Left unchecked, this would all result in a
host of problems within the human body.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.689
In fact, because hydrogen peroxide’s claim
to fame is primarily its great oxidizing effect,

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.649
up until relatively recently it was thought
that its presence in the body had only damaging

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.649
effects.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.560
However, recent research, such as that performed
by the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.670
Krebsforschungszentrum) in 2014 was able to
show that hydrogen peroxide is an essential

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.740
chemical messenger helping the body’s cells
respond to outside hormones and growth factors.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.119
As Dr. Tobias Dick sums up, “We know today
that the body’s own H2O2 is vital for signal

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.039
processing in a healthy organism.”

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.569
That said, the level of H2O2 must be maintained
in a specific range (between 0.05 micromol/l

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.599
and 117 micromol/l in exhaled breath, and
in human fluid).

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.990
Too much and the damaging effects of oxidation
will cause countless problems that can result

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.920
in cell death, among other issues.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.140
Enter the enzyme catalase, which is found
in almost all living things.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.430
Catalase circulates throughout the cell, waiting
to come into contact with the H2O2 being produced

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.540
by cellular respiration.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.569
Once in contact, it rapidly converts it into
water and oxygen (via two H2O2 molecules becoming

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.620
two H2O (water) molecules and one O2 (dioxygen)
molecule).

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.840
In fact, the catalase is so good at its job,
that it has one of the highest chemical conversion

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.450
rates of any enzyme.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.349
A single catalase molecule can convert millions
of hydrogen peroxide molecules every second.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.290
(It is this water and oxygen being rapidly
produced that results in the fizzing/bubbling

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.250
effect you see when the hydrogen peroxide
comes in contact with the catalase.)

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.599
However, even with this efficiency, residual
hydrogen peroxide will remain, allowing your

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.280
body to maintain the low concentration of
hydrogen peroxide required for normal protein

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.260
signaling, while keeping it from reaching
toxic levels that can destroy a cell.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.270
Like all living things, bacteria, viruses,
and many other pathogens have a myriad of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.439
chemical reactions taking place within their
cells.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.319
Just as the oxidizing effects of hydrogen
peroxide can ultimately potentially interrupt

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.189
these processes, it can also do the same to
bacterial cells.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.730
Thus, if this oxidizing agent is in high enough
concentration, the result is a halt to normal

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.150
cellular processes resulting in the death
of the pathogen.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.599
So why the controversy today on whether you
should use hydrogen peroxide on wounds?

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.510
As just mentioned, this oxidizing agent will
also kill healthy human cells in sufficient

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.599
concentration.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.500
Beyond this, it’s also thought that it may
slow down the mechanisms of healing because

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.480
it interferes with the normal scaffolding
processes involved with repairing skin damage.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.299
(This interruption can also potentially lead
to increased scarring, see: How Scars Form.)

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.260
This is all not to mention that if the oxygen
gas produced by the large amount of hydrogen

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.610
peroxide coming in contact with the catalase
enters your blood stream, it can circulate

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.370
throughout your body leading to countless
medical problems like heart attack, stroke,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.260
or pulmonary embolus.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.700
While you might think this couldn’t possibly
happen, hydrogen peroxide used as a topical

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.270
disinfectant has been implicated in several
fatal and near fatal incidents due to this

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.910
oxygen gas being introduced into the bloodstream.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.730
However, as yet it’s not entirely clear
how the oxygen is getting there.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.150
It may be that excess oxygen enters the capillary
beds themselves, or that H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide)

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.960
molecules get absorbed into the bloodstream
and then, in such relatively high concentration,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.950
create the oxygen embolus.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.690
Whatever the mechanism, the potentially life
threatening complication remains.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.700
So in the end, thanks to the propensity of
hydrogen peroxide to cause damage to healthy

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.050
tissue, combined with the very slight risk
of oxygen emboli after pouring it on a cut,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.000
the use of hydrogen peroxide to clean wounds
is usually not recommended anymore, presumably

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
much to the relief of six year olds the world
over.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.630
As for what you should do when cleaning wounds,
most doctors will point out simply using normal

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.220
saline, a little elbow grease, and some over
the counter topical antibacterial products

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.570
will have a much greater chance of preventing
infection then the hydrogen peroxide would

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:52.100
anyway.
