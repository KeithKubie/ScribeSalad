00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.202
(zooming)

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.071
- Hello everybody,
I'm Greg Proops.

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm going to show you
how to make a martini.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.443 align:start size:97% position:3%
This recipe is by Luis
Buñuel, the great filmmaker

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.644
and this is how that starts.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.780
First we get a shaker
and some ice here.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.684
This is from the Comedy Central
ice machine located right...

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.087 align:start size:97% position:3%
If a cube hits the floor,
that's what children are for.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
They are you
indentured servants.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.090
Have one of them pick it up.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.259
We'll start with a
little vermouth here.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.094
As you can see, this is
At Midnight vermouth,

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.562
a very special brand.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start size:97% position:3%
We pour about, I don't know,
2, 3 ounces of vermouth

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
into the shaker and
then, like James Bond,

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.571
gently, gently, gently.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.341
And then, oh no!

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.842
Are we pouring more
vodka into that?

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.377
Right on top of the vermouth?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.679
No, we're not and this is
the trick that Buñuel knew.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.716 align:start size:88% position:13%
That goes out. That way,
there's a scintilla,

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.720 align:start size:88% position:13%
a jaunt, an iota, a
reminiscence of vermouth

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.722
'cause you don't want the
vermouth to get in the way

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.324
of what the main event
is, which is this fine,

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.661
Peak 7 Vodka made by a
very good friend of ours,

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.962
here at the show.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.531
My strength is enormous.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.933
I'm just gonna rip the
cork out all by myself.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.368
There we go. Mmm.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.139
Now, they've given us
a shot glass to measure

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.442
out the shots of vodka
and what we do with that

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.545
is before we get going,
you're gonna wanna...

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.547
Mmm. That's good Peak 7.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.450
You don't want to measure.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.618 align:start size:84% position:16%
What you want to do
is do it by intuition.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.054
A couple more cubes
of ice here and then,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.957
♪ Lalalalalalalala

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.863
Okay, that ought to
be enough for me.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.698
A little shake.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.700
I like two olives, maybe three

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.470
and so, we'll start with two
and stick those right in there.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:84% position:16%
That goes in first,
maybe a... mmm.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.143
Then, the main event.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.413
(classical music)

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
Right on time. This will
win you into anyone's heart.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
It's the perfect martini because
there's a hint of vermouth,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.355
not that big splashy,
icky puddle of vermouth

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.556
that you want.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.791
You want this to
be an elegant drunk

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.759
because after one,
you're gonna be like,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.261
I'll have another one
and then after two,

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:12.332
you're gonna be like, I
want anyone inside me.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.900
(slurps)

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.136
(groaning)

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:23.309
I can't put you down
'cause I love you.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.379
Smashing.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.250
That is how you make
Luis Buñuel's martini.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.818
And I thank you.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.254
(piano keys)
