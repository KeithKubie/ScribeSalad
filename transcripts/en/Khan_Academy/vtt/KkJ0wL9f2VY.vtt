00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.110
In the last video, we figured
out the formulas for the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.660
observed period and frequency
for an observer sitting in the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.260
path of the source.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.470
So the source is moving
towards the observer.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.910
So this is the example where
the train is moving towards

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.170
you, and you perceive the
train's horn as having a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.170
higher pitch or a higher
frequency.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.490
And we were able to do that by
doing a thought experiment.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.620
Saying, OK, my object
starts here.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.000
After one period-- a period is
just a measure of time, but

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.900
it's the measure of time over
which the source emits a

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.320
cycle, so it emits a
cycle every period.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.130
But after one period, we said,
OK, where is that first wave

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.300
front, or that first pulse,
or that first crest?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.090
And where is the source?

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.950
Because exactly one period has
passed by, and the source will

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.550
be ready to emit another
crest or another cycle.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.180
So the distance between where
the source is and that front

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200
of the crest, or that first
crest, that is going to be the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.800
wavelength.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.340
Because this next thing that
emits is going to be traveling

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.720
at the exact same velocity, and
it's going to be separated

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.530
by that distance, which we
saw is this expression.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.770
We said how long will it take
it to travel that distance?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.440
Well, it's traveling at
a speed of v sub w.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.500
That'll tell you what the
observed period would be for

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.580
this dude over here.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.470
We calculated it right here,
and then the observed

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530
frequency is just the
inverse of that.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.940
Now let's think about the
situation where the observer

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.360
is over here.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.310
So these equations, or these
formulas that we came up with

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.020
right here, this is observer--
or let me say source traveling

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.133
in direction of observer.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.830
Now let's think about the
opposite case, where the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.120
source is traveling away from
the observer, and in this

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.830
case, the observer is
that guy over there.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.890
Maybe I'll do it in
a different color.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.400
He'll be blue.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.510
So this is the observer.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.350
So when we started off, our
source was right here.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.789
After exactly one period from
the source's point of view,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.520
that first crest emitted
has traveled radially

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800
outward that far.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.270
This is the distance.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.020
The velocity of the wave times
the amount of time that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.310
passed-- velocity times time
is going to give you

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.370
distance-- and where the source
of the wave will have

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.650
traveled to the right exactly
this distance.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.500
It's velocity times the amount
of time that's gone by.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.620
Now, in the last video, we said,
OK, that wave is just

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.350
passing this guy.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.080
How long will it take for that
pulse that's being emitted

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.030
right then to also reach him?

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.900
And then that tells us the
period between two pulses or

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.430
between two crests.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.990
Now let's think about that exact
same situation here.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.110
That first crest is just
passing this guy.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.780
And a period, or the t sub s,
which is a period of the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.430
emitted wave has
just passed by.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.150
So this guy is just about to
emit another wave, So?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.270
That other wave is going
to be right here.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.940
So what is the distance between
the crest, or the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.740
cycle, or however you want to
think about it, the pulse that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.610
is passing him by right now,
what is the distance between

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.790
that and the pulse, the front
edge of that pulse that is

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.460
being emitted right
at that moment?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.920
Right at that moment.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.770
Well, it's going to be this
radius, which is this value.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.960
It'll be v sub w times
the period.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.170
That is that distance plus the
amount of distance that our

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.740
source has traveled away
from this guy.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.880
So plus v sub s times
the period.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.760
So that's what this distance is,
and this is how far apart

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.940
this wave pulse is going to be
from that one or this crest is

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.350
going to be from that one.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.030
So if he's seeing this first
crest right now, right at this

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.100
moment, how long will it take
him to see the crest that's

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.790
being emitted right now, that's
this far away from him?

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.350
Well, it's that far
away from him.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.590
So let me write this down.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.525
So the amount of time it takes
for him to see the next crest

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:09.150
or the same point in the next
cycle, that's the period.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.590
That's the observed period.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.130
That's going to be equal
to this distance.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.660
The velocity of the wave times
the period from the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.110
perspective of the source plus
the velocity of the source,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.220
because the source has gotten
that much further away from

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.520
him, velocity of the source
times the period of the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.220
source, so that's how far
the next crest is.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.350
And then you divide it by the
speed of the wave, by the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.970
speed of each of the crests,
which is just the velocity of

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.000
the wave. And we can just factor
out the t sub s's here

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.090
and say this is t sub s times
v sub w, the velocity of the

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.000
wave plus the velocity of the
source divided by the velocity

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.090
the wave. So this will be a
larger observed period than if

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.300
this guy was stationary and
especially if the observer was

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.070
in the path of the guy.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.160
That make sense, because every
time this guy issues a cycle,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.340
he is moving a little
bit further away.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.970
So every crest the same point
in the cycle is going to be

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.810
further and further apart, so
you're going to have longer

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.080
wavelengths, longer periods.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.540
And if you want the observed
frequency for that guy over

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.500
there-- I'll do it in
the same color.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.360
The observed frequency for
a guy where the source is

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.700
traveling away from him is
just the inverse of that.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.050
So one over the period, one over
the period, same argument

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
we did there, one over the
period from the point of view

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.650
of the source is the frequency
of the source.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.810
Let me Color code it.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.240
So 1 over t sub s is equal to
the frequency of the source.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.440
This is the inverse of that.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.570
So I'm just taking one
over everything here.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.950
So 1 over t sub s is the
frequency of the source, and

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.595
then we take the inverse of this
over here: the velocity

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:48.110
of the wave divided by the
velocity of the wave plus the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.910
velocity of the source.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.710
So we're done, at least
for the simple cases.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.700
Obviously, it becomes a little
more interesting when someone

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.930
isn't exactly in the direction
of the source or exactly being

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.210
moved away from, but these are
kind of the two extreme cases.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.590
So this is the situation when
it is moving away from you.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.990
Now, just to check our math and
maybe make it a little bit

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.370
concrete in relation to the
video we did where we

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.220
introduced to the idea of the
Doppler effect, let's actually

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.310
apply those numbers.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.550
So on that video, two videos
ago, we had a situation where

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.520
the velocity of our source was
5 meters per second to the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.310
right, and the velocity of the
wave was 10 meters per second

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.165
radially outward, and the period
of our wave-- I'll call

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:45.580
it the period of our-- let me do
it in another color-- from

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.080
the point of view of the source
was 1 second per cycle,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.580
and the frequency was just
the inverse of that.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.700
So 1 cycle per second,
or 1 Hertz, which

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.550
is a cycle per second.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.450
So using those numbers, let's
see if we get to the exact

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.930
same answer we got in that first
video where we first

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.330
learned about the
Doppler effect.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.910
So let's look at the frequency
from the point of view of this

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.770
gentleman right here.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.680
So the frequency of the source
is going to be 1 cycle per

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.560
second, 1 Hertz.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.940
The velocity of the wave is
10 meters per second.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.430
Let me write this.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.820
1 cycle per second.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.660
The velocity of the wave is
10 meters per second.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.000
The velocity of the wave is 10
meters per second minus the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.150
velocity of the source is
5 meters per second.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.460
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:42.060
The observed frequency for this
guy right there, is going

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:51.210
to be 1 cycle per second times
10 over 10 minus 5, and the

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.620
meters per second cancel out.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.370
Meters per second in the
numerator, meters per second

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.540
in the denominator.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.560
So 10 divided by 10 minus
5, or 10 divided by 5,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.270
is going to be 2.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.470
So it's going to be 2
cycles per second.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.450
And if you want the observed
period for this guy, its going

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.650
to be the inverse of that,
or it's going to be

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.540
1/2 second per cycle.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.470
And this is exactly what we got
in the previous video, or

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.000
actually, it was
two videos ago.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.870
Now what about the guy who this
guy's running away from?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.480
Well, we'll do the
exact same thing.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.610
You have 1 cycle per
second, or 1 Hertz.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.890
That's the emitted frequency
from the point of view of the

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.049
source times the velocity of
the wave divided by the

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.150
velocity of the wave plus the
velocity of the source,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.850
because it's moving
away from him.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.659
So it's 10 over 10 plus 5.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.340
That's 10 over 15.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.920
That is 2/3, so this
is equal to 2/3.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.440
The units over here
all cancel out.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.700
This was cycles per second.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.820
So 2/3 cycle per second, which
confirms the numbers we got in

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.515
that first video, so that should
make us feel good and

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:58.230
it also makes a lot of sense.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.840
This guy is going to see the
wave crest more frequently.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.700
He's going to observe
a higher frequency.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.370
If this is a sound,
a higher pitch.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.300
This guy, since each crest or
the cycles are getting spread

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.050
out, he's going to see them less
frequently, and if this

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.450
is sound, he's going to
observe a lower pitch.
