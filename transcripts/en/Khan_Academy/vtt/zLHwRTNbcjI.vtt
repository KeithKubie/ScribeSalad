00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.083
- [Instructor] As we get
into the late Heian period,

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.394
you start to have the emergence of a

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:09.394
increasingly powerful warrior class.

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:14.368
And all of that comes to
a head in the year 1185,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:18.151
when the Heian period ends and a general

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.151
by the name of Minamoto
Yoritomo comes to power.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.575
And what's significant here
is the notion of an emperor

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.713
continues to exist, but
all of the power resides

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:35.006
in what you can essentially
consider a military dictator,

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.006
or a shogun.

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.158
And the system that emerges
is known as the bakufu system

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:45.163
or the shogunate.

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:48.988
And Minamoto Yuritomo
was the first shogun.

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:52.281
So you can see here, the
emperor still was there,

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.857
but the shogun was where
all of the power was.

00:00:55.857 --> 00:00:57.778
And this is really the beginning

00:00:57.778 --> 00:00:59.819
of medieval Japan.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.319
It's the beginning of the Kamakura period,

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:09.145
named for where the capital
of the Kamakura period was.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:11.535
Now what's distinctive
about medieval Japan

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:13.368
and the bakufu system,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.867
is that it becomes much more decentralized

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.422
than what we had under the Heian period.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:21.409
It's often called a feudal system,

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.805
because it has parallels
to what was going on

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:26.517
in Europe at around the same time.

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:29.611
Where at the top you had this
military ruler, the shogun,

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:30.923
and then beneath the shogun

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.184
you had this decentralized structure

00:01:33.184 --> 00:01:35.610
of these lords, essentially,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.759
that controlled significant
regions of Japan.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.355
They were called the daimyo.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.116
And there were roughly
300 daimyo in Japan,

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:46.855
roughly county sized districts.

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.735
And the daimyo, in order conquer land,

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:51.282
or to protect their own land,

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:55.449
they would support a warrior
class known as the samurai.

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.076
And so they would take their agricultural

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.773
surplus from their lands,

00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:03.415
and use that to support
this warrior class.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.801
And this warrior class, the samurai,

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.235
they were analogous to
knights in medieval Europe

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.469
and just as the knights
had chivalry in Europe,

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.650
the samurai in Japan had bushido

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.324
which eventually emerges
as their code of conduct.

00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:20.472
Despite that decentralized nature,

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:24.639
they were able to fend off
invasions from Kublai Khan.

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.464
So as we've mentioned in other videos

00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:32.631
in the 1270s, Kublai Khan
is conquering much of China

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:37.364
and he also attempts to conquer Japan.

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:39.768
This right over here is
a picture of the Mongols

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:42.949
shooting arrows at a samurai warrior.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.529
Now one of the key factors that keeps

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.239
Kublai Khan from taking over Japan

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.049
is on two different occasions
as they send their boats

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.374
from what we now consider
to be Korea to Japan

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:57.156
they encounter significant
storms that destroy

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:00.422
most of the boats, and so the Mongols

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:04.732
who are able to get to land
are significantly depleted

00:03:04.732 --> 00:03:08.732
and they're pushed back
by the samurai warriors.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:14.361
Now the Kamakura period
continues on until 1333

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.872
when there is a brief, only
a few years restoration

00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:20.732
of the power of the emperor,

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:25.664
but a few years after that
another shogun comes to power

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.081
and that is Ashikaga Takauji.

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:34.285
And this is the beginning
now of the Muromachi period.

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:39.533
The Muromachi period is often
known as the Ashikaga period

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.179
or the Ashikaga shogunate,
but it's named Muromachi

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:47.417
for the district of Kyoto
at which it had its capital.

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:50.957
And even though over the
course of the Muromachi period

00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:52.317
the emperor at different points

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:56.649
was subsumed into the power of the shogun,

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.418
this is considered especially
the later Muromachi period

00:03:59.418 --> 00:04:03.319
as one of the more fragmented
times of Japanese history.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.523
You had many civil wars.

00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:07.847
You had a lot of internal conflict,

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.298
and it was only at the end as we get

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:13.465
to the end of the 16th Century
that Japan gets reunified.

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:16.180
And one of the key factors that allows it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.727
to get reunified is that in
the middle of the 16th Century

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:23.894
Portuguese traders show up and
they introduce guns to Japan.

00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:29.017
And one daimyo in
particular is able to take

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:32.427
significant advantage of those guns,

00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:34.510
and that is Oda Nobunaga.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:40.510
Oda Nobunaga as I mentioned
was a powerful daimyo,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.023
one of these lords who controlled

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:46.280
what you could kind of consider
to be a county of Japan

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.849
and using these guns, he's able to put

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.619
most of the other daimyos,
most of the other lords

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.786
into submission, and he begins
to significantly unify Japan.

00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:00.969
Now he is eventually
assassinated and his successor

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:05.136
Toyotomi Hideyoshi continues
to unify Japan even further.

00:05:08.102 --> 00:05:11.631
When he dies, Tokugawa Ieyasu takes power

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.029
and he's able to consolidate even further

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.798
and definitively becomes
the ruling shogun of Japan.

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:20.929
Now even though this
period that we're entering,

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.248
the Edo period and it's
named for the castle Edo

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:27.208
from which the Tokugawa shogunate ruled,

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:29.065
even though this continues
to be a shogunate

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:34.032
with a shogun in power at
the top, the bakufu system,

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.084
the reason why this is
considered the beginning

00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:39.307
of the modern period or
the early modern period

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:43.457
is that Japan was finally unified again.

00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:44.926
Now one thing that we will see

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:47.733
as we get into the 19th Century,

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:49.740
as we get into the end of the Edo period

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.483
and then you have the Meiji restoration

00:05:51.483 --> 00:05:53.478
where you have imperial rule again

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:57.598
is that Japan is very good
at borrowing technology

00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:02.080
and ideas from other cultures
and then making it their own.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.843
We saw that in the classical period

00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:07.430
where they imported ideas
of Confucianism, Buddhism,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.756
imperial government from the Chinese,

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:12.082
but adding their own flavor to it

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:14.744
and we will see it again as
we get into the 19th Century

00:06:14.744 --> 00:06:18.523
when Japan is one of the first
countries not just in Asia,

00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:21.117
but in the world to truly industrialize

00:06:21.117 --> 00:06:23.087
by learning many of the technologies

00:06:23.087 --> 00:06:25.670
that get pioneered in the west.
