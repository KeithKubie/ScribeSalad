the genome I mean the reason a tumor

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
the genome I mean the reason a tumor
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.889
the genome I mean the reason a tumor
grows is because the cells in that tumor

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
grows is because the cells in that tumor
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.259
grows is because the cells in that tumor
have picked up glitches they've picked

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
have picked up glitches they've picked
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.240
have picked up glitches they've picked
up mutations they picked up changes in

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
up mutations they picked up changes in
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.749
up mutations they picked up changes in
the DNA that make those cells grow out

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
the DNA that make those cells grow out
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340
the DNA that make those cells grow out
of control it's like pressing and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
of control it's like pressing and
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.810

accelerate in a car and just keep it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
accelerate in a car and just keep it
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.010
accelerate in a car and just keep it
going it's just grows and grows and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
going it's just grows and grows and
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870
going it's just grows and grows and
grows and grows and the reason why is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
grows and grows and the reason why is
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240
grows and grows and the reason why is
because something's broken in the genome

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
because something's broken in the genome
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.300

and so what's happened in the past ten

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
and so what's happened in the past ten
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.740
and so what's happened in the past ten
years in particular since the end of the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
years in particular since the end of the
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419
years in particular since the end of the
human genome project is the recognition

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
human genome project is the recognition
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.380
human genome project is the recognition
that we can read out the genome the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
that we can read out the genome the
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.790
that we can read out the genome the
sequence of the tumors DNA and gain

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
sequence of the tumors DNA and gain
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910
sequence of the tumors DNA and gain
insights from that tumor with respect to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
insights from that tumor with respect to
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650
insights from that tumor with respect to
what have been the DNA changes that have

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
what have been the DNA changes that have
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.040
what have been the DNA changes that have
led to that those cells becoming a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
led to that those cells becoming a
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650
led to that those cells becoming a
cancer and that is being done in a very

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
cancer and that is being done in a very
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389
cancer and that is being done in a very
large scale in many countries around the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
large scale in many countries around the
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189

being collected from people and those
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729
being collected from people and those
genomes of those tumors are being read

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
genomes of those tumors are being read
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.609
genomes of those tumors are being read
out and have all that data be put on the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
out and have all that data be put on the
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.050
out and have all that data be put on the
internet for scientists to be able to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
internet for scientists to be able to
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420
internet for scientists to be able to
collect it all and analyze it and we are

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
collect it all and analyze it and we are
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.859
collect it all and analyze it and we are
learning a tremendous amount about

learning a tremendous amount about
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230
learning a tremendous amount about
cancer and many very interesting and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
cancer and many very interesting and
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.020
cancer and many very interesting and
surprising ways and among the many

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
surprising ways and among the many

us insights about how to better classify

us insights about how to better classify
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039
us insights about how to better classify
different types of cancer and different

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
different types of cancer and different
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.760
different types of cancer and different
subtypes of cancer and I often make the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
subtypes of cancer and I often make the
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.789
subtypes of cancer and I often make the
points that some of the earliest

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799
points that some of the earliest
 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.499

implementation of genomics in the
medical situation is going to be with

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
medical situation is going to be with
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.990
medical situation is going to be with
cancer and it's already happening now

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
cancer and it's already happening now
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490
cancer and it's already happening now
and I think it's gonna grow considerably

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
and I think it's gonna grow considerably
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.039
and I think it's gonna grow considerably

where I think standard of care for many
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660
where I think standard of care for many
types of cancer are gonna be get that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
types of cancer are gonna be get that
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.480
types of cancer are gonna be get that
tumor read out its DNA sequence its

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
tumor read out its DNA sequence its
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819
tumor read out its DNA sequence its
genome and based on what you've seen

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
genome and based on what you've seen
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340
genome and based on what you've seen
what's wrong with that tumor not by

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
what's wrong with that tumor not by
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440
what's wrong with that tumor not by
looking at it under a microscope only or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
looking at it under a microscope only or
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020
looking at it under a microscope only or
by looking at it in a sort of a gross

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
by looking at it in a sort of a gross
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359
by looking at it in a sort of a gross
fashion but actually looking inside its

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
fashion but actually looking inside its
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069
fashion but actually looking inside its
blueprint you will be able to have a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
blueprint you will be able to have a
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.950
blueprint you will be able to have a
much better way of deciding what types

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
much better way of deciding what types
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690
much better way of deciding what types
of treatments to pursue and have a much

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
of treatments to pursue and have a much
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330
of treatments to pursue and have a much
better idea about what's wrong in that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
better idea about what's wrong in that
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130
better idea about what's wrong in that
kind of tumor and some of those things

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140
kind of tumor and some of those things
 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710
kind of tumor and some of those things
will also be very helpful for leading to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
will also be very helpful for leading to
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.550
will also be very helpful for leading to
possibly new developments of therapy

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560
