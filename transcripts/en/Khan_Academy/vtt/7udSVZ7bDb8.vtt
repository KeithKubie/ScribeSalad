00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.161
- [Voiceover] In the vidoe on protein structure,

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.620
we talked about the different orders of structure,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.260
starting with primary structure,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.020
and this is all a bit of a review right now.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.430
Primary structure is just a sequence of the amino acids.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.686
But then from there we can start thinking about how does it

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:17.990
get shaped by thinking about the secondary structure.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.890
And secondary structure is all about interactions of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.870
actual backbone, and we went into some depth

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.746
in the overview video where we talked about

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.720
some of the more typical secondary structures.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260
We talked about the parallel beta-pleated sheets,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.400
and over here I have two backbones.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.100
They're oriented in the same direction.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.630
Nitrogen, alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.260
And I just drew the side chains as these generic R groups.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
And what we saw is you can have hydrogen bonding

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.300
between these backbones, and that was

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.890
a parallel beta-pleated sheet.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.630
Or if they're oriented the other way,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.320
this one's going nitrogen, alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.168
This one's going carbonyl carbon, alpha carbon, nitrogen.

00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:00.360
Well now you have an anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.390
and once again, this is interaction of the backbone.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.590
Or you could have an alpha helix like this

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.190
where you have hydrogen bonds between

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.800
the different layers of your actual helix.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.390
And then we can get to tertiary structure,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.400
and tertiary structure is where we

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.630
finally talk about interactions of the side chains,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.090
where we start to think about, well,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.640
what are these R groups and how would these R groups

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
actually affect the entire shape of the protein?

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.140
And to help us think about that a little bit,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.471
I've drawn a few visuals down here.

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:34.260
And so what you could imagine,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.700
you could imagine this orangish-brown

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.060
string curve that I've drawn here,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.050
let's just assume for the sake of visualizing

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.560
that that's our polypeptide backbone.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.120
And just as a bit of review,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.290
you could think about your first order,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.550
your primary structure, which would be about,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.200
okay, I have that amino acid, then I have this amino acid

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.730
and then I have that amino acid.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.510
So that sequence, the sequence is your primary structure.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.039
Then you could have interactions between the backbone,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.560
and so that could be maybe this is a, this right over here,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.220
this is an anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.390
right over here where you have hydrogen bonds.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.900
I'm trying to draw a dotted line, but it's really small.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.478
Where you have the hydrogen bonds

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:23.130
right over here between these two backbones.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.384
I haven't drawn the side chains here.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.960
You could have an alpha helix here.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.510
Once again, you have hydrogen bonds

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.350
between the layers of the helix.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.460
But now let's talk about tertiary structure.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.130
And tertiary structure's about the side chains.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.890
So one example of tertiary structure,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.130
here I've drawn a bunch of side chains.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.260
This is from valine, I haven't drawn the backbone.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590
The backbone's up here.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.830
And obviously, none of this is drawn quite to scale.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.190
But the valine side chain, its R group is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.250
pure hydrocarbon, which is hydrophobic.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.620
And so one common interaction you might see

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.850
from side chains is hydrophobic side chains

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.960
are not gonna want to be on the outside

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.160
of a protein molecule that's inside of an aqueous solution,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.330
that's being exposed to water.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.192
So this might wanna clump into the center,

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:12.890
and so that might affect how that chain,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.100
how the polypeptide chain is bent

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.080
or how the whole protein is shaped.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.270
So these, for example, these might be hydrophobic.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.590
These would be hydrophobic here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.760
and kind of they're clumping away from the water.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.100
And I'm drawing everything in two dimensions,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.630
but obviously proteins exist in three dimensions,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.290
which makes their shape so interesting

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.210
and oftentimes hard to fully process.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.964
You could have something like serine

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:42.100
which has a hydroxyl group on its side chain.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.630
And a hydroxyl group, one, since it's polar,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.798
we know oxygen is a lot more electronegative than hydrogen,

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:52.197
so the oxygen's going to have a partially negative charge.

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.590
This hydrogen's going to have a partially positive charge.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.528
So that's going to allow this side chain

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.320
to be more hydrophilic, so it might sit on the outside

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.190
of a protein in contact with an aqueous solution.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.820
Or it might even allow it to form hydrogen bonds

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.520
with other side chains.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.130
So let's say that you had the side chains go like this.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.041
And once again, I'm not drawing it anywhere near to scale.

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.110
I'm exaggerating the size of these side chains.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.019
But maybe you have another side chain that,

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.060
I'll just draw it like this.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760
You have another side chain that at some point,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.490
you know, it's got a bunch of stuff.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.000
And then it has a, I'll just draw dots here.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.120
It has a bunch of stuff, but then it has

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.000
an oxygen bound to a hydrogen.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.590
Bond to a hydrogen.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.350
Well, maybe you have some hydrogen bonding

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.250
going on like that, so that would also

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.630
keep this structure in place.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.405
You could have situations where you have

00:04:52.405 --> 00:04:55.700
ionic side chains, side chains that have charge.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.850
So maybe this side chain right over here,

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.950
maybe it has a positive charge.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.528
And our polypeptide backbone,

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:08.030
let me loop it back this way just like that.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.134
You could have another side chain.

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:12.371
You could have another side chain that has

00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:15.420
a net negative charge, and so these

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.290
are going to be attracted to each other

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.420
and you're going to have an ionic bond.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.231
You can even have covalent bonds between side chains.

00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.160
This right over here, this is a typical covalent bond

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.750
that might be formed between two cysteine side chains,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.780
both of which contain sulfur.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.320
When they're left to their own devices,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.990
each of these sulfurs, let me just,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.960
so it's cysteine, this is the nitrogen,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.390
this is the alpha carbon, this is the carbonyl carbon.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.360
So I'm trying to draw the section of it that is cysteine.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.400
So when it's not in one of these disulfide linkages,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.390
this sulfur right over here would have

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.000
a covalent bond with a hydrogen.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.460
But under the right circumstances,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.100
it can form a covalent bond with another sulfur.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.350
And in this case, it's another cysteine side chain

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.260
right over here, and this thing over here,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.060
this is a disulfide bond

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.260
or disulfide linkage, sometimes called.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.800
And so you can imagine if let's say this was

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.490
a cysteine molecule, this part of the backbone,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.150
this is cysteine, this is cysteine,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.360
that their two side chains can form

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.100
this disulfide linkage, and so that would kind of

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.270
provide kind of almost a clip to clip those two parts of,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.593
or that part of this entire polypeptide together.

00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:32.800
So hopefully this gives you an appreciation

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.500
for all of the interactions that might occur

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.740
to give a protein a structure.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.600
And then last but not least, of course,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.800
you have the quaternary structure, which is

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.596
how do you fit together multiple polypeptide chains?

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:48.230
And all of these, this whole series of videos,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.250
is just to give you an appreciation for,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.630
even if you know the sequence,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.890
the different shapes and the different interactions

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.620
that a protein can actually have,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.260
and that's what gives proteins their complexity,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.890
their beauty, their ability to provide

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.590
all of these functions to catalyze reactions as enzymes,

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.200
to be signals as hormones, to provide structural integrity,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.220
to help transport oxygen, as in the case

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.480
of something like hemoglobin.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.291
And it's a huge area of research.

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:16.030
Even if you know the sequence, what is the shape

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.660
of that protein, and based on that shape,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.300
how can we use that to think about

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.190
how to manipulate that protein in different ways

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.660
or who knows?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.260
So it's a fascinating area of research.
