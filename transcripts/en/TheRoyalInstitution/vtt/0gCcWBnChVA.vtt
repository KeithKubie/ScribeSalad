00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.500
We make a lot of assumptions about the world
around us, often based on experience.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.700
These assumptions help us make judgments and
decisions quickly,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.480
but they're not always correct.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.660
In this activity you and your kids will try

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:33.350
to confuse your brains with an unusual mask.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.950
Tadaaa. Here we go!

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.490
Have you seen something like this before?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.280
No, but it looks like an illusion because
you're not sure if it's coming this way or

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280
that.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.260
What are you doing Daniel? Why are you moving
around?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.570
It's moving with me!

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.820
Ahh that's creepy!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.260
Why do you think he's moving as you move?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.980
Because it's an illusion.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.010
This is the 'hollow mask illusion'.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.600
Although the mask is actually concave, bending
inwards,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.060
it sometime looks like it is sticking forwards
out of the base.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.150
This is partly because we expect faces to
be convex, curving out towards us,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.150
and make assumptions about what we're seeing
based on our past experience.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.640
You probably won't have one of these at
home,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.410
but follow the link in the description for
a video to show your kids to start the activity

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.410
off.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.240
So it's funny when you move around

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.870
because it looks as if the eyes are following
you all the time.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.810
It's like his face is following me!

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.750
So do you think we'd be able to make one of
these ourselves?

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.011
Shall we give that a shot?

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:54.030
So we're gonna have a go at making our own
masks.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.960
For that we need some newspaper, and some
wallpaper paste to make papier mache,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.670
and we're going to blow up balloons and make
the masks on the balloons,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.360
so what do you want to do first?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360
Balloons!

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.390
You might have made papier mache masks before,

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.560
and these are made in just the same way,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.230
except you�ll paint the inside of the mask,
rather than the outside.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.940
To begin, blow up a couple of balloons.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
Then use the wallpaper glue to cover the balloons
with thin strips of newspaper.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.480
Once covered, leave them to dry overnight.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.569
Once the shapes have dried,

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.820
you'll have to carefully pop the balloons
inside.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.720
That was awesome!

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.370
Then cut the dried papier mache moulds into
two.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.310
Do you remember the first mask that was of
Einstein, so obviously that was a face.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.880
Do you think this illusion could work with
something that's not a face?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.569
Yes! As long as it has eyes!

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.970
So how can we test it to see if it's going
to work for something that's not a face?

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.310
Just do it! We have four masks, so let's just
do it.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.850
A butterfly or a pattern, something like that?

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.709
OK, shall we have a go at painting that?

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.680
The illusion plays on the fact that our brains
expect to see faces sticking outwards rather

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.890
than inwards.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.050
This is a great opportunity to get kids thinking
about how their brains interpret the world,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.590
and to do some experiments to investigate
further.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.291
Ask the children what sort of patterns they
think would work best for the illusion,

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.489
and how they might test their ideas.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.980
Try painting some masks with faces and others
with random patterns.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.790
You could even try experimenting with masks
that include only some parts of a face and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.610
not others,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.040
like including eyes but no mouth.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.300
Ok we're going to run the same test now as
we did earlier on,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.209
but we're gonna start with this pattern one.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.629
When it comes to testing your masks,

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.320
encourage your kids to experiment with how
they�re viewed.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.349
For example, try looking at them from different
distances,

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.080
or with one eye covered, which will affect
their depth perception.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080
You can also experiment with lighting,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.359
and bringing in other people who haven�t
already seen this type of illusion.

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.639
Ask your kids whether some patterns seem to
work better than others,

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.770
and think about why that might be.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.180
It's likely that masks which more closely
resemble faces will work best,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.870
as this is what your brain has developed to
recognise.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.870
What were the things you needed on the faces
to make it work?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.090
A main focus, or two, like eyes.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.330
They needed to look like a face, basically?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.349
What about how you were looking at them?

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:56.550
If you're too close it doesn't work as well.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.809
When you look at a normal face, what do you
expect it to have or look like?

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:10.849
It's not flat, it's 3D. So instead of it going
in, it's meant to come out.

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:19.360
Ooh! So that's why you get the illusion because
you see it's a face

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.430
and you think it's going to be coming out!

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.920
We've had great fun today. If you want to
have a go at these activities,
