hi I'm Steve Smith um research professor

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.230
 
the question I'm going to discuss today

is how can mark transportation help

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
is how can mark transportation help
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.100

Pittsburgh to use less fuel I'm going to

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110
Pittsburgh to use less fuel I'm going to
 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.950

focus specifically on traffic congestion

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
focus specifically on traffic congestion
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.290
focus specifically on traffic congestion
a problem I've been working on for the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
a problem I've been working on for the
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.160
a problem I've been working on for the
last couple years because of the simple

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
last couple years because of the simple
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.600
last couple years because of the simple
fact that traffic congestion

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
fact that traffic congestion
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110
fact that traffic congestion
particularly in urban areas increases

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
particularly in urban areas increases
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.410
particularly in urban areas increases
fuel consumption and so if we could do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
fuel consumption and so if we could do
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.890
fuel consumption and so if we could do
something about traffic congestion then

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900
something about traffic congestion then
 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.770
something about traffic congestion then
we can certainly make an impact on

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780
we can certainly make an impact on
 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.630

eight hundred dollars if I look at that

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910
eight hundred dollars if I look at that
 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.740

nationwide over 440 urban centers I see

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
nationwide over 440 urban centers I see
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.160
nationwide over 440 urban centers I see
that the product the cost of in terms of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
that the product the cost of in terms of
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.639

we consulted with the city and actually
 

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.840
we consulted with the city and actually
the city suggested that we add in this

ninth intersection and and which would
 

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.580
ninth intersection and and which would
it create a more of a grid pattern which

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:18.590
it create a more of a grid pattern which
 

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.980
it create a more of a grid pattern which
and a more challenging environment for

traffic flow and and this is the the
 

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.130
traffic flow and and this is the the
test side we came up with so so let's

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140
test side we came up with so so let's
 

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.960
test side we came up with so so let's
see if i can find the cursor here there

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:44.970
see if i can find the cursor here there
 

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.780

so the really three dominant flows

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:47.790
so the really three dominant flows
 

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.810
so the really three dominant flows
through this area there's this one

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:49.820
through this area there's this one
 

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.430
through this area there's this one
there's Penn Avenue cutting through Penn

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440
there's Penn Avenue cutting through Penn
 

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.910
there's Penn Avenue cutting through Penn
circle and then there's also this third

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920
circle and then there's also this third
 

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.530
circle and then there's also this third
flow moving back and forth this way so a

00:08:59.530 --> 00:08:59.540
flow moving back and forth this way so a
 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.130
flow moving back and forth this way so a
challenging of that environment so

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
challenging of that environment so
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.860
challenging of that environment so
here's a just a concept of operations of

the basic system that we built to
 

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.750
the basic system that we built to
put into that thing so the basic idea is

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760
put into that thing so the basic idea is
 

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:23.600
put into that thing so the basic idea is
let's see we use the cameras we're

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:23.610
let's see we use the cameras we're
 

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.310
let's see we use the cameras we're
taking real-time video feeds from the

processor that's running our strategy

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.030
processor that's running our strategy
 

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.280
processor that's running our strategy
then this system for each intersection

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.290
then this system for each intersection
 

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.860
then this system for each intersection
will compute a schedule that essentially

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:39.870
will compute a schedule that essentially
 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.760
will compute a schedule that essentially
optimizes the movement of all the

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:43.770
optimizes the movement of all the
 

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.740
optimizes the movement of all the
vehicles that it sees currently through

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:45.750
vehicles that it sees currently through
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.360
vehicles that it sees currently through
the intersection so sort of minimize

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.370
the intersection so sort of minimize
 

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.120
the intersection so sort of minimize
dead time and then based on that

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.130
dead time and then based on that
 

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.920
dead time and then based on that
schedule it'll send commands to the

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:51.930
schedule it'll send commands to the
 

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.450
schedule it'll send commands to the
actual controller the piece of hardware

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:53.460
actual controller the piece of hardware
 

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.180
actual controller the piece of hardware
that actually runs the traffic light and

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.190
that actually runs the traffic light and
 

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.160
that actually runs the traffic light and
enforces the safety constraints once

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.170
enforces the safety constraints once
 

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.670
enforces the safety constraints once
that schedule is built it's also then

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680
that schedule is built it's also then
 

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.680
that schedule is built it's also then
communicated to downstream neighbors and

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:03.690
communicated to downstream neighbors and
 

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.890
communicated to downstream neighbors and
then that gives the that indicates

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:06.900
then that gives the that indicates
 

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.530
then that gives the that indicates
what's coming down the pike to that

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
what's coming down the pike to that
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.900
what's coming down the pike to that
intersection and as its building its

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
intersection and as its building its
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.740
intersection and as its building its
plan it can use it has a now extended

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:15.750
plan it can use it has a now extended
 

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.770
plan it can use it has a now extended
horizon that it can use to do its

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:18.780
horizon that it can use to do its
 

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.780
horizon that it can use to do its
planning and then the whole process gets

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:20.790
planning and then the whole process gets
 

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.600
planning and then the whole process gets
repeated every few seconds so it's very

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:23.610
repeated every few seconds so it's very
 

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.670
repeated every few seconds so it's very
real time we're running recomputing the

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680
real time we're running recomputing the
 

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.580
real time we're running recomputing the
plan detecting new traffic and

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:31.590
plan detecting new traffic and
 

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.550
plan detecting new traffic and
reconnecting every couple seconds so

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560
reconnecting every couple seconds so
 

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.410
reconnecting every couple seconds so
here's a here's a short video of the of

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:38.420
here's a here's a short video of the of
 

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.930
here's a here's a short video of the of
the system in action sort of on the

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940
the system in action sort of on the
 

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.880
the system in action sort of on the
before on the left hand side is the

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:45.890
before on the left hand side is the
 

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.410
before on the left hand side is the
situation before we installed the

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420
situation before we installed the
 

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.660
situation before we installed the
pre-existing control and then on the

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:50.670
pre-existing control and then on the
 

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.370
pre-existing control and then on the
right hand side is the same intersection

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380
right hand side is the same intersection
 

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.110
right hand side is the same intersection
this is the main intersection in the

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120
this is the main intersection in the
 

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.530
this is the main intersection in the
pilot site the pen and pencil

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.540
pilot site the pen and pencil
 

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.190
pilot site the pen and pencil
intersection so this this video is sped

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200
intersection so this this video is sped
 

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.170
intersection so this this video is sped
up to about eight times so we can see

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180
up to about eight times so we can see
 

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.810
up to about eight times so we can see
the more the aggregate flows moving

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820
the more the aggregate flows moving
 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.310
the more the aggregate flows moving
through but if you look closely I think

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320
through but if you look closely I think
 

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.430
through but if you look closely I think
you'll you'll agree that that you've got

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440
you'll you'll agree that that you've got
 

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.300
you'll you'll agree that that you've got
a higher volumes on the left so these

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:14.310
a higher volumes on the left so these
 

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.180
a higher volumes on the left so these
are taken at the same time of day so

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.190
are taken at the same time of day so
 

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.710
are taken at the same time of day so
it's really the improved flow we did a

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720
it's really the improved flow we did a
 

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.129
it's really the improved flow we did a
controlled study of the

00:11:23.129 --> 00:11:23.139
controlled study of the
 

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:29.069
controlled study of the
of the system by performing a series of

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079
of the system by performing a series of
 

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.379
of the system by performing a series of
before and after run-throughs of or

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:31.389
before and after run-throughs of or
 

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:34.650
before and after run-throughs of or
drive-throughs along each of twelve

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:34.660
drive-throughs along each of twelve
 

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.569
drive-throughs along each of twelve
different routes through this pilot site

00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:36.579
different routes through this pilot site
 

00:11:36.579 --> 00:11:38.699
different routes through this pilot site
we kind of picked the twelve highest

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:38.709
we kind of picked the twelve highest
 

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:42.509
we kind of picked the twelve highest
volume routes and growth drove them

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519
volume routes and growth drove them
 

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.150
volume routes and growth drove them
multiple times or over across multiple

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160
multiple times or over across multiple
 

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.900
multiple times or over across multiple
days for each of four different periods

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:48.910
days for each of four different periods
 

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.720

and as we do these driving we did we

00:11:57.859 --> 00:11:57.869
and as we do these driving we did we
 

00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:01.099
and as we do these driving we did we
carried a GPS tracking device that

00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:01.109
carried a GPS tracking device that
 

00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:04.970
carried a GPS tracking device that
essentially recorded our speed our

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980
essentially recorded our speed our
 

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.559
essentially recorded our speed our
travel times and the number stops we

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:07.569
travel times and the number stops we
 

00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:10.829
travel times and the number stops we
made the amount of time we were all

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:10.839
made the amount of time we were all
 

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:15.299
made the amount of time we were all
sitting idle at lights etc and then we

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:15.309
sitting idle at lights etc and then we
 

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.340
sitting idle at lights etc and then we
process that information we did that

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.350
process that information we did that
 

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.429
process that information we did that
both with the pre-existing control plans

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:20.439
both with the pre-existing control plans
 

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.139
both with the pre-existing control plans
that were in place at the intersection

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:22.149
that were in place at the intersection
 

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:25.439
that were in place at the intersection
and then after we installed our system

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:25.449
and then after we installed our system
 

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:28.049
and then after we installed our system
we ran them again to do a comparative

00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:28.059
we ran them again to do a comparative
 

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:31.499
we ran them again to do a comparative
kinds of a kind of analysis one thing we

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:31.509
kinds of a kind of analysis one thing we
 

00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:33.689
kinds of a kind of analysis one thing we
did in aggregating the data we use the

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:33.699
did in aggregating the data we use the
 

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:36.389
did in aggregating the data we use the
traffic volume data to combine the data

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399
traffic volume data to combine the data
 

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.400
traffic volume data to combine the data
along different routes so we get a

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.410
along different routes so we get a
 

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.439
along different routes so we get a
pretty bow mean so as you can see from

00:12:40.439 --> 00:12:40.449
pretty bow mean so as you can see from
 

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:44.900
pretty bow mean so as you can see from
the statistics on this slide the the

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:44.910
the statistics on this slide the the
 

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.309
the statistics on this slide the the
adaptive system actually had a quite a

00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:47.319
adaptive system actually had a quite a
 

00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:51.389
adaptive system actually had a quite a
significant impact on the on several

00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399
significant impact on the on several
 

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:54.629
significant impact on the on several
sort of common metrics ranging from sort

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639
sort of common metrics ranging from sort
 

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.639
sort of common metrics ranging from sort
of an average reduction in traveling

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:56.649
of an average reduction in traveling
 

00:12:56.649 --> 00:13:00.269
of an average reduction in traveling
travel time of 25% an average increase

00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279
travel time of 25% an average increase
 

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:05.189
travel time of 25% an average increase
in speed of thirty-four percent number

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199
in speed of thirty-four percent number
 

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:08.039
in speed of thirty-four percent number
of stops reduced by thirty one percent

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:08.049
of stops reduced by thirty one percent
 

00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:10.650
of stops reduced by thirty one percent
and the wait time reduced by forty

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:10.660
and the wait time reduced by forty
 

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.289
and the wait time reduced by forty
percent so all that sort of translates

00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:13.299
percent so all that sort of translates
 

00:13:13.299 --> 00:13:14.789
percent so all that sort of translates
down off I want to look at fuel

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:14.799
down off I want to look at fuel
 

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:17.789
down off I want to look at fuel
consumption we get an average reduction

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:17.799
consumption we get an average reduction
 

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:21.179
consumption we get an average reduction
in fuel consumption of of 21 and a half

00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:21.189
in fuel consumption of of 21 and a half
 

00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:26.970
in fuel consumption of of 21 and a half
percent so a fairly significant both in

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:26.980
percent so a fairly significant both in
 

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.309
percent so a fairly significant both in
terms of improving the efficiency of the

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:29.319
terms of improving the efficiency of the
 

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:32.310
terms of improving the efficiency of the
process and also improving the

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320
process and also improving the
 

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.080
process and also improving the
the fuel consumption and release of

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.090
the fuel consumption and release of
 

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.640
the fuel consumption and release of
emissions into the into the air so what

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:41.650
emissions into the into the air so what
 

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.950

the pilot test and we sort of looking in

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.030
the pilot test and we sort of looking in
 

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.390
the pilot test and we sort of looking in
two directions right now in the fall we

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:54.400
two directions right now in the fall we
 

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.200
