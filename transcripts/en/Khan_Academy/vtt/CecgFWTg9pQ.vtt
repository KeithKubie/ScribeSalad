00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.850
In the last video we saw
that a geometric progression,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.340
or a geometric sequence,
is just a sequence where

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.700
each successive term is the
previous term multiplied

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.250
by a fixed value.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.310
And we call that fixed
value the common ratio.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.430
So, for example, in this
sequence right over here,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.360
each term is the previous
term multiplied by 2.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.230
So 2 is our common ratio.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.050
And any non-zero value
can be our common ratio.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.450
It can even be a negative value.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.230
So, for example, you could
have a geometric sequence

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.170
that looks like this.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.450
Maybe start at one, and
maybe our common ratio,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.370
let's say it's negative 3.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.860
So 1 times negative
3 is negative 3.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.240
Negative 3 times
negative 3 is positive 9.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.510
Positive 9 times negative
3 is negative 27.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.870
And then negative 27 times
negative 3 is positive 81.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.500
And you could keep
going on and on and on.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.410
What I now want to
focus on in this video

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.960
is the sum of a
geometric progression

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.820
or a geometric sequence,
and we would call that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.150
a geometric series.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.130
Let's scroll down a little bit.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.280
So now we're going to talk
about geometric series, which

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.750
is really just the sum
of a geometric sequence.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.360
So, for example,
a geometric series

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.390
would just be a sum
of this sequence.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.540
So if we just said
1 plus negative 3,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.890
plus 9, plus
negative 27, plus 81,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890
and we were to go
on, and on, and on,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.484
this would be a
geometric series.

00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:43.150
And we could do it
with this one up here

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.191
just to really make it
clear of what we're doing.

00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:51.470
So if we said 3 plus 6,
plus 12, plus 24, plus 48,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.800
this once again is a
geometric series, just

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.450
the sum of a geometric sequence
or a geometric progression.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.940
So how would we represent this
in general terms and maybe

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.820
using sigma notation?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.470
Well, we'll start with
whatever our first term is.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.710
And over here if we want
to speak in general terms

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.990
we could call that
a, our first term.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.350
So we'll start with our
first term, a, and then

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.430
each successive term
that we're going to add

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730
is going to be a times
our common ratio.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.610
And we'll call that
common ratio r.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.899
So the second term is a times r.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.440
Then the third term,
we're just going

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.040
to multiply this one times r.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.275
So it's going to be
a times r squared.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.330
And then we can keep going, plus
a times r to the third power.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.190
And let's say we're going to
do a finite geometric series.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.500
So we're not going to just
keep on going forever.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620
Let's say we keep
going all the way

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.066
until we get to some
a times r to the n.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:03.200
a times r to the n-th power.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.540
So how can we represent
this with sigma notation?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.460
And I encourage you to pause the
video and try it on your own.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.977
Well, we could think
about it this way.

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:15.310
And I'll give you a little hint.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.701
You could view this term
right over here as a times r

00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:18.200
to the 0.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.140
And let me write it down.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.920
This is a times r to the 0.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.180
This is a times r to
the first, r squared,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.540
r third, and now the pattern
might be emerging for you.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.120
So we can write this as
the sum, so capital sigma

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.170
right over here.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.740
We can start our index at 0.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:50.370
So we could say from k
equals 0 all the way to k

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:10.700
equals n of a times
r to the k-th power.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.070
And so this is,
using sigma notation,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.290
a general way to represent
a geometric series where

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.660
r is some non-zero common ratio.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.550
It can even be a negative value.
