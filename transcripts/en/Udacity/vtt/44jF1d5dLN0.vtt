00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's recap our four major expectations. One, a

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.180
time commitment. You need to be sure to set

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.460
aside enough time to complete the course. Two, interaction.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.410
We want you to actively engage with us here

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.140
by answering the questions as we go through

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.750
them. Three, minimal background. You don't need much information.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330
So just bring yourself, and you'll get through the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.290
course just fine. And four, get and give help.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.820
If you need extra additional resources, be sure to check out the links under

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.450
the instructor's notes in the discussion forums.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.290
And as always, help out your fellow

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.760
classmates. If you have information that can

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150
help answer a fellow classmate's question, go

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.540
to the forums and give it a shot. We could always use another genome guide.
