Now let's discuss misuse or
signature detection.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.200
These techniques detect intrusions
by looking at activity data,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.680
seeing if there's a match of
known intrusion patterns, and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.060
if there's a match this
activity is intrusion.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.490
Otherwise it is normal.
