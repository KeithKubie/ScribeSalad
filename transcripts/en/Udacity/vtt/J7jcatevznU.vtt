00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right. Enough about these crazy contraptions. Let's go to clock.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Actually, let's go to something even better than a clock--it's called a chronometer.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And let's think, what are the necessary properties that our chronometer has to have

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if it's going to be used for timekeeping device at sea.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Does our chronometer have to run forever without any external source of power.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Does it have to be periodic--what periodic means, it has some cycle that repeats itself.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If it must be periodic, does it have to isochronous as in does that cycle have to take

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the exact same amount of time every single iteration.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Finally, does it have to be predictable and by predictable I mean

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
even if we know it's isochronous, do we know exactly how long each cycle takes.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check whatever answers you think apply.
