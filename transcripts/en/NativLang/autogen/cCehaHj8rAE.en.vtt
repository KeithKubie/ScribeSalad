it's the voiced velar plosive gut or the
voiceless cut and then it seems to show

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
voiceless cut and then it seems to show

environments where the allophones of n
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120
environments where the allophones of n
show up in Spanish you can move to

bilabial plosive we noticed that in our

bilabial plosive we noticed that in our
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400
bilabial plosive we noticed that in our
examples we would write such a rule like

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410
examples we would write such a rule like
 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.970

this n becomes M in the environment
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.830
this n becomes M in the environment
where it is preceded by a vowel and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.050
I hope you now have a better
understanding of rules and environments

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
understanding of rules and environments
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.790
understanding of rules and environments
and the basics of phonology more general

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
 
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.860
 
you
