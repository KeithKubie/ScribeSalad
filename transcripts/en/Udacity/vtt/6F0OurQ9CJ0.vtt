00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:02.850
&gt;&gt; Laura, no!

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.957
&gt;&gt; Wait Laura, what are you doing?

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.550
&gt;&gt; I'm just trying to give you superpowers, like the Mutant Ninja Turtles.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.255
&gt;&gt; No, that much mutation that fast is just going to kill me.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; Wait well, I'll just do it slowly.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.990
&gt;&gt; No, no, no. Even if you go slower, you won't

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.750
kill me. But, I'm not going to get psychic powers, or anything

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.360
like you read about in graphic novels. I mean, at best

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.050
I might be lactose tolerant or resistant to malaria and HIV.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.710
&gt;&gt; Sounds pretty good to me.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.840
&gt;&gt; But, but, you can't control where the mutation's happen when you do it,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.580
I mean, there's a trade off. With malaria

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.980
it can cause anemia and kill you that way.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.060
&gt;&gt; Maybe I'll just put the ooze down then.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, mutations are already happening all the time

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.236
anyhow, replication errors, UV damage from the sun, and so much more.

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.150
&gt;&gt; God it sounds like dangerous business just existing.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, it is. In this lesson, we're going to

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.900
learn all about how mutation and variation happen in the first

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.350
place and how they spread throughout the population over many generations.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.460
&gt;&gt; Matt, Matt, this sounds like a

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.700
science fiction movie with mutations spreading through populations.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
&gt;&gt; Well, it kind is except we're going to talk

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.780
about real mutation. Knowing what you know about the human genome,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.230
the composition of coding and non-coding regions, tell me right now

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.712
if you think most mutations would be advantageous, detrimental, or neutral.
