00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.688
People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.607
because of the letter "b".

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:22.234
Since it doesn't spell a sound,

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:25.440
most folks can't figure out what it's doing there.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.780
But in spite of what most of us learn in school,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.268
sound is &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; the most important aspect

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:32.414
of spelling an English word.

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:35.695
A word's meaning and history need to come first.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:37.729
To doubt means to question,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:38.739
to waver,

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.202
to hesitate.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:43.780
As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.146
The present-day English word "doubt"

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.786
started as a Latin word, "dubitare".

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:52.211
It first moved from Latin into French

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:56.471
where it lost both its "buh" sound and its letter "b".

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:59.421
And then it came into English in the 13th century.

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:01.347
About 100 years later,

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:05.459
scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.466
started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling,

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.501
even though no one pronounced it that way.

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.186
But why would they do this?

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.080
Why would anyone in their right mind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.151
reinsert a silent letter into a spelling?

00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:21.178
Well, because they knew Latin,

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:26.532
the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it.

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:30.189
Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.756
the "b" was kept because it marked important,

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.339
meaningful connections to other related words,

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.158
like "dubious" and "indubitalbly,"

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.372
which were subsequently borrowed into English

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:43.802
from the same Latin root, "dubitare".

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.098
Understanding these historical connections

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.399
not only helped us to spell "doubt,"

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.403
but also to understand the meaning

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:53.068
of these more sophisticated words.

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.197
But the story doesn't end there.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:56.431
If we look even deeper,

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.462
we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt,

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:02.782
just how revealing that "b" can be.

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.508
There are only two base words in all of English

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.796
that have the letters "d-o-u-b":

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:10.574
one is doubt,

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:12.528
and the other is double.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.372
We can build lots of other words

00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:16.020
on each of these bases,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.990
like doubtful

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.344
and doubtless,

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:19.513
or doublet,

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:20.564
and redouble,

00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:22.066
and doubloon.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.508
It turns out that if we look into their history,

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:26.807
we can see that they both derive

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:29.287
from the same Latin forms.

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:31.260
The meaning of double,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.133
two,

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.778
is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt.

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:37.319
See, when we doubt,

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.831
when we hesitate,

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.497
we second guess ourselves.

00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:43.675
When we have doubts about something,

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:46.129
when we have questions or confusion,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.876
we are of two minds.

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:51.544
Historically, before English began

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:53.234
to borrow words from French,

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:55.506
it already had a word for doubt.

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:59.152
That Old English word was "tweogan,"

00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:01.585
a word whose relationship to "two"

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:05.288
is clear in its spelling as well.

00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:06.758
So the next time you are in doubt

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:09.457
about why English spelling works the way it does,

00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:11.412
take a second look.

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:16.170
What you find just might make you do a double-take.
