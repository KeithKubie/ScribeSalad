&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Norman Jay MBE, DJ from London,
UK, here in Davos 2008 and if I was given

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.790
an opportunity to change the world, whilst
all the world leaders are here, is make them

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.240
all wear a pair of jeans and I would all give
them a set of headphones so they could listen

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.500
to some music that would chill them out and
maybe they'll understand how the ordinary

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.410
guy on the planet has to live and survive.
