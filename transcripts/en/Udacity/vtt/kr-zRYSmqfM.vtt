00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, to have the tags match, we're beginning a bold here,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
so we'd have to end a bold there.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This second example is a bit more complicated.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have to do these things from the inside out.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We might look over and see, oh, we're ending an italics tag,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so I should begin an italics tag here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But if we do that, things don't balance well.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We look down and we see this bold later.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Actually, this innermost tag--the i here has to balance with the closing i,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
meaning there's a b here--bold--that has to balance with the closing b.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And then here we have an anchor tag beginning,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so we need to have an anchor tag ending.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Shaka was born in about 1787 and throughout his military and political career

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
united quite a bit of the southern part of Africa,

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
although these days his reign is viewed with some controversy.
