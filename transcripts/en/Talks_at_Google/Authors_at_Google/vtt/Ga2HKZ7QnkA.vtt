00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.440
female narrator: Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for joining us today on this lovely,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.850
Friday
afternoon. Making a stop during his book tour

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.370
of his second novel "Whiter Shades of Pale
 : the Stuff

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.440
White People Like Coast to Coast from Seattle
Sweaters to Maine's Microbrews." Authors at

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.780
Google is
thrilled to host Christian for the second

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.130
time. Please join me in giving a warm and
hardy welcome to veteran, white person, Christian

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.030
Lander.
[audience applause.]

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.410
Christian Lander: Awesome! Hey, guys. Thanks
for having me back again. This is awesome.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.730
So,
last time I spoke I to you guys was in the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.210
summer of 2008, and up until that point I
told you the sort of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.360
story of how the blog started off as a joke
with my friend Miles. The Filipino racist

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.570
that I consider one
of my best friends, a proud racist. And how

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.579
it just went from basically an idea on January
18, 2008 to the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.180
New York Times Best Seller by July 14, 2008.
It's a pretty, wild story on the way up you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.610
can hear all
about it on my last talk which is fairly easy

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.000
for most of you people here to access.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.509
But since that day, since I was last here,
a few things have happened to me some very

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.560
interesting
things. So, all throughout 2008 I kept thinking

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.040
to myself every day this blog can't get any
bigger, you

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.999
know, the book, this can't get any bigger
 , this can't get any bigger. and then I talked

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.609
to Google and I
was like this really can't get any bigger.

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.740
And then in August of 08 after I'd left here,
my publicist got a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.119
call from the Conan O'Brien Show or Late Night
with Conan O'Brien . And they said Christian,

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.289
Conan
would like to have you on as a guest.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.299
Now, this completely blew my mind, because
I had spent so much of my life-I mean-I have

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.250
a personal
vendetta against tall guys. Because I really-there's

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.229
a number of reasons-but one I feel like they've
had

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.549
an easier life than me across-the-board with
everything: Sports, women, career, whatever.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.549
It's been
easier.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.219
So like, I always liked to say life worked
out pretty well for me at a driver's license

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.270
5'9". You
can think about that for a minute. But a realistic

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.240
5'8", but you know, if I was , you know, for
every inch

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.950
taller I would have been, my life would have
been 30% better. And so, things worked out

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.369
great at 5'8",
but at 6'1", I would have taken over for Conan.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.700
So, I'm so excited to meet him, he gets a
pass on the tall person thing because he's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.470
funny. But also
because he has red hair, and he knows the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.110
pain that we both went through as children.
Specifically the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.060
nursery rhymes about the color of our pubic
hair. If any of you have redheaded friends,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.000
check this one
out, it happened. And so, I'm actually going

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.111
to be on the show, and this is in 08 and I'm
freaking out.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.410
I'm like Oh my God! This is incredible. I'm
gonna be on Conan O'Brien, I can't believe

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.441
it. So, they're like
, Yep, this is definitely going to happen.

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:35.520
September 6, 2008, it's booked. There is a
100% chance this is

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.550
happening. They cannot take it away from you.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.972
I'm like Oh my God! This is amazing. So, every
day I would go to the NBC website, and I'd

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.680
hit refresh a
thousand times a day, because like I wanted

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.470
to find out who the real celebrities that
are going to be on

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.730
the show. Because it could be anybody, right?
So I'm like refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.800
and it
comes up. And the guest that day is Jerry

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.540
O'Connell .Now, this may not impress all of
you, but this was

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.590
a big deal to me for a number of reasons.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.410
Reason #1: The TV show, "Sliders". No one
watched it, I guess. Uh... it's a great show.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.410
Reason #2: Jerry was on a Canadian TV show
when I was growing up, and I'm from Canada,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.980
called
My Secret Identity. And the show was about

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.230
him as a teenager with superpowers. Specifically
the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.700
superpowers of being able to run really, really
quickly and fly if he sprayed two aerosol

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.000
cans down
towards the ground. I should remind you that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.920
Canadian television is heavily subsidized
by our government,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.570
and while sometimes, it will give us a Degrassi;
other times it will give us "My Secret Identity".

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.660
So, I was super thrilled about that. Like,
I'm really excited, I'll have Slider's, I'll

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.360
have that. All this stuff
was great, but there was one other reason

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.200
I why was thrilled about this one. One massive
reason why.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.630
Please tell me you guys have see the movie
Stand by Me. Right? Yes, okay. So in the movie,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.150
Stand by
Me, Jerry O'Connell is a fat kid. And this

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.220
is especially important because I was a fat
kid. And here's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.220
where it's going. Jerry O'Connell grew up
to marry a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.830
So he is literally
a hero to every fat kid on earth. That you

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.880
can be this chubby at 13 and still grow up
and marry a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.400
swimsuit model. So, I was so thrilled that
I was going to get to go on the show, and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.410
I was going to
meet my fat kid hero. Like I couldn't wait.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.520
And then the other guest was Tim Gunn from
"Project Runway".

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.351
So, totally excited about meeting Jerry, this
is going to be the greatest thing in the world

00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:16.570
and so I get to
New York September 6, 2008. And I'm just-

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.060
I'm freaking out and I'm in my dressing room.
And the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.810
dressing room's really, really small, and
I just remember in front of me was a plate

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.439
of cookies, and I
just remember looking at the cookies thinking

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.219
to myself, don't eat them you'll throw up,
don't

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:30.440
eat them you'll throw up and as a former fat
kid I really wanted the cookie. I'm like,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.574
I want the
cookie. Don't eat it you will throw up, don't

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:32.870
eat it you'll throw up, don't eat it you'll
throw up. So, I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.629
didn't touch the cookies, I just left them
there. And I'm just totally, totally trying

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.639
not to vomit. And my
agent comes up to me and he says listen man,

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.740
you're going to be fine. Don't worry you can
do this, I

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.740
believe in you.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.099
Okay, okay, I can do it. And so once I get
my head together, I started thinking, what

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.789
are you supposed to do
when you're backstage at a late night show.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.539
Like I've never been to one before, I don't
know what

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.810
the etiquette is. Like can I go over to Jerry's
dressing room. You know, and kind of start

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.240
talking to him.
Not on his door and the like-bam, bam, bam-

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.539
Hey uh Jerry, remember when you were- remember
when you were fat? Ha Right? Can I do that,

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.710
really? And then I start having this weird
paranoia. Like oh, my god. And if I do that,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.240
and it doesn't go well he is going to go on
the show and be like- Conan, you have a weird,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.439
fat kid
obsessed guy back there. You need to call

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.020
security as soon as possible and get him out
of here.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.490
And so I'm like, I'm just not going to do
it. I'm going to pretend like I'm cool, I'm

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.620
going to pretend like I've been here before,
I'm

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.699
just going to stay in my dressing room, I'm
just going to stay here until I go on the

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.639
show. And so I'm waiting,
I'm waiting and waiting, and all of a sudden

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.309
there is a knock at my door, and I look over.
And it's Jerry O' Connell.

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:33.259
And he points at my agent and goes "Are you
the guy? Are you the stuff white people like

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.259
guy? Are you the stuff white people like guy?
 "

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.580
My agent goes, "No, him." And I'm about to
open my mouth to say something about how great

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.580
he was
in "Can't Hardly Wait".

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.510
And he goes "Oh my god. I read that blog all
the time; it's so funny. Oh. It's hilarious."

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.360
I'm trying to get one more really, and he
keeps talking about how much he loves it,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.900
"Oh it so funny all the
entries. Oh. It is so great pictures where

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.940
you get those they're incredible."

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.610
I'm like yeah. Sure. Okay. He is like "Look,
man. Stick around after the show. There's

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.949
some people I want you to meet. But I got
to go." -wwisshhh and he's gone. And I just

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.840
look at my agent and I'm like "Man, I
think I just met Jerry O'Connell. This is

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840
great."

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840
And he's like "You're fine man. It's going
to be alright." So then Jerry O'Connell goes

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.259
on the show. He is
absolutely hilarious. He's fantastic. And

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.629
then Tim Gunn goes on the show, and he is
great. Then it's my

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.729
turn to go on the show. Now, everything that
I tell you from this point on is based on

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.639
the Tivo'd episode
of the show because I blacked out the whole

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.139
time I was on there. I don't remember any
of this

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.059
happening. I remember walking out and I remember
getting off the stage. So all this from the

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.059
TiVo'd episode.

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:30.499
So, I get out there, and you have to understand
the layout of the show. Conan was here, I'm

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:33.509
here, Tim
Gunn's here, and Jerry O'Connell's here. So

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.189
you get the layout, it's like 3 couch- I'm
closest to Conan,

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.690
Tim Gunn, Jerry O'Connell. So, I'm out there
and the first question Conan asks me, "So,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.389
Christian , what
are some things white people like?" I go,

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.759
"Well, you know, farmer's markets." Right?

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.699
And Conan's like, "Yeah, we do." And Tim Gunn's
like, "Uh Huh." And Jerry O'Connell's going

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.490
like, "Oh, my god!
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard!

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.509
Oh, that's where I get my onions."

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.650
Right? And so I look over and I'm like, man,
this is going great. And then Conan asks me

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.919
another
Question, "Well, Christian, we've got Tim

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.002
Gunn on the show tonight. What are some clothes
that white

00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:08.139
people like?"

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.370
And I'm about to open my mouth and about to
say something when I feel a hand, and I'm

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.580
wearing a cardigan
sweater at the time, because I wear a lot

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.900
of cardigans. And I feel a hand pinching me.
And I look over

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.759
and Jerry O'Connell has reached over Tim Gunn
and is pinching my cardigan, looking me in

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.759
the eye and
is going, "Sweaters, white people like sweaters.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.960
Say sweaters." And I always try to tell myself-
like you know what, I am the guy who could

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.309
be cool enough to be like "Yeah, hey Conan,
Jerry's right, we like sweaters."

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:42.110
No, I'm looking at my fat kid hero reaching
over a reality television superstar, pinching

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.930
me on national
television . And so I just look at him like

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.559
[gasping]. I go back to Conan, I-I got nothing,
I'm

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:58.319
reaching back I got nothing. I go, [gulps]
"Um, shorts." And Jerry hits the floor.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:05.801
He's like, "Oh, my god! We wear them too early.
That's so funny." And I just look at him like,

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:07.750
man this is
the greatest interview ever. And then I look

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.680
at Tim Gunn and I'm like, "Well maybe not."
And go back to

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.800
Conan, we keep talking, the interview finishes,
and I'm like, oh my god, that was incredible.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.300
I was just
on Late Night with Conan O'Brian. I need to

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.539
call some ex-girlfriends. Because I will tell
you if you ever

00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:26.710
do anything that gets marginally famous, the
first thing you'll think about is I need to

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.949
call some ex-
girlfriends. And so I'm back stage and I hear

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:34.160
that huge voice. "Christian, Christian!" I
go-"Huh". And I turn around, and it's Jerry

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.120
O'Connell. And he goes, "Oh, man, that was
the funniest thing ever out there. It was

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.030
awesome. Here are those people I wanted you
to meet. It's my parents."

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:45.890
In my head I'm like, I didn't know we were
at this stage in the relationship yet, Jerry.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.480
But um all right.
And so, all of a sudden, his phone rings and

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.250
he is like I've got to take this. So now on
alone backstage of the

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.460
Conan O'Brien show with Jerry Connell's parents,
and thank God they filmed that show in Toronto

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.710
where I grew up. Because we just talked about
intersections and it filled the horribly awkward

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.340
silence
that was beginning to set in, and Jerry comes

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.640
back. And he is like, "Oh, man that is so
funny that is so

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.820
hilarious. Let me get your info when we get
back to L.A., let's all hang out." And I'm

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.400
like, yeah sure Jerry.
So I take down the info, and, you know, and

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.740
I leave, and I'm thinking to my myself.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.680
It's super awesome that I have this information,
but like how do you ever contact him again,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.270
and in not
a weird way. Like hey man, remember me? You

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.570
know like super weird. So, like where does
it come

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.100
from? I let it go and I thought that was a
really awesome experience and I may or may

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.080
not have a fake
e-mail address here, but I'm just going to

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.240
go back home and everything is going to be
fine.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.260
So, I go back home. A couple of weeks later,
I get invited to be on "Later" with Carson

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.670
Daly. Where I was
the headliner. It's a pretty big-time show,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.860
if you can't tell, and everyone was really
nice though. But it

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.650
was kind of weird to be like the top billing.
So, I get there and I'm in my dressing room

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.001
and everything's great and I look on the wall
and on the wall is a picture of Jerry O'Connell

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:56.380
singing. And my wife goes
to me, she's like look you are never ever

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.080
going to find another non-weird opportunity
to send him an e-mail. You need to write something

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080
now.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.451
I'm like, Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to do
it. So I take my phone out and I write a quick

00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.010
message. I'm just like, "Hey, Jerry. I don't
know if you remember me, we were on Conan

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.900
O'Brien
together a couple of weeks ago. I'm back stage

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.550
at Carson Daly's, because I'm going to be
on the show

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.160
tonight and there is a picture of you in the
dressing room. Thought it was kind of funny.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160
Christian."
Send.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:23.700
Boop- Awesome, I'm Tivoing it right now. Jerry.
And so, I'm just looking at my phone being

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.970
like, what
has happened to my life. Like nine months

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.010
ago, I was goofing around on the Internet
with Miles, and

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:36.940
now I might have to get a restraining order
against my fat kid hero. This is insane.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.880
And so that was happening in 2008. I couldn't
believe it. So I'd been on Conan O'Brien.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.720
I'd been on Carson Daly. And it was
absolutely insane.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.250
And so the book kept doing really, really
well. And then really interesting thing happened

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.130
with the book, was licensed to do some international
editions. So the book went to Australia, where

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.380
it was a
best seller. It just sold really well in Australia.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.410
There's white people there. Uhh. It sold really
well in the

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.620
U. K. as well, believe it or not also. White
people there. And it was translated into Dutch,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.950
and the
amazing thing about the Dutch, they are a

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.750
clever people. They, you know, reclaimed all
that water .

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.310
You know, they know they know what they're
doing. Their book is "Stuff White People Like"

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.770
It- I don't speak Dutch. But you know. If
you speak Dutch you can translate it roughly.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.720
And their cover,
instead of the big thumbs up, which I refer

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.490
to as the universal white gang sign. You know
what I mean.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:32.780
Like "Yeah!" It's like we recognize each other.
You know, they actually have a mirror on the

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.160
book so
when you hold it up it says "Stuff White People

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
Like".

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.482
So, the Dutch are sharp. They are very, very
sharp. I appreciate what they did. But it

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:44.360
was really weird
to see all my words translated into a different

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.381
language. And then this year, this is 100%
happening,

00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:53.030
this is not made up, this is 100% legitimate,
the book is being translated into Japanese.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.220
And... but there's
like a million foot notes, you know what I

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.840
mean, to explain like the sarcasm and all
that stuff. But that

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.430
doesn't prevent me from every day, every single
day, I have a dream it's going to become a

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.630
textbook. I
have this fantasy, and it's a recurring fantasy,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.660
of being at the airport at LAX, Tom Bradley
International

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.770
Terminal. I see Japanese businessmen coming
out of the terminal, wearing Fleet Foxes T-shirts,

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.020
you
know I mean. And leaning forward and go, "What

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.310
is organic coffee? " [Japanese accent] Alright?
And then

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.250
like, then later on I'm at the coffee shop
and I see them having a business meeting and

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.530
they're flipping
through the book and their like, "Oh so, Frisbee

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:35.820
sports?" You know, "Your son is gifted?" You
know,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.230
and then somehow being able to negotiate a
better deal with the American business. And

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.710
you know,
it's my small part to create a trade imbalance

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:49.270
between the two nations. I just, I just dream
every day

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.550
that that is going to happen. It is just unbelievable
all the stuff that's happened in terms of

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.550
the book.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.290
And then an amazing thing happened. The book
was optioned to become a TV show. And I was

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.800
hired
to write it with a really great director.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.460
It wasn't awesome process. It didn't go anywhere.
That's sort of

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.440
just how television works. But the concept
of the show was the wrong kind of white guy,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.200
learning how
to become the right kind of white guy from

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.270
a black guy. And, you know, the black guy
carried around a

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.720
moleskin notebook with all of these notes
that he's learned from all of his time with

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.560
white people. It
stemmed from the fact that when I started

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.900
the site so many people thought that was black.
And you

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.950
know what I mean. Then when they found out
I was a white Canadian, they were super disappointed.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.540
Literally, the exact disappointment I felt
at 13 years old, you know I mean. Like dammit

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.510
I'm a white
Canadian, I wish I was something else. And

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.430
it's been funny, actually I've met a lot of
black people who've

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.400
come up to me, they're like, "You know what
man? Come on. This is kind of ridiculous.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.090
We've been
saying this for years. Why didn't one of us

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.460
write it down?" And so, that would have been
the TV show, it

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.980
would have been really funny, the whole thing
was going to be set at like a Tom's of Maine.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.280
Or you
know I mean like a Burt's Bees type company

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.860
with a tag line "Saving the World through
Vanity", which

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.810
is sort of the joke, but sadly, ultimately,
you know, it-it-it didn't happen.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.610
And then the other thing that happened that
was kind of unexpected with the site is the

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.080
spin-offs.
There have been so many spin-off sites it's

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.490
unbelievable. Three books have actually been
published:

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.500
"Stuff Christians Like" was published, "Stuff
Midwesterners Like" was published, "Stuff

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.990
Hipsters Hate" was
published. And these are just like all; these

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.680
are people who got book deals basically using
this concept.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.880
And then the sites itself that have spun out
of this are amazing. There is: Stuff Black

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.130
People Like, Stuff
Latinos Like, Stuff Asian People Like, Stuff

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.280
Gay People Like, Stuff Gay Parents Like, Stuff
Hill People

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.340
Like, Stuff Unemployed People Like, Stuff
Hollywood Assistants Like, Stuff Dutch People

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.670
Like, Stuff
Australian People Like, Stuff Korean People

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.660
Like, and so forth and so forth and it keeps
going and a

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.970
few of them really stand out as brilliant.
In Australia, they made a site called Stuff

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.500
Bogans Like, and-and
we have in Australian knows what that is.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.120
The rough translation is it's kind of like
a frat boy, but it's

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.260
really hard to find a one to one translation.
So basically it's stuff frat boys like, but

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.650
they also created a
website called Stuff Goths Hate that just

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:06.290
redirects back to the Stuff Bogans Like website.
And I'm just

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.220
like, man, why didn't I think of that?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.010
And then there's another site that someone
created, and I actually got to meet the creator

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.180
of it and I-I
just almost punched him out of jealousy. He

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.000
created a site called White Stuff People Like.
And its

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.130
entries were like: sugar and cocaine and plaster.
And I was like damn it, man. I could have

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.300
had two. It
would just take a little word swap and I would

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.510
have had two. So you know, this was sort of
the wild

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.610
ride that happened. In the last couple of
years I've actually had time to think about

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.120
answering the
questions that people ask me like, why did

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.260
the site get so popular? Why did the book
get so popular?

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.530
What happened? And I keep thinking back to
it. I mean, luck is obviously a huge part

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.340
of it, but I realized
that it was basically two things helped the

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.340
site grow.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.970
1. Were people who would get to the website
and they'd start clicking on it. And they'd

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.910
look through
it, and they'd be like okay, yeah, I like

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.320
that, all right, yeah I like sushi, who doesn't
like sushi? all right I

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.370
got it. okay, yeah I like kitchen gadgets.
okay, hold on let me just take a look at the

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:11.420
full list here. Oh my
god! Did I leave my webcam on? What the hell's

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.500
going on here? And it's sort of that fun and
horror. Oh

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:21.120
yeah the World Cup is coming up. Uh, you know,
like that sort of horror that like my entire

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.500
life has been
spelled out in this list and sort of sharing

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.930
that experience. So, that was one reason why
it got popular.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.270
But I think the other reason it got popular
and why it got sent around so quickly were

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.529
people going to
the site going like yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:37.260
yep, I know this asshole, hang on. Forward-Forward,
title:

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:42.530
Think you're unique? Send. Boom. And it went
from there. It was like a giant check to white

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.480
people.
And so I think those were-those were some

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.570
of the nominal reasons why I think it got
big. Those are

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.100
the surface reasons, but there were, I think
some marginally intelligent reasons behind

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.200
why it got
popular.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.250
And I think the first reason why is this whole
concept of being white. Now, I always like

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.930
to say- you
don't have to be white to be white, you just

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:07.490
have to be rich. And so to further illustrate
that point in

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:14.740
the new book, the regional white person for
San Francisco is actually an Asian woman.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.220
That's how I
explain the power of San Francisco, a city

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.809
so white it can turn other races white. It's
incredible. And so

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:25.030
this idea all came from my high school experiences.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.780
So, I grew up in Toronto, Canada went to a
very interesting high school called Jarvis

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.880
Collegiate. And it is
right downtown Toronto. To give you an idea

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.180
of how the school worked, we were this amazing,
amazing school that drew students from the

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.460
richest neighborhood in Toronto, Rosedale;
two middle

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.960
class neighborhoods, and two of the poorest
neighborhoods in Toronto, a housing project

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.980
and a place
for mostly new immigrants called Jamestown.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.140
We all ended up going to the same high school.
And

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.620
what was really amazing was that literally
every ethnic conflict on Earth played itself

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.780
out at my high
school. Specifically the wrestling mat, because

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.590
we had a gym teacher with a political science
degree,

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:04.190
and he thought it was funny to have Tamils
and Sri Lankans wrestle each other or to have

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.800
Serbs and
Croats wrestle each other. And it was believe

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.760
it or not actually fantastic, no one ever
got seriously hurt,

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.120
but when Ned and Marco were on the mat. BOOM!
Everyone just poured into the gym to watch

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.970
it
happen. And so we had this really amazing

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.280
mix of sort of immigrants and-before I get
back to that,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.540
there's another thing about my high school
that was interesting.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.559
We were also um- our football field was very
interesting. It wasn't a full size football

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:29.191
field. And I was
on the football team. And I was actually a

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:34.110
two year varsity starter at offensive line.
That's what

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.110
happens when your school is mostly made up
of, you know, Chinese and Sri Lankan immigrants.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.300
I am
actually one of the fatter guys at the school.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.840
And so, we would practice in the mornings,
and the

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.860
amazing thing about the school was the area
around the field was the main ring for transvestite

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.920
prostitutes in the city of Toronto. And so
we practiced really early in the morning when

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.990
they were
ending their shift, and some interesting things

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.130
happened. On one hand, they were prostitutes,
but on

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.830
the other hand they were also Canadian and
they had a sense of humor. And so in the morning,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.020
you
know, the offensive line would get ready and

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.910
every time we would bend over, they whistled
at us.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.309
And I always say as a 15 year old boy this
causes you to come to grips with your sexuality

00:19:11.309 --> 00:19:17.530
awfully quickly.
Because you realize you have options. For

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:25.300
the record, I did not have sex with any transvestite
prostitutes in high school. And so, back to

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.740
the school, so back to Jarvis Collegiate,
this amazing mix of

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.440
races and cultures all coming together into
one place. And what was interesting is it's

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.080
Canada, so we
had for example we had first generation immigrants

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.850
who were brand new to Canada, but we also
had

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.390
third generation Chinese-Canadians, fourth
generation Indo-Canadians, etc. so, all in

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.160
one place. And
what was amazing that if you liked anything

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.720
on the list from the first book or anything
on the list from

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.880
this book, you were called white. You were
called a banana, an Oreo, a coconut, or whatever

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.250
foodstuff
related to your skin color and had a white

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.010
center at the middle of it. And this was just
a lesson of Jarvis.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.990
We just knew that was going to be the case,
and you were called that by your own people

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.990
essentially.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.920
And so there was one guy at my school, a guy
named Long, and was a great guy, but he was

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.260
third
generation Chinese-Canadian. Long was the

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.150
guy who wore shorts way too early. In the
city you don't

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.890
need to break them out in April. He'd break
them out in February. Long wore Teva sandals

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.281
all the
time, he played hacky sack every single day.

00:20:22.281 --> 00:20:25.480
He had a backpack- like a big back pack, he
went camping

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.720
all the time. He had one of those necklaces,
like they were thick and had a random bead

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.690
here and then
like another one here, no symmetry to it.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.679
You know, he liked jam bands, right. And so
every day,

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:41.690
every day at school, Long got called a banana
over and over and over again. And the thing

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.600
about it was
Long in no way, in no way was ashamed to be

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.720
Chinese. It wasn't that Long was trying to
become white, Long

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:56.550
was just rich. And so because of that, that's
where he acquired these tastes, and that's

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.020
where
acquired the unflattering knick name. And

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.500
so that in and of itself was sort of this
commentary on

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.330
whiteness that was coming through in the book.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.050
Again, that you don't really have to be white,
but what's incredible is that it is this group

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.910
of people,
these progressive, these left wing progressives,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.480
who believe that we are the most progressive
people

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.000
on Earth possibly the most progressive people
in history. And yet our class is still so

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.990
overwhelmingly
dominated by white people that I could put

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.030
a list out like "Stuff White People Like " and
people get it

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.030
right away, people understand it right away.
And so that in and of itself gives you a sense

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.140
of the level of progress that we've actually
had in terms of the upper-middle class liberal

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.390
actually honestly diversifying. And so, when
I bring that point up

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.640
to people, they're always like, well then
you know, what's the solution, like what's

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.630
the fix to this? And
I'm like look, I don't say I have an answer,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.910
but have some things that white people should
stop doing

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.980
that aren't making it any better.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.790
And so specifically, one of the things that
white people like to do is show off their

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:55.430
ethnic friends, and I don't
think this is really helping at all because

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.610
ultimately you're not viewing them as a person;
you're

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:04.461
viewing them as a Pokémon. And I have this
belief that people do view their ethnic friends

00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:06.660
like
Pokémon. You know, gotta collect them all

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.010
and then eventually you know, you have a full
set and you

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.550
get a little red globe or whatever. And it
all- it all works out. But I kept saying like

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.601
that is not the
solution. Having this group of ethnic friends

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.770
is not a racial solution, because all you're
doing is saying

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.621
look at how progressive I am. It's still ultimately
about you. It's not about your friends; It's

00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:25.210
not about
any progression. It's still about you, and

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.910
I just can't stop getting annoyed at white
people that do this.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.559
Because the more I write it and the more I
realize from my one ridiculousness, because

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:35.860
I- I do the
same thing, is a- is that all we want as white

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.360
people, like all we really live for is to
eventually have, you

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.130
know, an old black guy come up to us and tap
us on the shoulder and say, "You know what

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:47.860
man, you're
one of the good ones." That would justify

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.500
our entire existence, literally everything
that we do. I mean

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.290
ideally our dream is that Che Guevara would
come back from the dead and be like "Man,

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.330
you're the
good white people man. Yeah, I support what

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:01.990
you do. Hey, how did I get on that t-shirt?"

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.180
But the reality is if he came back I would
be the first person he killed. I mean, it

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.140
would be like you're an asshole-BANG.
And I would be done and a revolution would

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.970
start, but it didn't. When I just think about
this whole

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.290
process it's just the ridiculousness of what
we do and I just want to have this message

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.040
to white
people: I just wanna tell them take a step

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.450
back, like relax for a second, stop patting
yourself on the back, stop talking

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.870
about how great you are, stop doing everything
about you, and try to do something positive.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.970
And
stop being so snobby. It's not helping. And

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.890
the truth is I thought writing these books
and riding the

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:42.490
blog would actually help me stop being so
snobby. It hasn't worked at all. I try my

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.520
best to listen,
and I tried my best to be tolerant. And I

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.020
can't do it. And so I always say the snobbishness
in white people

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.300
is so ingrained that we would rather have
you root around in our medicine cabinet than

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.460
our bookshelf.
Because you can go to rehab for Vicodin addiction;

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:04.140
you can't go to rehab for Dan Brown.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.670
It's true. It's absolutely true. So I hope
with the message it will come across to white

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.890
people is just take
a step back and look around you. Stop being

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.799
so full of yourself. And easier said than
done look at me.

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:22.230
And so, this is what's happened since I was
last here. All this stuff is amazing it has

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.591
been fantastic. All of it has
been overwhelmingly positive. But I would

00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:28.309
be lying if I said everything that has happened
has been

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:35.549
overwhelmingly positive. After all, I write
on the Internet. And so, I always like to

00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:38.790
people that don't
fully get this about how dangerous, but how

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.600
quickly race wars escalate on the Internet
is that if you were to

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.880
post a video on YouTube of a laughing, giggling
baby, just 30 seconds, just baby's laughing,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:55.309
it's adorable. Comments #1: What a cute baby.
Comment #2: Fuck that white baby. Wait four

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:58.540
seconds; hit refresh. Eight thousand comments,
every

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:03.500
ethnic slur in the world thrown back and forth
from a laughing, giggling baby.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.670
So you can imagine when you write about race
and white people, what sort of response you

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:13.420
start to get. So I get a lot of people criticizing
me, like outrageously criticizing me. So,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.890
I have gotten an e-
mail before that has come in and the e-mail

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:21.550
actually says: You piece of garbage, you're
horrible, I hope you go to jail, and

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:27.460
get raped, and get AIDS, but die slowly so
that you can watch the rest of your family

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.420
die from cancer. I
hate you. Anonymous

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.870
And this e-mail came about because I had the
audacity to say that white people like yoga.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:45.210
Right, so imagine, just imagine how much hate
is flowing through the Internet that this

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.710
is what's
coming back to me. So, aside from the stupid

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.840
criticism the overly stupid criticism of wishing
death

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.080
upon me for saying you know white people like
Anthony Boardain, you know, this is like this

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.390
is what
are dealing with. But the other criticism

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.230
that I usually get is people would write in
and they would say

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.190
things like this is elitist, and so I'm like
yeah I know. And then they would say you know

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.171
like I was
saying before, I'm not white and I like all

00:26:05.171 --> 00:26:07.299
of these things. And I'm like, well look man,
don't worry about

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:13.510
it. First of all you are white, second of
all-second of all I never said this site was

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.970
stuff only white
people can like. It's still called "Stuff

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.179
White People like", and people generally get
it after that.

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:23.590
But then can keep encountering the same criticism
from the same idiot over and over and over

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.020
again.
It's a guy who's like: Yeah, you know what

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.100
man, if you wrote a site called "Stuff Black
People Like" it

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.990
would be racist. Boom!
Like they think they've got me with something.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.070
And I'm just going like, yeah, you know what,
you're right. It

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.240
would be racist, but I wrote a site called
"Stuff White People Like." Here's a picture.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.650
Dude, it's okay.
And when I write back, they're like, okay,

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.240
all right all right, I guess that kind of
makes sense. But you

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.840
know what man, still, it so ridiculous. It's
so unfair. It's like why is it always okay

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.621
to make fun of white
people. I don't think that's fair, you know.

00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.330
You can't make fun of black people, you can't
make fun of

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.540
Latino. You can't make fun of Asians. Anyone
can make fun of white people. That's ridiculous.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540
That's
unfair.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.020
And they're so angry at this perceived double
standard. And I always write back and I say.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.850
You know
what? It is always perpetually for the rest

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.750
of time acceptable to make fun of white people.
There is

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.549
never an instance when it is not appropriate
to make of white people. And he's like, what

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:13.730
now wait,
come on man, that's not true. And I'm like,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.820
yes, it-it's very true. Let me explain why.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:22.160
There is currently no ethnic slur for a white
person that actually hurts, dead serious.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.140
Anyone in here
who is offended at being called a honky or

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.850
a cracker is reaching, okay. We actually are
like-if someone

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:36.210
calls us one of that we're like, ooh, yes,
is this what racism feels like? This is great.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.930
Like, it is not genuinely
offensive, it doesn't hurt. It's not rooted

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.380
in anything. It never-never hurts. Even like,
old ethnic slurs

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.140
from the olden days that might have hurt in
like the '20s or something don't hurt anymore,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.420
because it
all worked out great. And so, there is no

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.690
slur that you can use and this is why I make
the joke. This is

00:27:52.690 --> 00:28:01.250
why white people always get history degrees,
because it always has a happy ending for them.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.250
Think
about it, but it's true.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:07.000
And so then people are like, come on man.
I get into fights with white people all the

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.510
time. They're so
obnoxious. And I just it's just so unfair,

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.360
that honky-cracker thing they just want more,
but it doesn't

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.710
work. Is there anything I can call them that
hurts, is there anything out there that hurts?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.710
And I'm like yeah, there is one thing.
If you get into a fight with a white person

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.840
and it's escalating, and you just want to
have that one thing

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.650
that one word and you reach back and you're
like-BAM! You throw it on the table like a

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:32.090
trump card,
call them average. Nothing will hurt them

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.690
more. That will sting with them for like a
week. They're like,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:41.169
why did he call me average? I need to talk
to him about this. You will literally-if you

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:43.980
can ruin a vacation
before a white person leaves if you call them

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.320
average. So that is the term , but that is
also why it is

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.500
always acceptable to make fun of white people.
So if you are not white, never shy away from

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.450
making
fun of white people. Just go for it, it doesn't

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.200
hurt. You're going to be fine, don't even
sweat it.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.669
So the new book that's out is, "Whiter Shades
of Pale": it's a regional guide to white people

00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:07.951
across
America and I was trying to think of a non-douchy

00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.400
way to bring this up. But there really isn't.
It was

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.290
recently reviewed in the New York Times...
wait- what was the question? Yeah it

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.720
was reviewed in the New York Times. Thanks,
I heard it coming in from the audience there

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.880
somewhere. Thank you. Thank you for bringing
that up. And you know the New York Times called

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.299
it
preternaturally excellent. No big deal, I

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:30.470
am getting that tattooed right actually over
my belly like

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.530
"Tupac's Thug Life." I'm getting it done right
over here. Sorry I had to bring that up, I

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.490
know it's douchy
but it was like literally one of the biggest

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.820
moments of my life. It was awesome.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.490
So it has all these regional sections on white
people, so we have like the Washington, DC

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:50.030
white person, which is
actually the Obama family. Because I make

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.910
the case that Obama, though he is our first
black president,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:58.680
is also our first white president. Because
of the following, you know, he has an organic

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.370
vegetable
garden, he drives a hybrid, he went to law

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.400
school, went to an Ivy League school, and
he has the one

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:12.340
accessory all white people want black children.
So first-first-first white president not black,

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.300
so yes, so
that goes through out. And then you know we

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.190
have Minneapolis, and all that sort of stuff.
And people

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.240
always ask me, well, so, how did you come
up with this. How do you define a white city?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.370
and I said
anywhere where property values out strip income

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:29.080
is a white city. So, Portland, Oregon; Madison,
Wisconsin; Austin, Texas basically anyplace

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.810
where you wonder how can anyone afford to
live there.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:41.880
That is a white city. Hey San Francisco, hey
San Jose, hey everywhere to Bakersfield. So-so

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.309
yes, this
was the concept, it was this regional guide,

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:46.980
and it was really awesome. I got to have the
drawings

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.060
done. Little regional drawings of the white
people. It was really funny, I did a lecture

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.720
in Arkansas, at the University of Arkansas
and when I got there, these two seniors, two

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.701
senior graphic designers had
done 100 unique "Stuff White People Like"

00:30:58.701 --> 00:31:01.431
posters for my appearance and I was just blown
away.

00:31:01.431 --> 00:31:04.270
Cause the logic was there like we're going
to do it, it will be a portfolio piece for

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.721
our artwork eventually, but let's just
do it and see if he likes it. And I got there

00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.309
and I was blown away they were everywhere
and they were

00:31:09.309 --> 00:31:12.480
gorgeous, beautifully designed . I'm like,
do you guys want to sell these on the website?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.250
Yeah that would be incredible. And then when
I got the idea to do this, I asked them do

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.710
you guys think
you can do line drawings of obnoxious white

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.310
people? And they're like yeah I think we got
this. And I

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.370
was so happy to have designers I could trust
and I could work with . They did all the line-drawings

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.971
for
the site and they are the ones for the book

00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:31.130
and they're the ones who've really made this
come alive. And I can't thank them

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.809
enough, it was awesome.

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:35.722
The regional was a bit of a change from the
first one, and the other thing that was a

00:31:35.722 --> 00:31:37.730
bit of a change was that
I'm a little older now. So when I wrote the

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.320
first book I was 29 years old, and so my snobbery
was

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.460
almost entirely dedicated to music. Like it
was just, I literally spent like an hour every

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.050
day checking
music blogs, and it was just so much work,

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.820
it was so exhausting and I was so frustrated
by it all that by

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.501
the time I turned 30 I realized can't keep
this up forever man. I'm exhausted. And I

00:31:56.501 --> 00:32:00.070
noticed what had
changed was after 30 you replace your music

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.280
snobbery with food snobbery . And the reason
why we

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.320
do this as white people is that you can never
be the oldest guy at a restaurant. You know

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.870
what I mean,
like being at a concert looking around and

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.020
being like oh my god, everyone here is 23
years old.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.770
Restaurant looking around your like all right,
fitting right in, this is a fantastic. It's

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.440
like being at a craps
table in Las Vegas. I don't know if any of

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.140
you play craps but if you go there and you're
under 60

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.640
you're always the youngest guy there. It is
awesome. You'll feel fantastic. So I realized

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.280
that my
snobbery had really changed considerably,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.520
and so I thought the book was going to reflect
that. So

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.570
before I open up for questions I have a couple
readings in here. They're good ones.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:47.730
And you should have a point of pride because
in the new book Google made it. It took a

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.610
long time
figuring out how to get it in there, how I

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:55.450
was going to do it. Additionally, Google appears
again, I have a section for "Acceptable Reasons

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.961
for a White Breakup". And had an @ yahoo.com
e-mail

00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:00.360
address was one of the things.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:09.130
Because I mean, yeah I don't have to explain
it any further. You guys all get that.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.600
So there is a few other entries for San Francisco
before I get to Google. So I'm going to read

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.160
three of them
from the new book that I like.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:22.450
"#58. Hating people who wear Ed Hardy. Often
it can be easier to find common ground with

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.250
a white
person by talking to them about something

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.320
you both hate. Discussing things you both
like might lead

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.710
to an argument over who likes it more or who
liked it first. Clearly the safest route is

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.700
mutual hatred. When choosing to talk about
something that

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.360
white people hate, it's best to something
that will allow white people to make clever

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.000
comments or at
the very least to feel better about themselves.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.300
Currently the easiest way to do that is to
ask a white person

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.600
for their thoughts on people who wear Ed Hardy.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.950
Ed Hardy is a clothing company that makes
a wide range of expensive T-shirts, hoodies,

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.970
and jeans.
These clothes are notable for their use of

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.300
elements from classic tattoo designs such
as skulls, hearts,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.799
and dragons. On the surface, the use of the
words classic, tattoo, and T-shirt would suggest

00:33:57.799 --> 00:34:00.720
a logical fit
for White people, but that is not the case.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.700
The right kind of white people hate these
clothes

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.781
unilaterally, and it is advised that you merely
accept that at face value. If you were to

00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:08.860
ask
a person to explain why a regular size dragon

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.850
logo is okay, but one that goes around the
neck is not , you

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.379
would be trapped in an hour long and fruitless
conversation.

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:18.800
To put this in proper perspective, Ed Hardy
is so hated by White people that it can not

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:26.580
be worn ironically. This is no small feat.
As it stands now, the only other things that

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.400
can't be worn ironically by White people are
Nazi

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.820
uniforms, Ku Klux Klan robes, and self tanner.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:36.900
Since you can not in good conscience have
an Ed Hardy-themed party, the best way to

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.690
make use of
this white hatred is to give your stories

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.190
a little more appeal to white people. For
example, if you take

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.350
the reasonable but not compelling story, I
got cut off in traffic this morning and when

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.440
I honked the guy gave me the finger. And replaced
it with, I got cut off in traffic this morning

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.210
by this guy in an Ed Hardy
shirt; I honked and then he gave me the finger.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.659
The story will become 60% more interesting
to White

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:58.400
people, because it allows them to make a witty
response like, I guess that douche bag had

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.240
to get you to a UFC party or a nightclub event
that he was hosting. Follow this up with a

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.450
laugh, a high five, and a compliment about
the acceptable shirt the white person is wearing,

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:10.750
and you will find yourself with a brand new
friend."

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:15.020
And so this one always makes me think of a
"Jersey Shore". And I admit that I still watch

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.230
it because like
all the self-tanning and the-and the Ed Hardy

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.540
shirts. And I have this fantasy I wish I could
go back in time to

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.520
like the turn of the 20th Century at Ellis
Island and see all the Italian immigrants

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.050
coming in and show
them a DVD of what was going to happen. And

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.210
be like welcome to America, here's what's
going to

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.250
happen in about 90 years. they'd be like you
know what , we're going to go back to Italy.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.940
We will just deal with World War II, it's
all going to workout great. I in good-faith

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:45.890
can't let this happen to my lineage. So yeah,
an interesting world to say the least .

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:51.460
All right, last one before Google. "# 59.
Swimming.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.770
Among the physical activities most enjoyed
by White people, swimming remains right near

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.349
the top. In fact, swimming is the one activity
that remains constant throughout the life

00:35:58.349 --> 00:36:01.660
of a white person. They begin
with swim lessons as a child, join a swim

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.750
team in high school, train for a triathlon
after college, and then

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.900
swim as a way to stay in shape after 50. If
you ask any white person over 50 how they

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.510
stay in shape,
the answer will inevitably be swimming laps

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.580
or perhaps more accurately swimming laps in
a Speedo.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:19.030
For those of you at the gym with a pool, you
know what I'm talking about. It is hard to

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.160
say exactly
why white people like swimming so much but

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.690
there are a number of theories. First of all
the great

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:28.450
tragedies to befall white people in the water,
they were actually brought about by white

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.450
people.
Sharp attacks, getting lost at sea, and the

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.950
Titanic, though the latter was technically
a tragedy brought

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:38.390
about by an iceberg it was still a white iceberg
that did it. Aside from these minor hiccups

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.300
swimming has been a pleasurable activity for
white people for generations.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.260
Another theory why white people enjoy swimming,
is their ability to completely dominate the

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.660
sport.
Of course, this domination doesn't come from

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.359
years of training and crushing competition.
It was mostly the fact that white people only

00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:55.420
have to compete against other white people.
This is in turn because

00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:00.130
even at the highest levels non-white competitors
are mostly limited to a few over eager Chinese

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:04.010
Olympians or some adorable underdog from a
third world country who just learned to swim.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:09.200
Swimming at the Olympics is actually another
example of how good white people are at figuring

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.070
out
how to maximize the few ways in which they

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.940
can eke out athletic dominance. White people
have helped to ensure that you can win medals

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.040
in swimming for different distances, relays,
and most importantly, different strokes. So

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.641
White athletes can win upwards of five metals
for doing the butterfly,

00:37:21.641 --> 00:37:26.700
the back stroke, but in track a support long
abandoned by white people, they could not

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.490
obtain
additional medals for running backwards or

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:34.090
doing a crab walk. It seems right, you know,
if you get a

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:38.349
different medal for doing the butterfly you
should get a medal for, you know running sideways.

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:41.820
Sadly there seems to be no end in sight for
white peoples dominance of competitive swimming.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.040
For further proof, go to the nearest computer
and type in "swim team" into Google. Then

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.190
click on the images tab and you will see more
white flesh than a Morman orgy.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:55.180
Competition and pleasure are logical reasons
why white people would enjoy swimming, but

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.830
these are not the only factors that will put
people in the water. Many white people will

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.070
engage in something called "polar bear events",
where they gather on the beach in the middle

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.220
of winter, quickly jump into
a partially frozen lake or ocean, and then

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.510
run back to waiting blankets and warm beverages.
This is often done to remind white people

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:15.060
they are alive. Because for white people nothing
makes them appreciate the gift of life more

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:22.530
than voluntarily trying to end it. Why, why
do we do that?"

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.760
And finally "#60 Google.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.580
Thanks to a middle school reading of the book
‘1984', virtually all white people have

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.650
an intense fear of
a big brother type of organization that monitors

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.280
all of your actions and compiles terabytes
of data on

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.870
you, your family, and everything that you
do. A white person can think of nothing more

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.119
frightening
than some strange company holding all of their

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:45.422
information and using it for their own benefit.
That is unless that company happens to be

00:38:45.422 --> 00:38:50.930
Google then everything is fine. White people
have spent the past decade happily

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:55.290
handing over as much of their life as possible
to Google: E-mail, work documents, video chat,

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:59.970
payment system, zoom sources, and all of their
Internet searches. If Google offered to digitize

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.560
and store all financial and
medical records, white people would be among

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.780
the first to jump aboard. Partly because this
would

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.140
make dating much easier for white people,
because the ability to use your phone to view

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.650
a sexual
history report and a 401K statement could

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.080
save you hours of indirect thinly veiled questions.
There are

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.160
a number of reasons why white people have
been so eager to hand their lives over to

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.020
Google, the first
and most obvious reason is simple peer pressure.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.160
If you ever exchanged email with a white person,
there is a 100% chance their e-mail address

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.580
ended in gmail.com. Of course some white people
have

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.720
an @MAC.com address, but even those people
know they'll need an @gmail.com address if

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.080
they want
anyone to take them seriously.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.359
But one of the biggest reasons why white people
love Google is simply the company itself.

00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:41.920
It's famous
for providing all of its employees with perks

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.390
like free food, ball pits, arcade machines,
and pretty much

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:51.000
anything else that will take the misery out
of coding for 18 hours a day. Finally, Google

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.300
is renowned for
having a very selective hiring process that

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.320
enables them to bring on only the best and
brightest people on earth. So naturally every

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.560
white person believes that they should be
working there. When a white

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.170
person with the job that you covet begins
complaining, simply tell them they should

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.930
be working at Google. The pool of dot com
money, endless perks, and working in a selective

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.680
environment will be too strong and they will
immediately begin searching for a job. While

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.950
they are filling out Google strange
questionnaire, inform your superior that the

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:24.180
white person is looking for a new job and
enjoy your new promotion".

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:32.040
So, thank you for indirectly getting all sorts
of white people fired. But that is my talk,

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.081
my update and a few of my readings. If you
guys have any questions for me, I'd be more

00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:38.990
than happy to answer them. Any
questions about white people. Or about , or

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:46.140
about me. I'd be more than happy to answer
them. You just come up to the mic here, so

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.150
it's recorded.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:55.480
female #1: We have one. Hello. We have one
question from a distributed office. They wonder

00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:02.089
I'm worried I don't care enough about the
environment, microbrews, and the evil corporations

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:07.369
not named Apple. Could you give me tips on
how better to portray the angst these important

00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:08.369
issues cause me?

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:09.410
Christian: How better to portray?

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.410
female #1: Yes.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.700
Christian: But they don't legitimately care
about it. T-shirts, T-shirt form or bumper

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.790
sticker form are the only two things that
white people understand. So, just slap an

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.280
Apple sticker on the back of whatever car
it is you're driving. Everything will be just

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.810
fine. Get a thread less shirt- chillin'.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:29.006
audience member: Stickers on the back of your
Apple products.

00:41:29.006 --> 00:41:31.830
Christian: Stickers on the... I know I see
some of them right now. This is-this is a

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.220
big white dilemma,
right, because if you cover it up how are

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.720
the people at the coffee shop going to know
your creative?

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:43.359
It's almost-- it's like the same thing with
the moleskin notebooks. Right, you know I

00:41:43.359 --> 00:41:48.510
mean if they don't provide any functionality
a over 99 cents notebook but come on. You

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.700
know what I mean. Same sorta thing.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.981
male #1: I would like to speak about shades
of white.

00:41:58.981 --> 00:42:00.770
Christian: Shades of white?

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:08.859
male #1: Yes, I came here from Russia which
is mostly white. And I noticed when I had

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:15.160
my first questionnaire which has questions
about your race, it lists: White, White not

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:20.550
Hispanic, Caucasian, and I
had some urge to cross Asian Pacific Islander

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.550
off.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.550
Christian: We all want to cross off Pacific
Islander.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.890
male #1: I got lost. Because for me Caucasian
doesn't make sense because it's like a Chechen

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:32.840
branch of al-Qaeda.
I said white not Hispanic and then the conversation

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:43.950
started from there. Do you have a take on
what these things are?

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:45.840
Christian: Yeah. I got this covered.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.840
[audience laughs]

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.100
Christian: I have been trying to get the census
to update for quite some time now. There is

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.140
a test at the back of the first book to determine
how white you are exactly. Because I think

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.800
determining whiteness by
skin color is-we're done with that, we're

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.740
finished with that. I think you should just
check all the things that you like and then

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.760
you should be assigned a percentage white
that you are. And that should count as your

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.180
ethnicity. I think that would probably be
a little less confusing than having all of

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.010
these
things. That would at least be my-my policy

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.040
on it. But it's a tough one. I understand.
Anybody else?

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.560
male #2: What is your favorite single malt
scotch?

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:27.030
Christian: My favorite is-- what I like-this
is like two level deep question. You already

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.280
assume that I drink single malt scotch, which
is correct.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280
[audience laughs]

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.500
Christian: You also assumed that I will be
snobby about it, which is also correct. The

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.849
proper answer is
my favorite single malt scotch is the one

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:41.420
I can't afford. For those of you that drink
scotch you'll

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:47.180
understand. But other than that, Laphroaig
is my favorite. Laphroaig 18 year is fantastic.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.820
25 is what I
want, but I don't have $600 to buy one. Good

00:43:52.820 --> 00:44:01.420
question, great question. Anybody else?
All right. All

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:06.010
right well then I guess I'll let you guys
get back to work. And thank you guys so much

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.540
for coming out to
hear me talk again. And I will stick around

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.900
and sign books or if there are any questions
too personal about White people that you don't

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:17.580
want to ask in public, which I understand,
we are a judgmental people. I've tried to

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.510
make that clear. Feel free to come up and
ask me or if you want a goofy picture of me

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.740
that's fine, too. But make sure that when
you get the picture taken, I'm holding the

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.339
book up otherwise people will be like "Hey,
you met Seth Rogen." Thanks everybody.

00:44:29.339 --> 00:44:31.320
