David, were you able to write
down the slots and the fillers.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.850
&gt;&gt; I was.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.908
So, for object x, I have that it's
a large triangle, that is not filled in.

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.750
For object y, I have it's a large
circle that's not filled in.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.440
And for object z, I have that it's
a small circle, that is filled in.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.176
As far as the relationships go,
in this case we have that z is inside y.

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:21.990
Z is inside y.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.080
Z is above x, which it is,
and y is also above x.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.540
Y is above x.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.870
&gt;&gt; Good David, that sounds right to me.
