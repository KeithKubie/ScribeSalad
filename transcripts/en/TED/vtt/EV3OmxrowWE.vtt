00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.808
There's an African proverb that goes,

00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:17.486
"The lion's story will never be known

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.950
as long as the hunter
is the one to tell it."

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:25.511
More than a racial conversation,
we need a racial literacy

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:28.919
to decode the politics
of racial threat in America.

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.757
Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth,

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:36.864
that the more we understand

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:40.435
that our cultural differences
represent the power

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:42.046
to heal the centuries

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.898
of racial discrimination,

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:45.663
dehumanization and illness.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:49.116
Both of my parents were African-American.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.921
My father was born in Southern Delaware,

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:53.408
my mother, North Philadelphia,

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:57.722
and these two places are as different
from each other as east is from west,

00:00:57.746 --> 00:01:00.086
as New York City is
from Montgomery, Alabama.

00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:03.687
My father's way of dealing
with racial conflict

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:07.454
was to have my brother Bryan,
my sister Christy and I in church

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:10.338
what seemed like 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:11.512
(Laughter)

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.403
If anybody bothered us
because of the color of our skin,

00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:18.625
he believed that you should pray for them,

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.457
knowing that God
would get them back in the end.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.654
(Laughter)

00:01:23.256 --> 00:01:26.531
You could say that his racial-coping
approach was spiritual --

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.510
for later on, one day,

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:29.830
like Martin Luther King.

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:33.097
My mother's coping approach
was a little different.

00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.896
She was, uh, you could say,
more relational --

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.140
right now, like, in your face,

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.314
right now.

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.196
More like Malcolm X.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.536
(Laughter)

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.140
She was raised from neighborhoods

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:46.600
in which there was racial
violence and segregation,

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:48.704
where she was chased out of neighborhoods,

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:51.275
and she exacted violence
to chase others out of hers.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.288
When she came to Southern Delaware,

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.539
she thought she had come
to a foreign country.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:57.468
She didn't understand anybody,

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:00.952
particularly the few black and brown folks

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:04.234
who were physically deferential
and verbally deferential

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:05.636
in the presence of whites.

00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:07.392
Not my mother.

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.647
When she wanted to go
somewhere, she walked.

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.396
She didn't care what you thought.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.611
And she pissed a lot of people off
with her cultural style.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.613
Before we get into the supermarket,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.425
she would give us the talk:

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.087
"Don't ask for nothin',

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:23.496
don't touch nothin'.

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.516
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:31.257
I don't care if all the other children
are climbing the walls.

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:32.821
They're not my children.

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:35.029
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"

00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:37.666
In three-part harmony:

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.840
"Yes, Mom."

00:02:40.674 --> 00:02:43.147
Before we'd get into the supermarket,

00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:45.031
that talk was all we needed.

00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:47.384
Now, how many of you ever got that talk?

00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:50.396
How many of you ever give that talk?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.871
(Laughter)

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:54.288
How many of you ever give that talk today?

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:59.244
My mother didn't give us the talk
because she was worried about money

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:00.436
or reputation

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.906
or us misbehaving.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.236
We never misbehaved.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.422
We were too scared.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.677
We were in church 24 hours a day,

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.852
seven days a week.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.215
(Laughter)

00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:11.669
She gave us that talk to remind us

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:15.898
that some people in the world
would interpret us as misbehaving

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:17.366
just by being black.

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:22.431
Not every parent has to worry
about their children being misjudged

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:24.338
because of the color of their skin,

00:03:24.362 --> 00:03:25.672
just by breathing.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.668
So we get into the supermarket,

00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:29.862
and people look at us --

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:31.971
stare at us as if we just stole something.

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:37.252
Every now and then, a salesperson
would do something or say something

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:39.649
because they were pissed
with our cultural style,

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:41.982
and it would usually happen
at the conveyor belt.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.166
And the worst thing they could do
was to throw our food into the bag.

00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:48.693
And when that happened, it was on.

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:49.789
(Laughter)

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.012
My mother began
to tell them who they were,

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:53.574
who their family was,

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:55.049
where to go,

00:03:55.073 --> 00:03:56.604
how fast to get there.

00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:57.936
(Laughter)

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.107
If you haven't been cursed out
by my mother, you haven't lived.

00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:02.281
(Laughter)

00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:04.449
The person would be on the floor,

00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:07.567
writhing in utter decay and decomposition,

00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:09.834
whimpering in a pool of racial shame.

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:11.009
(Laughter)

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:13.448
Now, both my parents were Christians.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:17.148
The difference is my father prayed
before a racial conflict

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:18.851
and my mother prayed after.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.298
(Laughter)

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:23.818
There is a time, if you use
both of their strategies,

00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:26.516
if you use them in the right time
and the right way.

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:28.948
But it's never a time --

00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:31.040
there's a time for conciliation,

00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.161
there's a time for confrontation,

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:37.172
but it's never a time to freeze up
like a deer in the headlights,

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:42.281
and it's never a time to lash out
in heedless, thoughtless anger.

00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:44.526
The lesson in this is

00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:46.974
that when it comes to race relations,

00:04:46.998 --> 00:04:49.043
sometimes, we've got to know how to pray,

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:51.244
think through, process, prepare.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.887
And other times,
we've got to know how to push,

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:55.285
how to do something.

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.156
And I'm afraid that neither
of these two skills --

00:04:58.607 --> 00:04:59.783
preparing,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.708
pushing --

00:05:01.732 --> 00:05:03.753
are prevalent in our society today.

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:10.070
If you look at the neuroscience research

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.424
which says that when
we are racially threatened,

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.118
our brains go on lockdown,

00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:18.357
and we dehumanize black and brown people.

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:24.642
Our brains imagine that children
and adults are older than they really are,

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.988
larger than they really are

00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:28.644
and closer than they really are.

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:32.060
When we're at our worst,
we convince ourselves

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:34.425
that they don't deserve
affection or protection.

00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:37.740
At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,

00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:42.541
we know that some of the scariest
moments are racial encounters,

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:46.281
some of the scariest moments
that people will ever face.

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:51.787
If you look at the police encounters
that have led to some wrongful deaths

00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:55.050
of mostly Native Americans
and African-Americans in this country,

00:05:55.074 --> 00:05:57.329
they've lasted about two minutes.

00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:00.213
Within 60 seconds,

00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:02.350
our brains go on lockdown.

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:04.118
And when we're unprepared,

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:05.335
we overreact.

00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:07.201
At best, we shut down.

00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:10.397
At worst, we shoot first
and ask no questions.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:15.234
Imagine if we could reduce
the intensity of threat

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:16.582
within those 60 seconds

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:19.593
and keep our brains
from going on lockdown.

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.926
Imagine how many children
would get to come home from school

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.109
or 7-Eleven

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.238
without getting expelled or shot.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:31.649
Imagine how many mothers
and fathers wouldn't have to cry.

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:39.157
Racial socialization can help young people
negotiate 60-second encounters,

00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:41.423
but it's going to take more than a chat.

00:06:41.447 --> 00:06:43.316
It requires a racial literacy.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.704
Now, how do parents
have these conversations,

00:06:46.728 --> 00:06:48.699
and what is a racial literacy?

00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:49.912
Thank you for asking.

00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:51.161
(Laughter)

00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:55.520
A racial literacy involves
the ability to read,

00:06:55.544 --> 00:06:58.595
recast and resolve
a racially stressful encounter.

00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:02.766
Reading involves recognizing
when a racial moment happens

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.858
and noticing our stress reactions to it.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.584
Recasting involves

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.775
taking mindfulness and reducing
my tsunami interpretation of this moment

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:17.080
and reducing it
to a mountain-climbing experience,

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.571
one that is --

00:07:18.595 --> 00:07:22.226
from impossible situation
to one that is much more doable

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.407
and challenging.

00:07:25.048 --> 00:07:28.292
Resolving a racially stressful
encounter involves

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.449
being able to make a healthy decision

00:07:30.473 --> 00:07:34.356
that is not an underreaction,
where I pretend, "That didn't bother me,"

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.606
or an overreaction,
where I exaggerate the moment.

00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:43.201
Now, we can teach parents and children
how to read, recast and resolve

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:48.802
using a mindfulness strategy
we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate,

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:50.086
breathe and exhale."

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.260
Stay with me.

00:07:51.663 --> 00:07:53.108
"Calculate" asks,

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:54.867
"What feeling am I having right now,

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.985
and how intense is it
on a scale of one to 10?"

00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.612
"Locate" asks, "Where
in my body do I feel it?"

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.431
And be specific,

00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:09.442
like the Native American girl at a Chicago
fifth-grade school said to me,

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:14.187
"I feel angry at a nine
because I'm the only Native American.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.740
And I can feel it in my stomach,

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:20.592
like a bunch of butterflies
are fighting with each other,

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:23.760
so much so that they fly up
into my throat and choke me."

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.022
The more detailed you can be,

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:28.064
the easier it is to reduce that spot.

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:29.906
"Communicate" asks,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.703
"What self-talk and what images
are coming in my mind?"

00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:35.983
And if you really want help,
try breathing in

00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:37.485
and exhaling slowly.

00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:42.382
With the help of my many colleagues
at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,

00:08:42.406 --> 00:08:44.621
we use in-the-moment stress-reduction

00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:47.050
in several research and therapy projects.

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:52.624
One project is where we use basketball
to help youth manage their emotions

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:55.013
during 60-second eruptions on the court.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:01.149
Another project, with the help
of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott,

00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:06.087
we leverage the cultural style
of African-American barbershops,

00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:09.828
where we train black barbers
to be health educators in two areas:

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:14.504
one, to safely reduce the sexual risk
in their partner relationships;

00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:15.885
and the other,

00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:17.851
to stop retaliation violence.

00:09:18.636 --> 00:09:21.501
The cool part is the barbers use
their cultural style

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:25.335
to deliver this health education
to 18- to 24-year-old men

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:26.955
while they're cutting their hair.

00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.998
Another project is where we teach teachers

00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:35.609
how to read, recast and resolve
stressful moments in the classroom.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:40.963
And a final project, in which we teach
parents and their children separately

00:09:41.717 --> 00:09:44.043
to understand their racial traumas

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:48.195
before we bring them together
to problem-solve daily microaggressions.

00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:53.052
Now, racially literate conversations
with our children can be healing,

00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:54.962
but it takes practice.

00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:57.188
And I know some of you
are saying, "Practice?

00:09:57.212 --> 00:09:58.378
Practice?

00:09:58.402 --> 00:09:59.927
We're talking about practice?"

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:02.117
Yes, we are talking about practice.

00:10:03.126 --> 00:10:04.511
I have two sons.

00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:07.374
My oldest, Bryan, is 26,

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.517
and my youngest, Julian, is 12.

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:12.818
And we do not have time
to talk about how that happened.

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:14.556
(Laughter)

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.743
But,

00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:17.855
when I think of them,

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.214
they are still babies to me,

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:21.913
and I worry every day
that the world will misjudge them.

00:10:23.887 --> 00:10:26.340
In August of 2013,

00:10:26.966 --> 00:10:29.925
Julian, who was eight at the time,
and I were folding laundry,

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:32.294
which in and of itself
is such a rare occurrence,

00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:35.544
I should have known something
strange was going to happen.

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.790
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents,

00:10:37.814 --> 00:10:39.058
and they were crying

00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:42.272
because of the acquittal
of George Zimmerman.

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:44.466
And Julian was glued to the TV.

00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.106
He had a thousand questions,
and I was not prepared.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.447
He wanted to know why:

00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:55.749
Why would a grown man stalk
and hunt down and kill

00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:57.741
an unarmed 17-year-old boy?

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:00.147
And I did not know what to say.

00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:02.613
The best thing that could
come out of my mouth was,

00:11:02.637 --> 00:11:05.614
"Julian, sometimes in this world,
there are people

00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:07.648
who look down on black and brown people

00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:11.184
and do not treat them --
and children, too --

00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:12.769
do not treat them as human."

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.401
He interpreted the whole situation as sad.

00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:18.980
(Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad.

00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:20.821
"We don't care. You're not our kind."

00:11:20.845 --> 00:11:21.996
HS: Yes.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.381
JS: It's like, "We're better than you."

00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:26.556
HS: Yes.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.891
JS: "And there's nothing
you can do about that.

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:32.371
And if you scare me,
or something like that,

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:35.025
I will shoot you
because I'm scared of you."

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:36.263
HS: Exactly.

00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:38.658
But if somebody's stalking you --

00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:40.660
JS: It's not the same for everyone else.

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:43.571
HS: It's not always the same, no.
You've got to be careful.

00:11:43.595 --> 00:11:45.659
JS: Yeah, because people
can disrespect you.

00:11:45.683 --> 00:11:46.861
HS: Exactly.

00:11:46.885 --> 00:11:48.659
JS: And think that you're,

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:54.890
"You don't look --
you don't look like you're ..."

00:11:55.611 --> 00:12:00.256
It's like they're saying
that "You don't look right,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.713
so I guess I have the right
to disrespect you."

00:12:02.737 --> 00:12:04.522
HS: Yeah, and that's what we call,

00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:06.181
we call that racism.

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.520
And we call that racism, Julian,

00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:11.675
and yes, some people -- other
people -- can wear a hoodie,

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:13.688
and nothing happens to them.

00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:16.056
But you and Trayvon might,

00:12:16.747 --> 00:12:20.356
and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.012
(Voice-over) HS: And that's why --

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:24.597
JS: So you mean like,
when you said "other people,"

00:12:24.621 --> 00:12:27.557
you mean, like if Trayvon was a white,

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:30.876
um, that he wouldn't be
disrespected like that?

00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:34.087
HS: Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people

00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:35.997
when I said, "other people," all right?

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:39.465
So there was a way in which
I was so awkward in the beginning,

00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:41.921
but once I started getting
my rhythm and my groove,

00:12:41.945 --> 00:12:46.545
I started talking about stereotypes
and issues of discrimination,

00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:49.012
and just when I was getting my groove on,

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:50.539
Julian interrupted me.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.207
(Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous,
or you're a criminal because you're black,

00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:56.681
and you're a child or a boy --

00:12:56.705 --> 00:12:58.863
That is wrong,
it doesn't matter who does it.

00:12:58.887 --> 00:13:00.531
JS: Dad, I need to stop you there.

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:01.709
HS: What?

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:03.537
JS: Remember when we were ...

00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:05.672
HS: So he interrupts me to tell me a story

00:13:05.696 --> 00:13:09.342
about when he was racially threatened
at a swimming pool with a friend

00:13:09.366 --> 00:13:11.011
by two grown white men,

00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:12.884
which his mother confirmed.

00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:15.757
And I felt happy
that he was able to talk about it;

00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:17.388
it felt like he was getting it.

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.753
We moved from the sadness
of Trayvon's parents

00:13:19.777 --> 00:13:22.527
and started talking about
George Zimmerman's parents,

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.551
which, I read in a magazine,

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.823
condoned the stalking of Trayvon.

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:29.546
And Julian's reaction to me was priceless.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.055
It made me feel like he was getting it.

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.227
(Voice-over) JS: What did
they say about him?

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:37.485
HS: Well, I think they basically
felt that he was justified

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:39.887
to follow and stalk --

00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:41.082
JS: What the -- ?

00:13:41.106 --> 00:13:43.025
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong.

00:13:43.049 --> 00:13:44.464
JS: That's -- one minute.

00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:48.456
So they're saying he has the right
to follow a black kid,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.421
get in a fight with him and shoot him?

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.378
HS: As Julian was getting it,

00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:54.747
I started to lose it.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.463
Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking:

00:13:57.487 --> 00:14:00.464
What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon?

00:14:01.478 --> 00:14:03.573
I calculated my anger at a 10.

00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:07.268
I found, located, my right
leg was shaking uncontrollably

00:14:07.292 --> 00:14:08.532
like I was running.

00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:12.004
And in my mind's eye,
I could see somebody chasing Julian,

00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:14.056
and I was chasing them.

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:16.910
And the only thing
that could come out of my mouth

00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:20.238
was if anybody tries
to bother my child ...

00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:24.804
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries
to bother my child ...

00:14:24.828 --> 00:14:25.995
mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.415
JS: What will happen?

00:14:27.439 --> 00:14:29.403
HS: Well, they better run.

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.653
JS: Because what?
HS: I'm gonna get 'em.

00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:33.828
JS: See? (Laughs)

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:35.653
HS: I'm gonna get 'em.
JS: Really?

00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:36.835
HS: Oh, yeah.

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:39.916
JS: Then they're gonna get you
because they might have weapons.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.088
HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna
call police, too, like I should.

00:14:43.112 --> 00:14:44.693
But I feel like I wanna get 'em.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.722
But you can't; you're right,
you can't just go chasing people.

00:14:47.746 --> 00:14:48.916
JS: They can be armed.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.849
HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right.

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:52.328
I feel like I wanna chase 'em.

00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:54.437
JS: Plus they could be
an army or something.

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:57.631
HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna
go get 'em, messing with my son.

00:14:57.655 --> 00:14:59.154
I don't like that.

00:14:59.178 --> 00:15:00.329
JS: Um ...

00:15:00.353 --> 00:15:02.478
HS: But you right. You gotta be careful.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.571
And um, you gotta be careful.

00:15:06.247 --> 00:15:09.365
You never know what some crazy people
will think about you.

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:12.900
Just as long as you believe
you're beautiful

00:15:12.924 --> 00:15:15.766
like Daddy believes
you're beautiful and handsome,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.283
and Mommy believes you're beautiful
and handsome and smart.

00:15:20.202 --> 00:15:23.182
And you deserve to be on this planet,

00:15:23.206 --> 00:15:26.307
just as happy and beautiful
and smart as you want to be.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.963
You can do anything you want, baby.

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:35.111
HS: Racial socialization is not just
what parents teach their children.

00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:39.064
It's also how children respond
to what their parents teach.

00:15:40.277 --> 00:15:41.733
Is my child prepared?

00:15:43.097 --> 00:15:46.757
Can they recognize when a racial elephant
shows up in a room?

00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:50.556
Can they reduce
their tsunami interpretation

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.751
down to a mountain-climbing adventure

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:55.125
that they can engage and not run away?

00:15:55.568 --> 00:15:59.924
Can they make a healthy
and just decision in 60 seconds?

00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:01.694
Can I?

00:16:02.103 --> 00:16:03.270
Can you?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.189
Yes, we can.

00:16:05.955 --> 00:16:09.517
We can build healthier
relationships around race

00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:13.931
if we learn to calculate, locate
communicate, breathe and exhale

00:16:13.955 --> 00:16:17.826
in the middle of our most
threatening moments,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.499
when we come face-to-face
with our lesser selves.

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:25.226
If you take the centuries of racial rage

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.835
that boils up in all of our bodies,
minds and souls --

00:16:29.851 --> 00:16:34.142
and anything that affects our bodies,
minds and souls affects our health --

00:16:34.658 --> 00:16:37.731
we could probably use
gun control for our hearts.

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:41.707
I just want what all parents
want for their children

00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.057
when we're not around:

00:16:43.081 --> 00:16:44.743
affection and protection.

00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:48.791
When police and teachers see my children,

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.811
I want them to imagine their own,

00:16:51.404 --> 00:16:54.973
because I believe if you see
our children as your children,

00:16:55.703 --> 00:16:57.119
you won't shoot them.

00:16:58.388 --> 00:17:00.917
With racial literacy, and yes, practice,

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:05.073
we can decode the racial trauma
from our stories,

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:07.506
and our healing will come in the telling.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.824
But we must never forget

00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:15.994
that our cultural differences
are full of affection and protection,

00:17:16.018 --> 00:17:19.940
and remember always
that the lion's story will never be known

00:17:19.964 --> 00:17:22.352
as long as the hunter
is the one to tell it.

00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:24.147
Thank you very much.

00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:29.224
(Applause)
