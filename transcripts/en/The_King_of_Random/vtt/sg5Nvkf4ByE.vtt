In this video, we're going to be showing
you how to take this Lego brick container,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.609
and transform it into
a vacuum that can suck up,

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.660
and then store all of
your Lego brick pieces.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.420
[Music]

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.020
To get started, we're going to
need some kind of plastic box,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.320
a vacuum cleaner and
some spare vacuum hose.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.910
I happen to have one
of these actual Lego boxes

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.570
that's shaped like a giant Lego brick,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.170
but you don't have to use one of these.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.250
If you just have a clear plastic
shoe box size container,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.720
that will work just fine.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.619
We're also going to need an exacto knife,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.780
a glue gun,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.520
some type of mesh cloth or fabric,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420
and all of the ingredients that we
use to make our proto-putty,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.960
that's type 1 silicone,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.820
some food coloring and some corn starch.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.920
Here's what we've got in mind.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.360
We'll cut two holes into the lid,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.411
one for the hose going in,

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.960
and one for the hose going out.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.800
A proto-putty seal around the whole lid
will prevent any air from leaking,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.480
and a mesh filter on one side
will prevent any Lego pieces

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.000
from accidentally getting
sucked up into the vacuum cleaner.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.900
First, we need to take the lid of
our container and add some holes.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.720
If you're using these
nice Lego containers,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.620
I like to put them right here on these bumps

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.120
because it just keeps the aesthetic.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160
If you're using you container
with a more flat lid,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.280
you can just cut right into
the flat surface.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.520
We're going to want one hole on one side
where our vacuum cleaner hose will go in,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.200
and another hole on the other side
where our additional hose will come out.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, I'm in a workshop
and here we have a shop vacuum.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600
But if you want to just do this
at home with your home vacuum,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200
that will work just fine as long as
you have a hose that can be pulled out.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.140
One quick note about
using a home vacuum,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.480
if you have the type of vacuum that has
turning bristles and you take the hose out,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.340
you do want to make
sure that those bristles

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.670
aren't still rotating in
contact with the carpet

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.200
because after a couple of minutes,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.590
the friction can begin to melt
or burn some types of carpet.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
So, if you are doing 
his as a home vacuum,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760
you may want take your vacuum cleaner

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.820
and tip it on its back so that the bristles
aren't going to burn anything.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.440
Now, we want to make a hole in one side
that's just the same size as this adapter,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.280
and a hole on the other side
that's the size of our vacuum hose.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640
I picked this vacuum hose up at a store

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.560
that just specializes in all
sorts of different types of hose.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.660
It was pretty convenient.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660
If you don't have one of those near you,
there are a few other options.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040
There are some kinds of pool and
drainage hose that are about the same size,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.700
and this is a 1 and 1/4 inch diameter.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.940
Or you might be able to find an
old vacuum that doesn't work anymore,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.200
and take the hose off of there,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560
or if you have a vacuum repair shop,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.420
they might have some broken vacuums
and be able to sell you one of the hoses.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.900
Let's take our hose,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140
place it right where
we want our hole to be,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.280
and then trace around it
with a permanent marker.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.300
[Music]

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.500
And let's do the same thing
with our other hose.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.620
These hoses are very similar
in size but not quite identical.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960
If you happen to have a hole saw

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.010
that is exactly the same size
as one of your hose connections,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.930
You can probably use that and
it should work just fine.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.120
Both of my hose connections ended
up being not quite the same size

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.300
as any of the hole saws,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.060
so we're just going to use
an exacto knife suspect.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.040
[Music]

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.900
I suspect I'm still going to need
a little additional trimming

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.860
before this fits quite right.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.030
Yeah, it's still just a little tight.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.880
I just need to trim down
the plastic a bit more.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.620
[Music]

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.240
There we go.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.640
Our hose now fits in
and it is nice and snug.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.080
It holds itself in place.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.320
You can see that the lid
is just really well attached.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.340
But we can pop it out when we need to.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.620
That's one cut.
Now, let's cut the other side.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.140
[Music]

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.517
Now, on this box specifically,
the corners have these support pieces

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.460
that I think helped keep the box
in shape and help it stay on the lid.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.180
While those may increase the structural
integrity and be a good thing most of time,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.120
they can kind of get in the way for us,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.760
so what we need to do is trim away
some of these little plastic tabs.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.320
[Music]

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.120
We now have our hose intake,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.720
and our hose outtake?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.520
Is that right?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.600
Hose in and hose out.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.380
So, what we need to do is make it so
this lid fits perfectly snugly onto our box.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.700
As it is, we can attach
the lid and it may stay on,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.220
but there's a lot
of space around the sides.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.960
Air is going to be able to get in
through all of the gaps,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.790
and we don't want that.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.160
We want all of the suction
to come out of the front of the hose.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.780
So what we need to do
is make a proto-putty seal

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.280
that goes all the way around,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.340
so when we have the vacuum turned on,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.060
all of a suction is coming
from one spot only.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:59.980
[Music]

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.260
Also, this particular container
has two small holes at the bottom,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.460
and we want to plug those up,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.160
and we'll just use a little bit
of our proto-putty for that as well.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.600
[Music]

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.600
All right, our proto-putty is starting
to set but it's not there yet.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.960
You can see we've still got
lots of squishiness to it,

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.240
and that's exactly what we want.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.860
While it's still squishy,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.660
we need to take our lid
and press it down over the box

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.940
so it forms a nice tight seal.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.060
And the goal is not to make it
so the lid can't come on and off

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.840
because of course we do still
want to be able to remove it.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.680
But the goal is so that
when there is suction in the box,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.640
it just pulls itself nice and closed

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.500
instead of having lots
of air rush in all of the gaps.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.060
[Music]

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.740
One more thing that you can do.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.940
If you cut your holes and you find that the 
hose is a little more loose than you'd like,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.069
you can use some extra proto-putty
to make a seal that goes around the hole

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.820
to make sure your hose
connection is nice and snug.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.860
Depending on how well
you cut your holes,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.740
you may need to do this on
one side, both sides or neither side.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.120
Now that we've got everything formed,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.920
it's time to just let our proto-putty cure
for a few minutes until it's nice and rigid.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.420
Our protoputty is nice and cured.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.120
So now we can remove our hose,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.140
and we can remove the whole lid.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.840
[Music]

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.380
If you've made the proto-putty correctly
with all the cornstarch mixed in,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.960
it shouldn't stick too much.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.660
It should just be able to slide on and off
while holding itself nicely in place.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.820
One of the nicest things about the
proto-putty that we use for the seal

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.520
is that it's designed not
to stick to things too much

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.580
by adding all of that corn starch.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.920
That's really nice because it
means we're able to fit it on the lid,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.580
and then take the lid off and on.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.580
But one of the downsides is
that it is possible that your seal

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.920
will just be kind of loose on your box.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.680
If you want to make it
a little bit more permanent,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.380
you can take a bead of the caulking without
any food coloring or cornstarch in it,

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.660
and that should do a pretty good
job of bonding the silicone seal

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.000
to the plastic of the box.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.540
This stuff is sticky.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.200
It's only not sticky because
we added so much cornstarch.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.020
Now we don't want any little
Lego pieces to get sucked up

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.340
into the actual vacuum cleaner.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.780
So what we want to do
is add a filter onto one side.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.000
I've got a little piece of screen mesh.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.720
You could also use any
sort of cloth with large mesh,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.740
like a tool
or some kind of netting.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.140
This is just what I have available
so this is what I'm going to use.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.140
This little flange seems
like it will get in the way,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.820
so let's just try and trim
that off with our exacto knife.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.659
Now, I've got a hot
glue gun and our mesh,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.080
let's just cut this to size
and then glue it right over that hole.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.889
It should still let air flow
through it really nicely.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.960
It's not going to slow down
the vacuum power at all,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.200
but it's just going to make sure
that none of our Lego pieces

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.540
end up in our vacuum cleaner.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.680
[Music]

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.980
That's pretty hard to see
but it did draw on it.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:52.160
[Music]

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.120
That'll do it.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.780
We have a mesh
covered hole in one side,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.229
and a non-mesh covered
hole on the other side.

00:07:57.229 --> 00:07:58.580
We should be able to pop this lid on,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.279
attach our vacuum hoses,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:04.120
and start sucking up Lego
directly into our Lego storage box .

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:24.060
[Music]

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.000
Box full of Lego pieces.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.920
Very cool. That worked great.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.761
And  you can see a little bit
of fuzz did get sucked up

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:36.260
and pulled up against our little filter here.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.000
So that may be something that is
worth cleaning every once in a while.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.800
Really small dust should probably
still get pulled right through that filter.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.980
The bigger dust will just get caught up
against it but that worked great.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.720
It even pulled up some
of these longer skinny pieces.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.540
They didn't like to go very well, but when
you suck them up with other pieces.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.280
It all sort of traveled through the hose,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.680
even some pieces that
I thought seems kind of large,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.500
like this little window frame piece,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.060
It does fit in the tube but not super easily.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.060
But it still managed
to travel up through there...

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.640
Quite nicely.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.740
Well, this works great,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.820
and I did want to do one thing just
to show it off even a little bit more.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.260
I have a second Lego box
that I've modified

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.500
by adding a clear window
onto the front of it.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.160
Now, we should be able
to see the Lego pieces

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.940
after they've traveled
through the vacuum tube,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.140
land in our box.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.540
And we can see how well that works.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:45.040
[Music]

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.140
That's awesome.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.240
Just flies in there all over the place.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.080
It's pretty neat.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.300
Now, like I said it's not necessary to put
the clear window on the side of your box.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.780
That's just something that lets us see
what's going on as Lego flies in there.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.800
And I think it looks pretty cool.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.340
Overall though, I would
just go with the normal box.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.880
No window added.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.440
Because you know,
that's going to work just as well,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.660
and save you some time and effort.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.900
Guys, this has been awesome
but the fun doesn't have to end.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.600
This little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.480
and you should check that out.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.340
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.440
you need to do watching now,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.600
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.980
so you never miss out on a video.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.560
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.580
Talk to you then.
