00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:10.362
appraisal were his two new considerations. He realized he just left it home. He

didn't have to buy a new one, which was great. And he also realized, it was

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:17.495
nice to get some exercise and be outside for a while. In both of these

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:21.200
examples, we see how important it is, and useful it can be to engage in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.355
secondary appraisal. We can learn a lot from taking a step back and reanalyzing

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:30.470
