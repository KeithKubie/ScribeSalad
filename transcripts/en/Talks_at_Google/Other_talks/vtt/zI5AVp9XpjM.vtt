FEMALE SPEAKER: What
better way to end

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.000
this month on a strong
note than with a talk

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.170
by a lifetime advocate of women
leaders and entrepreneurs.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.300
I've heard Denise speak last
October at the Grace Hopper

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.350
conference.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.170
I loved her workshop on
leadership and communication,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.890
and her actionable,
practical advice.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.410
Here's one example.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.090
She told us, here's what you
will stop doing-- pining,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.750
whining, talking about weather,
traffic, and how busy you are.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.680
Even in the coffee line, talk
about something meaningful,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.750
she said.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.340
It made me realize how often
we waste an opportunity

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.390
for a deep connection.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.270
Denise has a long history of
advocacy for women leaders.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.280
She started a nonprofit to
help women entrepreneurs.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.530
She founded the
Thought Leadership Lab,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.510
where she coaches executives,
entrepreneurs, and leaders

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.630
of Fortune 500 companies.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.050
She co-founded
Springboard, a conference

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.710
for women entrepreneurs.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.220
And last but not least,
she wrote a book,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.870
"Ready to be a Thought Leader,"
which she will discuss today.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.730
This talk is brought
to you in collaboration

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.870
with Talks at Google and
[INAUDIBLE] Women at Google.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.790
Many thanks also
to those who helped

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.500
to make this event
happen, especially

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.890
to Regina [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.410
Without further ado, the
floor is yours, Denise.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.390
Thank you.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.870
DENISE BROSSEAU: I'm
delighted to be here actually

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.440
for three reasons.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.940
First, because it's
Women's History Month,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.160
and we're celebrating our
foremothers and our foresisters

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.150
who are really the people who
built the path that got us here

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.730
where we are today.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.070
Secondly, because
I am really honored

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.150
to reconnect with all the folks
that I met at Grace Hopper.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.590
How many of you guys go to
Grace Hopper conferences?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.390
It's such a fun place where so
many wonderful women in tech

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.900
come together for the
first time, many of them.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.880
And third, because we're
launching a women's community.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490
And honestly, my
whole career has

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.300
been about women's communities.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.880
I belong to them, I start them.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.460
I'm kind of a groupie.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.260
So how did that begin?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.709
I really wanted to share
some of that story.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.250
The truth is, many years ago,
in the early part of my career,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.534
I had the chance to take a
class on creativity in business.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.450
And one of the things
that they asked us to do

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.470
was an exercise to
write our life mission.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.860
Now honestly, I'd never
thought of doing such a thing.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.230
I thought that's
what companies did.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.400
And it took me weeks
and weeks of iterating

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.200
before I came up with
a mission statement

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600
that I could live my life by.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.265
And I want to share it with you.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.640
My mission-- more women
leaders at the top

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.750
of every organization.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.960
How many of you guys
believe that's a mission

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.554
worth accomplishing?

00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:44.054
Yeah.

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:47.040
[CLAPPING]

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.840
So that's why I do
what I do, is I really

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.250
work to that mission statement.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.670
And what I want to talk about
today is some of the paths

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.906
that I've taken to
get here, as well as

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:00.530
some of the techniques that I've
learned and some of the things

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.770
that I've learned from so many
other amazing people, my role

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.500
models, the people within
this community of technology

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.990
but also across the United
States and across the world.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.350
So let's get started.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.270
I want to start with a survey.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.420
So take a minute and
look at all the choices.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.970
I'm not sure what a
thought leader is.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.120
I want to be a thought
leader, but I don't know how.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.090
I've identified goals
that will help me build

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.312
a followership for my ideas.

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:33.520
Becoming a thought leader
is just not my top priority

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.020
right now.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.720
Or, others already call
me a thought leader.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.220
So let's have a
quick show of hands.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.127
How many are A?

00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:40.710
I'm not sure what a
thought leader is.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.210
Yeah.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.440
Admit it, right.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.390
Not really entirely sure.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.891
That word gets
bandied around a lot,

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.223
so we're going to kind of
define it, at least in the way

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.875
that I believe it
should be defined.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.500
How many I want to
be a thought leader,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.994
but I really don't know how?

00:03:52.994 --> 00:03:55.410
OK, good, because we're going
to go through a lot of steps

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.790
today.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.560
That's excellent.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.060
OK.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.560
I have identified goals
that help me already build

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.990
a followership for my ideas.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.630
How many people are
in that category?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.130
Great.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.460
A couple of great folks here.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.000
Becoming a thought leader is
not my top priority right now.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.220
It's OK to admit that.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.280
Maybe you have other
things on your to-do list.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.430
But nobody in this
room has that.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.930
Great.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.430
All right.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.089
And last, others already
call me a thought leader.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.290
I've already been
defined that way.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.440
Not quite yet.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.130
All right, good.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.410
Well that gives me a
sense of where we are,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.220
because I want to spend some
time on both the definition

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.832
and the how-to steps,
because I think

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.290
it's really critical
to think about

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.300
what can we do to move on
that journey from leader

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.120
to thought leader.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.490
What does it take.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.120
But let's start with a
couple of examples of folks

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.900
that I admire, thought
leaders that I admire,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.960
including the two
co-founders of wogrammer.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.960
So these two women working
in the tech industry,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.530
they kept getting the same
question over and over.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.900
And it was always said
with a bit of trepidation,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.876
like, what's it really
like to work in tech?

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.250
Sort of thinking
that maybe there

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.710
was going to be some bad answer
because of something they'd

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.460
read in the media.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.070
And these two women felt
like that's not right.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.070
Our careers are going well.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.550
Women programmers have
great careers in technology,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.330
and we want to share that story.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.080
So they started
interviewing women.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.470
First a few, then
dozens, then hundreds.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.020
And now, they're out
speaking those stories

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.820
in front of lots
of big audiences.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.090
They built a website where
they share their stories,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.750
and now they're
working on a book.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.030
To me, that is building a
followership for your ideas,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.150
and changing the conversation.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.980
Next is a guy Ron Finley.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.990
He calls himself the
guerrilla gardener.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.270
How many of you guys
have heard of Ron?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.790
He's got a wonderful Ted
Talk, well worth listening to.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.500
So he is an artist.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.730
He lives in South
Central Los Angeles.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.900
And one day, he built a
garden in his front yard.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.410
He just planted a garden.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.110
Now that's all well and
good, except for the city

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.160
owned that land.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.660
And so within a few months after
his garden started to grow,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.456
he got a letter, and it
said tear out your garden.

00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:56.432
And he thought,
this is just wrong.

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:58.640
So he started a petition
and he got hundreds and then

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.680
thousands of signatures.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.030
And he took it down to City
Hall, and he demanded a change.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.900
And that change has actually
instituted an entire movement

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.860
around community gardens
in South Central, an access

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.180
to fresh food in a
place where it's just

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.970
strip mall after strip mall.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.530
And he started to
spread those ideas

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.220
to other urban communities
so that homeless shelters are

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.590
building gardens, and they're
taking the abandoned lots

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.180
and turning them into
something useful.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.970
And third is my client,
Von Ton-Quinlivan.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.030
Von is passionate about
education and access

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.010
to great jobs for people from
disadvantaged communities

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.850
and from veteran-- and veterans
who return to the United States

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.870
after being away at war.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.862
And she started a
program at PG&amp;E,

00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:43.730
a hundred-year-old
utility company,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.930
to give access
for the first time

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.700
to those folks for
high-paying jobs,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.777
and then spread that effort
across her entire industry

00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:54.860
and started to spread it
across the United States.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.800
And I'll be telling you
more about her story,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.508
because she's actually
one of the reasons

00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:01.030
that I wrote this book
was my work with her.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.290
She really inspired me
to share what I learned

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.706
from my experience with her.

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:07.490
All right.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.690
So what is a thought leader?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.410
You've heard all of that.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.260
Let me try to distill it.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.210
It starts, I think,
by-- thought leaders

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.690
start by being change agents.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.280
They've got something
that they're

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.160
doing that's different
than what's already

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.140
been done, or always been done.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.830
And they inspire us
with that change.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.910
They inspire a few
folks around them,

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.740
and then they recognize
that this innovation

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.170
is something worth spreading.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.750
They understand they need
to replicate and scale that.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.270
Because they themselves
can't do that alone,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.790
they understand that they need
to start building followers

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.370
in order to build
sustainable change.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.566
So thought leadership
is about starting

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.190
as a change agent,
which is why I think

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.800
this is such a powerful
conversation for folks

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.580
here at Google,
because so many of you

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.750
are creating
unbelievable innovations.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.830
So now, how about
sharing those in a way

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.260
that those ideas
can be broadened,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.032
those innovations can
become sustainable change.

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:04.740
When you think about
our foremothers that

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.230
are showcased on all
the walls around--

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.854
and those who are
not here in the room,

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:11.180
we've got posters of all
kinds of amazing women

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.670
who we're celebrating here
on Women's History Month.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.870
They all replicated their
change beyond one small place

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.640
to something that
had a bigger impact.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.020
Making an impact often
starts, though, locally.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.740
It starts in one company,
one organization, one city,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.550
one school, and then it
starts to grow from there

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.549
through the efforts of often one
or a small team of individuals.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.909
And that starts to have
potentially the chance

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.630
to make a movement.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.020
It is actually the art of
building a followership

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.540
for our ideas and for the
change that we have underway.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.790
That, to me, is true
thought leadership.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.530
It's not tweeting what
you had for lunch.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.130
I know.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.540
That used to be the old way.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.660
Set up a Twitter account,
I'm a thought leader.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.900
Like, no.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.020
Not so much.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.540
So I'm trying to reclaim this
word thought leader, because I

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.110
really do believe it's
something much bigger,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.045
and something to really be proud
of when you get that moniker.

00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:09.420
So let me tell
you a little story

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.190
about how I came to
this conversation.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.000
The truth is, I'm an
accidental thought leader.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.810
I had no plan to be
a thought leader.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.670
I had no idea about
being a thought leader.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.770
But I did work in the technology
industry for a number of years,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.000
and co-founded an
organization called the Forum

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.486
for Women Entrepreneurs.

00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:27.860
For those here in
Silicon Valley,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.730
you may know it
now as Watermark.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.200
But the organization
was originally

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.300
started around one idea,
and that number one

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.410
is where it started.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.390
Less than 1% of
the venture capital

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.770
funding in the United States was
going to women entrepreneurs.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.420
I don't know about you,
but I thought 50% was fair.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.851
1% seemed astonishing.

00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.350
And my co-founder-- that's her
there on the screen, Jennifer

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.520
Gilrobert-- she called me
up one day and she said,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.430
we need to do
something about this.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.715
And she was absolutely right.

00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:58.530
And we created this organization
to offer three things--

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.040
education-- how do
you do this, how

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.710
do you do a venture-funded
scalable business in technology

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.490
and life science; how do
you access all the resource

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.820
providers-- the law firms,
the banks, accounting firms;

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.370
and then third, how
do you connect women

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.010
with others who are their role
models, those who have come

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.740
before, so that they can help
one another so that arm-in-arm

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.220
we can do this together.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.040
So we created that organization.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.136
I was doing it
full-time-- excuse me,

00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:24.510
I was working
full-time, doing it

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.530
on the side, until I quit to
run the organization after five

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.110
years.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.110
We had about 300 members,
and we started scaling

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.660
to other cities.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.630
It was a lot of
work, a lot of fun.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.000
And one day, the phone rang.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.787
So imagine I'm just working away
at my own little organization,

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.120
I get a call from some group
called the National Women's

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.510
Business Council.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.880
I'd never heard of them.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.030
But they were working
at the national level

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.125
on similar issues of women
and access to capital.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.500
And they called
and they said, we

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.230
want to host the first
venture conference

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.930
for women entrepreneurs.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.450
You guys call them
Google demo days, right?

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.430
I attended the Google demo day
here a few week-- months ago

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.680
for women.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.997
This was the precursor to that.

00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:04.830
In fact, it was the
first venture conference

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.030
in the United States
for women entrepreneurs,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.670
where we not only
put them on stage

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.430
but we coached them and got
them ready for prime time.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.360
That eventually
became Springboard.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.320
And that first conference
that we ran here in 2000,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.430
we had 357 applicants.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.380
We chose 27 women.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.002
Within three months, 25 of
those companies got funded.

00:11:26.002 --> 00:11:27.460
People told us that
was impossible.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.876
They told us, first of all,
there were no women out there.

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.030
Who were we to think we
could put on a conference

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.630
of all women entrepreneurs.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.740
But we proved them
wrong, and we went on

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.290
to scale that effort across
the United States and now

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.780
internationally.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.320
But here's what
was so fascinating,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.500
because doing that gave me this
whole different opportunity

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.610
to shape the conversation
about women's entrepreneurship.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.710
I suddenly started getting
calls from the media.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.540
I got a chance to go speak
at conferences nationally,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.980
and even internationally.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.610
I got a chance to serve on
committees and commissions

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.280
working on these issues.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.000
I got a bully pulpit
about an issue

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.180
that I cared about deeply.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.290
And I had no idea
what I was doing.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.290
I mean, I'll be serious.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.310
It's like-- I had to
quickly get media training.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.970
I had to learn how
to tell our story

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.930
and tell our message
more broadly because I

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.720
had this chance.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.160
So, great.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.647
Springboard continues to scale.

00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:22.230
We are all over, as
I said, the world.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.190
We've helped companies like
Zipcar and Constant Contact.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.680
That's the day we went to
NASDAQ and took Constant Contact

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.060
public on the NASDAQ.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.750
It was an amazing high
for all of us involved.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.920
Who would have ever thought
that that would happen?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.780
And the organization now
continues to do its work

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.680
and, fast forward a few years,
I'm off doing other things

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.160
and I get a phone call from
this woman, Von Ton-Quinlivan,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.924
who I mentioned earlier.

00:12:46.924 --> 00:12:48.590
Von called me and she
said, so you know,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.680
Denise, you became
a thought leader

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.970
in women's entrepreneurship.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.860
I want to do that.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.880
Honestly, I'm looking
at the phone going,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.339
I was a thought leader?

00:12:58.339 --> 00:12:59.880
I didn't know I was
a thought leader.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.340
That wasn't a word
I'd use for myself.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.630
Often, it's somebody else who
first gives you that moniker.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.189
And she said, I want to do that.

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:10.480
And we sat down in her living
room and we wrote a plan.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.190
It was a five-year
plan, from nobody

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.420
to well-recognized
thought leader.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.290
And then she hired
me to help her do it.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.800
And over the next three years,
she knocked it out of the park.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.350
She went from creating a program
internally to her company

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.560
called Power Pathway, which was
a community college workforce

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.190
development program which
brought the community together,

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.770
the community colleges together,
and the company together

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.640
to actually train people
to get jobs at PG&amp;E.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.350
But then she spread that
across her industry.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.590
She started serving on
committees and commissions,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.940
testifying in front
of the US Senate,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.730
recognized by the White
House, and then head-hunted

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.290
by the governor to do
the same work that she

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.870
did at PG&amp;E across the
entire community college

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.180
system as the
vice-chancellor of workforce.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.490
That was such a wake-up
call for both of us.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.270
Honestly, I never knew that
you could do this with a plan.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.780
And that's really
why I wrote my book.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.105
I honestly wrote this
book for my younger self.

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:06.890
I mean, I wrote the
book that I wish

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.000
I'd had back when I first
had this sort of moment,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.730
because there was
no book back then

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.290
and I want to give that same
seven-step process to all

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.190
the others who want
to follow in hers

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.280
and all these other women's
and men's footsteps.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.510
So I want to talk about
some of the steps today,

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.690
and how do you do that.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.080
Because thought
leadership gives you

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.260
a platform to change the world.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.050
How many of us
would like to change

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.584
just a little part of the
world just a little bit, right?

00:14:38.584 --> 00:14:40.500
That's probably why we're
working here, right?

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.850
This is a place that you
can get to change the world.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.080
So why do you want to
be a thought leader?

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.650
I want to invite you, since
we're creating community,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.410
to actually interact with
someone you haven't met before,

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.965
or someone who I call your
GC partner-- geographically

00:14:57.965 --> 00:14:58.465
convenient.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.420
I want you to answer this
question with someone.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.610
You know, 30 seconds each.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.490
And those who are on the phone
or sitting at their desk,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.970
write it down.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.220
Why do you want to
be a thought leader?

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.570
Here's some things
people tell me.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.140
They tell me that they
want more influence.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.910
They want more impact.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.730
They want more income.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.320
And they want to leave a legacy.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.345
So which is it for you?

00:15:24.345 --> 00:15:25.970
Or is it something
completely different

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.470
that I haven't even thought of?

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.330
So turn to your GC partner and
just share for a few seconds,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.040
why do you want to do this.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.160
What would make it
worthwhile for you.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.030
Go ahead.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:57.847 --> 00:15:58.722
DENISE BROSSEAU: Shh.

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:02.370
It's always the hardest part.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.670
When I ask a question like
this, people get so engaged.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.190
But how many of you
guys, influence?

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.850
I really need more influence?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.730
A few folks have that one up.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.230
OK.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.040
I like that.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.930
OK, how about impact?

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.240
I want to have more impact?

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.610
The room goes up in flames here.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.350
Yes, this is what I want.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.000
How many would not mind
having a little more income?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.810
OK.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.410
All right.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.118
Pretty much most of
the room on that one.

00:16:24.118 --> 00:16:25.956
And how many would
like to leave a legacy?

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:31.820
Not just do a job, but leave
something behind that matters?

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.540
And then this is the one that
I found was so fascinating.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.710
It's also career insurance.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.110
We got health insurance
and life insurance,

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.090
what about career insurance?

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.700
People love to hire
thought leaders.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.580
People love to work
for thought leaders.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.310
People love to promote
thought leaders.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.660
So this, to me,
having your ideas out

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.320
and a followership for
what you believe in,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.424
this brings all kinds
of opportunities.

00:16:56.424 --> 00:16:58.090
Honestly, when I hear
some of the people

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.160
that I know who've
come to Google,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.420
they've come because they've
built a followership,

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.240
and they've gotten hired in
because of that following.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.619
So, career insurance.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.180
What a great reason
to do anything.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.950
So how does it begin?

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.099
I believe it begins by
finding our passion.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.260
Some of us, our passion is what
we get to do every single day.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.849
Some of us, it's
in our community.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:24.140
Some of us, it's
much more broad.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.510
Some of us, sometimes
it's really tiny.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.260
I just want to change one
thing in my kids' school.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.570
But how do you figure that out?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.050
How do you find
that intersection

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.720
of where you're going to play?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.330
So I came up with this diagram.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.300
We've all started it.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.980
How many of you did
the Venn diagram

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.510
in fifth grade, fourth grade,
right, those three overlapping

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.010
circles?

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.450
I believe that this is the
key to figuring this out.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.750
So it starts with where
you have credibility.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.330
Often, it's where you
have some degrees,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.570
you have some credentials.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.260
Maybe you've won
an award, you're

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.970
part of a company
or a team that's

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.320
doing interesting
work in an area.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.790
Or, it could be
based on the fact

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.950
that you've had people
whose lives you've changed.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.430
Next circle is experience.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.470
This could be the number
of years of experience,

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.570
or successful change agents.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.280
You've made some
successful change.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.600
That's experience.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.830
You've managed a
major initiative.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.860
Or even if you're
just starting out.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.720
That's something that you
want to be out talking about.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.350
And finally, commitment.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.350
You are committed to
improving something.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.170
You're committed to enabling
your team to be more effective.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.450
There's lots of
different ways in which

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.610
this one comes into play.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.810
But if we start there and then
find where the others overlap,

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.610
I find that that's where
people can most likely come up

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.410
with what I call their thought
leadership intersection point,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.004
that place where all three
of the circles intersect.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.510
This is critical, because we
can't be known for everything.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.960
We can't be known for
being all over the place.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.750
We have to find something,
a niche, one place

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.090
to play to be that go-to person.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.380
So this is where it begins.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:16.080
And I want to ask
you this question.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.830
What is one thing you're
really passionate about?

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.330
I'm sure this room
is full of people

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.596
who are passionate about
a lot of amazing things.

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:25.470
So why don't you turn
back to your GC partner

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.530
and just share one thing,
in one sentence or less,

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.410
one thing you're
passionate about.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.020
And it doesn't have to be
related to your day job.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.850
I just want to give
you permission to be

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.391
thinking bigger than that.

00:19:37.391 --> 00:19:37.890
OK.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.530
One thing.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.020
Share with the
person next to you.

DENISE BROSSEAU: Shh.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.790
Here's the thing about
this conversation.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.266
Remember during
Ella's introduction

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:08.890
and she said that
one thing she learned

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.473
is that we waste a
lot of time talking

00:20:10.473 --> 00:20:13.550
about traffic and all the things
that we're too busy doing?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.280
To me, if this was
the question we

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.090
were asking each other
standing in line for coffee,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.030
wouldn't that shift
our entire day?

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.180
Wouldn't it shift
the entire community,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.940
if this is what we talked
about all the time.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.540
Whether it be with
our family members,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.900
whether it be with our
friends, whether it

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.200
be with our colleagues.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.982
So I talked to Sue-- just
going to pick on you here.

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:36.440
I'm guessing that one of the
things you're passionate about

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
is women's leadership.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.180
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.554

I have ever heard
of that actually

has a full-time person devoted
to running their women's

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:48.160
network.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.457
I think that's fabulous.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:52.040
And to get to align what you're
passionate about with your day

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.060
job, that's pretty fabulous.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.740
OK, what else?

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.323
Who else is passionate
about something

00:20:56.323 --> 00:20:58.640
that they're willing to share?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.760
Be brave now.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.546
Yes.

00:21:01.546 --> 00:21:03.515
AUDIENCE: I'm quite
passionate about helping

00:21:03.515 --> 00:21:04.718
other people be successful.

other people be successful.

good at helping myself.

DENISE BROSSEAU: Oh, yes.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.120
We're always really good
at the others, right.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.328
She said that she's not very
good at helping herself,

00:21:13.328 --> 00:21:15.662
but she's really good
at helping other people.

00:21:15.662 --> 00:21:17.620
That's something to really
be passionate about.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.800
And being able to see
them shine and see them

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.180
succeed, that's really
wonderful, isn't it?

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.270
What else?

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.550
One more idea.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.350
One more something
somebody's passionate about.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.460
Yes.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.400
AUDIENCE: For me, it's
access to good food.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.971
So there's a non-profit--

00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:35.470
DENISE BROSSEAU:
So Autumn is really

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.900
passionate about great food.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.070
I'm going to say this so
the people online can hear.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.920
And she works with a
community organization that

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.650
goes into backyards,
picks the fruit

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.964
and re-distributes it so
that it doesn't go to waste

00:21:45.964 --> 00:21:47.630
and people can get
out in the fresh air.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:48.570
I'm ready to sign up.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.510
So this, to me, is
where it begins, right?

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.752
If we can find that one
piece we're passionate about.

00:21:56.752 --> 00:21:59.310
So I want you to start
thinking about this today.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.000
If nothing came to
mind immediately,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.220
this is where the
conversation starts.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.170
The second is to
find your imperative.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.287
I'm going to share--
Katie Orenstein is

00:22:08.287 --> 00:22:10.120
one of the people I
interviewed for my book.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.940
Katie is a former
journalist who is really

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.590
on a roll across
the United States

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.830
to create women empowered
to write op-eds.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.250
Why is that?

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.180
What she realized is--
she did some research--

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:30.230
37% of the content contributed
to news outlets-- only 37%--

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.310
is women.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.750
Only 15% of the editors
on Wikipedia are women.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.770
Only 26% of the Sunday
morning news shows are women.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.870
And she believed that
part of it was a challenge

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.970
with being able to
shape an argument,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.950
being able to frame the
conversation in a way that

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.120
showcased new ideas without
discounting the old.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.230
And so she created a program
called The Op-Ed Project--

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.090
theopedproject.org-- and
she goes around the country

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.810
offering op-ed seminars, one-day
sessions-- I've gone twice

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.730
over the five years that
I've known about it--

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.860
and spend a Saturday
and really learn

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.460
how to frame an
argument because that

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.830
is critical for everything,
whether it be getting up

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.149
in your own company to
articulate your ideas,

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:13.690
whether it be getting
on a big stage,

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.160
whether it be writing an op-ed
for the "New York Times,"

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.840
it takes shaping an argument
in a way, as I said,

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.224
that doesn't discount others.

00:23:20.224 --> 00:23:22.140
And that's what she's
really passionate about,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.420
because her belief is that if
we shape the conversations,

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.030
we shape regulations,
we shape policy,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.350
and we shape the way we're
treated by the culture

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.600
that we live in.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.980
That's her imperative.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.500
So thinking to yourself,
what if for you.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.030
Here's what I mean by that.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.790
If we have a vision
of the future

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.620
that we can see-- what
if it looked like this--

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.270
and we can articulate
that for others,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.650
that's when we can get
people to follow us.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.360
So here's what I
recognized-- when

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.480
I started the Forum for
Women Entrepreneurs oh

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.710
so many years ago, we had
that conversation with people,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:06.690
what if women had 50% of
the venture capital funding

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.190
in the United States?

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.130
I hate to say how
many years later it is

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.410
and we're somewhere
between 6% and 11%,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.262
depending on what year it is.

00:24:14.262 --> 00:24:15.720
We've been at this
for a long time.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.620
The what if future
could be very far off.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.300
But you want to imagine a
future and envision a future

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.900
and articulate a future, because
then others will get on board

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.855
and create that future with you.

00:24:26.855 --> 00:24:27.730
That's what it takes.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.820
We can't do any of this alone.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.390
So that question of what
if, what is the better

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.557
future that you envision?

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:38.390
Write that one down as
something to go ahead

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.110
and think about when
you get home tonight.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.360
Can I articulate it clearly?

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.690
Can I tell others what I
want to change in the world?

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.570
That's a really
important question

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.810
to be asking ourselves,
or asking our friends.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.930
OK.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.200
Another quick survey.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.440
What, if anything,
is holding you back

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.969
from becoming a thought leader.

00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:01.760
Now you know a little
bit about what it is.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.230
We're starting to talk
about some of the steps,

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.896
and we're going to
talk about some more.

00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:07.200
But I'm too busy,
I don't have time;

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.320
I don't have the appropriate
skill set, give me a few years;

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.320
I have some good ideas, but
sometimes I lack confidence;

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.219
or nothing, I'm on my way.

00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:16.760
So let's see.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.980
Show of hands, number
one, I'm too busy.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.700
A couple.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.510
Few.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.200
OK.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.640
Number two, I don't have
the appropriate skill set.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.500
Not quite ready yet.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.560
Give me a few years.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.390
OK.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.320
Number three, I
have some good ideas

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.550
but sometimes I lack confidence.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.050
Yeah.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:32.990
That one I see a lot.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.270
Absolutely.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.891
Or nothing, I'm on my way.

00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:36.390
OK.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.515
We've got a few folks in
the front of the room, who

00:25:38.515 --> 00:25:39.706
sat front and center.

00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:41.580
What does that tell you
about that front row?

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.538
Next time, you're going
to sit in the front row

00:25:43.538 --> 00:25:46.169
because you'll be able
to say yes to that.

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:47.460
Here's what's been fascinating.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.190
I've been around
the country talking

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.389
about these issues
and these ideas.

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:54.180
I've been around the
country to communities

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.520
of men, women, old, young, every
kind of background and culture,

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.590
and what I keep finding is the
same story, the same things

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.410
that are holding everyone back.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.540
I'm beginning to wonder
who got the memo that

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.430
says it's OK, because nobody
I've met has got the memo.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.460
It's either their company,
their boss, their culture,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.730
their family, some sort of
religious norm, whatever.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.450
There's so many reasons
why we don't do this.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.700
There are so many things
that hold us back.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.610
And I get that.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.170
In fact, I added a whole
chapter in the center of my book

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.890
because I realize how important
this conversation of what

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.190
I call putting your
I-- the letter I--

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.932
put your I on the line.

00:26:32.932 --> 00:26:35.140
So everyone I interviewed
for the book, I asked them,

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.906
what do you do?

00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:37.250
How do you keep going?

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.600
How do you stay focused on
this as a priority for you?

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.170
And I put together what I
call the rules for resilience.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.850
And I came up with
one image that I

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.970
think sort of tells the story.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.130
And this is it.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.290
Because how many days do
we get up in the morning

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.810
and we look in the mirror and
we see the lion and we think,

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.420
we can do anything,
we're invincible.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.010
And how many times do
we get up in the morning

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.350
and we see the
little kitty that's

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:10.120
even smaller than ourselves,
because there's what I call--

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.270
or there's what my client
calls-- the itty bitty

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.970
shitty committee.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.470
Right?

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.178
It's in our head.

00:27:15.178 --> 00:27:16.080
It's very loud.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.620
Anybody have one of those?

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.090
We all admit that we have one.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.920
Those negative voices, they
tell us we can't do this,

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.400
we can't do this,
for whatever reason.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.240
So how do we fire the itty
bitty shitty committee?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.110
How do we move beyond those
conversations from our family

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.960
or our background that say don't
get too big for your britches,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.600
or don't be a show-off,
or whatever it is

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.400
that we're telling ourselves?

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.920
So just think to
yourself and share

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.870
with the person next to you how
do you nurture your inner lion.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.830
What's one thing you do?

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.210
Some people it's music.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.460
Some people it's colleagues.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.190
Some people it's getting
out and doing exercise.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.940
But just share with
the person next to you

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.350
what's one thing you do
to build your courage,

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.170
to feel invincible, to feel
like anything is possible?

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.060
OK.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.010
Match up with somebody.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.518
What is one thing?

00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:12.422
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:33.988 --> 00:28:36.910
DENISE BROSSEAU: Shh.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.690
Can I hear just a few folks?

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.750
Who has something?

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.080
Let's hear those little secrets.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.660
What is it that
you do to nurture

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.777
that sense of confidence?

00:28:46.777 --> 00:28:47.860
What's a couple of things?

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.693
There must be some great
ideas in this room.

00:28:49.693 --> 00:28:50.750
I believe it.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.000
AUDIENCE: Coming to this talk.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.250
DENISE BROSSEAU:
Coming to this talk.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:53.750
Thank you.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.570
That's very sweet, Ella.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.210
And how many of you
watch Ted Talks?

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.090
I really-- I love to watch
Ted Talks because they inspire

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.180
me to think, here's a
person who came from nobody,

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.279
came from nowhere, and
look at this amazing thing

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.070
that they're doing.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.568
What else are you trying?

00:29:08.568 --> 00:29:09.943
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
suggestion.

00:29:09.943 --> 00:29:11.449
Just tell yourself
you can do it.

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.740
DENISE BROSSEAU: Tell yourself.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.920
The positive voice instead
of the negative voice.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.060
So it's that mantra, that
repeating, I can do anything.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.450
I am amazing.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.230
Wouldn't that be a wonderful
thing to wake up to.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.095
Yes.

00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:28.115
AUDIENCE: Reminding
yourself of [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:28.115 --> 00:29:28.990
DENISE BROSSEAU: Yes.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.154
Remind yourself the past.

00:29:31.154 --> 00:29:32.820
What's the journey
I've already been on?

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.890
What have I already overcome
to get where I am today?

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.989
Because if I could do
that, I can do anything.

00:29:38.989 --> 00:29:41.280
That's what's so fun about
the Grace Hopper conference.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.970
You know, I get this room of
600 women, and I ask them,

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.450
how many of them came from
another part of the world.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.900
And, like, 80% of
them raise their hand.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.720
How many of you
are doing business

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.720
in a language that's
not your first language?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.335
You know, 75%.

00:29:53.335 --> 00:29:55.850
And I think, you can do that?

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.210
The rest of this is easy.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:57.860
Honestly.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.450
That feels impossible to me.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.287
And yet, so many
people have done that.

00:30:01.287 --> 00:30:03.620
So you're right, reminding
ourselves of where we've been

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.600
and what we've already overcome.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.990
So I want you to think
about your own practices.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.040
And actually maybe
document them,

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.790
because there's days
when you kind of need

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.255
to remind yourself.

00:30:14.255 --> 00:30:16.550
It's one of those little
kitty days, what can I

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.010
do today to actually
bring myself back

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.290
to feeling confident.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.330
That's an important
list to have handy.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.830
Put it on your smartphone
so that you have that ready.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.070
OK.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.710
Let's go on to step four
here, because this was really

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.140
the biggest awakening, the
biggest learning, for me

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.890
when I was doing this book.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.220
I'm a start-up girl.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.350
I started my first
company when I was 26.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.260
I love the start-up phase.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.510
I join all kinds of start-ups.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.650
I insisted on being
employee 13 or less,

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.830
because I love that first part,
right, where there's nothing.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.300
It's all to get figured out.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.940
And then I started
to talk to people

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.910
who really were thought
leaders in the world,

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.840
and what I learned was that
this was the essential step.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.750
You have to codify what
you've done so others

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.464
can follow in your footsteps.

00:31:04.464 --> 00:31:05.880
So one of the
people I interviewed

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.830
is actually someone
here at Google.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.100
How many of you know Avinash?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.600
Right?

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.460
So Avinash started
his career at Intuit.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.920
He started working for the
first time with search engine

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.060
optimization tools, and
he realized that they

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.310
were really hard to implement.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.559
It was hard to get his company
on board with the kinds

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.830
of things he needed to do.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.350
So he spoke at a
conference one day,

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.480
and he started telling
these experiences.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.870
And two guys came up to him
at the end, and they said,

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.357
you should write a blog on that.

00:31:31.357 --> 00:31:33.940
And when we were talking, when
I interviewed him on the phone,

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.970
he said, there were
already thousands of blogs.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.720
Who was I to blog?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.900
So he tried a test.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.710
He just sent it out
to maybe 10 or 12

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.830
or 13 different
colleagues, and his wife,

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.330
to see what people thought.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.590
Did he have anything to say?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:52.620
And he came up with a set
of principles, one of which

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.690
really resonated with me.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.810
And that is, uncomplexify.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.460
Now, I know this a made-up word.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.400
But what he-- the
reason that he said

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.110
this is that he recognized that
the kinds of things that you

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.320
guys are dealing
with in technology,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.980
or people in health care or
whatever field they're in,

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.652
they are complicated.

00:32:10.652 --> 00:32:12.360
And we're not talking
about dumbing down,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.930
we're talking about simplifying.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.770
Getting rid of the jargon,
getting rid of the acronyms.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.710
I worked at Motorola.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.560
I understand the
world of acronyms.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.830
But that's not how others
can follow your path.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.950
So he started blogging
and, over time, he

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.670
got a call from
somebody at Wiley

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.540
and they said, what if we
put your blogs into a book?

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.520
And then he wrote a second book
with more blog posts in it.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.400
Today, he has blog
followers around the world

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.034
and, of course, followers on
social media from everywhere.

00:32:40.034 --> 00:32:41.450
But he tells me
that the one thing

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.810
he's most excited about from his
experience is the love letters.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.744
He gets love letters
from all over the world.

00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:51.660
He said he gets love
letters from young people

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.630
when they're first
stepping into their career,

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.820
thank you so much for
giving me the path that I

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.410
can follow for my career.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.120
Another, a senior
executive at a big company,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.700
a global company,
saying thank you

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.894
for being able to distill
that, because I was really

00:33:03.894 --> 00:33:06.060
having trouble understanding
how I could get my team

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.630
to get on board with that.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.880
Uncomplexify.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.147
It's a really key point.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.110
Another part of this
codify your lessons learned

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.630
is about models, frameworks.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.100
So my friend Robin Chase, the
CEO and founder of Zipcar,

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.350
she just came out with a new
book called "Peers, Inc."

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.510
And she created this cool model.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.990
I can't get into
the whole details,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.240
but these are the
kinds of things

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.660
that people who want to go
from leader to thought leader

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.840
start to think about.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.990
It's showing the pathway.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.260
It's showing the path.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.410
How did I get here?

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.790
What are the things
I believe in?

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.090
What's my credo?

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.170
What's the framework?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.010
How can I do this?

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.975
So when I was doing my
own book, of course--

00:33:43.975 --> 00:33:45.350
and it was all
about frameworks--

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.432
I had to go out and hire
somebody to create me

00:33:47.432 --> 00:33:48.890
a framework, because
I had no idea,

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.060
just to articulate
my seven steps.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.151
We're covering a
few of these today.

00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:54.650
And this is available
on my website,

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.465
but this is, to me, the
steps that it takes.

00:33:57.465 --> 00:33:59.590
You're not going to always
start in the same place.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.423
But that's part of what
we're talking about.

00:34:01.423 --> 00:34:03.980
You want to articulate what
are the steps that others

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.800
can take to move forward.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.770
And then we're going to talk
about being discoverable.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.130
Being discoverable
is pretty important.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.320
And what was so fun when
I was preparing this talk

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.730
was to see the
discoverable behavior

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.949
of some of your colleagues.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.521
So, being discoverable could
be having a great LinkedIn

00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:23.020
profile.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.150
How many have a great
LinkedIn profile?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.820
About a third of the room, OK.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.389
Maybe half on a good day.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.889
OK.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:33.060
How many have put themselves
forward for an award?

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.870
One.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.050
Two.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.920
So I just want to say, I
got nominated for an award.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.760
An organization contacted
me and they said, could you

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.909
complete this form.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.580
And so I completed the
form and I sent it back,

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.967
because I thought getting an
award would be kind of fun.

00:34:46.967 --> 00:34:49.425
And the woman wrote back and
she said, that was remarkable.

00:34:49.425 --> 00:34:51.230
And I said, what do you mean?

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.150
She said, a third of the
people don't open the e-mail

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.230
past the first target
line, and no one

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.644
has ever gotten the
form back in 24 hours.

00:35:01.644 --> 00:35:03.060
I didn't think I
was that strange,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.396
but this is what
I'm talking about.

00:35:05.396 --> 00:35:06.770
If we don't put
ourselves forward

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.090
or co-nominate
someone else, we're

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.577
not going to be
discoverable for our ideas.

00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:13.410
So here's a few people
within your community

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.040
who are-- this is my
friend Joyce Dickerson,

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.170
who's out of town or would
have been here today.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.760
She's from the Global Data
Center on Sustainability.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.090
Used to be at Stanford.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.460
And she was talking
at an online forum

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.580
about hosting a summit on
how green is the internet.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.750
It's a great little video.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.580
I definitely recommend
you go watch it,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.800
because she talks about
how that team has really

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.870
done thought leadership around
these ideas of sustainability.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.380
And then I found
our very own Vidya,

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.730
who will be speaking
on the panel, who

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.610
was doing a fun little
video about how to unleash

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.840
the power of Chrome kiosk apps.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.730
And I found Joanna Smith
from the Android team

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.450
who was on Medium telling
people about how--

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.790
developers about how
to use the Google tools

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.130
to create great interfaces.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.830
And I found internationally your
Google Nigeria country manager,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.400
who was hosting
a wonderful panel

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.560
program similar to
this showcasing women

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.859
leaders in her country,
and being able to share

00:36:14.859 --> 00:36:16.150
that with the Google community.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.320
So this is another
question I want

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.220
to leave you to think about.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.990
How will you be more
discoverable this year?

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:31.190
What is one thing you can do
to get your ideas out there?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.560
I'm going to give you three
possible things that you

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.140
wouldn't have thought about in
how to answer this question,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.220
starting here with convening.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.520
So one of the powerful
ways that Von really

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.060
changed things in
her industry is she

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.380
convened a consortium
across her industry.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.170
How did we do that?

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.270
The idea was to find all
the people with her same job

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.040
title in other companies
in the utility industry

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.220
and invite them to join her
in a quarterly gathering.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.960
She found a host-- excuse
me, a head of the group,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.044
and she was the co-head.

00:37:04.044 --> 00:37:05.710
The head of the group
was a guy that was

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.240
well-respected and well-known.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.690
She was completely
unknown in the community.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.330
So as the co-chair
of the consortium,

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.550
she had a chance
to draft the agenda

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:19.330
to make sure her agenda got
discussed at every meeting.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.720
Convening is a very powerful
strategy for thought leaders,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.430
bringing people together
to share best practices

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.380
but also sharing your own.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.980
Sharing what you're
struggling with

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.360
and learning from other people,
but also teaching other people.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.900
Second strategy.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.540
I couldn't go without
talking about Sheryl.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.340
When people ask-- and
outside the Bay Area,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.910
when I ask people what's one
thought leader they think of,

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.890
this is the first person
that comes to mind.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.780
But what I think is unique
about what she's done,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:57.200
she went from a talk to a
book to building a community,

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.600
empowering people to start
their own communities.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.300
So think about
yourselves this year.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.560
She has actually
created this possibility

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.770
for women who are really excited
and passionate about women's

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.180
leadership to create
Google-- excuse

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.355
me, create Lean In circles.

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.230
How many of them are
within Google right now?

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.604
How many of you guys have been
to a-- you have some here,

00:38:15.604 --> 00:38:16.870
right?

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.709
The one in Palo Alto I think
is like 700 people now.

00:38:19.709 --> 00:38:21.500
I got to speak for them
a couple years ago.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.760
I was like, 700 people.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.630
They don't all come.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.213
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:24.213 --> 00:38:25.350
DENISE BROSSEAU: OK.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:26.540
It was a little scary.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.720
But maybe 50 or 60
come to each session,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.130
and we have a chance to discuss
the things that Sheryl's really

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.780
advocating about how to lean in.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.120
And last, I want to
have a little exercise

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.380
here on my third strategy,
which I call amplify.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.290
And I want to actually
get you all out

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.280
of your chairs for a few
minutes and playing with me.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.840
So let me explain how
this is going to work.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.380
You're all going to match
up in groups of three,

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.480
and you're going to each
have a separate role.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.550
Role number one is
the interviewer.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.810
And the interviewer
has a microphone.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.562
You see my microphone, right?

00:39:04.562 --> 00:39:06.520
And you're going to
interview the other person.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.280
You're always going to say
the same question-- tell

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.850
me one thing about yourself
that you really like.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.390
Or what's your
superpower, if you prefer.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.140
The second person
is the interviewee,

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.870
and they were going to
answer the question.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.390
The third person
is the amplifier.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.420
Let me show a little bit
about how that might work.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:34.160
So let's say that the person
says, I'm really brave.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.060
That the attribute I'm
most proud of about myself.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.570
So how might you amplify that?

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.150
So I'm going to make this up.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.350
So let's say Sue says,
I'm really brave.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.720
Because you're really
brave, Sue, aren't you?

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.680
Sue is not just brave, Sue
is the bravest woman I know.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.240
She climbed Annapurna last year.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.960
She goes and jumps
out of airplanes.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.880
Not only that, but
she organizes events

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.900
that bring together thousands
of women to change the world.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.830
She's brave every
day for her daughter.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.360
She's brave every
day for her team.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.090
Now, I've only met
Sue for five minutes.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.220
I have no idea if she
does any of those things.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.076
You're making it up.

00:40:14.076 --> 00:40:15.460
This is for fun, OK?

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.160
And how long do you go?

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.850
How long does this last?

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.850
Go as long as you
can plus 20 seconds.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.396
This is supposed to take you
out of your comfort zone.

00:40:25.396 --> 00:40:27.020
And I'll explain why
you're doing this.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.480
But after the
first person, we're

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.480
going to go on to the
second and then the third.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.770
You've got maybe just a
few minutes to do this,

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.228
because I want to leave some
time for questions at the end.

00:40:35.228 --> 00:40:37.610
But everybody rotates,
everybody plays each role.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.000
And the last thing is, when
I ask you for one superpower

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.180
or attribute, I do not
mean your cute shoes

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.210
or your cool glasses.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.420
This means an attribute,
something that you

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.569
do that you're really proud of.

00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:52.110
And the first thing
that came to mind

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.134
is not the one you
dismiss right now.

00:40:54.134 --> 00:40:55.550
That was the
committee showing up.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.049
No.

00:40:56.049 --> 00:40:58.510
Whatever you thought, I'm
proud of this attribute,

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.480
that's the one you say.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.980
All right?

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.960
Everybody up.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.100
Match into threes.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.904
Nobody gets to not play.

00:41:03.904 --> 00:41:07.696
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.230
DENISE BROSSEAU: All right,
so here's my question.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.919
How many of you
like the people that

00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:45.460
were in your group
a whole lot better

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.320
than you did a few minutes ago?

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.700
What is that about?

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.077
What is that about?

00:41:52.077 --> 00:41:53.910
AUDIENCE: Because they're
complimenting you.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:54.868
DENISE BROSSEAU: Right?

00:41:54.868 --> 00:41:58.450
They just said nice
things about you.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.810
How much of this
behavior is going on

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.374
in our day-to-day lives?

00:42:02.374 --> 00:42:03.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.180
DENISE BROSSEAU: I'm kind of on
a roll around as many audience

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.190
as I can to get more of
this amplifying behavior.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:12.900
Not everyone is going to be
on the front of the stage.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.820
Not everyone is going to be
the thought leader tomorrow.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.030
But all of us can amplify.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.000
All of us can
amplify each other.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.220
And this kind of behavior
just is so reinforcing.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.470
It gets us to want to come
to work in the morning

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.210
if somebody's actually
paying attention.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.040
Now by the way, those people
were making that stuff up.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.480
What if somebody was
amplifying something

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.060
you were actually doing?

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.000
Something you're
actually good at?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.692
That, to me, is
the counterbalance

00:42:39.692 --> 00:42:40.400
to the committee.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.737
It's the idea that
if our culture--

00:42:42.737 --> 00:42:44.320
we were talking
during the break about

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.101
how often, if we come
from another place, that's

00:42:47.101 --> 00:42:49.350
a place that was told-- we
were told, that's not-- you

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:50.840
don't put yourself forward.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.280
So we need others
sometimes to find

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.320
that little secret passion,
that little expertise that we

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.640
see but we discount.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.070
And we want people to
be amplifying that,

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.200
so you can be amplifying
that for each other.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.900
That's something I really
wish for your community,

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.100
to have much more of the--
like, nominate someone

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.270
else for an award.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.140
Put someone else forward
to be on a panel,

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.430
or be on a panel with
someone for the first time

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.940
if they've never done it.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.714
Help somebody to think through
what they're passionate about.

00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:21.380
I was talking during
the break, as well,

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.392
about how-- people said,
well, how do I do this?

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.850
I don't know what
my-- I don't know

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.380
how to do that
[INAUDIBLE] exercise.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.430
So I will share with
you some worksheets

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.340
that I have, but let me
just cover this last couple

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.870
questions.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.450
And the first, this is
really the ultimate question.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.550
How will you support
each other this year.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.440
How could you create
little communities

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.490
of folks who want to take the
first steps on the thought

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.960
leadership path?

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.290
How could you potentially
use a Lean In Circle

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.410
model to come together on a
weekly, monthly, or quarterly

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.400
basis to actually
amplify one another

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.340
and invite and empower
each other to move forward

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.720
in this conversation?

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.960
Because to me, thought
leadership is not

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.460
about being known,
it is about being

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.390
known for making a difference.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.090
So my invitation
every time I give

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:12.354
this talk is to say, what
do you want to be known for?

00:44:12.354 --> 00:44:14.520
That's such a great question
to be asking ourselves.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.103
And we're so busy
with our to-do list,

00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:18.080
we often forget to ask it.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.180
So I will take some questions,
but if you want to reach me,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.360
this is how you can find me.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.420
I want to invite you to be
more discoverable this year.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.900
I want you to help other
team members and colleagues

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.600
to be more discoverable.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.130
And if I can help
you or your team

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.890
to be more influential, to
make that journey from leader

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.660
to thought leader,
this is what I do.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.690
I get to work with amazing
people, many of them

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.944
women leaders, and their
teams who are really

00:44:43.944 --> 00:44:46.360
making that journey and helping
them to think through what

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.480
are all the strategies
they can use, how can they

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.756
be more effective and
be more efficient at it.

00:44:50.756 --> 00:44:52.630
And if you send me a
note to denise@thoughtle

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.220
adershiplab.com--
denise@thoughtle

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.510
adershiplab.com-- I will send
you a secret page on my website

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.470
which has a whole set
of worksheets which

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:04.790
go with the book, because I
really believe that there is

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.910
some very basic steps
that you can take,

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.290
but sometimes taking them
from just reading a book

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:10.530
can feel overwhelming.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.920
The book is written as
a seven-step process,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.610
with a ton of resources and
questions to ask yourself,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.310
but the worksheets are
sort of an adjunct to that.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.319
All right, so, happy to
take a few questions.

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:21.860
I know we're running
up against time,

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.550
but who has a question for me?

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.500
How long does it take.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, how long it
takes to from [INAUDIBLE]--

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.868
DENISE BROSSEAU: From
leader to thought leader.

00:45:29.868 --> 00:45:32.333
Yeah, I wish I could
say, oh, about a week.

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:34.140
All done.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.800
Honestly, everybody takes
a little different path,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.520
and everybody takes a
little different timeline.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.820
For me, it was really
in a year because it was

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.070
kind of I was the go-to girl.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.320
I was one of three or four
people in the United States

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.819
who knew anything about a topic
in the middle of the dot.com

00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:52.060
craze, and it was the
hot topic and everybody

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.165
wanted someone to talk to.

00:45:53.165 --> 00:45:55.540
We had an organization, we
were doing interesting things,

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.460
we were out showcasing
women entrepreneurs.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.850
And so that's why I got this
opportunity and really kind of,

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.730
over the next year
after the conference,

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.160
just kind of went everywhere.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.054
Others of my clients have taken
definitely longer than that.

00:46:08.054 --> 00:46:10.220
You know, for Von, it was
three years from beginning

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.940
to getting her head hunted to
the job at the chancellor's

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.560
office.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.850
From absolute zero-- a brand-new
job, no team, no resources,

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.580
nothing-- to being head-hunted.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.660
That was three years.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.390
So everybody's different.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.360
And by the way, it
doesn't really-- to me,

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.430
it's not so much about the time
it takes, but the impact you

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.989
have along the way.

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:31.530
So much of this is
about figuring out

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.530
how am I going to
measure my success.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.620
Am I measuring it
by my followership?

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.510
Am I measuring it by
people adopting my ideas?

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.980
Am I measuring it
by just feeling

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.930
more career satisfaction,
which you mentioned.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.650
Do I just feel more like
I'm leaving that legacy

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:47.250
that I want to leave.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.470
That kind of measurement
stick is a little

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.900
different than just a timeline.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.134
AUDIENCE: I imagine to be
a really good and diligent

00:46:55.134 --> 00:46:56.550
thought leader
that you have to be

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.840
able to take a lot of bumps
and bruises along the way,

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.630
and a lot of resilience and
have a lot of perseverance.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:06.150
So I'm just interested
to hear-- that, to me, I

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.017
feel like is sometimes
where I hesitate,

00:47:08.017 --> 00:47:10.350
like do I want to take all
the bumps and bruises coming.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.530
DENISE BROSSEAU: Absolutely.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.654
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious
to know your approach when

00:47:13.654 --> 00:47:14.627
those come on the road.

00:47:14.627 --> 00:47:16.210
DENISE BROSSEAU:
Yeah, there's arrows.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.390
There are definitely
arrows that come our way.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.770
But here's the thing that's
so fascinating to me.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.689
Usually, in our mind, they're
way bigger than the actuality.

00:47:23.689 --> 00:47:26.230
All the different people that
I've worked with over the eight

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.563
years I've been doing this
work, there have been arrows,

00:47:28.563 --> 00:47:29.630
I'm not going to kid you.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.990
But usually, we imagine
them to be way bigger,

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.150
and we stop ourselves because
we think that's going to happen.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:36.900
And yet, what we
find is, when we

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.550
do we hit a bump
in the road-- I'm

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.600
not saying we don't have
them, I have one client

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.910
who put out a post that really
wasn't well-researched and got

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.460
some real pushback on you don't
have the facts-- but being

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.670
able to clarify and build--
re-build the credentials

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.460
after that and the credibility
after that by owning it up.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.340
The truth is like anything.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.280
Innovation is about
making mistakes.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.130
Innovation is about
bumps in the road

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.070
and overcoming those bumps.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.410
And by having a community or
having someone else next to you

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.920
to lean on, I highly
recommend that.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.470
You know, that definitely helps.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.400
And then lastly, I
would say that there's

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.220
this great quote by a guy
named Hank Lieber that I put

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.550
in the book, and he
talks about there really

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.470
is no such thing as failure.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.400
He says, failure is if you keep
doing the same mistake over

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.970
and over and over.

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.360
Otherwise, it's just learning.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.220
And we all want to keep
learning, so keep going.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.610
Which I think is just a very
powerful reframe of this.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.770
Yes, people are
going to bump into me

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:37.190
and they're going to
question me and doubt me.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:40.350
But the more I can keep
going and learning from that,

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.426
the stronger I get.

00:48:41.426 --> 00:48:43.550
As one of the women I
interviewed in the book said,

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:46.789
you have to get ready for
when you're not ready.

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:48.080
Because we're not ready, right?

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.500
We weren't ready for the job
we have right now, were you?

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.150
Right?

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:52.150
We're not.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.990
But picking ourselves up,
brushing ourselves off,

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.164
and keep going.

00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:58.080
But thank you all for
being here and thank you

00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.790
for playing with me today.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:00.632 --> 00:49:01.590
I really appreciate it.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.139
[APPLAUSE]
