A fast food chain in Brazil is selling burgers
wrapped in edible paper. And hey, look, it's

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.820
Mr. T...BAG.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.330
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.250
Researchers from Spain have developed this
eco-friendly brick. By using waste from paper

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.980
mills and mixing it with clay, they pressurize
and extrude it like a sausage to create these

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.250
paper building blocks. They take less time
in the kiln than conventional bricks, saving

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.750
energy and money, but they're currently not
quite as strong.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.720
Meanwhile the Tokyo Metropolitan University
Graduate School of System Design is developing

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.080
virtual body technology that utilizes five
senses. Visuals are provided by a 3D monitor,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.570
headphones for audio, it can create the feeling
of wind and spread smells with a fan, a chair

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.850
that leans back and forth and vibrates, and
it even has foot pedals. The idea is to allow

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.140
seniors to experience things like traveling
Milan, or running the 100-meter dash like

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.580
Usain Bolt.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.110
Gate Feeder is a high-tech way to make sure
your proper cat gets the proper food. Only

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.600
the cat wearing the right RFID tag collar
can open the door preventing other cats who

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.900
might bully each other out of food, interrupting
regular meals or special diets.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.050
World's Largest Round Pizza.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.080
Roboy aims to be the most modern tendon-driven
robot in the world. The Artificial Intelligence

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.920
Lab of the Univeristy of Zurich is building
this open source humanoid service robot in

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.860
only 9 months, and they intend for Roboy to be helpful to humans. And hopefully

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.300
not destroy us...

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.670
Sound Bottle was designed by Jun Fujiwara
of Tama Art University to record the soundtrack

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.670
of everyday life. It makes a database of sound
sources and forms music with automatic repetitions.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.600
It turns out belly buttons are like rain forests
of bacteria. A recent study found that from

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.600
60 belly buttons, 2,368 bacterial species
were found, 1,458 of which may be new to science.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.730
So...Yeah.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.170
Techjet's Robot Dragonfly is a palm-sized
robot that flies like a bird, hovers like

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.870
an insect, and is designed for aerial photography,
gaming, and security. This award winning,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.870
WiFi enabled micro-flying insect has 20 environmental
sensors, GPS capabilities and HD cameras.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.900
You can also customize color and even the
wing design. Find the link below for more.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.430
"Honey, you're burning the ice cubes again!"
"It's just calcium carbide reacting with water

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.640
to form acetylene gas." "Alright."

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.290
Finally, Firewall is an interactive media
installation by Aaron Sherwood in which a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.290
sheet of spandex acts as an interface to create
fire-like visuals and play music...

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.900
I'm gonna leave you with a robot that juggles
without any sensors and, as always, thanks

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.900
for watching.
