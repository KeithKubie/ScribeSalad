00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.640
As we enter into 1917,
the United States

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.390
has been able to maintain
its neutrality in World War

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.690
I. In fact, President Wilson
has just won a re-election based

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.090
on the platform that
he kept us out of war.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.150
And to large degree, he was
able to keep the US out of war

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.590
because the German
Empire had pulled back

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.000
from its unrestricted
submarine warfare.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.460
After the sinking
of the Lusitania

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.764
and how angered
America had gotten,

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:27.430
they said, OK, we're
not going to attack

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.690
passenger vessels anymore.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.460
We're only going to attack
things that are definitely

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.230
British, non-passenger vessels.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.350
But as we go into January
1917, the British blockade

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.734
on the Central Powers
was having its effect.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.650
And the Central Powers
were getting desperate,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.160
in particular Germany.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.850
And so they are eager
to essentially do

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.030
the same to the British.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.190
Once again, go with the
unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040
But the Germans
knew that if they

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.600
were to go back to this, that
it's likely that the US would

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
enter the war on the
side of the Allies.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.690
So knowing that was
likely to happen.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.700
They said, well, how
could we slow the US down.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.790
And the thinking was, well,
maybe we could somehow

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.280
enlisted the help of
Mexico which at the time

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.190
was not the best terms
with the United States.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.410
And so Arthur Zimmerman who was
the German Foreign Secretary,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.730
the equivalent of the United
States Secretary of State.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.340
The Foreign Minister,
Arthur Zimmerman

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.825
sends an encoded a
telegram to the Mexicans.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.450
And it's encoded,
especially because it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.680
has to go over lines that are
controlled by the Americans.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.740
And in it, he actually
proposes an alliance

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.430
to slow the Americans down.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.510
So this is what he wrote.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.050
So this is a coded telegram.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.560
And then, it was
actually intercepted

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.710
by British intelligence
and decoded and then shared

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620
with the Americans,
and then that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.144
was also then made public
to the American public.

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:57.310
And so this is why it's
fascinating to actually read

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.809
this stuff.

00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:00.120
This is January 1917.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.730
This is the Germans
talking to the Mexicans.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.890
"We intend to begin on
the first of February

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.030
unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.039
We shall endeavor
in spite of this

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.870
to keep the United States
of America neutral.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.290
In the event of
this not succeeding,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.960
we make Mexico a
proposal alliance

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.360
on the following basis--
make war together, make peace

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.860
together, generous financial
support, and an understanding

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.450
on our part that Mexico
is to reconquer the lost

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.090
territory in Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.435
The settlement in
detail is left to you.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.177
You will inform the
President--" they're

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:42.760
talking about the
president of Mexico.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.530
"--of the above most secretly
as soon as the outbreak of war

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.840
with the United States of
America is certain and add

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.190
the suggestion that he
should, on his own initiative,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.830
invite Japan to immediate
adherence and at the same time

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.510
mediate between
Japan and ourselves.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.030
Please call the President's
attention to the fact

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.760
that the ruthless
employment of our submarines

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.800
now offers the prospect
of compelling England

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.110
in a few months to make peace.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.190
Signed Zimmerman."

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.830
Now, the Mexicans,
when they read this,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.270
they really didn't
take it too seriously.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.061
They didn't think that
they could seriously

00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.136
engage the US in a war.

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:21.510
They couldn't
seriously take back

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.156
or occupy these territories.

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.780
So they didn't really
think much of it.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.590
The real effect of
this telegram was

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.060
to make the American
public angry.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.580
They were going to go back
into the unrestricted submarine

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.280
warfare.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.810
And the Germans, themselves,
talk about ruthless-- "ruthless

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.260
employment of our
the submarines."

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.790
So when people talk about,
what were the causes.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.910
What brought the US into war?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.630
The ones that are
typically cited

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.330
are the unrestricted
submarine warfare.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.570
The sinking of the Lusitania.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.520
The Zimmerman telegram
that was trying

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.300
to get Mexico to somehow
get into a war with the US

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.250
and reclaim these territories.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250
And as we'll see, a
few months after this,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.170
the US actually does
declare war on Germany

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.100
and enter into World War I.
