Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.200
I remember it so YOU don't have to!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
We're all familiar with the show Family Guy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.900
Either fondly...

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.500
Peter Griffin: Okay, that is the LAST time you are gonna pull that crap!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.300

Lucy: AAAHH!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.440

Sssssss--

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.440
NC: Or... seasons-one-through-six fondly enough.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.100
But here's something you may not have known:

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.720
Before the long-running series...

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.100
well... briefly short-running series, THEN long-running series...

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.920
I know nothing about that!

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.980
Cartoon Network ran a short in 1997 you MAY find a little familiar.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.080
Familiar-sounding dog: Uh, Larry, it says here your license is suspended.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.200
Familiar-sounding Larry: Aw, no, they-they-they just put it away temporarily.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.460
NC: Yep! That's Seth MacFarlane doing an eerily similar Brian the Dog as well as an eerily similar Peter Griffin,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.640
only here, they're not called Brian and Peter, they're called Larry and Steve.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.780
And yes, this was played on Cartoon Network during the day, NOT during Adult Swim!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.780
This was meant for kids!

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.320
It was part of Cartoon Network experimenting with cartoon pilots on a section they called What A Cartoon!,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.000
which resulted in several popular shows being made.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.460
So... was the original idea for Family Guy supposed to be a kids' show?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.820
It certainly seems that way.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.360
The seven-minute short begins with Steve talking to a camera explaining his situation:

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.940
that being stuck with Larry.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.000
Steve: Hi, there. My name's Steve.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.940
I'm a dog, in-in case you were, um...

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.160
...well, stupid.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.100
NC: Apparently, he was at the pound, and out of all the humans, Larry was the only one who can understand him.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.060
This is hilariously never explained, as everyone else just hears him bark.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120
It's... just kind of how this world works.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.280
Steve: You will be indirectly responsible for the resulting euthanasia.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.180
Larry (hearing it as "youth in Asia"): Oh, boy, they got enough kids over there as it is.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.700
NC: Steve, of course, is an intelligent cynic, and Larry is a brainless doofus,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.480
and somehow, they have to survive mundane adventures like getting a new lamp.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.460
With Larry, however, that proves difficult as he's constantly getting them into trouble.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580
[whapping]

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.460
Larry: How do you feel, Steve?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.180
Steve: Like Agamemnon after the fury of Clytemnestra.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.820
NC: Think kind of Inspector Gadget and Brain going to the grocery store; he's always gotta save him.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.100
The humor isn't hilarious, but it's not bad, either,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.800
It has a lot of slapstick cartoony jokes, as well as a good line here and there.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.320
Larry: I-I think I know what I'm talking about, alright?

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
Alright? I- [stammers] I didn't spend twelve years in kindergarten 'cuz I'm stupid!

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
NC: It even has bits of surreal humor similar to what Family Guy would eventually incorporate.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.140
Saleslady: Just ask our spokesman, Mickey the Xenophobic Scotsman!

[glass smashes]

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.880
NC: What especially funny is all the foreshadowing to the Family Guy show that ends up here.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.620
For example, the names of one of the stores they're looking for is Stewie's,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.920
which would eventually be Peter's son in the show.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.320
Larry: Uh, Stewie's has usually got good stuff.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.340
NC: This guy looks pretty close to Peter's dad.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.360
Either that, or...

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.320
Ehhh, let's just hope it's not HIM!

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.280
Steve's design, you can certainly see elements of Brian in,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.860
and Larry, though seemingly different in layout, actually is very similar!

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.320
Just trim down the nose,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.240
change the hair,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.180
it's surprisingly really close!

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.460
Overall, it's a cute little short, and honestly might've been a decent kids' show.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.140
Maybe along the lines of Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Lab, and so on.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.220
However, while those shows were picked up, Seth's wasn't.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.120
The network passed on this show, but liked Seth's style so much,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.420
that they brought him on to be a writer on some of the shows that DID get picked up.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.540
He would try again on another show, though, called Zoo Mates!

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.060
Another pilot, but this time for Nickelodeon 
(for Oh Yeah! Cartoons).

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.040
And this time with the help of Butch Hartman,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.400
who would go on to develop hits like Fairly Oddparents and Danny Phantom.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.740
It was....

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.700
odd...

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.980
but, for different reasons his other shows are odd.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280
It was just animals trying to live together in an apartment, but messing things up.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.340
Standard enough, but, there was a laugh track over the entire show!

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.660
Polar bear: I'm gonna bust your head when I'm finished!

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.060

[laugh track]
Polar bear: Who-o-oa, I'm dizzy!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.500
NC: To this day, I have no idea if this was done ironically,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.980
or in the same spirit as The Flintstones, where we're supposed to believe somehow an audience is laughing at this!

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.780
[laugh track]

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.720
NC: No surprise, this one was not picked up.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.620
However, executives from Fox saw Larry &amp; Steve,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
and were interested in Seth creating a show based on the concept, except with an adult edge.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.640
This is naturally where Family Guy came from.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.220
So, there it is! Family Guy was originally mean for kids, right?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.680
Well, there's another part of the story.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.920
You see, while at the Rhode Island School for Design, Seth had to put together a thesis film in 1995.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.280
It starred himself introducing his animated characters living in an everyday suburban home,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.740
embarking on surreal adventures with cutaways.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.300
The name of that thesis? The Life of Larry.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.100
Which once again, stars a doofus named Larry, and his talking cynical dog named Steve.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.000
Larry: Yeah, oh-I-oh-I think what happens is he, uh, eats his food, and then whatever Spot can't finish.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.620
Steve: Wh-wh-where did you-- where did you hear that?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.020
Larry: Episode 65.
Steve: Oh.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
NC: And wouldn't you know it, he also has a patient wife named Lois...

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.580
Prototype-Lois: Fine! Let's have this conversation for the ten millionth time, Larry!

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.020
NC: ...an overweight son named Milt, instead of Chris,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.020
and a much more adult tone.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.740
In fact, many of these jokes would eventually make its way into the Family Guy pilot,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.420
which would eventually make its way into the Family Guy show.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.280
It's actually kind of eerie how similar these jokes are in every incarnation.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.000
Larry: I got it! That's the guy from Big!

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.540
Pilot-Peter: Tom Hanks! That's it! Aw, funny guy!

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.100
Series-Peter: Everything he says is a stitch!

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.940
Tom Hanks in Philadelphia: I have AIDS.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.880
Series-Peter: [laughing uproariously]

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.860
Pilot-Peter: [laughing uproariously]

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.260
Larry: [laughing uproariously]

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.420
NC: So when Fox saw this was also part of the Larry &amp; Steve portfolio,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.900
they said that matched their animation outline perfect.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.340
Although... maybe not perfect enough.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.980
It was decided they should fatten up their lead,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.840
give them a baby,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.860
add a geeky daughter,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.480
and focus more on the family dynamic, hence the title, Family Guy.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.300
Looking all too familiar to another animated Fox family.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.820
So... there's kind of a lot to be discovered here, isn't there?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.160
Was Family Guy originally meant to be a kids' show?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.720
For a short amount of time.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.720
Originally, it was an adult comedy film thesis about a guy and his dog,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.620
which turned into a kids' show pilot about a guy and his dog,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.000
which turned into an adult show pilot that was made to be more like The Simpsons, because it was on Fox.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.260
So not only was it at one point a kids' show, it actually had little-to-no tie-in with The Simpsons at all!

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.980
Which is a criticism the show has had to fight for years.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.860
Even in the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover, they referenced it,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.120
and the Simpsons took more than their fair share of punches at them.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.540
Homer Simpson: It's just a lousy ripoff!

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.100
Peter: It may have been INSPIRED by Duff, but I... I like to think it goes in a different direction.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.660
NC: While it's pretty obvious where that later influence came from for Family Guy,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.980
You can see the original idea has no connection.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.000
So the evolution of an idea isn't always as simple as you think.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.180
Actually, many times, it's very complicated!

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.000
From an adult show, to a kids' show, to an all-too-familiar Fox formula,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.960
this idea has gone through SO many versions.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.300
But truth be told, all of them are interesting to check out.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.320
If you can find them,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.600
obviously, you can tell from the quality here they're not the easiest to locate,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.440
they're certainly worth viewing to witness the creative process.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.000
Whether you love Family Guy, hate it, used to love it, or used to hate it,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.780
there's no denying the content-changing ways and ideas for it... is intriguing to watch.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.060
But seriously, that "hurt knee" joke has to stop.

Doug from last week: Hey! Doug Walker here, doing the Charity Shout-Out,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.060
and this week, we are doing the Marine Mammal Center.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:00.040
These people are guided and inspired by a shared vision of a healthy ocean for marine mammals and humans alike.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.240
Their mission is to advance global ocean conservation for marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.120
as well as scientific research and education.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.120
Since 1975, they've rescued and treated nearly 20,000 marine animals.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.480
They rescue marine mammals for different reasons,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.880
including malnourishment, separation, entanglements, and diseases.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:27.280
They've recognized the fundamental relationship that binds humans, animals, and the ocean.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.940
They also partner with leading scientists and other professionals in order to learn from the patients in their care.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.660
Patients from healthy, endangered, and at-risk populations.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.500
To expand and advise scientific knowledge,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.220
enhancing understanding of the health of our oceans, and the implications for human health.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.100
They spread knowledge to members of the scientific community and general public of what they find out.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.540
If you look at their site and their YouTube page,
