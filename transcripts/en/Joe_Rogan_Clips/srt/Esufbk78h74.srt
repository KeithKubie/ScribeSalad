1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,850
The Joe Rogan experience. Boom. And we're
live. What's up brother? How are Ya man,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Joe Rogan. I am so happy to be
here. I'm so happy to see you.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,770
Fuck, you've gone through
a journey. Oh Man.

4
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,500
Since the last time I see it is tea.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,130
Yesterday was one year from your
heart transplant anniversary. Exactly.

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:25,020
Wow. One year. And Joe,
if I told you it was easy,

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,480
I'd be lying.
But man,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
it was so worth the journey
and they ain't even funny.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,860
What does it feel like right now?

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,190
Like having another person's heart in
your body? What does that feel like? Well,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,200
a lot of times it feels like I actually
did die and this is just the dream,

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,150
you know, mind right now. Yep.
Wow. This, this is a, I pick this,

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,340
this would be my heaven. You look
great. You're still jacked. No,

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,570
not losing any weight. Oh yeah.
Yeah. But I mean, you still,

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,980
you're still jacked. He's still
got muscles. Uh, you know,

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,190
it's a fall from where I was.
I really appreciate that though.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,350
But I, I, you know, I look at
myself, man, it's just, uh, you know,

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,380
fragmented. What I used to be,
but you know, I'm still here.

19
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:14,590
That's what's so important to me, man.
Well, the ridiculous thing you were doing,

20
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:19,591
you're making videos of your working out
like getting ready and after your heart

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,850
attack,
heart operation,

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,050
this you have a heart transplant and
you're running in a parking lot and you

23
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,480
trip and fall. I'm like Jesus
man, slow down. Like yeah,

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,420
cause you have it there.

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,410
They just decided that you were just
going to start pushing from the beginning.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,670
Well, uh, actually, uh,

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,780
my brain was ready but my body wasn't.

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,420
They warn you about doing that. Did
they say it was okay? They told me that,

29
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:50,500
you know, they gave me three city
walk and you know, me, I'm like,

30
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:55,440
I walk shit, I can run
it. At least my mindset,

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,150
I could. Right. What
does it feel like though?

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,740
Like when you like what is the difference
between the way your heart feels now?

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,170
It's night and day.
You know,

34
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,790
before I got the transplant
it had got really bad,

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,650
really bad. I had a flat line
two more times, uh, you know,

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,540
before the actual transplant. And it was,
I couldn't go through one another frat.

37
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:24,310
Right. And that would've been it. But
the difference now, I mean it feels,

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,780
I only say flatline. Like
your heart stops. Yes. Yes.

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,150
And what did they do to start
it back up again? Okay. Um,

40
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,710
after I had this last heart attack,
um, they asked me to see miss firstly,

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,020
do you want to us to put in a pacemaker?

42
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,840
And I thought about it a lot because
my brother and my older brother walked,

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,270
had a pacemaker installed before he
passed away and his pacemaker was actually

44
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:53,280
going off, uh, when he, when
he died. So I'm like, man,

45
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,000
I didn't really do any good for him.

46
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:59,550
So I was like going back and forth and
then all this, uh, something voice,

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,000
say the equity and get it. And so I told
me I put it in and pacemakers saved me.

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,140
Wow. So it went flat, like see
your heart gave up and then the p,

49
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,290
what is the pacemaker do exactly?
It's like a defibrillator,
you know, like raped.

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,320
They had the paddles that give you
an electric shock, you know, that's,

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,910
that's what the pacemaker does is just
give you a little joy on the inside,

52
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,670
you know, inside and it's connected
directly to your heart wound,

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,460
that sucker flat lines. It
gives you a jolt. Wow. Yeah.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,550
Did you feel it? No. No. I was,

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,750
I was dead until we say, well,
you did, you don't feel nothing.

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,900
So you had blocked out to,
uh,

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,540
it's not a blackout or a,
uh,

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,800
like those off when you're sleeping.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,070
Death is totally different.
Totally different. And you,

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,290
I knew that I was dead
before I died before at flat.

61
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:56,741
Right.

62
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:01,360
It was just being my wife at home and I
was talking to her just like I'm talking

63
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:05,230
to you. And the next thing,
all the lights went out.

64
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,200
It was like a one of
those old fashioned TVs.

65
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't know if you're old enough to
remember these black and white TVs. Yeah.

66
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:15,150
Yeah. That's exactly how
it was. They're just tiny,

67
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,800
tiny pinprick of light and you know that,
that's it.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,750
Wow. It's no, you know, you
absolutely know that this is it.

69
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,500
And it's not,
you know,

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,580
this is the irreversible
and you know that it's,

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,220
this is death and not just, you're
not just those at all. You know,

72
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,330
did you have a near death experience?
I everything.

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Um,
the only thing you have to,

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,280
only thing I had time to say was
I had time to call my wife's name,

75
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,720
but I mean, when they say things rush,
you know, everything was like, this is it,

76
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,110
this is it. You know, you're not
going to be able to do this anymore.

77
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,560
You're not going to get this is it,

78
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,590
this is the final finalization
of everything hits you.

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,550
Like, no, this is, you know,
this is the final thing.

80
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,990
This is your last moment on earth
and you know it. And I'm like,

81
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,270
what do you do? How I could do was say my
wife's name. And that was, that was it.

82
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,230
So the pacemaker kicks in and
then you wrote back online.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,930
Yeah. And it was, so that's a damn good
description. And then it was like a,

84
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,980
I thought I felt like that
I had been asleep for hours.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,170
It was the best,
most peaceful,

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,790
restful time of my entire life.
Wow.

87
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,080
In just a short moment,

88
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,640
if felt like I had been asleep for eight
hours, so rested so well rested, so,

89
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,630
and my wife told me,
he goes just a short period of time,

90
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,770
but it felt like I had been asleep for
eight hours. So this happened twice? Yes.

91
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,160
The second time was in the hospital.
Oh Wow.

92
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,990
So they tell you, okay, Mr.
Fletcher, we have a heart for you.

93
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,950
Yeah, they call me like two 40
in the morning, I think it was.

94
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,780
So you have to get in there right
now. Is that how no one, no,

95
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,420
I had hours before I had to
actually be at the hospital.

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,720
I said be be at the hospital thing
like six or seven. Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,510
And then you think in a wall boy.
Uh,

98
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,210
I was happy and sad when I got the call.

99
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,970
I was happy for myself,
um,

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,850
because I didn't think I could
go through another flat line,

101
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,690
but I was sad for the donor and spam.
Yeah.

102
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:42,190
I knew somebody had to pass away in
order for me to get that heart. Yeah.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,850
So I felt real bad about that.

104
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,560
So they put it in you,
you wake up,

105
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,960
what does that feel like?
Um,

106
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,580
it felt like, uh, um, being born again,

107
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,940
a rebirth.
I never try and let it go at life.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,320
Wow. Yup. I get it. Another
start. Another chance. They, it,

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,390
my son Ain't over.
Wow.

110
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,350
So from the moment this,
so they have to open you up right here.

111
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,910
They do that chest spreader thing and uh,
and what is all that like?

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,590
Well, are you, of course that
you were out, but when you
wake up and you look down,

113
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:30,240
you're covered with stitches,
right? I mean, it must be
a giant scar, right? It's,

114
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,990
they are so good now.
Don't get it. You know,

115
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,820
I have a scar, but considering they do
this my second time being split open,

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,160
you know, first time, uh,

117
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,200
and Oh five when they put
a metal valve in a Frat,

118
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,190
when I, during that operates a three times
on, you know, on the table during the,

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,290
the operation itself. Uh, so, um,

120
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,770
me and flat line or a five flat lines,
I think I'm at my limit, man. Wow.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,170
Um, I seen the scars. They had to
take the pace, the pace maker out.

122
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,400
They took the metal bat out of
the well make, take the old heart,

123
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,560
had the middle path ministry,

124
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,590
took the whole heart out a put
in a new heart and a is this man,

125
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,980
it's a unbelievably,

126
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,050
this before shower would
kill me if I took a shower.

127
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,040
I be doing for the rest
of the day a shower. Yeah.

128
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,130
Or shall we kill me for the rest of the
day when I had a seat in the shower,

129
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,850
you know, uh, how would, how
would a shower kill you? Oh Man.

130
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:34,620
It was bad amount of physical activity
and you know, uh, how, you know,

131
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,890
you people take taking
a shower for granted,

132
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,190
but that amount of physical
activity would kill me.

133
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:46,050
I'd be wiped out just for washing your
sheets. Yes. For the rest of the day,

134
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:50,760
man. It was so you were hanging by
smell? Yeah, definitely death. Wow.

Because he opened his jelly jar for me.
Wow. Yeah. It's a humbling, humbling.

139
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:10,710
Very big time. Big Time. How long did
you have to stay in the hospital for? Um,

140
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,390

very long. I mean we got out of,

141
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,030
uh,
we went straight there in intensive care.

142
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
They keep you there for like three days,

143
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,430
but I think I was probably
released to within two weeks total.

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,640
Wow. And then are you using a
walker? Are you walking fine?

145
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,520
Like I wouldn't say I was walking fine,

146
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,840
but I was walking just
walking slowly. Oh, big time.

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,820
Big Time. Slowly. Yeah, I
was crawling along. Wow.

148
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,070
And how long did it take for you to get
to where you're at? Like now? Like now,

149
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:54,120
I'd have no idea that you had a heart
transplant really. Well, I appreciate it.

150
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:57,840
You know, when I saw you mean you
look very happy. Oh, I am happy.

151
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:01,350
You look like you're glowing.
I am extremely happy.

152
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Just to be alive when you
come that close to dying.

153
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,850
I mean every day is just a blessing,
man.

154
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:16,020
If people actually hate doing
CT, I'm blessed man. I'm
sorry I got no complaints.

155
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,830
Blessed. Oh yes, no
complaints whatsoever man.

156
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,350
I seen I wanted to hug them.
Joe,

157
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm so happy to see you man.
I'm alive.

158
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,580
Wow. Cause we, you know, last
time we talked about, um,

159
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,640
me meeting the transplant and I needed
the transplant it, now I'm back. I had it,

160
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
the first six months were rough
the first six months after

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,620
the jelly jar. Oatmealy tell you
jog, just not being able to do,

162
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,900
you know, normal things. The first
thing I tried to do was walk.

163
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,530
So they had me walk around,
I guess a city block,

164
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,710
maybe city Black Joe.

165
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:05,550
When I first tried to walk around a city
block, I'd have to stop probably 12,

166
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:10,470
13 times and take a seat
and get up and try to walk.

167
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,240
And it was, it was killing
me, man. My, my, you know, my,

168
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,030
my wife was slowed down. He slowed
down and walk with me and us too.

169
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,160
It was such a struggle and I'm like,
you know what,

170
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,680
I don't give a damn how long it take me.

171
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm going to make you mad and I'm
going to make you keep, keep going.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,030
And what kind of activity are
you able to do now? A year later,

173
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,130
I am a lifting again, but very
lightly I'm able to do, you know,

174
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,750
the machines and stuff in the 10.
Uh,

175
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,580
I think I've been able to do
that for the last two months.

176
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,540
So when you say that lightly, is
this by doctor's orders? Oh yeah.

177
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,640
I can't do anything without
them approving it first. Yeah.

178
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,650
I except they run into the parking
lot. I didn't even approved. Yeah.

179
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,170
My mind was like, Oh yeah, you can do it.

180
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,890
My body was like leaving me
out this month. Yeah. So what,

181
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,540
what holds you back in terms
of like lifting weights?

182
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,680
Like why do you have to go light?

183
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,120
And my strength is just nowhere near what
it used to be. The strength is still,

184
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:18,010
you know, I can tell, but, uh, you know,
I have a long way to go, but, you know,

185
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,170
just to be able to do anything.

186
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,210
So I guess I kinda need
to do and I do what I can.

187
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,710
And that's what I tell people all the
time, man, if you can't, uh, you know,

188
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,100
do what you want to do, at least get
in there and do what you can do. Yeah.

189
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,400
It's better than doing nothing.
Yeah.

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,400
So now did they have you on medication
to make sure that the heart doesn't get

191
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,610
rejected by your body?

192
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,840
Most definitely in an APP and people
out there who've had transplants,

193
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:46,210
I know that they were like, oh man. Yeah.

194
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,060
I take about 21 different medications.

195
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,910
Yep. 21 different Medicare and will
the side effects of the stuff? Um,

196
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,260
they used to be worse, but now, you know,

197
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:03,100
my feet are swollen pretty much every day.

198
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,200
Um, something in the medical
kind of kicks my arthritis.

199
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:12,400
I have arthritis too, so it kind of
kicks in and told are stiff, you know,

200
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,870
pretty much every day.

201
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:18,871
But when I compare the side effects
to the work took possibly happen,

202
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,210
which is deaf assigned fixing shit,

203
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,820
I'll take them now, will you have
to take this medication forever?

204
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,390
Uh, it gets less, less and
less. When I go back, uh,

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,400
this month back up to Palo Alto
where they did the transplant, um,

206
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,590
they're going to take off about
four or five different medications.

207
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,400
So I'm a year out now. They lasted
me. And the further you get out,

208
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,850
the less medication and thinking
eventually we'll get down to two or three,

209
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,610
but you'll always have to
take some oh yeah, definitely.

210
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,750
And it's just because your body doesn't
understand why it has someone's heart in

211
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:56,440
it. Um, for a while that,
that in the beginning,

212
00:13:56,441 --> 00:14:00,200
like I'm taking 21 now,
it's because, you know, uh,

213
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,030
to keep the chances of rejection
down by the fact that you're checked,

214
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,680
they understand that hey, w it wasn't
the one that she was born with, right.

215
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,280
Answer, foreign, you
know, a foreign heart.

216
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,310
And I really want to talk to you about
that heart. What I know about it. Um,

217
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,930
it's a woman's heart, right?
Yeah. So, you know, you know,

218
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,640
I thought it was going to drop a
bomb on following. Yeah. Very good.

219
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,570
Yeah. But I tell you that,
that threw me for a loop. Yeah.

220
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,770
And I was,
you know,

221
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm always talking about how strong
my faith is and you know, um,

222
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,550
faith, faith, faith, faith
man, superman of faith, uh,

223
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,120
and I could have so much faith
to Matt and phase me. You know,

224
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,740
I went into the operation, hey, I see
you guys on the other side of is because,

225
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,510
you know, I got, I know I'm going to be
our, I got so much faith that, you know,

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm gonna get through this,
so I'm gonna see you guys.

227
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:04,001
But when the doctor came in and told me
that I had a woman's heart that sacked

228
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:09,740
the shit out of my face because I had
done steady, you know, I looked, you know,

229
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,700
stated on this,
the,

230
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,120
the survival rate of male to
female and it wasn't good.

231
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,090
The states I had read wasn't good.
When they do a female to me, I'm sorry,

232
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,080
female to Male, the tree is
not good. And I was like,

233
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,950
everything I had read said it's not a
good thing. The doctor comes in and says,

234
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,300
Yep, you've got a woman's heart. And she
wasn't that much younger than you are.

235
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,190
Fuck that.

236
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,240
That know sideman yeah, tested my
faith big time. How did she die?

237
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,550
I have no idea. I have no idea. But, um,

238
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,410
the thing I have feelings,

239
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,180
I haven't talked to the family.
I would love to.

240
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,560
I don't know anything about it,

241
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:59,561
but I had these feelings and I really
would like to know if what I'm feeling is

242
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,970
right. You know, I want, I really want
to meet the family and let you know,

243
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,340
let them know that I'm out here doing
everything I can to raise donor awareness.

244
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,320
And if their mother or their wife or
their sister or their aunt didn't die in

245
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:20,321
vain and then I'm doing my absolute best
to carry on and let people know that,

246
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,080
you know,

247
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,790
she was a donor and that it's so
utterly important for people to donate,

248
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,960
to get the gift of life.
What are these feelings that you have?

249
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
I have feelings that,
uh,

250
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:35,921
for some reason I can see that I feel
like she was the oriental lady and I,

251
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,310
I, you know, I don't know why,

252
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,440
but I really have feelings like that
and I feel like I can see this woman

253
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,470
telling her husband,
you know, I'll see it.

254
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:53,030
And we'd get home from work and making
plans with their kids for the weekend.

255
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,810
And I have no idea if
this is right or not,

256
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,320
but I just had those feelings.
Are they recurring? Yes.

257
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,870
And you like, do you remember
it like a memory? It's, um,

258
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,350
it's like I get to look into her,
you know,

259
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,190
her existence, her, her
life and I, you know,

260
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,690
I have no, I could be totally
wrong. She could be a Jamaican lady.

261
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,030
I have no idea. Or, uh, if
I'm in the ballpark or not,

262
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:29,720
I just had this feeling. I
just have a feeling. Wow.

263
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,130
Do you have any unusual cravings
or anything like either a,

264
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,810
I don't think, uh, no. I
don't think I have any.

265
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,050
I do talk to her and I feel like that,

266
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:46,100
uh, you know, when, when like when I
was walking around and I've told him,

267
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,690
tried to make it around that block,

268
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,210
I would often ask her for help
to help me make it around me.

269
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,200
Wow. Yeah. I talked to her
a lot. Wow. Come on lady.

270
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,770
I need your help. You have a name
for it? I just call him the lady.

271
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,350
Come on lady. I need you.
Wow. Wow, that's crazy.

272
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,900
You're superman from
Katherine has a lady's heart.

273
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,590
Now when you say that there's,
it's not,

274
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,970
the results aren't good for lady
hearts and male bodies. What'd you,

275
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,950
did you say that to the doctor?
Yeah, me and the doctor is so, um,

276
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,060
it's so funny.

277
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,660
I don't even know if the doctor's
suppose because it was this one doctor.

278
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,780
He would come in and young
guy and he would come in
every day. How are you doing,

279
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:33,630
Mr Footer? And I would say
I'm blessed. I don't care.

280
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,830
When I woke up from the transplant,

281
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,330
I consider every second after that
a blessing. It's borrowed time, man.

282
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,570
It wasn't supposed to be here.
So my answer's always,

283
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm blessed so he can meet you. How are
you doing? I'm blessed him. But he said,

284
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,850
you know what, you're going to change.
They're not gonna know, doc. It's not.

285
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:57,510
And you could say going to
make me change my answer them,

286
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,810
I'm going to always be blessed
no matter what you say. He said,

287
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:04,380
you think you're doing really good, don't
you and I were here. Yeah. I think I'm,

288
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm, I'm alive. Yeah.
I think I'm doing good.

289
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,130
I walked around this a hospital corridor.
I think I'm doing really good.

290
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,570
He said,
you're not,

291
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,110
you're doing about what you're supposed
to be doing and you have a woman's heart

292
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,080
and it's too small for you.

293
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,990
And she was almost your age.

294
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,880
I cannot fuck it's too small.
Yeah.

295
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,550
He told me that the heart
was too small and uh,

296
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,733
the lady was,

297
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,370
I was 58 or nine and 59 cause
I'd be 60 on June the eighth.

298
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,990
So, uh, he says it's too small and

299
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,930
you're not, you know, you're not
doing anything extraordinary.

300
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,730
You just do an average. And
she's eight. And I'm like, man,

301
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,480
fuck for the rest of the day.
I was fucked. I was fucking,

302
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:06,060
I'm like, man, I was, you know,
guy, why didn't you do this to me?

303
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,290
Why didn't you give me a woman?
Sorry. And O's warming it. Dad,

304
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,670
why can't you give me an age? Why? God,

305
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:19,410
I was questioning, why did you
do this to me? Did you ask him?

306
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,160
Heck, what do you mean the doctor
or guide the doctor? Uh, I didn't,

307
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,870
I need to ask the doctor that my
doctor did come in and I feel New York.

308
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,850
I'm sorry. I did ask the doctor.
I asked her, I said, dad, why,

309
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,530
why could you now I am dude. I had tears
in my eyes because this was, you know,

310
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,380
I'm like, fuck, I got another
heart, but I ain't gonna last long.

311
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,050
I'm going to be out of
here. So it was, you know,

312
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:47,800
it was fucking with me and the
doctor. Um, I answered that. Why?

313
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,060
I mean, why is he looked me in
eyeballs doing, she said, Mr Frichy,

314
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,770
we didn't want you to die. It's just
that simple. We didn't want you to die,

315
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,280
you know, that was what was available.
That was what was available.

316
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:04,510
It was a healthy heart and I
needed one badge, you know. Well,

317
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,890
that heart grow to match your body.
It already has really,

318
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,640
it is the proper size that it's,
it did.

319
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,420
Yes. And the doctor that
told me it was too small.

320
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,740
It was the one who told me that he had
grown through the proper sides. Wow.

321
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,690
Why does it grow? Because it recognized
it was in a bigger body. Uh, Joe, I,

322
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,550
you're on, that's on the physical. Uh, if
you look at it physically and probably a,

323
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:33,130
you know, with a rational
mind, that would probably be,

324
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,460
it realized that it had to
adapt to a large degree.

325
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,660
But I'm going to give him a little credit,
the car, because it's just me, man. So,

326
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,540
cause he came back too fast. I
mean, it was like a week later,

327
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,070
he said it's already decided that
she'd be a week later. A week later,

328
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,720
before I left the hospital,

329
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,220
he was telling me that it's
already should be Jesus.

330
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,280
And I said, see doc, I
told you I'm blessed man.

331
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,840
I thought that doesn't make any
sense. I know. What did he say?

332
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,830
Did the doctor say it doesn't make
any sense to a normal thing? Yeah,

333
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,450
I have no idea. I have no idea
if it's a normal thing or not,

334
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,530
but you know, I mean me, I'm getting
crazy. I'm going, wow. The other miracle,

335
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,410
thank God
I can say that question guy and I,

336
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,520
my answer was what did I,
I got back was was simple.

337
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,560
He said, if I gave you or an
18 year old Olympic athletes,

338
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:33,100
heart CT and you recovered was doing well,

339
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,350
then people are going to say that.

340
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,350
That's why you got an 18 year old Olympic
gold medal is hard and you're able to

341
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:43,150
recover and stuff because of this,

342
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,290
but if I take the old lady's heart,

343
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,240
there's two small and that not,

344
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,600
you're not supposed to be able to come
back and do these things with this heart,

345
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,990
then they're going to have to
give me a little credit. He said,

346
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,800
I have a habit of taking
the least of the least,

347
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:06,910
the lowest of the low and making something
out of it. And I said, you know what?

348
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:11,830
Let me shit the fuck up. You're absolutely
right. It wouldn't be that impressive,

349
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,450
right? It wouldn't be a miracle if I
eat all foods. It's wonderful heart.

350
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,700
But because I'm God,

351
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm going to take this heart and give it
to you and you're going to still do all

352
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:26,800
those things. So shared up
CT, I said, okay, that's good.

353
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,280
Now when you exercise now and you just,

354
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,090
are you pushing or you just get into a
point where you just feel a little tired

355
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:37,480
and your back off.
Joe Rogan,

356
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,550
I can't help but push my say no.
That's what I'm asking is, you know,

357
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,740
I give, I gave her, I gave
everything I got. Yeah. I can't help.

358
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,820
It doesn't matter. Do you feel weird
when your heart starts beating heavy? Um,

359
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,580
or should I say her start her heart.

360
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,830
Her heart starts beating them pretty
fast and you know, I don't feel weird.

361
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,360
I feel like,
uh,

362
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,070
it's something I've done my whole life
and I'm just glad to be back, able to do,

363
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,710
you know, some of what I used to
do. It's just I feel good, you know,

364
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,710
I still talk to her though. Come on,
lady, I'm sure can get through this.

365
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,240
And now you feel it building up like
you feel like every month or so you get

366
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:27,680
stronger? Um, definitely.
Yeah, definitely.

367
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:32,060
I feel that the longer that it's in the
lungs, that, that the heart is in need,

368
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:36,290
the more it feels like, you
know, it's, that's where it
should be, you know, and my,

369
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,630
my body adapts.

370
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,140
And how long does a heart transplant
usually survive in a person?

371
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,120
Well, um, I think the longest,

372
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,280
at this point it's close to 40
years. 40 years. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

373
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't want 40 years.
I don't want to be a hundred man.

374
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:03,740
You don't know why not? Um, I want to, I,

375
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:08,720
you know, I never expected, like I
said, on June the eighth I'll be 60.

376
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,290
I never expected to make it to 40.

377
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,780
So you're really, really, yeah.
I never, I never expected that.

378
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,900
I expected to die young. So, um,

379
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,990
I'm way past what I thought I would
make it anyway. So it's a place.

380
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,740
Why did you think you you're going to
die that? Yeah. Oh Man. I never had,

381
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,140
I wanted to be a, I was, I was my,

382
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:34,610
and I want it to be the sky rocket
man. Brilliant. Like to shoot

383
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,370
this guy be a brilliant bursting then I
thought they would be the perfect ending.

384
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,330
Just go forward, go forward, go
forward, go forward and explode.

385
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,310
She can't dead motherfucker.
Yeah. But he was fine. He was,

386
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,020
he was something else when he was alive
and you happy with that, you know,

387
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,890
that's what you've thought. Yeah.
Yeah, definitely. Wow. Yeah.

388
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,070
Now you got to settle in for 41 years.
I don't even want to be photographed.

389
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,430
Why do you say that though?

390
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,430
Want to be alive right now and
every day is a blessing playhouse.

391
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,730
So why is it 40 years of blessing? It
would be a blessing, but I, man, you know,

392
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,370
I would be, um, I don't
want to be around where,

393
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,580
uh, um, I don't want to
be a burden on anybody.

394
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,470
And a hundred man, Yo, somebody
else got to take care of you.

395
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,610
Wipe your ass,
got wear diapers and shit.

396
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,150
And I don't know if I,

397
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:34,850
I w I wouldn't want to be around to
be a burden on somebody. Yeah, yeah,

398
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,120
yeah. I know what you mean. But right
now you're not a burden. I hope not. No.

399
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,940
I think my wife might disagree.
Wow. But you're moving around man.

400
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,890
I mean, like I said, if I didn't know, I
would have no idea. Well, I appreciate,

401
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,440
and even though I know you must've
lost some muscle, he's still,

402
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:55,890
if I just met you, I be like,
this is a Jack Dude. Yeah.

403
00:26:55,891 --> 00:27:00,330
He's still got the size your arms, man.
There's still huge. I don't think so,

404
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:04,880
but prepared to what they used to be.
That's why. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I don't,

405
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,440
I don't see him as Hughes.
Yeah.

406
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,140
That's kind of stuff don't even
matter that much to me. Right.

407
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,010
I'm sure you have a new lease on life. Oh
yeah. Big Time. What matters to you know,

408
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,430
uh,

409
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,890
that the really important
things are crossing my family.

410
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,020
Uh, I'm in spreading. Um,
donor awareness is so,

411
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:30,021
so important because so many people
die just waiting to get her heart,

412
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,860
you know, on the list of 21, I
think 21 people a day pass away,

413
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,580
just waiting, trying to
get in. I was so fortunate,

414
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:43,581
so blessed to be able to get one that I
want to try to make sure that a lot of

415
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,910
people get one too. So whatever I
can do to try to raise awareness.

416
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,820
What is the problem? Like people putting
on that they'll donate their organs. Yes.

417
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,630
Well you can do it online now. Joan, you
try was right in California. You can,

418
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:02,370
I don't know about other states, but
in California you can do it all online,

419
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,450
you know,
and,

420
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,950
and through the DMV and get your
diet on your driver's license.

421
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,490
And I want to be a donor and I mean, you
can't take the stuff with you. No, wait,

422
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
no, he, people get paranoid
too. I've heard people say,

423
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm worried about doing that because
what if they don't resuscitate me because

424
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:23,740
they need someone to get a
heart or a liver or something.
Like, I don't know, man.

425
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,410
I really don't think that's
what doctors are into now.
