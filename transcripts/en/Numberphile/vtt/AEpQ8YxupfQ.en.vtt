00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Here is a perfectly legal $20 banknote from the United States of America,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.040
and the gamble is, you extend
your fingers like this in a V-shape

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.600
and you try to catch it when I drop the banknote like this -- yeah? -- in mid-flight.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.340
And if you can catch it when I drop it you get the bank note,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.840
and if you don't you don't get the banknote.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm going to drop it at some ...

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.920
[Brady, off camera] *argh*

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.680
[Professor] ... unannounced time.
[Brady] Ok.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.180
[Brady] *argh*

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.240
[Prof] You shouldn't guess. *laughs*

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.220
[Brady] *argh*

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.640
[Prof] One more time.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.200
[Brady] *ohhh*

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
Now most people, at least the vast majority of people, can't get it.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
And that's because there is something called the reaction time in most humans.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.520
In other words, you see something or you feel something, and then it's processed in the brain.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.520
And the brain sends back a command to the body saying, "Do something," and that's the reaction time.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.020
And that reaction time in most people is of the order of 0.2 seconds.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.100
It varies from person to person, but approximately 0.2 seconds.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.760
We learn in high school and elsewhere that when you drop any object

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.580
you know this, this, or this,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.560
the stuff falls in free fall

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.540
over distance which is equal to half g t squared,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.310
where t is the time of the fall

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.140
and g is the gravitational acceleration.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.080
g is about 10 meters per second per second.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160
It's 9.8 but that's close enough.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.320
t, reaction time that we have to catch this, is 0.2.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.420
So if you square that that's 0.04,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.120
halve that is 0.02, times 10,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.870
that is equal to 0.2, that's in meters.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.840
That is equal to 20 centimeters approximately.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.060
So in the human reaction time, I mean the average reaction time,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.180
this object falls by 20 centimeters.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.600
This is according to my ruler 15.5 centimeters.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.800
So it's significantly, but not by much, shorter than 20 centimeters,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.540
so it falls more than its own length.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.820
So when you start from, even from the bottom,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.740
you can't catch it.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.440
Because by the time the signal is sent to the brain,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.320
and brain sends back the signal to do something,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.480
it's already fallen more than its body length.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860
So it is quite amazing that the United States of America made a banknote

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.380
which is slightly shorter than 20 centimeters

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
which matches exactly 0.2 seconds human reaction time.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.500
[Brady] This isn't going to work on everyone, humans are different.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.550
[Professor ] Humans are different.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.910
For example I know that although my esteemed assistant,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.840
and in fact the cameraman, the man behind Numberphile,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.780
couldn't catch it in the previous experiments.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.750
Actually when we do it honestly he sometimes can, because his reaction time is actually pretty good.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.860
[Brady] With my right hand.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.680
[Prof] With your right hand, yes.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.060
And also I'm cheating. You see if you wanted to make sure that people have the minimum chance,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.360
you ask him to extend those two fingers.
These two fingers don't move so fast.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.490
Those two are probably the fastest pair so try doing it with ... If you can hold your camera?

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.720
[Brady] In my right hand?
[Prof] And with your right hand.
[Brady] Hang on a second...
[Prof] Ok lets do this.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.040
[Brady] Hang on a second. Ok.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.960
[Prof] Here. Now Brady Haran, he's really quick.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.860
[Brady] Ohh!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.740
[Prof] *chuckles* Well $20 dollars is at stake. You shouldn't be guessing.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.180
[Brady] Ohh! I was catching them before!

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540
[Prof] I know, you were catching them before, but now

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.140
[Prof] *chuckling* No, no, you were guessing.
[Brady] I guessed.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.720
[Prof] You guessed.
[both] *laughing*

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.480
[Prof] Ok, you have the $20.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.680
[Prof heard speaking on a different video]

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.800
But this time each paper clips is linked to the rubber band but not between themselves.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.940
Let's finish with something that is a work in progress.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.370
So far we have been linking paper clips together.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.770
And sometimes we refer to this as addition.
