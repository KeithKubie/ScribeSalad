00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:08.700
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm
Jessica and today I'm

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.340
going to talk to you about a
chemical demonstration I like

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.890
to call colorful indicators.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.540
Indicators show us
what we normally

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.840
wouldn't be able to see, from
the canary in the coal mine

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.420
to a paint that changes
color with temperature

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.510
to the acid base indicators
we'll be seeing today.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.190
And chemist Dr. Bassam
Shakhashiri here he is--

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.630
is going to be
showing us the demo.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.090
He's the president of the
American Chemical Society

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.530
and performing this
demo right here at MIT.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.030
[WHOOSH]

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.863
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: Now
what I'm going to do

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:43.890
is an experiment using another
form of carbon dioxide.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.480
It's called dry ice.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.950
And you'll notice
I'm putting what on?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.225
AUDIENCE: Gloves.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.060
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Putting gloves.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.280
And I'm going to
open this bucket

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.740
and pick up three chunks
of carbon dioxide solid.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.650
This is solid carbon dioxide.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.280
Its temperature is minus
78 degrees Celsius.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.050
It's very cold.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.960
Dry ice changes from being a
solid to a gas by a process we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.857
call sublimation.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:19.190
Sublimation is happening right
now, but we can't see it.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.090
How come we can't see it?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.067
Because carbon dioxide
as gas is what?

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:24.900
AUDIENCE: Invisible.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.680
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
It's invisible.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.610
It has no color.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.040
So sublimation is
happening right now.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.820
We can't see it.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.270
And I'm going to put
those three back in here

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.910
and ask you to focus your
attention on what you

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.519
see between my two hands here.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:39.060
What do you see
between my two hands?

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580
In order to sharpen your
powers of observation

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.910
and develop the skills of
reporting these observations,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.420
I ask you to pretend to be the
play by play radio announcer,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.260
describing to someone who was
not with us what's going on.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.212
Not the TV announcer,
that person

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:55.920
has got it made because
the picture tells

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.070
almost everything.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.242
So, there are how
many cylinders?

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:00.159
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.700
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: And what do
you see inside the cylinders?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.870
AUDIENCE: Colored liquid.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.369
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Colored liquids.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.060
OK, I'm listening
to you on the radio.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.259
And what I hear you say is
that there are six cylinders.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.150
And they have in
them colored liquids.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.990
Come on.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.190
Your brain learned a
lot more information

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.240
than those two
statements, right?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.850
Right?

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.520
So they're about
this big, you said.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.810
I can see you on the radio
saying it's about this big,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.410
right?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.120
You've got to do
better than this, OK?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.030
Are they 100
milliliters in size?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.340
Are they 10 milliliters in size?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.940
Are they somewhere in between?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.440
Yes.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.690
We put a bracket on it when
we estimate in science.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.650
We put a bracket on it.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.490
All right.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.830
And they have, yes,
colored liquids.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.900
How do you know they're liquids?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.770
They could be gels.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.610
How do we find out?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.020
We shake them up a little bit.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.750
Because we know from
experience, it's a keyword,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.560
we learn things-- a brain learns
things, so we use them, right?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.600
So they're liquids.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.240
So I'm going to take
chunks of dry ice

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.630
and put them in the cylinders
in a very special way.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.916
And when I get done, you tell
me what the special way is.

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:11.840
AUDIENCE: It's blowing out.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.170
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What's blowing out?

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.982
You see any bubbles?

00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:20.571
What kind of bubbles are those?

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:22.455
AUDIENCE: Blue.

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:23.868
Green.

00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:25.889
Green.

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.930
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: What?

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.370
You want to know
what's in there?

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.744
You already know
what's in there.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.910
Dry ice, I put the
dry ice in there.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.780
What did I put the dry ice into?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.500
Into two cylinders that have
colored liquids in them, right?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.510
And I put the dry ice
in every other cylinder.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.460
I didn't put it in
every cylinder, right?

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.600
Every other cylinder, leaving
one for comparison purposes.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.540
So these are dyes that change
color when the pH of the liquid

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.050
changes.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.750
[WHOOSH]

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.010
JESSICA HARROP: All right.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.070
So let's break down.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.560
What's happening
in these cylinders.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.500
There's six of them.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.490
And each set is
a different color

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.610
because they're different acid
base indicators inside them.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.510
So this set starts out blue.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.360
This one starts out pink.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.530
And the final one is purple.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.589
And every cylinder contains a
few drops of sodium hydroxide,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.529
which is a base.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:26.140
NaOH, sodium hydroxide,
and it's a base.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.630
So let's start with the basics.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.790
What is an acid and a base?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.160
One definition is that
acids are compounds

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.260
that donate a hydrogen ion or
H plus to another compound.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.260
And the compound that accepts
that hydrogen ion is a base.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.780
So acids are
hydrogen ion donors.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.840
And bases are hydrogen
ion acceptors.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.160
Here's some examples.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.080
Sodium hydroxide is a base.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.910
It's used to make soap.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.020
And acetic acid,
which looks like this,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.370
it makes vinegar sour.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.970
All right, so let's look
back at our cylinders here.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.830
This first set of cylinders
contains the indicator

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.560
bromothymol blue.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.180
Let's take a look
at the spectrum.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.960
All right, so let's take a
look at bromothymol blue,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.870
the indicator in the
first set of cylinders.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.880
As you can see here,
there's a scale of numbers.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.620
This is a pH scale.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.840
The higher the number, the
more basic the solution.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.910
The lower the number,
the more acidic.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.920
So our solution
started off basic.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.550
It was blue.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.250
It had sodium hydroxide in it.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.100
And this is what the chemical
structure of the molecule

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.740
looks like when it's blue.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.270
The chemical bonds
in the molecule

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.580
are absorbing colors of
the visible spectrum that

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.940
are not blue.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.270
So blue is reflected
back to our eyes.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.630
Now, if our compound picks
up a hydrogen ion which

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.130
it would if you added an acid to
it, the molecule changes color.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.460
Now it absorbs blue
and reflects yellow.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.070
Since the colors depend on
the structure of the molecule,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.110
a chemist could
reprogram the molecule

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.420
to switch its
color at other pHs,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.000
other numbers on this scale.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.190
That's useful depending
on the kind of reactions

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.890
she may want to study.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.570
Now, nature experiments
with color all the time.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.300
Animals use color to avoid
predators, attract mates,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.890
scare off enemies, etc.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.502
[WHOOSH]

00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:19.960
All right, so now
let's take a look

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.270
at what's happening in the
second set of cylinders

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.680
that started off pink.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.420
[WHOOSH]

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.490
The indicator in there
is phenolphthalein.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.830
The same thing is happening
with our bromothymol blue,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.700
but this time when the
solution is basic, it's pink.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.235
And when it's acidic,
it's colorless.

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:37.450
[WHOOSH]

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.030
But why does adding dry
ice change the solution

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.100
from basic to acidic?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.830
Well, dry ice is
solid carbon dioxide.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.570
When you add it to
water, it bubbles.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.540
And part of every bubble of
carbon dioxide dissolves.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.854
When it does, it
forms carbonic acid.

00:06:51.854 --> 00:06:53.020
Let's look at that equation.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.480
So there's more and more
carbonic acid in the water.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.230
And this acid reacts
with the sodium hydroxide

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.550
until there's none left.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.050
So the solution becomes acidic.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.820
So we saw our bromothymol blue
turning from blue to yellow

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.960
as the solution
became more acidic.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.840
And we saw our phenolphthalein
turn from pink to colorless

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.352
as it became more acidic.

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:26.810
Now, let's watch
again what happens

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.730
in the final set of cylinders.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.230
[WHOOSH]

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.480
BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: All right.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.000
So now I ask you to focus your
attention on this cylinder.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.510
Actually, you can
focus your attention

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.660
on anything you want to, OK?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.810
You can even not pay
attention if you want to.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.040
We live in a free country.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.560
But if you want to follow
the experiment with me,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.630
I want you to focus your
attention on this one

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.910
and tell me, count them out,
how many different color

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.516
changes you see as I drop
the dry ice in there.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.160
I'm listening to
you on the radio.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.290
One.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.032
Wow, I heard wow.

00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:07.240
What kind of a count is that?

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.260
Three so far.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.940
Three different color changes.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.340
But you know, I'm listening
to you on the radio.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.340
You want me to appreciate
what you're seeing,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.870
so what were the color
changes that you saw?

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.570
Why couldn't you
say those, right?

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.690
You see how we have
to help our brain make

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.600
the right observations and
make the right reporting.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.362

00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:32.570
JESSICA HARROP: OK, so in
the final set of cylinders,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.990
Dr. Shakhashiri has a
mixture of indicators.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.520
This created the
color changes that

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.059
occurred as the solution
became more and more acidic.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.190
There were three
changes that we saw.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:52.165
It went from purple to
blue to green to yellow.

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:52.790
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.206
All right, that's
it for me today.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.200
I'll see you next time.
