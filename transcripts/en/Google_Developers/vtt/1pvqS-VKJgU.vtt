GREG HARTRELL: My
name's Greg Hartrell,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.985
I'm the lead product manager
for Google Play Games, and--

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:11.110
DAN GALPIN: I'm Dan Galpin.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.790
I'm a [INAUDIBLE] developer
advocate here at Google.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.660
GREG HARTRELL: So we're going
to talk to you a little bit

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.980
about Google Play Games,
our online network,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.409
and a little about preceding
some of the growth story

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.950
that we heard from
Chris [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.130
So Chris told us about the
incredible gaming momentum

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.590
we have with Android
and Google Play.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.340
To recap some of
those metrics, we

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.380
have over a billion
activated Android devices.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.870
And three in four of
those Android users

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.690
are playing games.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.030
That's a ton of gamers.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.880
We know that
developers are reaching

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.860
an unprecedented audience
of gamers like never before.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.339
And the more
interesting thing is

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.880
when we take a look
at that momentum,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.980
it's helped propel Google Play
Games, our online game network,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.120
to tremendous growth.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.870
So we're sharing with
you the stat today,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.550
that we've had over 75
million new users who've

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.560
joined us in only six months.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.770
So since we launched at
Google I/O last year,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.000
we've spoken to many
of you who've adopted,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.500
we've spoken to
many of our players,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.590
and we're just delighted
by these results.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.230
I'd just like to
thank-- and Dan and I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.440
would like to thank-- everyone
of you for adopting us

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.920
and for helping make us this
successful in this short period

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.890
of time.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.890
We think that this is one
of the greatest growth

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.170
opportunities for
game developers today,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.610
and we'll take you through a
little bit of that right now.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.320
So if you step back and
look at Google Play Games,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.520
it's basically Google's
online game network

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.050
with user experiences
and services designed

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.580
to enhance game play,
bring all of these players

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.080
together, and in a
matter of speaking,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.070
take Android and mobile
gaming to the next level.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.390
Many of these services are
available cross platform

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.090
to developers, through
SDKs, through Android, iOS,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.900
and the web.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.150
And for players, they're
engaging in these experiences

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.790
in-game and through
our Play Games app.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.690
But that said,
there's a lot more

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.590
to these services than just
the achievements, leaderboards,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.460
multiplayer, and Cloud
save services that we have.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.940
The way to think
about Play Games

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.000
is, it's a concentrated
network of people

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.860
who enjoy playing games.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.670
And in an ecosystem this
large, it's essential for us

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.759
to bring all these
people together and help

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.960
you connect them
to your content.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.877
So for those of you
who've adopted Play Games,

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:15.210
we've talked with you, and
we've looked at our own data,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.720
and we know some interesting
properties about these players.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.530
We know that they're playing
longer, they play more often,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.110
and they're more likely
to monetize in your title.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.410
So some of you have
experienced double-digit bumps

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.610
in engagement and
retention stats,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.570
or have seen a lift in revenue
after launching Play Games.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.050
We know that we're helping
many of these games just

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.820
reach new heights.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.940
But there's nothing magic
about Google Play Games.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.250
It's not like you just integrate
the services and magic happens.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.860
It's really more
about how do you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.600
use the tool sets to
engage these users

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.490
and these mobile
users that are there?

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.030
So you can imagine,
in mobile gaming

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.840
there's a very diverse audience
that you're trying to reach,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.784
and similar to the
way that you think

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:54.200
about the thematics
of your title,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.241
and what type of audience
you're trying to reach,

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.140
you also need to think of how
these tool sets will resonate

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.030
with the different
types of players.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.320
So one way to think
about them-- and there's

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120
many-- is how interested they
are in social-- or just social

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.620
openness-- with a
spectrum of people

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.747
who are not very
interested and very high.

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:13.580
So Dan's going to use
his best science class

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.900
voice to help us understand
how Android Labs thinks

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.075
about these users.

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:19.450
DAN GALPIN: Here
at Android Labs,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.299
we've done extensive
research, which

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.840
leads us to the
conclusion that there

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.720
are three fundamental gamer
archetypes, the competitor,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.380
achiever, and stealth gamer.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.630
These archetypes can be
charted based approximately

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.890
on how open they are
to social interaction.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.140
At the open end of our scale,
the competitor archetype

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.760
engages in everything,
achievements, leaderboards,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.850
and multiplayer.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.630
They thrive in competitive and
deep cooperative experiences.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.720
They own every console,
their personal homepage lists

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.050
their achievements and scores--
and not just from one network--

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.700
they play games on mobile for
the same reason that Captain

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.160
Kirk climbed mountains
in "Star Trek IV"--

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.464
because they're there.

00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:02.630
Achiever is the other side
of the openness spectrum.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.690
They thrive in progression,
solving problems, and revealing

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.280
story, but they're averse to
playing in social situations.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.930
This is the mobile
equivalent of the people that

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.159
work to earn a million points in
"Geometry Wars" without dying.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.700
The people that
played "Final Fantasy

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.352
VIII" to get the two-minute
long Eden Summons.

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:20.810
Like the competitor,
these guys are

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.990
looking for deeper phone
and tablet experiences.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.650
The stealth is a funny persona.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.180
They don't view themselves as a
gamer but they play every day.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.020
And while they are
less likely to engage

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.930
in direct social
interactions, they

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.980
welcome passive interactions.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.710
This means they can
be engaged to help

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.820
a friend, or by comparing
themselves to another player,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.160
so long as the social
interaction is fast

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.690
and the impact is immediate.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.745
With these three
personas in mind,

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:49.120
I'm going to hand
it over to Greg

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.057
to cover how Play Games can
help you reach each one of them.

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.390
GREG HARTRELL: That's fantastic.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.727
I already feel like I'm in
fifth grade science class again.

00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:58.310
So let's take a look
at the competitor

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.490
persona in a little
bit more depth.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.760
So the toolkit here, are our
social and public leaderboards

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.110
and our multiplayer
capabilities.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.930
And these cater very
well to somebody

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.350
who wants that competitive
and cooperative experience.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.430
When you look at social
and public leaderboards,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.080
it's intuitive, this
is the classic way

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.990
of engaging a
competitor's streak.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.307
I think what you see here,
is that somebody chasing

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:20.890
their score, their
going to try to get

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.120
in front of their friends.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.390
And what we found, is that
our social leaderboards

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.390
are particularly effective
in encouraging people

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.480
to reach out to
their friends, saying

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.430
hey, come play this
game, and oh, by the way,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.630
try to beat my score.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.310
Moving on to the multiplayer
capabilities that we have,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.650
maybe the best example
we have most recently,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.720
is from a game
called Clumsy Bird.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.640
Clumsy Bird used our real
time multiplayer capabilities

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.570
to drive an intense amount of
social interaction and repeat

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.460
game play.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.020
They did this in the form of
using our auto-matching system

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.850
to create a five-round
elimination tournament.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.020
This ended up rewarding players
for making it to the end.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.470
And with the auto-matching
capability we have,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.100
is really fantastic, because
it gives your players

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.650
to access to what
might be described

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.960
as the hidden social
graphic or game.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.690
That is people who were
playing the game right now,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.000
and these players are
getting into games

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.800
in seconds, which is a
highly-gratifying experience

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.340
for this type of user.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.310
We also have an invite
system, so Clumsy Bird also

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.070
integrates that.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.110
Where I can invite
a player like Dan

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.780
and ask really penetrating
questions like,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.970
how can I beat his
score, and how did you

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.702
get that fancy
hat for your bird?

00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:27.410
DAN GALPIN: I think
the really cool thing

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.530
is that this game really used
our services to stand out

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.017
from other similar
games on the platform.

00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:35.350
GREG HARTRELL: To say the least.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.910
OK, so moving on.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.010
We also have turn-based
multiplayer intuitive.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.570
That if you have a title
that is literally turn-based,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.840
or where game play sessions
are played in increments

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.277
over many days or many
hours, very useful toolkit.

00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:50.860
Good to point out
in our invite system

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.515
that Google will
help rank users based

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:54.140
on how frequently
you engage with them.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.180
So being able to show
you players that you've

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.890
played with recently, or people
who are actively playing,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.690
helps people get into a game
even faster, and appeals,

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.040
again, to that
competitor persona.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.520
But the growth hack
here is interesting.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.497
So if we take a look at our
notification system, what

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.580
this allows is an opportunity
for social discovery

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.200
in your game.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.720
So if you've
integrated multiplayer,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.850
you automatically get the
ability to notify users

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.730
through the millions and
millions of Android users

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.670
that are out there.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.975
And we took this to heart
and we've made some changes

00:07:24.975 --> 00:07:26.750
to the way that we've
done notifications.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.035
Launching in-play services,
rolling out this week,

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:31.910
and expanding the way
that we think about it.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.920
So we called it
priority notifications.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.080
So let's go through an example
of how this might work.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.810
So today let's say Dan invites
me to a game by default--

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.859
he's in my circles-- I would
see Dan's face, and the fact

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.650
that he wants to play
Frozen Front with me,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.900
and my phone would buzz,
and I'd see it in the shape.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.280
But let's say I got invited
by somebody who is not

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.120
in my circles, and they're
interested in playing with me.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.260
So in this new
rubric, we're going

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.300
to be able to silently
aggregate these people

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.420
in the notification.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.230
And I don't yet know
who this user is.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.390
So if I tap on the
notification, you'll

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.710
see that there's two users.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.790
Dan's on the left in my circles,
and I can play a game with him

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.270
immediately, and
on the right, you

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.130
have this handsome
devil, who, clearly you

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.350
want to play a game with him.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.260
And you can go and
see more, and you

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.640
can add him to your circles,
or play games with him.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.520
And again, if I
don't have this game,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.132
I'm taken to the Play Store,
I'm converted into a new user,

00:08:23.132 --> 00:08:24.590
and that's a little
bit of a growth

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.400
hack for you using
multiplayer games.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.740
OK that's the competitor
in a nutshell.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.220
Let's talk about the achiever.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.914
So the toolkit here
is pretty simple.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.789
This is the user that's
progression oriented.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.900
They're going to
complete all the story,

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.691
and they're going to
earn every achievement

00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:39.860
that you put into your game.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.679
Quality achievements
are essential here,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.450
and the leader boards
have a tendency

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.600
of driving this user as well.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.790
But the key message we want
to leave with you today

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.640
is design great achievements.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.547
And that sounds easy to say,
and it's very easy to do,

00:08:52.547 --> 00:08:54.630
and we see the titles that
do this really well are

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.340
seeing a lift in
engagement and improving

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.710
the retention of their titles.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.060
So let's take for example,
a game like "Plague Inc."

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.700
For those of you who haven't
played "Plague Inc"--

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.158
and I would be impressed for
those of you in this room that

00:09:04.158 --> 00:09:07.550
haven't-- "Plague Inc" is
this simulator that allows you

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.030
to engineer a virus
to destroy all humans.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.052
And if you learned in
super villain class,

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.510
after you destroy
the world, you're

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.540
really just supposed to go on
vacation, and maybe retire.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.440
But that leaves you out
of the opportunities

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.220
of all the exotic ways that
you can destroy the world.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.680
So as the achiever, I'd be able
to look at the achievements

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.200
and say, oh, there's other
ways for me to go about this.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.410
I can potentially cause
World War III, fascinating.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.910
Or I can infect
astronauts apparently.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.662
Viruses in space.

00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:35.120
This is the most
awesome game ever.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.520
DAN GALPIN: This
game is awesome.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.840
GREG HARTRELL: OK, so very
easy for you to accomplish.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.340
Bottom line is,
achievements matter.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.650
We have this Play Games
developer practices video.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.050
It's online now.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.077
I think we'll be showing
it at a lunch break.

00:09:47.077 --> 00:09:49.660
This is where we'd invite you
to take a picture of the screen,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.271
get the link.

00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:53.270
And for those of you that
didn't take a picture,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.770
you can always google it.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.540
OK.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.970
Let's switch a little bit
more discovery hacking here.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.790
So by integrating Play
Games-- and this appeals

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.560
not only to the
achievers, but also

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.210
to any one of the
archetypes-- there

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.350
is several ways you can
get incremental installs.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.372
So the first and most obvious
one, get a great rating.

00:10:09.372 --> 00:10:10.330
You have a great title.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.770
It's high quality.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.817
You will see a higher
uplift in installs,

00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:15.400
and we encourage you
to focus on that.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.850
DAN GALPIN: People
like Play Games.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:17.891
GREG HARTRELL: Go figure.

00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:18.830
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.960
GREG HARTRELL: Next to it is, is
when you integrate Play Games,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.527
and this is particularly
interesting for the achiever

00:10:22.527 --> 00:10:25.050
persona, the store will show
different types of badges,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.400
including the fact that
his game has achievements.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.470
And that is one
little edge that you

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.220
can get that allows this
user to make the decision

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.250
to install and play your game.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.190
Now let's switch over
to the Play Games app.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.226
Fascinating feature
of this experience

00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:40.100
is you can see what your
friends are playing.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.224
So if you were to look at
my recently-played games,

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.300
you would see that I'm
playing "Brave Frontier"

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.024
and "Robot Unicorn Attack
2"-- fantastic titles--

00:10:47.024 --> 00:10:49.440
and you tap through those,
they would take you to the Play

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.960
Store, and convert those
people into new users.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.722
Also in the Play Games app,
we have specialized top charts

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:57.930
that show games that have
integrated with Play Games,

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.140
including a popular
multiplayer category.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.060
And the ability to search for
those titles within it as well.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.680
And lastly, we
announced this week

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.090
that we've updated the game
categories in the Google Play

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.934
Store with 18 new genres.

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.350
And that helps people find
games that they love in a genre

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.440
that they care about.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.250
DAN GALPIN: But
the real question

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.630
is, how do we approach
our stealth gamer?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.490
They appreciate sign-in
with Cloud Save,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.740
but we don't really have
anything for social discovery

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.940
for them, until now.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.580
So we're adding Game Gifts to
the list of Google Play Games

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.680
services.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.190
Game Gifts is a service that
enables users to both send

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.155
and ask each for in-game items.

00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:37.440
I'm going to go
through the basic flow.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.460
So we start off by actually
giving UI in the game

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.610
to actually send an extra life,
and of course, extra lives

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.114
look like mushrooms.

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:48.655
And just to show
we're honest, here's

00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.870
the code you would actually
execute to do this.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.710
All you do is request a
send intent with type gift.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.440
Inside of the intent,
you can include

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.650
a binary payload,
whatever you want,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.571
the lifetime of the
gift in days, an icon,

00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:02.320
and a description.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.090
Back to our flow.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.780
Google Play Games
then displays the UI

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.270
to select the player to gift.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.420
I recommend following this
example, and gifting me.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.950
The request heads into
our cloud and notification

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.370
is posted to receiver's device.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.535
They actually get this
aggregate view of anyone

00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:23.234
who sent them gifts,
whether or not

00:12:23.234 --> 00:12:24.650
they're actually
in their circles,

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.350
and then from there they can
actually accept the gift.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.080
Now if they don't
yet have the game,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.000
then they're brought
to Google Play,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.230
and Google Play will go
and install the game.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.170
And then they can
actually accept the gift,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.166
and this is what it looks like.

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:40.040
You actually end up
getting incoming requests

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.360
in an unconnected bundle.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.000
And our game helper sample also
provides a get request method

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.540
to fetch these requests,
as in this example.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.110
We also register a
request listener,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.690
which means if the game
is actually running,

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.720
you can actually just get these
game requests within the game,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.370
you don't have to direct
people into this flow.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.600
And you can accept them,
just by handling requests.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.100
And the game should
probably display

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.330
some UX to allow the
gifts to be accepted,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.810
since Play Games does not.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.760
And here's how you actually
handle the callback

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.160
once you've accepted
the request.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.470
Note that the response doesn't
actually contain details

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.815
about the request, which
is why I cashed the request

00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:15.020
objects to begin with.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.720
And yes, you use empty blocks
is where you'd actually

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.910
handle the requests
within your game.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.400
OK, so back to our flow.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.830
Now we've accepted the request
and we get an extra life!

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.460
You can also actually
show the inbox request

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.740
inside of your game.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.635
So we talked a little
bit about gifting,

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.260
and that was a pretty
complicated flow,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.670
but I actually
left something out.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.280
So after you've actually
accepted the gift,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.540
we allow you to get the
results of the transaction.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.395
And this allows you to
do things like trades

00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:46.752
within our gifting system.

00:13:46.752 --> 00:13:47.710
So this is pretty cool.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.168
Instead of just
accepting the life,

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.415
you can actually prompt
the user and say, hey,

00:13:51.415 --> 00:13:53.790
do you want to trade
this for some other item?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.420
And sure.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.000
And so if the user
accepts that trade,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.460
it'll send a message
back, and you

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.150
can find out that
the item was traded.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.280
And this way you can actually
set up complex flows.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.230
You could say, hey, no, I'm
not going to accept this item,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.390
but here is my offer.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.270
And you could actually have a
complex negotiation scenario

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:15.150
going on between players,
all hosted by Play Games.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.140
So now you've made a game
that all three archetypes play

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.270
and discover using Play
Games, which is awesome.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.360
But the next question is, how
do you know if I'm successful?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.739
So I'm turning it
back over to Greg.

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.280
GREG HARTRELL: So
to precisely answer

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.380
the question of how
you're successful,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.160
you need to think about who
are these different personas?

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.714
And how can I see that
I'm engaging them,

00:14:33.714 --> 00:14:35.880
and that Play Games is
actually making a difference?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.510
So this week, we're launching
a new update to the Google Play

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.610
developer console, and we
call it Enhanced Play Games

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.940
Statistics.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.650
What's fascinating
about the statistics

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.500
for Play Games adopters is,
it allows you near-zero effort

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.141
analytics by virtue of
incorporating Google Play

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:52.640
Games.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.580
It comes in the form of a daily
dashboard that you can view,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.614
providing you player and
engagement analytics,

00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:01.780
for you to better measure
the success of your titles

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.450
between updates and for the
types of content you added.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.200
So let's take a closer look.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.780
OK, that's too close.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.510
Alright.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.480
So for the best game ever, you
need the best ever dashboard.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.690
And so we'll do a
quick tour here.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.710
What I can see in
this best game ever

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.500
is a quick, at-a-glance, metrics
of recent days of new players,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.030
and active players--
ones that I've

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.640
converted into coming back.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.230
I can also get a quick glance
at my retention data, which

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.230
gives me a quick glance
at several days of running

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.700
day two averages.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.020
And then I can look at
my engagement statistics,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.930
particularly for achievements
and leaderboards, achievements

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.860
both in terms of what's earning,
and the meantime to unlock,

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.430
and also leaderboard activity
in terms of scores posted.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.470
The dashboard also
provides delta metrics,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.190
so I can at a glance
quickly determine

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.390
whether I'm increasing
or decreasing

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.610
engagement with my players.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.830
And I can use this in
a variety of scenarios,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.394
depending on how
I manage my game.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:58.810
So let's take a
look at the player

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.040
stats when you dive deep.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.070
This gives you your
trend lines for players

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.630
who sign in to play games.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.370
And your rubric is, I have
new players who are coming in,

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.250
I can see which ones
are becoming active,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.210
and I can see how
I'm retaining them.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.090
So the quintessential
scenario here

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.010
is, you've just updated your
title, your goal of that title

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:23.060
was to improve-- or rather
reactivate-- all of your users,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.930
or a large swath
of them, and you

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.070
could see your trend lines
and your active players

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.780
to validate whether
you've accomplished that.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.310
A more interesting scenario
is through player retention.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:37.100
So this dashboard gives you
the ever-important new player

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.300
return rate.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.179
And what new player
return rate is,

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.720
here's the number of people who
started playing on this date,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.960
and 1, 2, 7, and 30 days
later they came back.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.460
And many of you use
this as a key metric

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.560
for deciding whether the
early game of your title

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.220
is compelling or is successful.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.950
And so the use
case here, you just

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.890
updated your title to compress
let's say your tutorial flow,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.740
and maybe enhance
some of the things

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.530
that you're showing within
the first 24-hour period,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.920
with the goal of increasing
day two retention.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.980
And so what you would
see here on let's say

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.720
March 8th, going from March 7th,
is you accomplished that goal.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.690
You saw a bump in day two
retention as a result,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.400
and you know that your tutorial
flow changes were fixed.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.319
And again, this data is all
based on Play Games signed-in

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.280
users.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.520
Gives you all of this
data on a daily basis.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.150
Let's switch over to the
engagement analytics.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.180
So this focuses on
achievements in leaderboards.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.010
And so if you think
about the archetypes

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.010
that we talked about earlier,
such as the achiever,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.790
and the competitor,
let's say that you added

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.270
an achievement towards
the end of your game

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.360
and you can kind of see that
this is the one that helps them

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.310
get to that very special
level that I know

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.759
has a ton of content.

00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:51.800
I can see if my achiever's
actually chasing that,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.230
or whether they're
finding things

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.740
that are impeding
them along the way.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.560
Or if the competitor is, let's
say you added a new tournament

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.960
mode to your game, you
can use the leaderboard

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.990
that's backing that tournament
to see the number of scores

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.472
that are posted, and the
velocity of people engaging

00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:08.680
in that, to decide whether
your tournament system was

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.790
successful.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.500
So we're very excited to
launch this for all Play Games

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.000
adopters.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.300
It's available in the Google
Play Developer Console

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.209
this week.

00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.000
We can't wait to see
what you do to improve

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.940
the metrics of your titles.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.280
OK, so that brings us
to the end of our talk.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.960
We're going to do a quick recap,
to see what we learned today.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.230
First is, we learned
that Play Games is

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.040
a highly concentrated network of
people who love playing games.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.290
We know that they play
longer, they play more often,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.990
and they're more likely
to monetize in your title.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.300
We learned about three personas,
the achiever, the competitor,

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.780
and this stealth gamer.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.290
For the competitor, we have
direct social experiences,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.650
and for the achiever we
have progression mechanics.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.600
And for the stealth
gamer, who is

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.807
interested in passive
social experiences,

00:18:50.807 --> 00:18:52.890
we've launched Game Gifts,
which we're rolling out

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.340
with the next Play services
update over the next week.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.970
We learned a number of
growth hacking techniques,

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.300
using Google Play Store
and Google Play Games,

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.640
such as the top charts
in the Games app

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.610
and seeing what
people are playing.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.890
And through multiplayer
notifications,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.560
you can convert new
users who have not

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.740
played the game by virtue
of social discovery.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.420
And last, but
certainly not least,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.920
we give you tools to measure
your success through the Google

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.490
Play Developer Console with
enhanced Play Games statistics

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.662
for all of your signed-in users.

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:26.870
And with that, that brings
us to the end of our talk.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.911
Dan and I would like to
thank you for joining us.

00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:31.440
We have a fantastic lineup for
Google Developer Day today,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.760
and we'll be taking questions
outside in the back,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.420
after this.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.660
Thank you very much.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.210
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.
