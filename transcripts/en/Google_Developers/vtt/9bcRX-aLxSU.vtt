00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:09.443
Hi.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm a developer advocate
on the Google

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.230
Maps Developers team.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.920
I'm coming to you from Mountain
View, California, at

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.100
the Googleplex to give
you another Google

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.330
Maps Developers shortcuts.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
This is an episode on how to
build your first iOS app using

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.259
the Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.080
To help you out, I've uploaded
a project to GitHub and to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.410
Google Code called
Hello Map iOS.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660
So let's take a look at that.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.350
This is the Hello Map
iOS on GitHub.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.800
You'll see here we outlined
the requirements.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.450
The basic requirements are you
have the latest version of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.720
Xcode, you download the Google
Maps SDK for iOS, and you have

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.420
the iOS 6.0 SDK.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.470
That's all outlined in this
doc and on our developer

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.970
documentation.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.220
Now the steps to get started
are, first, you're going to

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.230
clone the project on iOS.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.640
So here I'm going
to hit Clone.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.130
There I've got get clone the
project, and I'm going to look

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.580
in the directory and I see
I have Hello Maps iOS.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.780
And I'm going to double-click
on this Xcode project file.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.870
And look, I have the project.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.450
OK.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.780
Now I'm going to explore
this here.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.020
I've got to create and add the
key to the project, and that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
is going to go into this
HMAppDelegate file.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.060
So I am going to go over to the
Google APIs console, where

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.700
I've created a project.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.900
Just called it iOS Map Apps.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.220
And you'll see here I have
the Google Maps SDK

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.000
for iOS turned on.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.880
Then, I'm going to switch over
here to API access and I'm

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.230
just going to show you
the process for

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.830
creating a new key.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.820
I create the iOS key and I
say com.example.hellomap.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.920
You can use your own project
identifier, but for this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.110
purpose, do this.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.730
I click Create, and you'll
see it added an API key.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.800
So I'm going to copy that, and
I'm going to go into the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.330
AppDelegate file, and I'm
going to add in the key.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.840
By the way, if you're copying
down my key, I'm totally

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.420
deleting this at the end
of this episode so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.450
don't even try it.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.690
But you'll see there's
still an error.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.710
We haven't actually added the
framework to the project.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.350
So I'm going to go over here.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.380
I downloaded the framework to my
desktop, and I'm just going

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.720
to click on the framework file
and drag that over to the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.870
project, add it to the
frameworks in my project.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.290
And then I'm going
to click here--

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.630
copy items into the destinations
group folder,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.180
click Finish.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.180
Almost there.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.570
Almost done.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.600
So now I click on that
and pull up a context

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.570
menu, Show in Finder.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.600
And I am going down to
Resources, opening that up,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.070
and you can see the Google
Maps bundle.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.945
I'm going to drag that
into the frameworks.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.800
Uncopy copy items into the
destinations group folder

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.070
because it's already there,
click Finish.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.420
OK.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
What's the next step, you ask?

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.550
The next step is run it
in the simulator.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.800
Click on Run.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.724
And there you have
your first map.

00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:18.339
Yay, awesome.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.910
OK.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.560
Two common mistakes--

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.970
one is you don't add the
framework, two is you don't

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.800
add the API key.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.410
If you find everything loaded
but you're getting a blank

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.750
map, add the API key.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.180
Oh, one other thing that
actually just came up today.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.780
Check the deployment target,
which is if you go into the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.570
project navigator, you click
on Hello Map, and then on

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.200
Targets, you select Summary.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.530
Look at the deployment target--
make sure that you

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.770
are using one that you actually
have installed on

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.790
your system.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.280
So we do require for development
that you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.450
use at least 6.0.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.100
You actually have that installed
on your system, but

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.230
we do support back to 5.1 for
actual deployment, so it will

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.340
run on devices back to 5.1.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.820
I discovered this when I was
working with somebody who

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.120
didn't have 6.1 and I had baked
6.1 into the project.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.180
You may need to change it back
to 6.0 if you don't have 6.1

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.350
yet, or just get 6.1.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.310
OK, that's it.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.530
If you have any questions,
as usual, Stack Overflow.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.840
And we look forward to seeing
you in the next Google Maps

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.090
Developer shortcut.
