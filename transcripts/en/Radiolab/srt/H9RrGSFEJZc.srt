00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,930
Hello. Hey mark. Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,590
I'm Robert Krulwich and this is
radiolab, the podcast, the podcast.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,850
And today on the podcast we have a
story from a reporter, Mark Phillips,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,680
who's here. Here with us. Ah, yes. Okay.
So mark, what are we hearing? Well,

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,660
I went to visit this incredible
woman named Diane. Ben. Darren. Hey,

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,370
come on man. Nice to meet you. Yeah.
Can we say what was their last name?

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,170
Van Darren van Daren. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,500
She lives just south of Denver in the
foothills of the rocky mountains. Oh,

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,960
that's a cool view of a extend. Very
look tiny, doesn't it? So who is she?

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,030
Why is she a person of note? Well,

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,050
she's one of the best
altar runners in the world.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,930
Very active lives. That's an ultra runner.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,390
The definition is just anything
longer than a marathon.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,320
The majority of them that she runs
are a hundred miles a hundred.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,610
This was continuous miles continuous.
There's no sleeping, no sleep,

16
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,490
28 hours straight. Wow. I
can tell you what pain is.

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,060
I can tell you what pain is.
And I'm, I was fortunate,

18
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,360
I got runner up to Lance Armstrong for
outdoor person of the year, years ago.

19
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,720
And I kind of think lance and I have
stories that are very parallel. How so?

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,020
Well, it's interesting,
she was always an athlete.

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,390
She actually played
professional tennis for awhile.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,000
She came to running later
in life and oddly enough,

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,070
her running career started with a
seizure. Well, my first seizure, gosh,

24
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,030
I do remember it. It was
1988. Diane was 28 years old.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,660
I had two children married. Um,

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,140
I was three weeks into my third
pregnancy and one day I was with my mom.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,500
We were in the car and as
we were driving around,

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,830
I remember reaching for like
the, the glove compartment box.

29
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,610
My mom had asked for me to get some gum
out and I remember as I was reaching for

30
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,540
that, that's, I had this funny
sensation. It was quick and it was brief.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,070
And then boom, that's the
last thing I remember.

32
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,750
And next thing she knows she's waking
up in the hospital. Um, I was confused.

33
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,210
I didn't know where I was, what
I was doing, what happened.

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,500
And eventually I ended up getting
with a doctor, Doctor Spitz,

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,230
and after some tests they
sent me off for an MRI.

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,540
You told her what you have is epilepsy?

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,790
Oh,

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
that was the first time I heard that word.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:13,920
[inaudible]

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,050
the seizure is just out of the blue. Well,

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,440
what the doctors eventually figured
out is that when she was a baby,

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,380
she had a fever and I ended up
throwing a grand mal seizure,

43
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:26,100
which lasted almost an hour. That's
the, that's the big one. Yeah. And uh,

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,330
they kind of put together that she
probably damaged a part of her brain from

45
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:35,220
that seizure and 24 years later,
basically, boom, seizures.

46
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,840
Reoccurred and you said earlier that
this somehow led to her running? Yeah.

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,560
Okay. So after the seizure,
the first seizure in the car,

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,550
they started to happen more and more.
But before the seizures would come on,

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,190
she would have this warning
sign. It's called an aura.

50
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,300
I would have an or I would have a
sensation before it did go into a seizure.

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,550
People with migraine
pepper. Exactly. Yeah.

52
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,710
I would get really
tingly all over my body,

53
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,560
but feel kind of floaty the premonition
that something's about to happen.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,130
She was in the shower, shouldn't have
to get out. Okay, what do I need to be,

55
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,220
what do I need to do?
And then it would happen.

56
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,790
I tried every medication that
was available, diets, nutrition.

57
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,190
I mean I tried it all.
Basically nothing was working,

58
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,900
nothing work until I found the only way
I could break the cycle of a seizure for

59
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,140
me. Whenever I had that premonition,
a seizure was coming on,

60
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,050
I'd have my running shoes by the
front door, should be eating dinner.

61
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,070
She would feel a premonition.
Just drop her, her fork and knife,

62
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,340
throw those running shoes on.

63
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,320
And I just showed you these
mountains here by my house.

64
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,410
I'd run to the pikes national
forest. Have this just a,

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,660
this is run in silence for a second.
Okay. So we can get some sound of that.

66
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,380
Yeah. Are House is literally, you know,
on the foothills of these mountains.

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,280
I'm not going to see a herd of elk out
here. I've seen them out lying out here.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,340
Well I do, whenever I had a seizure
coming on, I'd go run. Well,

69
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,400
of course my family, my mom, everybody
was panicking because they thinking,

70
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,680
oh my gosh, Diane is going to be off
running in the middle of nowhere,

71
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,470
have a seizure and we're not going
to where she is, how to find her,

72
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:06,640
what we're going to do.
But I found that, um,

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,930
that it worked. She wasn't having
seizures. So when she would run,

74
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,680
she would have a premonition but
no actual seizure at the end. Yeah.

75
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,380
When I ran from the seizures
and I'd run to the forest,

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,240
I would just feel me just getting more
relaxed. My heart wouldn't be pounding,

77
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,740
calmness set in and that is
where my love for running began.

78
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,670
She did this for years. She feel this or,

79
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,730
and then she'd just run
literally outrunning the
seizures and at first had just

80
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,390
been hour or so, but then she was
going for longer and longer, two hours,

81
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,890
five hours, six hours. And
it sort of worked for awhile.

82
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,470
But eventually

83
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,840
the seizures basically to start
overcoming, they caught up with her.

84
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,640
I was having three to
five seizures a week.

85
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,250
I wasn't getting those premonitions
like I did in the beginning.

86
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,460
It got to the point where she didn't
have enough time to get her running shoes

87
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:03,300
and I didn't have that long of a
premonition. It was like boom seizure.

88
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,470
So I could tell that part of my brain
was actually getting weaker and I knew at

89
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:10,680
that point in time I really was at more
of a risk of dying from a seizure you

90
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:14,220
could die from is if a
seizure happens all the time.

91
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,630
People die of seizures all the time.
For example, um, a friend of mine,

92
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,390
his wife, she went up to go take a bath,

93
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,190
had a seizure when up later and he found
her dead in the tub. You know, my kids,

94
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,980
I always had a tell them, hey, mom's
taken a bath. Come check on me.

95
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,090
My children at a very young age had to
learn how to drive a car because what if

96
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:37,260
mom had a seizure while she was
driving? I as a parent, as a wife,

97
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:40,830
as a mom of three small children,
I was running out of options.

98
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,430
And you know, she talked with
her doctors and they said, well,

99
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,580
there's a chance you could have
a surgery that would fix this.

100
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,690
If the seizures are coming from
just one discrete part of the brain,

101
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,250
they can cut that part of the brain out,

102
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,980
but first they have to figure out if
it's that type of seizure and it's coming

103
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,810
from to see if it was operable,

104
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,590
which meant she had to go to the hospital
and actually have a seizure in front

105
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:03,740
of them.

106
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,740
I had to have 64 electrodes basically
glued onto onto my scalp and then I had

107
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,530
this cord out of each one of these
electrodes that was in my head.

108
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,120
It was tethered into a TV set.

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
She was hooked up to an EEG machine and
had a camera on me 24 seven and there's

110
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,030
footage of this. She showed it to me.

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,460
I remember laying there in
the bed saying, I can't run.

112
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,410
I need to let it happen.

113
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,130
[inaudible]

114
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,080
what you see on the screen is she starts
to jerk. She's clenched, she's shaking.

115
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,870
You hear the bed started rattling.

116
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,300
She bites her tongue so hard that, you
know, there's just this pool of blood,

117
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,970
the lower phase, he's
choking on a blood. It's,

118
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,380
it's, it's horrifying. Yeah.

119
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,813
Huh.

120
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,920
And then as I came out
of it, honest to God,

121
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,690
I felt like I'd been run over by a truck.

122
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,530
I was gurgling still on
some blood that was, um,

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,460
in my throat and I had a massive headache
and put the doctors are standing right

124
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:19,490
next to her cheering. All right.
All right. We got it. We got it.

125
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,550
Cause they actually found that the
seizures were coming from one spot in the

126
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,640
brain. Then when they said,
well, what do you think?

127
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,120
We found the spot you could be a
surgery candidate. I mean, you know,

128
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:33,200
it's a big risk and it's not like
just taking a pill. I mean you're,

129
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,910
you're cutting out a chunk of your brain.

130
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,530
Was it a tough decision or was
it just sort of a no brainer,

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,870
no pun intended? Let's see
here. Well in all honesty,

132
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,870
um, it was hands down.
I was like, let's go.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,433
Hello.

134
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,140
So they saw the side
of my right head open.

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,070
I just literally just sod
it open. And so there was,

136
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,900
my brain exposed was on the table.

137
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,710
So the doctors huddle around and they
look in and they can actually see this

138
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:05,980
gray discolored spot from
all the seizure activity.

139
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:10,090
It's on the back right side. It's a part
of the brain called the temporal lobe,

140
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,360
which is the part of the brain that
seems to be involved in memory,

141
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,960
spatial reasoning and in temporal
reasoning time. And they had to know,

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,800
decide, okay, well how much of her
brain are we going to take out?

143
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,010
And they go back and forth.
I mean obviously the more
brain that they take out,

144
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,930
the more consequences,
the more side effects.

145
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,410
Well they ended up cutting out pry the
size of a kiwi out of my right temporal

146
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,320
lobe. That's big. Yeah,
it's not insignificant.

147
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,590
Kiwis are like the size of
golf balls. Right. And bigger.

148
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,790
When I came home I just had horrific
headaches and this extreme pain.

149
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,060
I just remember just holding my head,
just trying to hold my head together.

150
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:50,980
It just hurts so bad than that. And
seizure wise, they didn't know. Um,

151
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,000
so everybody was kind of on pins and
needles. Did it work? Did it not work?

152
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,430
And as days went on,

153
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,550
they waited and waited and waited
and I wasn't having seizures.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,790
None at all. No, she's not had a seizure
since the night before the surgery.

155
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,550
So you didn't really get into the
competitive altar running until after the

156
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:18,610
surgery. How did that come about?
I mean, how did I get into this?

157
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:23,170
It was interesting. I did a 50
mile race. I won that late. Okay.

158
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,690
Here's where things
kind of get interesting.

159
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,400
After a year or so of have no seizures,
Diane decided to enter this race,

160
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:34,430
a 50 miler. Wow. On a whim. I just
read about it in a magazine, you know,

161
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:37,010
I love to run and I thought, Oh man,

162
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,920
I have this new outlook on life
and that one of seizures. Okay,

163
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,870
I'm going to write a 50 oh one that.

164
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:45,230
And then I sent it for my first hundred
mile race. Of course everybody was like,

165
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,130
oh my gosh. Erasing the big horn
mountains of all places. Um,

166
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,450
did well I ended up placing
at the same time back home.

167
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,450
When did you start to
notice, uh, you know,

168
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,610
that that things were different
working differently in your brain? Um,

169
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,053
[inaudible]

170
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,893
okay.

171
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,760
Oh, I didn't, my family
started noticing things.

172
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,460
Mom's forgetting. You know what time
my appointments were relate to school.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,540
Mom's not here to pick me up. So she
was having short term memory loss. Yeah.

174
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,750
A lot of meeting somebody in the
morning. Later on that afternoon,

175
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,360
maybe I see him again and I have no
idea who they were. They'll have to say,

176
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:29,100
hey, remember I saw you? Those
kinds of things. But um, let's see.

177
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,860
What was I saying? Meanwhile,

178
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,430
first overall on the Alfred Packer 50
miler second overall and the bear 100

179
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,600
miler and first overall on the Tahoe
rim 100 miler. I can keep going. Yeah,

180
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,690
go first. Overall,

181
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800
on the 24 hours in Frisco trial run
first for women's in the dances with the

182
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:54,310
dirt 50 miler in hell, Michigan
dances with the dirt in hell.

183
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:58,870
Michigan first and women's in the Canadian
death race, 78 mile are in Edmonton,

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,060
Canada. The Canadian death race? Yeah.

185
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,650
The Yukon article two or 300 miler was
minus 48 degrees when we began the event.

186
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,980
The shoes literally froze on my
feet and only two of us finished.

187
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:11,170
I ran the first hundred miles
with no water did for him.

188
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,740
30 miles in the Yukon pulling a
sled during which time she'd sleep.

189
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,960
Only about an hour a night for 10 days.

190
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,100
Wow. Really, the crazy thing is that
through all of this, she can't read a map.

191
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,360
What do you mean woo?

192
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,360
One of the main functions of that Kiwi
size part of her brain that the doctors

193
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:32,450
took out, as I said,
was spatial reasoning,

194
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,410
and so after the surgery maps
just look weird to her. It's,

195
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,830
it's like just a bunch of information
on a piece of paper. All those lines,

196
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:44,760
all those squiggles, just noise to them.
How does she navigate through a race?

197
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,860
Well, I take a pink ribbon with me,

198
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,520
so when I'm out in the middle of nowhere
and I have three ways to hit a trail,

199
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:54,250
I'm not quite sure which way to go.
Is it left it right? I'll pick away.

200
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,010
I'll drop a ribbon, I mean
after a couple of hours,

201
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,320
if she feels like she's
not on a trail anymore,

202
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,600
she just goes back until
she gets to the pink ribbon.

203
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,500
And then she picks the other way on the
Yukon. There was time where, um, gosh,

204
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,980
I was lost for two hours while I was
out in the middle of nowhere, all alone.

205
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,330
Huge heavy winds just ripping
across the Yukon River. Um,

206
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,850
did you win that year that you
were lost for two hours? Yeah.

207
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,500
Yeah.

208
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,030
Mostly Diane finds these
sort of workarounds for what
she lost in the surgery,

209
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,740
but the fact is she only became this
amazing runner after the surgery.

210
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,810
So while we were talking I just couldn't
help but wonder. Well, I wonder like,

211
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,430
do you think,

212
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,230
did having part of your brain removed you
obviously make you an alternate runner

213
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,000
and you did understand the question?
I do. Um, and she says, no.

214
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,760
I think having a brain injury
puts me at a disadvantage.

215
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,550
Um, I,

216
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,790
let's see, what was I saying? But, um,

217
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,180
I think for me that the one advantage,

218
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,530
if I had to say I have an advantage over
the other athletes would be, um, time,

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,323
time.

220
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,290
I can really get lost in time when the
doctors are moved that part of your

221
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:11,760
brain, they took out a basic awareness of,

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,930
of time passing times, hearts. So when
I'm on the Yukon, I'm going for 10 days.

223
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,100
I kind of forget how many days
I've been out there. You know,

224
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,250
some of the racers are saying,
Oh, I've been out here six days.

225
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,460
I'm exhausted for me, I can't look back.

226
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,910
I can't think you know how long I've
been running cause I don't know.

227
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,803
Stay in the moment

228
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,990
because of that. She doesn't, she doesn't
know how tired she should feel. Huh?

229
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,760
Think about it. If you don't
know where you are in time,

230
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,740
you don't know how much further you
have to go, how far you've been.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,233
You just running,

232
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,840
you just hear in your footsteps and
that's it. I get a rhythm in my mind.

233
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,600
That's what I want to hear
with my feet. I go by rhythm.

234
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,260
I know the sound that my feet about
what an eight minute pace would be.

235
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,540
How my feet would say. Yeah.

236
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,220
So count half the beat for me.

237
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,320
You're a drummer here. Yeah.

238
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,590
And even with my breath into, oh,

239
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,720
this all breathing and
feet. Y'All go together.

240
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,990
[inaudible] smooth your seat, your
swimming and your gait move in your run.

241
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,130
So how does the breath
and the feet interact?

242
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,560
I just know him to press and to press out.

243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,803
Match my feet.

244
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,490
Let's get the rhythm. Yeah.

245
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,180
That's all I have to here. 28 hours.

246
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,340
That's what I want. It's
music. That's my music.

247
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,960
So nothing else in my mind.
I'll put my feet up, rhythm,

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,990
my breathing. That's the music, timber
and athletes here. That's the flow.

249
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,680
Thanks mark. Yeah, no
problem. Border Mark Phillips.
