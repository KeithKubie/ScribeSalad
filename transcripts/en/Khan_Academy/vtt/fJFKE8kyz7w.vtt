00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:01.122
Charlie: Sal Khan is here.

00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:02.630
He's the founder of Khanacademy.org.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.874
He provides 10-minute tutorials on the web

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:07.211
on everything from math
to science to finance.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.275
The Harvard MBA and
former hedge fund manager

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.943
has become an online teaching sensation.

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.550
His videos have been viewed

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.546
more than 50 million times worldwide.

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:18.197
They have been translated to
more than 7 different languages.

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:19.282
Here is a look.

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:22.289
Sal: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be 5.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.529
This animal's fossils are only found

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.216
in this are of South America,

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.525
a nice clean band here,

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.632
and this part of Africa.

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.100
We could integrate over the surface.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.779
The notation usually is a capital sigma.

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:36.694
National assembly, they create the

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.116
Committee of Public Safety,

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:39.748
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.792
Some cells have a membrane around the DNA.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.777
This is called a nucleus.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:49.023
Notice, this is an aldehyde
and it's an alcohol.

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:51.960
Start differentiating into
effector and memory cells.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.042
A galaxy!

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:54.241
Hey, there's another galaxy!

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.312
And for dollars is their 30 million

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.250
plus the 20 million dollars from

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.852
the American manufacturer.

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:03.716
If these things end up being
worth 30 cents on the dollar,

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.856
let's say that we go to some future state

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:07.297
and these really are worth only 30 cents,

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:09.542
the most that the private investor loses

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:12.394
in this situation is his 7 dollars.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:18.820
If this does not blow your
mind, then you have no emotion.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.347
Charlie: I am please to have Sal Khan

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:21.324
at this table for the first time.

00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:22.129
Welcome.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:23.114
Sal: Thanks for having me.

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:24.272
Charlie: So what am I just looking at?

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:26.136
Am I looking at someone who's
interested in everything

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.276
and has a passion to tell others?

00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:30.031
Sal: I think so.

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.616
Yeah, that's what I've
turned into. (laughing)

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:35.050
Charlie: What have you turned into?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.343
Sal: I've turned into someone,
I guess from my point of view,

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:41.179
who gets to, I started off with the math

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.351
and the physics and the
science and the economics,

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.289
stuff that I knew fairly
well from my background.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.254
Now I've turned into
someone who gets to learn

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:53.563
pretty much anything and
distill it down and teach it.

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:54.765
Charlie: You're learning new things,

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:56.369
assimilating them, distilling them,

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.230
and then teaching them.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.677
Sal: Yeah.

00:01:57.677 --> 00:02:01.659
Charlie: So give me the
background that you have.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.056
Sal: As you mentioned, 5-6 years ago

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:06.518
I was an analyst at a hedge fund.

00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:08.268
Before that my background was in software

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:11.433
then I went to business school,
did the hedge fund thing.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.188
I started in Boston, and
while I was in Boston

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.993
I had family visiting me from New Orleans.

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:16.884
This was right after my wedding.

00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:18.522
This was in 2004.

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:21.931
My cousin, Nadia, I
remember we were waiting

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.130
for the fireworks over the Charles River

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.376
and we were just killing time

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:26.787
and I started giving
her these brain teasers,

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:27.932
the type of brain teasers you'd give

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:31.800
at a software interview for
like 25-year-old engineerings.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.529
Most people just disengage,

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.275
"I don't want to deal with that.

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:36.549
"I don't want to think right now."

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.882
But Nadia, here's a
12-year-old, she was like,

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:38.746
"Don't tell me the answer.

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:39.802
"I need to figure it out.

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:41.017
"Okay, can they see each other?"

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.955
All these type of things
about the brain teaser.

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:45.802
I was pretty impressed.

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:47.047
I started telling her and her mother,

00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:47.777
"Hey, you should think about

00:02:47.777 --> 00:02:49.681
"becoming an engineer" or whatever.

00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.933
The next morning, her mom, [Noshradandie]

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:54.623
told me, thanks for believing in Nadia

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:56.227
but she's actually being tracked into

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:59.158
a slower math class,
the non-advanced track.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.299
I said that's impossible,
the stuff she was doing

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.032
yesterday is way beyond her.

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.426
She's clearly a bright girl.

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:07.514
She's like no, I think she
did bad on a placement exam.

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:10.165
So when Nadia woke up, I
said, "What's going on?"

00:03:10.165 --> 00:03:11.512
She said, no I ...

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:13.323
Apparently she had bombed units,

00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:16.053
converting gallons to quarts and all that.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:18.375
I said, Nadia, I understand
how that can be confusing,

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:20.069
but the stuff you were doing last night

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.378
was way deeper and way harder than units.

00:03:23.378 --> 00:03:24.504
If you're willing to work with me,

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.702
when you go back to New Orleans

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:27.054
and I'll stay here in Boston,

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:31.244
I think we can get you past
whatever hurdles you have.

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.714
She agreed and they went
back to New Orleans.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.870
Every day after work I would come home

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.530
and we'd get on the speakerphone

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.378
for about half an hour, an hour,

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:39.809
and I'd start working with her.

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.263
It worked out.

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:44.220
Two or three months, she got up to speed,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.521
went ahead of the curve.

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.625
Then I started tutoring her brothers,

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.535
other family members.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.750
Then you fast forward to 2006.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.834
About 18 months have gone by.

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:53.915
I was venting to a buddy,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:55.496
I was like, "This is a
lot of fun I'm having."

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.109
By this time I had
moved out to California.

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.737
I was like, "This is a lot of fun.

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:00.041
"It's really satisfying, but ..."

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.831
The first time you give a lecture

00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:03.589
on least common multiples,
it's kind of fun.

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:05.445
The second time, it's still
fun; a little more polished.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.654
The third time it starts to
get a little bit tiring to do!

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:10.503
He said ...

00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:11.440
Charlie: Do it one time.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.174
Sal: Do it one time.

00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:13.586
Why don't you put it on YouTube?

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.777
I said, "No, YouTube's
for dogs on scateboards.

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.377
"It's not for serious learning."

00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:21.591
Charlie: (laughing) That's true.

00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:25.142
Sal: Once I got over the
fact that it wasn't my idea,

00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:27.188
I decided to give it a shot.

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:28.339
I put it up there.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:30.335
Charlie: Now, which one
did you put up there?

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.419
Sal: It was either Least Common Multiple

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.064
or Greatest Common Divisor, I forget.

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:35.871
I think I did them on the
same day, that first day.

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:40.145
The cool thing about YouTube
is you an sort by upload time.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:41.303
So that first video you'd shown,

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:43.426
that was literally, that
was one of the early videos.

00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:44.358
I kind of cringed.

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:45.422
I was like, "Oh, that's
when I wasn't using

00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:46.722
"the fancy HD stuff."

00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:48.056
Yeah, it was on one of those topics.

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:49.126
Charlie: And the reaction?

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:50.520
Sal: You know what?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.496
I had about 20-30 up there,
my cousins' initial reaction,

00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:56.268
and I joke about this but it's true,

00:04:56.268 --> 00:04:58.385
is that they preferred me
on YouTube than in person!

00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:01.867
Charlie: (laughing)

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:03.998
Sal: I'll take that for what it's worth.

00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:05.326
It made sense.

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:06.960
Charlie: You need not come
to the next family gathering.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.849
Just send us ...

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.773
Sal: (laughs) Yeah, Sal
can be annoying sometimes.

00:05:12.773 --> 00:05:15.415
Charlie: When did it become Khan Academy?

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:19.566
Sal: You fast forward,
it soon became clear,

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:21.621
maybe in 6 months, even from the beginning

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.956
random people started watching it,

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.496
but then fast forward 6 months,

00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:25.992
I probably had 50 or 100 videos,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.975
and I started getting these random letters

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:29.328
from people, just on YouTube.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.386
If you look on YouTube,
people aren't always

00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:33.809
that civil on YouTube in
terms of what they write.

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.475
For the most part, everyone was writing,

00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:36.819
"Hey, thanks a bunch, this helped me."

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.773
Some people would write,

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:39.884
"I was going to flunk calculus
until I got this video."

00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:42.807
Or "I wasn't going to become an engineer

00:05:42.807 --> 00:05:43.965
"because I couldn't handle the course load

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:45.088
"until I saw that video on vectors"

00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:47.983
or whatever it might be.

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:49.993
It started to dawn on
me that this could be

00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:52.642
more than a hobby, although
it stayed a hobby right then.

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:56.248
I think the first time
Khan Academy came about,

00:05:56.248 --> 00:06:00.829
I think it was 2007, I
had decided to set up

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.164
my own domain name,
and so have another way

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.167
of viewing the videos.

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:05.537
I also started working on the software

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:06.951
for my cousins so I
could give them problems

00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.796
and give them exercises, and
I put it all on that site.

00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:11.184
I was working for a hedge fund

00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:13.578
called Wohl Capital and
my boss was Dan Wohl

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:15.213
and I said, "Well, I'm Sal Khan

00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:19.125
"so I'll call it Khan Academy."
(laughs)

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.307
Charlie: (laughs) What are your dreams?

00:06:20.307 --> 00:06:22.909
What do you want it to be?

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.616
Sal: I used to be kind
of quiet about this dream

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:28.039
because it seemed kind
of like a crazy thing.

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.614
Even last year it would have seemed crazy

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:32.164
for me to say what I'm about to say,

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:35.981
but now, I think there's a potential for-

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.371
Online learning, no one takes it ser-,

00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:40.191
They take it seriously,
they think it has value,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.614
but online learning is here

00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.955
and your prestigious
universities are over here.

00:06:44.955 --> 00:06:46.680
They're not in the same conversation.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.430
I'm hoping Khan Academy can
turn into an institution

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.111
that, I don't want to say rivals, but it's

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.291
talked in the same conversation
as some of these things

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.546
that have been around
for hundreds of years.

00:06:58.546 --> 00:06:59.796
Charlie: In the places
where you can learn.

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:01.294
Sal: In the places where you can learn

00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:03.172
at a very high level.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.418
So you can start at
arithmetic but you can go deep

00:07:05.418 --> 00:07:07.127
and it's a real learning experience,

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:08.582
it's not something superficial.

00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:10.123
Charlie: So how many
people work for you now?

00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:11.419
Sal: We have 8 people.

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:14.357
We just have 8, we had 6
if you'd asked last week.

00:07:14.357 --> 00:07:16.797
Charlie: So eventually
you will give diplomas?

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:18.669
Sal: That's an open question.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.130
If you focus just on K through 12,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.419
and our video content goes
well beyond K through 12,

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.072
but just on K through 12,
right now what really matters

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:30.042
is some of these standardized tests,

00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:33.790
the SATs, the AP tests,
high school diplomas,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.900
kids are getting into Harvard based

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.395
on just being home schooled right now.

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:41.066
We see our real niche right
now on the learning side.

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.671
Standard education's really
learning and credentialing.

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.083
We're going to tackle the
learning as well as we can.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.666
In the future, we'll see what we can do

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:48.530
on the credentialing side.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.128
Charlie: You've got a
remarkable group of people

00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:51.540
who believe what you're
doing; people from Google,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.044
Bill Gates and a lot of
others have cited you

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:56.505
for what you have done
and what you are doing.

00:07:56.505 --> 00:08:00.443
Is there any pushback from
what you have accomplished?

00:08:00.443 --> 00:08:04.917
Does anybody say, "Yes, but"?

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:10.292
Sal: My sense of the pushback is

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.457
sometimes these articles get written where

00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:14.900
the article itself is fairly
balanced and reasonable,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.155
but they'll title it
like "Will Khan Academy

00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:18.751
"Demolish Traditional Education?"

00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:20.312
Charlie: Where was this?

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:22.406
Sal: Oh, I don't know, I'm exaggerating.

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:24.358
There was one that recently came out,

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:26.983
will it flip the classroom,
or turn education upside down

00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:27.904
or something like that.

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:28.966
There are these headlines that are very

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.133
attention-grabbing.

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:32.047
I think when someone
reads that, they've become

00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:35.381
cynical about these panacea solutions

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.217
to a big problem, so
they might say oh, no,

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:39.491
there's no way that something like this

00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:40.982
could solve all of our problems.

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:42.624
For the most part, I think, when people

00:08:42.624 --> 00:08:43.652
understand what they're doing,

00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:45.758
we haven't gotten a lot of resistance.

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.322
Charlie: Who are the
people who are watching?

00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:50.458
Sal: That's the surprising
thing, who's watching.

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:52.389
When I started off, it was for my cousins.

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:55.956
I kind of just made them for my cousins,

00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:58.207
they wanted to learn,
I was there as kind of

00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:00.456
their big brother type figure,
so I was motivating them.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:03.274
Still, when I make the
videos, I'm kind of like,

00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:04.782
"Well, if I wanted to learn this subject,

00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:07.171
"what would I want, how would
I want it to be explained?"

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.622
I thought that it would
appeal to a certain

00:09:10.622 --> 00:09:14.115
subset of people, people who like to watch

00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:17.797
the Discovery Channel and
Charlie Rose and all the rest.

00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:18.620
Charlie: I'm hooked.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.568
Sal: (laughing) So I'm really focused on

00:09:22.568 --> 00:09:24.922
the intuition and the
going deep and showing

00:09:24.922 --> 00:09:26.365
how it connects and all of these things

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.394
that sometimes get lost in
some textbooks in some classes.

00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:30.764
The surprising thing is I get letters from

00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:33.734
that group of people, but I do get letters

00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:36.452
from parents of students
with learning disabilities,

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:41.868
kids who were otherwise
disengaged from math class

00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:42.920
or from school generally,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.859
and then over here they all
of a sudden discover a love.

00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:46.791
Charlie: That is the
most important question

00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:48.701
to come out of the conversation
between the two of us.

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:50.858
What is it you know, what is it you do

00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:56.330
that somehow makes
learning more attractive,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.619
more interesting, more
satisfying and more productive?

00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:04.039
Sal: I don't know that I
definitely have "the" answer.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.283
I have guesses.

00:10:05.283 --> 00:10:06.063
Charlie: Guess for me.

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:09.901
Sal: I started off
making it for my cousins.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.479
I kind of didn't care.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.123
I was kind of like this liberated person.

00:10:14.123 --> 00:10:15.649
If someone had told me in 2004,

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.912
"I'm going to give you a
couple million dollars.

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:19.541
"Produce something that's going to reach

00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:21.538
"millions of people and Bill
Gates is going to watch it"

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.535
and all the rest,

00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.204
I probably would have
produced something different.

00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:25.618
I probably would have
gotten fancy lighting

00:10:25.618 --> 00:10:28.208
and put some makeup on and
got some computer graphics,

00:10:28.208 --> 00:10:30.944
and probably produced a lot
of the education material

00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:32.387
that's already out there.

00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:33.398
These computer graphics,

00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:36.422
"The next stage of
photosynthesis is when the ..."

00:10:36.422 --> 00:10:37.923
But I think the reality is,

00:10:37.923 --> 00:10:40.122
that's what we all assume is good content,

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:42.061
but when someone watches
it, it's so dehumanizing.

00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:43.458
You kind of check out.

00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:44.865
That's not talking to me.

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.845
When I made it, it was
literally just me in a room,

00:10:47.845 --> 00:10:49.075
people can tell, it's just some dude,

00:10:49.075 --> 00:10:51.535
he's not getting paid, he's
making it for his cousins,

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:53.922
so they can tell there's
a human element to it.

00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:56.348
They can tell that, a
lot of times when people

00:10:56.348 --> 00:10:58.735
are trying to get people
engaged into math,

00:10:58.735 --> 00:11:00.268
they try to distract them.

00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:02.264
They'll do like a rap song or
they'll play all this music,

00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:03.806
and I think people find that patronizing.

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:05.196
They're like, look, don't distract me.

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:06.866
If math is good, it should be able

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.348
to stand up on its own.

00:11:08.348 --> 00:11:09.534
Charlie: That's exactly what I believe

00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:10.426
about this show.

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:10.969
Same thing.

00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:12.287
It's a black room.

00:11:12.287 --> 00:11:15.938
Just a conversation
between interesting people.

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:17.560
That's all it is.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.608
That's what people want.

00:11:18.608 --> 00:11:20.108
They don't want a lot
of bells and whistles.

00:11:20.108 --> 00:11:21.066
Sal: No, you're insulting people.

00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:22.376
If you have bells and
whistles it's meaning

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:23.350
it's not worth watching.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:25.282
Charlie: Sal Khan is a
very interesting person.

00:11:25.282 --> 00:11:26.070
If you don't know about him,

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.121
you'll learn a whole lot here.

00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.372
This kind of conversation

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:33.073
will penetrate that veil of complexity;

00:11:33.073 --> 00:11:36.754
and give you a channel
to access complexity.

00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:38.282
Sal: I wholeheartedly agree.

00:11:38.282 --> 00:11:40.157
Maybe I was subconsciously
inspired by you.

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:41.075
Charlie: No, you weren't.

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:41.868
But it is the same idea.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.461
When I hear you say it, I realize

00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:44.975
that's exactly the way we approach,

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:46.207
that's my mindset as well.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:51.439
What's the hardest thing about this?

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:53.042
24 hours in a day?

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:53.991
Sal: 24 hours in a day.

00:11:53.991 --> 00:11:55.732
I think now the hardest thing is,

00:11:55.732 --> 00:11:57.711
I really want me to be all about

00:11:57.711 --> 00:11:59.407
continuing to make videos.

00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:03.361
I want most of my day, the
learning and the producing.

00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:04.682
Charlie: But, what?

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.261
Sal: But, and this is
another interesting thing

00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.832
about Khan Academy, because
I've put these videos out there

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.986
and people watch them, I'm
kind of associated with them.

00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:19.264
I can use that as a platform
to engage in the discussion,

00:12:19.264 --> 00:12:21.369
however you want to view it.

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:23.067
I still think my biggest role,

00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:25.469
and probably the highest
leverage for my time,

00:12:25.469 --> 00:12:26.164
are those videos.

00:12:26.164 --> 00:12:29.462
Even though those videos,
that video on line integrals

00:12:29.462 --> 00:12:31.338
in the first week might only be watched by

00:12:31.338 --> 00:12:33.893
a few hundred people,
I think over the next

00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:37.664
hundred years, that'll be a big impact.

00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:39.955
Charlie: Do people come
to you all the time

00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:41.837
and say, "We can monetize this"?

00:12:41.837 --> 00:12:43.792
Sal: They used to.

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:47.740
About 2 or 3 years ago, when
Khan Academy had gotten to-,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.462
kind of people started to know about it,

00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:52.048
but I still had my day
job at the hedge fund,

00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:55.151
a couple of VCs approached,
hey, we could do a double

00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:58.341
bottom-line hybrid model,
a fremium or whatever,

00:12:58.341 --> 00:12:59.688
I don't know, all these things.

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:01.920
Actually I got to meeting
two with one of them.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.977
Meeting one was a lot of
fun because they're like

00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:06.521
hey, you can make a salary to do this

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.312
and if it all works out
you're going to be rich

00:13:08.312 --> 00:13:09.020
and all of that.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.252
But meeting two was let's
focus on this market

00:13:11.252 --> 00:13:12.596
because we can monetize this.

00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:19.747
I was like, "No, but I feel
like doing Civil War videos."

00:13:19.747 --> 00:13:21.374
I said no, I can't,
because it was too much fun

00:13:21.374 --> 00:13:28.965
to give up the fun part of
it regardless of the upside.

00:13:28.965 --> 00:13:30.499
Even though I didn't know what a nonprofit

00:13:30.499 --> 00:13:32.744
would entail to start and how do you raise

00:13:32.744 --> 00:13:34.226
money for it or anything,
that's where it became clear

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:35.673
that, no, I wanted it to be a ...

00:13:35.673 --> 00:13:37.015
I was like, what are
all these universities?

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:37.723
Oh, they're not-for-profits?

00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:38.916
I want to be a not-for-profit, too.

00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:39.837
Charlie: So that's what you've become?

00:13:39.837 --> 00:13:40.611
Sal: That's what we've become.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:41.630
Charlie: So you get a lot of money

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.677
from people like Gates or
John Doerr or Ann Doerr

00:13:44.677 --> 00:13:47.047
and people like that who believe
in what you do and say ...

00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:50.414
Sal: Yeah. Ann and John
were the first, literally,

00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:53.048
I'd quit my job in 2009 and the savings

00:13:53.048 --> 00:13:57.900
started to go like this and
it was Ann in particular

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.293
who really stepped up and
allowed me to get a first salary

00:14:02.293 --> 00:14:03.731
and then Google and Bill Gates

00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:06.016
and everyone else started to get involved.

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:08.348
Charlie: Take a tangent
from you for a second.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:13.418
What's wrong with the way we teach?

00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:15.050
Sal: More than the way
we teach, I think it's

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.319
a systemic thing of how
the school is structured.

00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:23.081
Right now you have, you and I were sitting

00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:25.055
in algebra class, pre-albegra class,

00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:28.842
and they're going over negative numbers.

00:14:28.842 --> 00:14:30.899
Maybe you get a 95% on the exam.

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.534
You feel good about yourself.

00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:34.905
You can an A stamped on
your forehead or whatever.

00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:39.503
Let's say I get a 70%, it's a C or a D.

00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:41.032
There's an assessment and it does identify

00:14:41.032 --> 00:14:42.912
that I have big weaknesses.

00:14:42.912 --> 00:14:44.570
You have even some weaknesses.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.873
You had a 95%, so there's
still 5% you didn't know.

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:48.631
Negative numbers is a core thing.

00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:49.912
You need to know that really well.

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:52.081
Despite that, the whole class then moves

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:53.645
to the next concept and builds on it.

00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:55.033
They assume that everyone had mastery

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.588
when they've just shown that no one does.

00:14:56.588 --> 00:14:59.051
You keep marching everyone down that path

00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:02.158
and people just keep having
gaps in their knowledge.

00:15:02.158 --> 00:15:03.531
What you have is when you get to,

00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:05.621
and we've all seen this with ourseleves,

00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:09.287
family members, everyone
hits a certain math class

00:15:09.287 --> 00:15:10.955
or a certain science class
where they hit a wall;

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:13.196
where all of a sudden that
A student or that B student

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:15.250
just starts flunking, they just can't-

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.209
They have good teachers
and they're trying to study

00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:19.266
and they're hitting
their head against a wall

00:15:19.266 --> 00:15:20.830
and it's because they
have all of these gaps.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.580
Once you're in algebra
class, there's no way

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.551
to identify the gap in fourth grade,

00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:26.784
or identify the gap in pre-algebra.

00:15:26.784 --> 00:15:28.376
Or once you're in calculus, there's no way

00:15:28.376 --> 00:15:29.717
to identify that algebra gap.

00:15:29.717 --> 00:15:31.381
I think that that's the problem.

00:15:31.381 --> 00:15:32.744
No matter how good a teacher you have,

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:34.696
you have just a weak foundation.

00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:36.546
Charlie: This is Fortune, August 24:

00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:38.193
"His low-tech, conversational tutorials,

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:40.832
"Khan's face never appears
and viewers see only

00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:43.161
"his unadorned step-by-step
doodles and diagrams

00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:46.212
"on an electronic
blackboard, more than merely

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:47.929
"another example of
viral medial distributed

00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.397
"at negligible cost to the universe,

00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:51.676
"Khan Academy holds the
promise of virtual school,

00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:54.689
"an educational transformation
that de-emphasizes

00:15:54.689 --> 00:15:57.066
"classrooms, campus and
administrative infrastructure

00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:58.797
"and even brand-name instructors.

00:15:58.797 --> 00:16:00.989
"Quick, free and easy to understand.

00:16:00.989 --> 00:16:03.848
"Khan has his skeptics in
the education business.

00:16:03.848 --> 00:16:05.960
"They don't doubt he means
well and is helping students,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.692
"but they question the broad impact

00:16:07.692 --> 00:16:09.864
"of any tutorial that
doesn't test performance

00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:12.785
"or allow student-teacher discussion."

00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:14.130
Is that a point?

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.931
Sal: It's a point. (laughing)

00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:18.037
As all points are.

00:16:18.037 --> 00:16:18.978
Charlie: Nothing more; it's a point!

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:19.894
Sal: It is a point.

00:16:19.894 --> 00:16:22.069
Charlie: Everybody's
entitled to a opinion.

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:23.168
Sal: Or more!

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:25.397
Charlie: Maybe two, three.

00:16:25.397 --> 00:16:26.396
Sal: Maybe two or three.

00:16:26.396 --> 00:16:30.607
To rebut that last point
is that that's exactly why

00:16:30.607 --> 00:16:33.172
we have the videos and
I keep making videos.

00:16:33.172 --> 00:16:34.683
But as soon as we got funding, that little

00:16:34.683 --> 00:16:36.815
simple software that I started building

00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:39.284
for my cousins to measure what they knew

00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:40.358
and what they didn't know.

00:16:40.358 --> 00:16:41.526
That's why we started building it

00:16:41.526 --> 00:16:42.457
into this exercise platform.

00:16:42.457 --> 00:16:45.485
I think over time, the
videos will always be

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:46.752
a big part of Khan Academy,

00:16:46.752 --> 00:16:49.066
but this exercise piece
where students start

00:16:49.066 --> 00:16:50.733
at 1+1, it keeps generating
problems for them

00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:53.816
until they can master a
concept, and only then

00:16:53.816 --> 00:16:55.152
move on to the next concept.

00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:56.972
That's going to become a
bigger and bigger piece of it.

00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:58.867
So, to rebut that, no, we
are doing the assessment

00:16:58.867 --> 00:16:59.999
and the feedback.

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.069
Charlie: Do you see it as supplementary

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:04.567
to the process of education or a main line

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:07.669
in the process of education?

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:11.420
Sal: We view ourselves as in the beginning

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.463
of this process, and I've
been at it 4 or 5 years.

00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:16.010
As an organization we've only
been at it 6 or 7 months.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.505
Our goal is that with Khan Academy alone,

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:23.248
if there's a student in Kolkata, they need

00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:25.554
an internet connection so
that's a gating factor,

00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:28.592
but if they're there, they
can get a pretty solid

00:17:28.592 --> 00:17:31.047
grounding in a lot of
different subject areas,

00:17:31.047 --> 00:17:32.830
especially ones that
are meaningful to them

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.207
that they can use to progress.

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:37.334
But, we think it can also
be the operating system

00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:38.942
of what happens in the classroom to really

00:17:38.942 --> 00:17:42.828
liberate what happens
inside of a classroom.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.416
Charlie: How many of
them do you do yourself?

00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:47.814
Sal: I've produced all the videos.

00:17:47.814 --> 00:17:48.642
Charlie: That's what I thought.

00:17:48.642 --> 00:17:49.640
Sal: I'm the faculty

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.807
Charlie: You are the faculty of one, yeah.

00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:52.266
Sal: Our meetings are
very non-bureaucratic.

00:17:52.266 --> 00:17:53.862
Charlie: Let's assume you're interested

00:17:53.862 --> 00:17:55.503
in Napoleon and in the French Revolution.

00:17:55.503 --> 00:17:57.309
What do you do?

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.836
How to do you prepare?

00:17:58.836 --> 00:18:01.799
What's the process of going from

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.724
"I'm curious about Napoleon" to

00:18:03.724 --> 00:18:06.205
"This is what I have to teach you.

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:09.666
"This is your access to understand
this moment in history"?

00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:12.333
Sal: Once again, I approach it from

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.950
what my brain would like to see.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.817
For me, in history in particular,

00:18:17.817 --> 00:18:20.283
I don't feel like I got
this in the history books,

00:18:20.283 --> 00:18:21.231
and even now when I prepare,

00:18:21.231 --> 00:18:23.023
I'm not getting it from the
history books on my shelf,

00:18:23.023 --> 00:18:24.734
I like to see a scaffold.

00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:25.660
I like to see a map.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.182
What is a Holy Roman Empire?

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.357
What is that now?

00:18:29.357 --> 00:18:30.355
Charlie: How they got to an empire.

00:18:30.355 --> 00:18:31.937
Sal: What are these things?

00:18:31.937 --> 00:18:33.122
People can just keep referring to them,

00:18:33.122 --> 00:18:34.142
but if I can't ...

00:18:34.142 --> 00:18:38.652
So what I do is, for
history, I immerse myself

00:18:38.652 --> 00:18:40.321
in it as much as possible.

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:41.289
I usually read Wikipedia entry first,

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:42.592
just to get the scaffold.

00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:43.372
Charlie: Same thing I do.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.200
I go for the scaffold myself.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.259
Sal: Get the scaffold and-

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:47.176
Charlie: Just as a learning experience.

00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:47.888
Sal: Just as a learning experience.

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:48.723
Charlie: I want to see where it fits.

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:50.558
I want to see the geography of the place.

00:18:50.558 --> 00:18:51.942
What does it look like?

00:18:51.942 --> 00:18:55.080
Sal: The beauty, also
Wikipedia, if I find cool maps

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.367
along the way, I copy and paste.

00:18:56.367 --> 00:18:57.689
I make sure they're in the public domain.

00:18:57.689 --> 00:19:00.819
I copy and paste, stick it on my little

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:02.361
blackboard art program.

00:19:02.361 --> 00:19:04.614
Sometimes I'll draw out a timeline

00:19:04.614 --> 00:19:07.398
just to make sure that
I get the years right.

00:19:07.398 --> 00:19:08.675
But the main thing I do,

00:19:08.675 --> 00:19:10.358
whether it's history of
chemistry or anything,

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.143
is get the scaffold and
then really immerse myself

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.751
for however long it takes.

00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:18.028
Then make sure that I can make

00:19:18.028 --> 00:19:20.695
intuitive connections between
everything that happens.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:23.261
Charlie: What's that,
an intuitive connection?

00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:27.015
Sal: Understand why something,

00:19:27.015 --> 00:19:28.683
if I'm doing it on the neuron,

00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:32.676
a biology book will tell you the signal

00:19:32.676 --> 00:19:35.105
goes across because
there's a myelin sheath.

00:19:35.105 --> 00:19:37.127
I'm like, yeah, but how
does putting a little

00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:39.291
tissue around a neuron, how does it make

00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:41.518
the signal go faster?

00:19:41.518 --> 00:19:43.634
No biology book will tell you that answer.

00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:45.631
I'd kind of ponder it a bit,

00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:46.749
and then, you know, it's kind of like

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:50.018
a fiberoptic system and
one's kind of amplifying

00:19:50.018 --> 00:19:51.458
the signal, but you amplify too-

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.212
Then I'd call up some buddies,

00:19:53.212 --> 00:19:54.379
who are either biologists

00:19:54.379 --> 00:19:57.725
or communications engineers or whatever,

00:19:57.725 --> 00:19:58.661
I'll say, "Does this make sense?"

00:19:58.661 --> 00:19:59.983
They're like, "No, I think you're right."

00:19:59.983 --> 00:20:03.408
It's a big deal for me,
if I'm doing biology,

00:20:03.408 --> 00:20:05.573
why does the myelin sheath
make the signal go faster?

00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:09.322
If it's history, why did
this artillery captain

00:20:09.322 --> 00:20:10.797
all of a sudden come to power?

00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:12.562
Weren't there other people around?

00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:16.929
These obvious questions are
important for me to answer.

00:20:16.929 --> 00:20:19.278
What's really cool is
sometimes you call a buddy

00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:20.453
and you're like, "I know you're
going to think I'm stupid

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:22.705
"when I ask you this and
you're probably going to think

00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:23.974
"I have no business making a video on this

00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:25.261
"considering I'm asking you this question,

00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.098
"but why does the Sarcoplasmic reticulum

00:20:27.098 --> 00:20:29.120
"release these ions when this happens?"

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.675
They're like, "You know
what, we don't know."

00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:34.151
I'm like why doesn't
the book tell me that?

00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:35.855
Everyone would like it better.

00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:37.780
Charlie: What do your former colleagues

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.438
at the hedge fund say?

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:41.802
Sal: They're super happy about it.

00:20:41.802 --> 00:20:44.474
My last boss told me, "Hey, if I knew you

00:20:44.474 --> 00:20:48.680
"were going to do this, I wouldn't
have hired you." (laughing)

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.618
Charlie: It's great to find something

00:20:51.618 --> 00:20:53.116
that you have great passion for

00:20:53.116 --> 00:20:55.838
and involve learning yourself.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.131
Sal: I think I've subconsciously
been inspired by you.

00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:00.744
Years ago, I was just, "Charlie
Rose got the best job."
