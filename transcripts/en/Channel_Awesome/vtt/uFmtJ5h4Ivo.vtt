00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.880
Riding high with the success of "Snow White" and "Pinocchio," it's interesting that Disney decided to do something one-hundred percent different for their third film.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.040
"Fantasia" doesn't have a narrative story.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.980
Hell, it doesn't even have any dialogue apart from the host.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.060
It's just an experiment of taking classical music and combining it with great Disney animation.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.580
It's not one story, it's several stories.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.840
And half the time, they're not even really stories.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.720
The opening is just a collection of abstract imagery that goes along with the music.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.860
Like what your mind might be thinking when hearing it for the first time.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220
And I friggin' love it.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.940
It's not just one of my favorite Disney films; it's one of my favorite films, period.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.780
Remember what I was saying before about emotional simplicity?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.400
You could argue that this is the film that masters it.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.740
Whereas I describe both "Snow White" and "Pinocchio" as emotional stories, this is what I like to call an emotional experience.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.600
It's not based on narrative as much as moments.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.900
And life is made up of very unique moments, so I don't think there's really any problem in putting them together in a movie.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.220
Especially if they do get an emotional response.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.800
Sometimes, it creates a confusing response.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
Like the one with the dinosaurs. I never know how to feel watching that.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.040
Sometimes they're threatening, sometimes they're cute.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.540
And then, through the course of the piece, they're just gone.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.420
I remember as a kid, I had no idea what to think of that.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.440
It's just sort of something that happened, and you draw your own conclusions.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
Some definitely do have a flowing narrative, like the most famous one, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice."

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.160
This is actually how the film came about; Disney just wanted to make this short with Mickey Mouse as a magician.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.120
But as the expenses for it got bigger and bigger, they finally just shrugged and said, "Hey why don't we a couple of these and just turn it into a flick?"

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.800
The result is some booming, fantastic music with some booming, fantastic animation.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.080
I think sometimes, just the falling of leaves can be so much more powerful than the emotional conflict that a character is going through.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.440
If the film is done right, it can suck you into something so simple, and yet so oddly profound.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.580
And Disney animators were great at that.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.520
They could find the ballet, the movement, the music, anything that was poetic in...well, really anything.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.080
Even just the changing of seasons.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.480
I've stated this before, but my absolute favorite is the ending.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.000
Both "A Night on Bald Mountain" and the "Ave Maria."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.760
Even if you don't have a religious background, just the very basic emotional levels they have here are really high.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.000
The contrast in putting these two together is just brilliant.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.360
And the belief in something much darker than you can imagine, or more inspiring than you can imagine, is definitely there.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.300
Disney wanted to do a lot more of these, and have this be a continuing film series.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.920
But sadly, the film didn't make the money that it needed.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.080
Oh, it made a lot of money. It was like the second or third highest-grossing film that year.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.740
But it didn't matter.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.820
The film cost a fortune to make, and financially, it just didn't make sense to make any more.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.500
They did make one sequel years later, though we'll get to that when we come around to it.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.540
For this film, though, "Fantasia" is a powerhouse of art.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.300
In fact, it's actually like going to an art museum.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.800
Except with motion and music.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.740
As you can imagine, though, it's not as geared for kids as the other Disney flicks.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.360
There's nothing really troubling or bad about it that kids can't watch. I remember watching "Bald Mountain" fine when I was younger.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.600
But with the exception of maybe "Sorcerer's Apprentice," there's nothing here that's immediately geared towards them.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.800
This was the animated Disney film almost strictly for adults.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.420
And while kids could watch it, it wasn't exactly their film.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.500
It was more for the grown-ups, and those who love it really love it.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.120
And it still continues to be one of my faves.
