00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.080
Hi, I'm Brian Naughton. I'm, I'm a

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.330
scientist at 23andMe and I'm from Dublin, Ireland.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.220
&gt;&gt; So after dropping the DNA sample in the mail, we don't see anything until

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.120
we get to our results. what happens to that sample once we drop it in

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.650
the mail? Where does it go? Where does it end up? So your sample actually

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.170
gets shipped to our lab in Los Angeles

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.490
where it gets processed. There are four major

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.430
components to that. It starts with

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.240
DNA extraction, then amplicfication of the DNA,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.000
then hybridization, and finally analysis of the data to make sure it's good.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, great about how long does that process take to do all those steps?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.330
&gt;&gt; So if you take all of the steps, and you did

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.640
them end to end, it would probably take three days or so.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.661
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:50.640
&gt;&gt; A lot of the process is just waiting for the equipment to become

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.100
available because of volume.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.140
&gt;&gt; I see. What, of all those sort of four processes,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.308
which of those is the most time intensive of all of them?

00:00:59.308 --> 00:01:03.781
&gt;&gt; The most time-intensive is the hybridization stuff, which happens

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:08.140
overnight. Amplification also happens overnight, though. So there are two major

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.540
parts where we have to leave the DNA for a

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.250
while, and come back to it, so it has time to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.690
&gt;&gt; about

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.450
what what, I mean I'm curious. What's the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.730
most expensive part of the Of the process.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.470
&gt;&gt; So that the chip and the reagents are going to be expensive part

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.180
of the process. I mean, by the chip, you also get the reagents that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.150
sort of like the chemicals that you need to run the chip. the other expensive

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.590
components are probably labor, obviously, because we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.360
actually need to hire what's called high-complexity

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.890
staff to run our process. It's a CLS staff.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.210
and then the, the rest is actually fairly inexpensive.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.670
&gt;&gt; What are the are there

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.140
any international restrictions, like obviously I'm, I'm

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.750
guessing if the lab time only takes, you know, like you said, three days,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.300
but, you know, longer if you're processing multiple samples. You know, it should

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480
take a lot longer for any international

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.010
people, who want to have this service done?

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.460
&gt;&gt; So the lab process

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.880
doesn't take longer, obviously the shipping is an issue

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.590
and shipping can be expensive if you're coming from Asia

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.820
to California that's part of the reason why we want

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.900
to add another lab actually just to help with that.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.420
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.260
&gt;&gt; There's also issues with exporting DNA from certain

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.320
countries, so China and India specifically have laws around

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.120
what DNA you are allowed to export out of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.080
that country. So that, that plus other regulations regarding

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.610
biological specimens mean that it's actually quite difficult

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.630
to add another country to our list of countries.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.870
&gt;&gt; Tell us a bit more aboutthe

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.070
DNA extraction step. What actually happens, you get

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.360
the, the DNA or the saliva sample in the lab, what do you do to get

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.450
the DNA out? DNA extraction is a very, you know normal thing that happens in

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.450
labs all over the world. There's nothing special

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.150
about who, how we do our DNA extraction.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.640
But the process is really trying to separate the DNA in the nucleus of the cell

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.100
from the proteins and other components of the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.660
cell that other wise be in the way.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.770
&gt;&gt; I see, and how much DNA do you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.420
get out of the saliva sample that someone sends in?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.130
&gt;&gt; It's actually very variable. So depending on the person we can

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.610
get anywhere from ten micrograms to over a hundred micrograms of DNA.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.150
&gt;&gt; And does most of

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.390
that variation happen just based on the number of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.250
cells that were in that spit sample or saliva

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.250
sample? We think so, but we actually don't have

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.290
very good information on that. We know that some

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.700
people's saliva is more watery than other people, and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.680
we know that, for example, infants do not often

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.960
give us good data, and we think that's partially

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.700
because of the wateriness of the, of that saliva.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.090
&gt;&gt; Well, for those people who might be wondering, you know,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.400
what kinds of cells do you actually getting in, in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.570
my spit? What, what, what, what are the actual cells that

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.450
And the and white blood cells are the other major component.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.560
&gt;&gt; Now, I, I do floss and brush my teeth, but I know that I'm sure I have some

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.810
kind of bacteria or germs in there. Even still is that a concern at

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.110
all, worrying about sort of having other non-me

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.610
DNA in my spit sample? Again, it's not something

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.350
we worry about too much. We know that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.030
people have a lot of bacteria in their mouths,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.770
and we know that from person to person there's a huge variability

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.760
in the composition of those bacteria. But for amplification we are happy

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.730
to amplify up all of your human and bacterial DNA. And then

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.250
let the sequencing or genotyping process sort out the human from the bacterium.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.730
&gt;&gt; I see. So, as long as it's human it's good. But does that mean, like,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.880
I, you know I shouldn't go kiss anybody right before I, I, I give my DNA sample?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.790
&gt;&gt; For the 23andMe

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.550
test, we actually collect two milliliters of saliva from you. Which

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.040
doesn't sound like a lot, but it can take up to

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.520
five to 10 minutes to fill that. That's a lot of

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.255
saliva. You have to be kissing a lot to make a difference.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.255
&gt;&gt;

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:19.150
[LAUGH]

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.890
So when you finish the first step, the DNA extraction, you essentially have

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.068
taken our sample and like you said, sort of purified the DNA from

00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:27.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.090
gotten rid of all the other stuff, the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.230
proteins, the other molecules that might be part

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.010
of cells and other kinds of contaminants. And

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.310
you pretty much have just a purified DNA product.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.150
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.710
&gt;&gt; Now is, is that enough already to do what you

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.670
want to do with it or what do you have to do next?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.850
&gt;&gt; Not really. It's common in many situations like this to want to amplify the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.770
DNA. So you always want to give yourself

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.410
the best opportunity to sequence what's in there.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.550
And the easiest way to do that is to take

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.360
the DNA you got and amplify it or copy it

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.130
as many times as you can so that you just

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.050
have enough signal that you make it easy on yourself.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.400
&gt;&gt; I see. So when you say you're, you're amplifying or you're,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.260
you're making copies I mean, are you controlling kind of how many copies

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.550
you make or you just, you know, you're making like ten more,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.420
20 more, you know, 100 more? How does that work? It's not tightly

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.700
controlled, but, in essence, at the end of the process, you end up with a

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.250
thousandfold enrichment of the DNA. So you really end up with a lot more DNA.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.650
&gt;&gt; So, do you end up with DNA leftover? You know, after

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.630
you're done with the procedure, you actually have leftover DNA for, for people?

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.260
&gt;&gt; Sometimes, we do. but usually, we store your DNA in its

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.330
In the saliva form, so that we're going back to the original copy.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.070
One issue with amplification is that, every time you

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.630
copy just like in DNA replication in humans, there

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.060
is a possibility for error. So those errors could

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.685
compound if you keep copying the copy. Just like Xeroxing

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:55.915
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.189
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.490
&gt;&gt; Now, we have our extracted DNA sample that's

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.580
been amplified, so we have enough of our sample

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.950
to do something with. are we ready to go

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.510
sequence it now? Is that what we're going to do?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.930
&gt;&gt; So, the process that your DNA undergoes at 23andME is

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.710
a little different to sequencing. It's called chip hybridization or genotyping.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.110
&gt;&gt; And so, how does this differ from sequencing? What's the difference

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.000
between sequencing, and sort of, what

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.040
you mentioned as sort of chip hybridization

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.360
for, for genotyping? So, if you can think of

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.590
sequencing as just reading the genome from beginning to

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.320
end almost, you want to know every single letter and

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.570
what it is. With genotyping we actually decide beforehand, which

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.940
parts of the genome, which letters are interesting to

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.740
us, and then we specifically look at those letters

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.630
with the knowledge that, these are the letters that

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.180
maybe cause diseases or are associated with Some trait that

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.550
we have.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.470
&gt;&gt; I see. So you have to actually put a lot of

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.720
thought into it before hand as to sort of know exactly which positions,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.218
which bases, which letters your interested in. How many letters, do you

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:03.875
actually or how many bases do you look at in an individual sample?

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.865
&gt;&gt; So we look at about a million on the current

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:07.610
[UNKNOWN]

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.060
chip. that means that, when you get your results back from us,

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.550
you can download a million different calls, or base pairs from us.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.210
&gt;&gt; Sequencing sounds like it gives you a lot

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:23.950
more information. what are the prohibitive aspects of sequencing? Why

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.750
doesn't 23andMe do sequencing? Yeah, sequencing is definitely the future

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.679
of this field and we, we're definitely interested in sequencing

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.360
when it gets cheap enough. But the main advantage of

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.090
genotyping is cost. so we know that to get the same

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.620
results that we get with the 23andMe chip we would have

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.570
to charge at least ten times more with the sequencing product.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.380
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.430
&gt;&gt; Probably a lot more.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.085
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:53.890
&gt;&gt; Genotyping has other advantages as well. We, because

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.350
you genotype using the process of hybridization, you actually get

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.690
a lot of different shots on go, if you

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.800
like. You get to hybridize different molecules many times

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.660
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And you get the, the sum of all of those, or

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.390
the, the average of all of those weeds. You get a lot of

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.760
information compiled into one data point.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.860
With sequencing, you might actually miss the

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.180
part of the genome you were interested in, and that could be a problem.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.410
&gt;&gt; I see. So, in a way, you kind of

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.480
have higher confidence, even though you have maybe

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.840
more limited information in the end. You, you

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.880
have a higher confidence about the actual, you

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.030
know, letter or base result for that position.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.850
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And some people describe genotyping as almost like

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.780
single based sequencing, where we're sequence, we're sequencing hundreds of

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.480
thousands of molecules on each part of the chip. So

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.060
there's an advantage there that's hard to replicate in sequencing.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.470
&gt;&gt; Tell us a bit more

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.050
about how this sort of chip piratization works for people who are unfamiliar. I

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.690
hear chip, and I. Well, sometimes I think potato chip. But I know in this case,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.710
we're probably talking about something more like maybe a computer chip. How does

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:07.600
this work exactly? Yeah, so the chip is really a glass slide that contains

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.840
an array of DNA. And those, and the DNA is bound to glass beads,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.090
that are, scattered, on a, on a regular

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.940
pattern on the, on the chip. So then that

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.680
DNA is designed by us. To bind to the

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.860
parts of the genome we're interested in, it's the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.750
process I talked about a minute ago, and it

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.410
comes together through the process of base pairing, just

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.870
like double helix base pairing. And then either you

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.980
have, let's say an a at postion The position

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.450
we're interested in, or a g. And depending

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.730
on which of those two you have, will either

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.710
light up green or light up red on the chip, at a specific position on the chip.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.020
&gt;&gt; I see, so you essentially have sort of a

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.520
discreet, or quantum unit, for every little DNA molecule that

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.790
you're testing, you get a little signal that says, oh

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.820
you have an a or you have a g here.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.120
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And because humans are deployed, you'll also get situations

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.370
where you have A and G, one from mother, one from father. So then, what we

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.065
see at that position on the chip is red and green or kind of a yellow

00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:12.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's really clever. So that, and it

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.382
allows you to easily distinguish any given position that you're

00:11:18.382 --> 00:11:21.020
looking at. Yeah, so when we get the data

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.040
at 23andMe we actually can plot it on a simple

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:31.080
xy plot with red on the y axis and green on the sorry, on the x axis. And then

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.120
we'll see three clusters of people who are AA,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.110
AG and GG because those are the three possible situations.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.140
for disposition in your genome. Then we can say, well if you're in

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.470
this cluster, its because of the process

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.190
called clustering, and you're AG, and if

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.100
your in this cluster, then you're AA. So there's a kind of a simple

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.580
analysis problem at the end of the, at the end of the output there.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.830
&gt;&gt; I see it sounds like you're

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.180
actually using sort of, the information from pooled

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.230
set of individuals, that you know, you're sort

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.250
of looking, and So even though an individual

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.050
call maybe difficult to know where on that graph

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.520
you're, you're placed. If you use sequestering like you said,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.840
you can more readily identify. Oh, you're part of

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.750
this group. So you're AA, not AG kind of thing.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.980
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And there are also situations you can imagine

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.660
where we get even more information, so, you could imagine a situation where

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.280
you have a deletion of the part of the geneome we're interested

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.235
in. Then what you will see is a new cluster another cluster of

00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:29.340
[UNKNOWN]

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.000
three with lower intensity because there is less signal there because there

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.720
are fewer DNA molecules. So then a new cluster could emerge and

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.020
it could be as infrequent as one in thousand people or one

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.032
in hundred thousand people. But we will see a nucleus of samples there.

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:48.130
&gt;&gt; Now, in, in lesson two of, of

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.390
our course, we actually talked about the first time

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.610
there about the idea of base pairing. And

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.720
we learned about the base pairing rules and, and

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.020
how things fit together. but what I find really

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.490
interesting is the idea that in, in a double stranded

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.810
DNA, you know, you have all these letters matching with

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.370
each other. Is, is what you're telling is the idea

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.870
that a single nucleotide variant is just one letter

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.670
change here? That if one letter doesn't match, that essentially

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.940
what's happening is that, the, the strand can't actually hybridize

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.190
completely. It can't base pair completely, and that's why you,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.910
you don't see the signal for one, but you

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.320
do for another? Is that, essentially what''s going on?

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.250
&gt;&gt; It's something very close to that. So

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.760
what we expect is that all of the letters

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.940
leading up to the letter we're interested in will

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.780
bind. And like you say, if there is a,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.330
an error there, one difference, then it won't bind,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.540
or it will bind weakly. So the signal will

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.700
be weak. But then, the specific letter we're interested

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.540
in, which will kind of come out one more

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.140
base, has, there's a pool of a's, g's,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.550
c's and t's floating around that can bind there.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.740
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.070
&gt;&gt; Or not. They'll only bind. If it's the correct base pair

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.400
&gt;&gt; And it's unoccupied.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.630
&gt;&gt; And it's unoccupied. Then, we'll see

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.320
the extension happen. The reaction that leads

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.050
to the color, you know, the color that we can see in our imaging system.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.810
&gt;&gt; That's great. And so essentially you have this,

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.830
you said the chip is a slide, and you're looking at

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.510
a million bases in this one little chip, this one little space?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there, even more than that. There's more than a million

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.720
beads per chip because it's better to read the same variant many, many times.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:29.820
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.520
&gt;&gt; Just to get a good average signal.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.780
&gt;&gt; Mm Hm. the reason for that, is that if

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.660
your in the corner, or maybe you'll get slightly different

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.070
optics, cause the cameras looking at the center of the chip,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.330
or so, or something like that. So you just want some redundancy.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.810
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.860
&gt;&gt; So it's a more then ten million beads per chip. And that process has been

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.910
improving over the years the density of the,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.840
of the chips has been increasing, a lot.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.680
&gt;&gt; How many chips, so, I mean, do you, have

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.340
you always use the same chip, or How do you

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.460
make changes, you know, if there's a new, I guess,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.810
I don't know, a new trait, or a new a

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.860
new SNV that you've become interested in. Are

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.950
you able to change your chips, so you can

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.260
look at that? Yes. We update the chip approximately

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.630
every 18 months. we're on the third iteration right

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.680
now, and we're constantly looking for a new variance

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.130
to add to the chip to improve the performance

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.330
of it. So you can imagine then, if there's

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.930
a paper published that says, this mutation in this

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.560
gene causes a disease. And it, you know, it's very interesting to go

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.010
and find that out. We can design what we call a, a probe

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.050
for that. Just a base, the sequence of DNA is attached to the

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.630
glass bead, and we make sure it's on the next iteration of the chip.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.070
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the hybridization process is sort of

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.970
the, the longest part. you said it happens over, overnight?

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.090
&gt;&gt; what, I mean for those of us, I mean we've learned

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.000
conceptually about base pairing, but any technical insight you might

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.520
have. I mean what's, why is this an overnight process?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.240
&gt;&gt; Essentially it just takes time for the DNA in your saliva,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.830
in the extracted saliva sample to find the right bead. So you

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.340
want to give it time to just search around in the solution,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.310
find the right bead and bind there. And that, that takes time.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.100
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.630
&gt;&gt; It takes time just based on quickly

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.940
the DNA moves around and how tightly it binds.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.770
&gt;&gt; and what do you use to measure the results? Are you, I

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.820
mean are you just like snappin a picture of the chip? what's actually happening?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.520
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's very close to that. in essence, you'd get

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.340
what's called a fluorophore attached to the, the bead. Because of the

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.040
presence of the A or the G at that position. that's the red or

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.680
green signal. You shoot a laser at it to excite the therafore, and then you

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.170
take a photograph of it with a digital camera. So a lot of it is

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.790
very much, you know, digital camera based.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.470
Just interesting that that technology allowed our technology.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it also sounds like, I know how big

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.440
my digital camera picture files are, that sounds like it's a

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.650
lot of data, a lot of information that, that you end up with.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all of that data from

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.280
this giant image file gets processed by software

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.101
that's actually done by our labs in Los

00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:23.300
Angeles, and translated into the xy plot I

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.359
mentioned before. Because for each bead on the

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.420
chip really all we're interested in is how

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.990
much red is there in there, and how

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.540
much green. The photograph itself is not terribly

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.141
useful after you extracted that data.

00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:41.320
&gt;&gt; Well it sounds still like there is a lot of stuff

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.480
that goes on time from the time that you guys get the

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.590
wrong data and you sort of do your quality control, qc check

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.368
before you know you know i see it on my twenty three

00:17:51.368 --> 00:17:52.333
[UNKNOWN]

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.790
profile page I mean is, is all of

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.450
that just sort of computational biology at that

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.510
point. who, who's looking at that data? Who's

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.190
organizing it? What's sort of going on there?

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really becomes a computational biology problem once

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.540
we get the data from the lab, and that's really

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.310
where 23andMe concentrates most of our Staff here are computational

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.320
biologists or software engineers, so that's really where we're best.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.470
so, the next major component there is called

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.060
calling, that's turning the data that we get

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:30.710
from the lab into the AAs, AGs or GGs that you can download in your raw data,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.160
or produce the reports you see on our

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.590
website. and that's kind of an involved process but

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.570
it, in essence, relies on looking at these

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.800
xy plots and making sure that everything is where

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.360
it, we expect it to be.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.410
&gt;&gt; and so the final results that, that we get back seem to look so, so curated

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:57.780
and so, so official w-, I mean how much of the computational sort of side

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.670
of this is sort of deriving you know. Oh what does this letter mean. I mean

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.380
how do you, I mean are you guys

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.400
viewing all the literature and, and selecting things and,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.559
&gt;&gt; How, how are those decisions made in general?

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:09.848
&gt;&gt; So

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:13.325
we actually have a pretty big content team at

00:19:13.325 --> 00:19:17.030
23andMe, they're the ones who scour the literature, look

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.640
at what's going on in the current science of

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.650
genetics, and find out, oh this mutation or this varient

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.200
causes this disease, and it's a new discovery. Then

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.810
they would write up what they think about that,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.840
and try to put it in launguage that makes

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.260
sense to our users. And if it meets our scientific

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.478
criteria, it goes out to the website. It

00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:41.100
is a little automated, and it can take time

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:46.075
to just process the data through to the website.

00:19:46.075 --> 00:19:49.640
But the actual process of taking your data, calling

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.970
all the variance, and all that is quite

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.590
quick. You can think of the website as being

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.430
in two parts. There's the part where we just

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.270
look at the calls that you have for disease.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.320
And the report just links that call to the

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.030
results. So for example we could say, you are

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.700
a carrier of cystic fibrosis because you have this

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.690
variant. So that's a, that's a scientific challenge, to

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.310
figure out what's going on in the literature. But

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.280
it's not an algorithmic challenge. The other part of

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.650
the website includes things like our ancestry composition feature

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:26.370
and our relative finder feature. Those are difficult algorithmic problems.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.940
You want to take the whole, you know genotype sample all million variants and

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.240
try and figure out based on that, what is this person's ancestral composition.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.703
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:41.210
&gt;&gt; So you can imagine that that's actually a more complex task and requires

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.680
a lot of code taking it from, you know, ABC through to the end
