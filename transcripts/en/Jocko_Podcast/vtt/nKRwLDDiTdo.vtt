When you're stepping into a leadership role and you have someone on your staff

2
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:07.090
who's not a team player,
creates clicks,

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.870
goes over me in straight to my bosses when there's a problem and whenever,

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.710
whenever has concerns voices them among teammates and not directly to me.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.420
How do I continue in my role?
How do I assess myself in,

6
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:23.320
how do I tackle this?

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.600
<v 1>Biggest thing we've got to do is build in a relationship with that person.</v>

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.550
You know,
you got to get in that person's head,

9
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.580
you got to find out what's going on,
you've got to find out,
you gotta,

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.410
you gotta talk to him.
You got to build that relationship.

11
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.100
You get to talking about why they're going over your head.
You then,

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.750
then you know what?
When they say,
well,

13
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.210
I'm going over your head because this happens you,
oh,
I didn't know that.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.590
You don't want me to get that fixed.

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.830
And you build up a little trust and then they say some other problem.

16
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.570
You get that one fixed and then you say,
hey man,
you know it's,
you know,

17
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.890
it's kind of hurts the team is when you're telling the team things that are

18
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:59.810
negative and if we could work together to you,

19
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:03.050
tell me what's going on that's negative.
And then we solve the problem,

20
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.760
we're going to do better as a team.
And that's,

21
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.410
that's my goal is just to do better as a team.

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.510
And I see that you're a leader because people listen to you and when you start

23
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.440
saying negative things,

24
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.970
they start thinking negatively cause you just influential person and,
and I,

25
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.180
and the influence you have over people is something that is going to be,

26
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.530
can be very beneficial to what we're doing.
If you want it to be,

27
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.630
I want you to want it to be,
but you know,
I'm not you.
You have that.
I don't.

28
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.540
So let's work.

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.220
If you could help me move this in a positive direction so our team can be more

30
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:41.930
successful.
That's the kind of thing I would do here.
And,

31
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.680
and the other thing is,
you know,
ask them straight up,
hey,

32
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.240
what am I doing wrong as leader?
What can I do better?
Where can I become?

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.280
Where can I make more things happen?

34
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.590
So that way and what you're doing is you're letting down your guard,

35
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.410
you're letting them given the opportunity to hopefully be honest with you about

36
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.620
what you're doing wrong.
And then you can give them,
you know,

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.720
you can correct those measures.

38
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.560
Now there is a possibility that this person is a jerk.
And when you say,

39
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.060
what am I doing wrong?
They go back and say,
hey,

40
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.470
this guys even know what he's doing.

41
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.680
He's just so that's why you need to take it slowly and fuel the situation out in

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.800
and make an assessment of how they're gonna react to these things and build a

43
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.670
little bit of a little bit of leadership capital with that person before you go

44
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:25.250
and say,
what am I screwing up?
Because then it's,
dude,

45
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.400
Jocko doesn't even know what he's doing.
He's asking me what he should be doing.

46
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.880
So don't if the person's a jerk,
you have to watch out for that.

47
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.500
So that's what we're going to build a relationship first.

48
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.030
It's like building a relationship.

49
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.580
It seems like a very common theme,
far stretching solution.

50
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:46.130
It is very much so.
Uh,
you know,

51
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.730
you take the extreme example of I'm a,

52
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.850
a hostage taker and you're my hostage and I'm threatening to kill you.

53
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.050
What are you supposed to do?
Build a relationship with me.

54
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.220
You want to get me to see you as a human.
That's what we're talking about.

55
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.870
The same thing.
That's an extreme example,

56
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.930
but this is the same thing going on here.
It's a really dumped,

57
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.790
by the way I heard this story,
he was on the news,
I forget how old the girl was.

58
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.530
He was a kid though,
a girl kid,
and she'd,

59
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.370
all she did was blabbed to this guy who kidnapped her and he wound up letting

60
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.700
her go because she,
she built that relationship.

61
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.450
So this team member that's creating clicks and doing all this negative stuff,

62
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.750
it's because he doesn't know you,
you know?
And he's,
he's just going,
I don't know.

63
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.130
You know,
Jocko is a mystery to me.
He doesn't hang out.
I don't know.
He's bad.

64
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.370
Don't die.
He just v there's a separation.
Yeah.

65
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.800
So I'm going to close that separation.
I'm going to Blab to them.

66
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.120
I'm going to build a relationship and we're gonna let that little kid go.
Yeah.

67
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.440
Yeah.
I remember

68
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.880
<v 0>in the nightclub where w w you know you have different bosses,</v>

69
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:47.920
different managers.
They worked different shifts or whatever.

70
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:52.720
So one guy just give me Matt Gilmore,
tall,

71
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.830
tall guy.
I love that guy.
He was real,
I don't know for whatever.
He's like,

72
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.230
I could,
I should,
I could just relate to him.
You know,

73
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.180
he was just real nice and I don't know,

74
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.910
the way he talked was kinda not funny like a comedian,

75
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.920
but just kind of in health.
Some people when they talk,

76
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.050
it's just kind of entertaining,
you know,
every time,

77
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.990
every once in a while though you certain words that's just kind of unique to

78
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:15.490
them.
It's like,
oh I like that.
Anyway,
really liked him.
And so I was hoping,

79
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.420
and he would usually work on Friday,
Saturdays,
right.
That he was,

80
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.520
cause he was kind of high up.
And then there's other guy,

81
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.820
I'm not going to say his name nonetheless.
There's this other guy and this guy,

82
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:29.660
he was like the full on unkind where he had this air about them where I'm the

83
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.170
manager of this club kind of thing.

84
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.920
And on off times if he'd be at like a party or something that we're cruising or

85
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.040
whatever and he talk about how,
yeah,
you know,

86
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.150
I'm in the office doing these sexual things with this person and just,
you know,

87
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.150
real,
real douchey for lack of better term,
rural,
douchey kind of guy.

88
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.040
And one time he was,
um,
there was this rule law of his longtime ago.

89
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.780
There's this rule,
you can't go upstairs.

90
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.860
There was like three levels in this club,
so you can't go upstairs.

91
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.260
It's like this high end kind of lounge.
You can't wear jeans upstairs.

92
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.490
There's a dress code.
I had been to that one.
Yeah,
no,
no,
you would not be welcome.

93
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.440
Flip flops and shorts on.
You won't even get in the front though apparently.
Um,

94
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.440
so one day on my off night,
I had jeans on.

95
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:15.130
I went upstairs real quick just to talk to one of my friends cake nuts and cause

96
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.160
he was up there and so I was talking to him and this guy,
this manager,

97
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:21.790
the one I didn't like,
he was up there and he'd be like,
he was like,
Hey,

98
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.200
the rules apply to everyone,
you know,
go downstairs.
So I'm like,
ah,
you know,

99
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.450
I'm just,
I will,
I'm just gonna talk to him.
He's like,

100
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.600
the rules apply to everyone.
Go downstairs like not be nice about it at all.

101
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.030
So I'm like,
all right,
whatever.
That's just an example of one experience.

102
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.630
The next week he comes in on his night off genes upstairs or whatever,

103
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:46.330
and as a joke,
not being a dick as a joke,
I was like,
hey,
you have jeans on.

104
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.380
I was working and he's like,
he goes,
he's all,
yeah,

105
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:55.270
well my title has a bit more letters than yours does.
Yeah,

106
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.370
that's what he said to me.
So you know,
I'm not sure where we're going with this.

107
00:05:59.371 --> 00:05:59.871
I know that.

108
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.770
I was going to say that's an example of him not building a relationship with me.

109
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.040
Certainly did not.
Matt Gilmore wouldn't have said that.
No,

110
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.670
he would just either not.

111
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.390
He would either compromised with me the first night or he would have,

112
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.680
he would have laughed at my joke and be like,
Haha,
good point.
Whatever.
Or both.

113
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.150
He probably would have done both.
Yeah.
