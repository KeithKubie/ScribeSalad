00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.580
And just one last point of note.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.740
I set the radius and a color variable earlier on in my code,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.440
where I also set my margins, such that if I need to change one,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.080
let's say I want to make all the radiuses of my chart bigger.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.340
Or change the color in some flexible way.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.470
I don't have to change at every place in my code.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.070
In this case, it's only in one, but

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.070
let's say I had a line the same color as the circles.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.830
I want to be able to make one change, and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.910
have that propagate through all my code.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.330
So I've left color and the radius of the circle again as variables.
