00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.621
As popular as George R. R. Martin’s fantasy
novels may have been, nobody would ever have

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.549
expected the HBO series to become a global
phenomenon. But as is usually the case, the

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.730
live-action version is just a slice of the
real story, and packed with cool easter eggs

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.290
most people will never realize. Share this
video with your Game of Thrones-addicted friends,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.110
and see how many of them already know these
10 Facts You Never Knew About Game of Thrones.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.070
Jon Snow’s Banner

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.379
The fact that Jon Snow is an illegitimate
son of Ned Stark is driven home early – hence

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.891
his last name - and bastard sons are all over
the story. But one fact that didn’t make

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:43.441
the jump from book to TV show is that in this
fantasy world, bastards don’t get to carry

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:48.030
the banners of their family – but they CAN
carry ones with the colors reversed. Since

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.460
the Stark sigil is a grey wolf on white, Jon
Snow carries a white wolf on grey in the books.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.030
It makes his nickname as King of the North
- “The White Wolf” – way more meaningful,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.530
and confirms that the Direwolves found by
the Stark sons was undeniably a message from

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.740
the Gods.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.280
Ramsay Almost Played Jon Snow

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.170
It didn’t take long for audiences to absolutely
despise Ramsey Bolton, but if things had worked

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.661
out differently, they might have been cheering
for him. Actor Iwan Rheon (“IH-Wahn Ray-On”)

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:20.450
originally auditioned for the part of Jon
Snow, and ended up coming down to the final

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.869
two choices beside Kit Harington. Which makes
their rivalry in Season 6 seem like a particularly

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.929
personal one.

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.740
George R. R. Martin Had a Cameo

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.639
With George R.R. Martin responsible for dreaming
up this treacherous world, you would think

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:38.139
he would have landed a part in the show himself
– but his cameo actually already happened.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:42.429
Martin played a wealthy nobleman from Pentos
at the wedding of Danaerys to Khal Drogo in

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.689
the pilot episode. But when most of the pilot
was later re-filmed – and actress Tamzin

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.710
Merchant was replaced by Emilia Clarke – the
entire sequence had to be cut… the author’s

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.270
cameo along with it.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.649
Tywin’s Butchering Scene Was Real

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.579
The noble and fearsome Tywin Lannister didn’t
actually appear until the show’s seventh

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.969
episode, but he made a memorable entrance,
butchering and skinning a stag while giving

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.290
his son a lecture. The scene showed he wasn’t
afraid of getting his hands dirty – and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.780
the same was true of the actor, Charles Dance.
After being shown how to butcher a stag the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
day before, he did it for real – on a stag
just as real – for the camera. He was happy

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.959
with the result… but not the smell, which
stayed on his hands for days.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.599
King Tommen’s debut

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.430
Even for devoted fans, the arrival of Tommen
Baratheon to the throne came as a surprise,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.910
or downright confusing. The reason why nobody
remembered King Joffrey’s innocent younger

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.909
brother? Because he had already appeared on
the show as Queen Cersei’s first cousin,

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.849
Martyn, held hostage, then murdered in Riverrun
(in S3E5). Actor Dean-Charles Chapman made

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.969
a good impression, and later replaced the
MUCH younger version of Tommen who had appeared

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.549
previously (he debuts in Season 4).

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.659
The Show Leading The Books

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.430
The current seasons of Game of Thrones have
actually gotten ahead of the books, but there

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.409
aren’t many cases of the HBO series actually
changing Martin’s ideas… with one exception.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.010
The Wildling named “Osha” had only a small
role in the books, but Martin was so impressed

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.049
with actress Natalia Tena, he admitted he
would write her differently when she returns

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.890
– making her younger, and more sarcastic
(first appears S1E6).

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.079
A More Scully Cersei

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.170
The amount of British actors who were sought
out or auditioned for the HBO series is too

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.170
big count, but one actress would have been
familiar to the show’s Comic-Con fandom.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.420
Actress Gillian Anderson of X-Files fame has
said she was offered a part, but turned it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.340
down sicne it would’ve taken her away from
her family. She didn’t say which role, but

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.980
the part of Queen Cersei Lannister is a frontrunner
– along with the Red Priestess, Melisandre.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:50.790
Either of which would have given her fans
some truly memorable scenes.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.260
Violet Eyes

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.140
The Targaryens are referred to in the TV show
as “dragons,” descendants of ancient Valyria

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.590
and therefore, almost a different kind of
human than the rest (or so they would like

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.459
to be believed). But one of their most recognizable
traits was removed from the show: their platinum

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.280
blonde hair is rare, but the purple eye color
was even more so. In the books, it was a clear

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.310
sign of Valyrian blood. But when the actors
playing Danaerys and Viserys had trouble focusing

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.380
with the violet eye contacts in place, the
showrunners decided to scrap the idea entirely.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.800
The Real Valyrian Steel

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.910
If you had made your family into a proud House
of Westeros centuries in the past, you might

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.330
even have gotten a sword of Valyrian Steel
to immortalize it. The metal is given almost

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.360
magical properties in the books and TV show,
since swords of Valyrian steel never dull,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.471
never break, and are easily spotted by the
flowing water pattern on its surface. It may

00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:45.280
sound like fantasy, but it’s based on the
real world Damascus Steel, a strong, sharp

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.360
metal with the same patterns. Like Valyrian,
the recipe for making Damscus Steel was also

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.610
lost in the 1700s so no more can be made.
No word on whether they would kill White Walkers

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.610
just as easy, but scientists have found carbon
nanotubes in the metal, so… that’s something.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.390
The Iron Throne

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.360
You got to hand it to George R. R. Martin”
a throne made from the swords of fallen enemies

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.770
sends a powerful message. And while the throne
in the books may be made from THOUSANDS, the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.390
TV version is special in its own way. For
starters, it seems to include Gandalf’s

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.150
sword from the Lord of the Rings as a bit
of a joke on the part of the propmakers. It’s

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.140
not alone, either, since the hero swords from
Robin Hood: the Prince of Thieves and even

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.510
Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven are among
the dozens visible. Who knows how many fictional

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.910
kingdoms fell in the history of Westeros…

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.910
Conclusion

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.230
Those are just a handful of the behind-the-scenes
secrets and extra details from the novels

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.360
