00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
In today's video,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.700
we are making some gummy
candy out of fruit.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:12.360
[Music]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.700
Guys, Benjamin Librado asked,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.300
if we could make
a gummy coconut.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.280
Yes, we can.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.480
I think we can do
more than just that.

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.218
Instead of just going
for a gummy coconut,

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.500
we thought we would try
a few different types of fruit.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.070
So here we've got a coconut,
an avocado, a couple limes,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.100
and several grapes.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.600
And we have ideas of how to make
gummy versions of all of these.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.300
Let's get started.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.140
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.000
We have four different
kinds of fruit.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.556
We are going to find a different
way to hollow each one out,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.700
and fill them with gummy candy.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.660
All right.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.300
So first thing
we're going to do,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.700
we need to hollow
out this coconut.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.300
Now, you guys have seen
in previous videos

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000
how Grant breaks
open a coconut,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
you get a perfectly clean cut.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.267
So we're going to do that.

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:47.840
So we're going
to take this outside.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.420
When Grant did this,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.000
he used a sharp rock,
the edge of it on the coconut.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.215
I was actually able
to smash my coconut open

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:54.400
just using flat ground.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.600
So I'm going to try that again.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.960
[Music]

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.980
Well, look at that.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.700
Nice.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.600
[Music]

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.100
So this one,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.190
we won't even have to worry
about carving out at all.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.800
That piece came right out.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.000
So while Nate finishes
cleaning out the coconuts,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.500
I'm going to go ahead and start
on the gummy candy center.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.570
We are going to be using
some Knox gelatine,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.900
some heavy whipping cream,
sweetened condensed milk,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.900
and some flavoring.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.140
[Music]

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.000
In previous videos,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300
you guys have seen
Grant make Lego gummy candy,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.843
and we're going to be using
a similar recipe,

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:37.754
but we're actually going

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:39.500
to be making this even
a little bit more solid,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.675
and it's going to be opaque,

00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:42.900
because we want it to look just
like a coconut inside.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.400
Measurements for this
are really simple.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.780
I used about 3/4
of a cup of water,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.600
1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
1/2 a cup of
sweetened condensed milk.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.334
I'll be adding a little
bit of flavoring,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
and we'll be adding 3,
maybe 4 packets of gelatin.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.300
So now that I've got a bit
of a simmering boil,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.100
that's as hot as we
really need this.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So because we want this coconut
to cure pretty fast,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.100
I'm going to be using
four packets of gelatin

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.982
and cold water,

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:09.480
which I'll be adding
to our gummy candy.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.300
If you wanted this to be
a little bit softer,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.205
you could use maybe

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.600
even 2 and 1/2 packets,
and it would be just fine.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.350
Disgusting.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.200
But that's how you
make a gummy candy.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.200
[Music]

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.700
We've got a couple
of coconut halves

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.420
that fit nicely together,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.200
and we are going to need
to seal these off.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440
So what we're going to do
actually is take some sandpaper,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.646
and just sand down the edges,

00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:34.100
because we are going to use
some tape to hold these together

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.300
while our gummy cures inside.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.760
[Music]

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.780
One spot is refusing to stay.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.960
I'm gonna put more tape on it.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.549
If it doesn't work
with duct tape,

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.200
you're not using
enough duct tape.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.740
[Music]

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.100
Go kick it around in the snow.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.740
Nate!

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.900
Go on.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.100
It's a coconut, that'll hurt.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.290
Probably shouldn't
be in sneakers.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500
Oh, my sneakers are new
and very waterproof.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:12.711
Oh, I can tell.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.040
[Music]

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.200
My shoe is off.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.280
You weren't paying attention.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.600
In case anybody is wondering
why we're doing this randomness,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.100
we're trying to cool
them down in the snow,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
because it's actually
a whole lot colder out here

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.400
than it is in our fridge.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.100
So our coconuts have to keep
rotating to make sure

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.000
that we create a hollow inside
for them when we cut them open.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.940
So I left Nate out in the snow,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.900
and I'm going to go
and start on the other fruits.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.210
I don't know about you guys,
but I don't think

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.543
that an avocado flavor
gummy candies going to be good.

00:03:49.543 --> 00:03:51.700
So I think I'm going to go
with mint for this one.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.400
Cool.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.780
Now let's make a filling.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.296
Measurements for this one
are going to be just the same

00:03:58.296 --> 00:03:59.700
as we did for
the coconut filling.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.406
So I've got 3/4
of a cup of water,

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:02.538
1/2 a cup of heavy cream,

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:04.344
1/2 a cup of
sweetened condensed milk,

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.500
and then we'll be adding

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.400
in about 1/2 cup of cold water
with our gelatin in it after.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.900
This will be the mintiest
avocado there ever was.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900
We are going to add
one other thing

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.900
that we didn't add
to the coconut.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.960
Food coloring.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.500
[Music]

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.700
That's kind of the color
of an avocado.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.500
You don't have to use
this much gelatin.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.782
This is kind of overkill.

00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:33.500
We just really want to make sure
that this cures fast.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:43.000
[Music]

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.700
Next up, limes.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:58.500
[Music]

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.800
So for this mixture, again,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.200
because we want everything
to set very quickly today,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.579
we've only added about
3/4 of a cup of water.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.299
I've added in 1/2
of an extra gelatin packet,

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:09.300
and then a full packet
of lime Jell-O.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.200
This is not the recommended
way to make jello,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.300
but it does work.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:24.380
[Music]

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.300
So Nate poured out half
of one of the avocados,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.600
just trying to get it
from the counter to the fridge.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.000
So I'm going to put
these in the fridge

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.160
and then pour the jello in.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.700
All right.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.580
We have an avocado,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.900
2 coconuts, and a lime
in the fridge.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.500
What's next?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.360
Surgery on a grape.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.720
We're literally trying
to hollow out a grape.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.700
The same way that you would

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.287
when you're trying
to hollow out an egg,

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:50.200
so you can carve it
or make it into an ornament.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.480
I shoved a needle
all the way through,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.657
and now we're just going to try

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:56.200
and hollow out the insides
by blowing the guts out.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.700
That'll be fun.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.620
Yep.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.900
I have a hollow grape.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm very proud of myself.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.460
[Music]

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.440
Here's the thing.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.300
We're not just trying to make

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.790
these grapes sat
in hollow inside,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.500
we're putting stuff back.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.600
[Music]

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.400
Little bit of the gelatin
leaked on this coconut.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.740
It's a little slimy.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.620
Wait, wait.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.060
No, no, no.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.760
It bounces in your hand.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.450
Kinda does.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.100
You can feel like vibrating,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.300
as though it were
a spring or something.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.900
[Music]

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.900
I'm so thrilled right now.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.360
I've put the lime
in the coconut.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.420
I'm proud of you.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.920
[Music]

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.600
Well, that one doesn't look
like a coconut,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.015
but it looks awesome.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.240
There's our lime coconut.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.500
Let's see what I real
coconut looks like.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.280
[Music]

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.390
Okay, that side does.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.600
That side looks great.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.100
Yes.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.300
This side, well,
maybe I should have kept

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.860
kicking it around in the snow
a little bit, but...

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.000
It's not bad.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.932
That's really not bad.

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:31.500
That's actually really cool.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.100
You can see that, that edge.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.540
It looks like a coconut.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.000
I want to try this.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.740
The coconut made
from jello and snow.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.040
[Music]

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.600
It's really good.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080
The avocado.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.400
We've got to look at the inside,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.500
but we are missing
a key element.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.229
I think we have a great idea for

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:52.700
how we're going to add
that key element in.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.860
Doesn't taste like
avocado at all.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.680
World's mintiest avocado.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.240
That's amazing, and it
tastes really good.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.200
Should we see
how our limes turned out?

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.040
Yeah.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.500
Jello segmented lime.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.800
Oh, that's fun.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:23.080
[Music]

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.620
Done.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.600
Pina colada flavored
energy drink?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.060
[Music]

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.880
Yes.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.800
A lime slice on a gummy coconut

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.300
with a pina colada
flavored drink inside.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.580
I've never been happier.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.300
The candy island
life, altogether.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.500
Oh that has some real
lime in it still.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.400
That's cool.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.140
[Music]

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.920
Hmm...

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.100
Nice and tart.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.120
There.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.200
My wedge has less lime in it.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.980
Well, that's some--

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.714
It's tart.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.260
Taste like a lime.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.800
This would be really fun to do
with oranges, grapefruit,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.750
like a bigger fruit

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.100
that you can carve out
the pieces a little bit easier.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.199
Because it'd be a fun snack.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
Nate just eating a lime?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.500
I have to go.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.840
Wait, get the grapes.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.840
[Music]

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.600
Dang it.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.100
[Music]

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.540
I can't get the edge.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:43.040
[Music]

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.100
The stick.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.160
Dang it.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.320
[Music]

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.200
Okay, but I actually want
to know what it taste like now

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.780
that we've done
surgery on a grape.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.760
Surgery on a grape.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.946
Surgery on a grape.

00:09:53.946 --> 00:09:55.300
That's really good.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.930
You thought it couldn't be done.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.284
You may have not said
it out loud,

00:09:58.284 --> 00:10:00.200
but in your head,
you thought we couldn't do it,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.910
but we could.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.320
We did.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.920
We might be the first people to
hollow out the guts of a grape,

00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:06.980
and fill it
with grape-filled Jello.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.300
[Music]

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.500
Thank you, Benjamin Librado.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.600
That was a lot of fun.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.263
But we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:17.263 --> 00:10:19.789
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:20.700
That box the bottom is

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.594
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:24.450
Hit this bomb in the middle,
so you're subscribed,

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.700
and you never miss
out on the fun.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.811
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see in the next one.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.940
Talk to you then.
