suppose it pays off and we start getting

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250
suppose it pays off and we start getting

civilization of some sort somewhere in

civilization of some sort somewhere in
 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.930
civilization of some sort somewhere in
the universe and we ask ourselves what

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
the universe and we ask ourselves what
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.400
the universe and we ask ourselves what
would surprise us and what would we

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
would surprise us and what would we
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.549
would surprise us and what would we
expect and what we would expect is that

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
expect and what we would expect is that
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.990
expect and what we would expect is that
they would have arithmetic and they

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000
they would have arithmetic and they
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.610
they would have arithmetic and they
would agree with us that two plus two

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620
would agree with us that two plus two
 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950
would agree with us that two plus two
equals four and they'd have geometry and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
equals four and they'd have geometry and
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.110
equals four and they'd have geometry and
they would there was a lot of things

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
they would there was a lot of things
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.910
they would there was a lot of things
that they would have would they have a

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920
that they would have would they have a
 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.360
that they would have would they have a
base-10 arithmetic probably not or

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370
base-10 arithmetic probably not or
 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.630
base-10 arithmetic probably not or
because why well because we are pretty

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640
because why well because we are pretty
 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.410
because why well because we are pretty
sure that the reason that we have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
sure that the reason that we have
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.600
sure that the reason that we have
base-10 arithmetic is because we've got

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610
base-10 arithmetic is because we've got
 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.150
base-10 arithmetic is because we've got
two of these with five of these and if

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160
two of these with five of these and if
 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.050
two of these with five of these and if
if we had only three fingers and the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060
if we had only three fingers and the
 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.370
if we had only three fingers and the
thumb on each hand and we would have

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380
thumb on each hand and we would have
 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.449
thumb on each hand and we would have
base eight arithmetic of course it might

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459
base eight arithmetic of course it might
 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:17.710
base eight arithmetic of course it might
turn out that they had base 10

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720
turn out that they had base 10
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.050
turn out that they had base 10
arithmetic because having two of these

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
arithmetic because having two of these
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.080
arithmetic because having two of these
with five of these is a better trick

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
with five of these is a better trick
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.669
with five of these is a better trick
than we realize it's not just a

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679
than we realize it's not just a
 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.040
than we realize it's not just a
historical accident but something that's

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050
historical accident but something that's
 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.620
historical accident but something that's
a sort of a deep design reason why that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
a sort of a deep design reason why that
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.210
a sort of a deep design reason why that
would be discovered again and again and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220
would be discovered again and again and
 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.839
would be discovered again and again and
again by evolution I mean I sight I

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849
again by evolution I mean I sight I
 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.020
again by evolution I mean I sight I
think if the planet on which this life

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
think if the planet on which this life
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.449
think if the planet on which this life
exists has has a transparent atmosphere

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459
exists has has a transparent atmosphere
 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:48.520
exists has has a transparent atmosphere
then eyesight is such an obviously good

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
then eyesight is such an obviously good
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.580
then eyesight is such an obviously good
trick to have because it permits

distel it permits you to get information

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
distel it permits you to get information
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.130
distel it permits you to get information
from distant objects very fast that's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140
from distant objects very fast that's
 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.880
from distant objects very fast that's
got to be good it gives you an advanced

got to be good it gives you an advanced
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.029

there's many good tricks I capitalize

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069
there's many good tricks I capitalize

space and what a good trick is is

something that will be discovered again

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860
something that will be discovered again
 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.589
something that will be discovered again
and again and again there's multiple

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
and again and again there's multiple
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.290
and again and again there's multiple
paths to it it's just such a good idea

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300
paths to it it's just such a good idea
 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.710
paths to it it's just such a good idea
that evolution will find it whenever

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720
that evolution will find it whenever
 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840
that evolution will find it whenever
it's available

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850
it's available
 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.730
it's available
and I think that we can rely on that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740
and I think that we can rely on that
 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.570
and I think that we can rely on that
principle to anticipate and I think we

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580
principle to anticipate and I think we
 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.310
principle to anticipate and I think we

they they help themselves to a lot of

features which they think well it's got
 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.260

to be this way and now maybe maybe

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270
to be this way and now maybe maybe
 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.420

you've covered with scales and maybe

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
you've covered with scales and maybe
 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.760
you've covered with scales and maybe
have three heads but but there's some

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770
have three heads but but there's some
 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.980

things that you're definitely going to
 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.770
things that you're definitely going to

Philip Morrison's observation that
there's two possibilities that we're

there's two possibilities that we're

really don't have a very strong opinion

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
really don't have a very strong opinion

about which is the truth I am inclined
toward thinking that we're not alone but

toward thinking that we're not alone but
 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.870
toward thinking that we're not alone but

that's based on sort of impressionistic

the question is are there are places

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560
the question is are there are places

the question is are there are places
