I'M A MOTHER
AND A SOCIAL WORKER.

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.874
AND I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WORKING

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:08.675
HEY, C-CZAR.
I'M PATTY.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.444
WELCOME TO DAD ACADEMY.
- IT'S SURE NICE.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.846
ANOTHER BOY, FINALLY.
- I'M NOT A BOY.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.047
I'M A WOMAN.
- OH, OKAY.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.250
I'M A WOMAN, TOO.
OOH, TOUCH MY VAGINA.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.418
TOUCH MY VAGINA.
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:22.022
THIS IS A STANDARD-ISSUE
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING DOLL.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.525

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.995
- IS THAT ANDERSON COOPER?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.430
- WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THIS WAS ANDERSON COOPER?

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.733
- 'CAUSE HE'S WHITE
AND HE'S GOT FLAXEN HAIR.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.669
- HE'S WHITE?
- YEAH, THAT BABY'S WHITE.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.106
- A FATHER NEEDS TO SPEND
A LOT OF TIME WITH HIS CHILD.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.150
- NO, I DON'T WANNA BE
A GOOD FATHER.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.652

A GOOD FATHER?

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.819

CONGRATULATIONS.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.282
YOU CAN GIVE THAT RIGHT BACK
TO ME NOW.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.683
- WHY WOULD I GIVE YOU
MY BABY?

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:58.519
- WELL, IT'S NOT A REAL BABY,
OF COURSE.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.387
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA SAY THAT
TO HIS FACE?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.756

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.558

THE BABY "PINOCCHLIO."

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.126
I'M SAYING THAT WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE THAT BABY

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.295
