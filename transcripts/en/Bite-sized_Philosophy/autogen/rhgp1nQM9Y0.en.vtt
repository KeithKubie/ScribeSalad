in his demise so if I'm a victim then

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
in his demise so if I'm a victim then
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000
in his demise so if I'm a victim then
everyone else owes me something and I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
everyone else owes me something and I

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
don't have to take any responsibility
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.229
don't have to take any responsibility
and so one of the things I've wondered

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239
and so one of the things I've wondered
 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.660
and so one of the things I've wondered
here's something to think about it might

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
here's something to think about it might
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389
here's something to think about it might
be that the sense of meaning that life

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
be that the sense of meaning that life
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220
be that the sense of meaning that life
can provide to you is proportionate to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
can provide to you is proportionate to
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049
can provide to you is proportionate to
the amount of responsibility you decide

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
the amount of responsibility you decide
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.930
the amount of responsibility you decide
to take on not that be very strange if

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
to take on not that be very strange if
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.160
to take on not that be very strange if
it was the case you know because

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
it was the case you know because
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689
it was the case you know because
responsibility of course is a kind of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
responsibility of course is a kind of
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060
responsibility of course is a kind of
weight obviously and it's difficult to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
weight obviously and it's difficult to
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.569
weight obviously and it's difficult to
take on responsibility but if any

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
take on responsibility but if any
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.149
take on responsibility but if any
positive emotion that you feel and your

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
positive emotion that you feel and your
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.120
positive emotion that you feel and your
control of anxiety and the control over

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
control of anxiety and the control over
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700
control of anxiety and the control over
pain is dependent on the activation of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
pain is dependent on the activation of
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469
pain is dependent on the activation of
these systems that watch you move

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
these systems that watch you move
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.200
these systems that watch you move
towards a desired goal then more

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
towards a desired goal then more
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.219
towards a desired goal then more
complete and weighty the goal is the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
complete and weighty the goal is the
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810
complete and weighty the goal is the
more kick there's going to be in the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
more kick there's going to be in the
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399
more kick there's going to be in the
observation that you're moving towards

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
observation that you're moving towards
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920
observation that you're moving towards
it and you know you kind of already know

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
it and you know you kind of already know
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140
it and you know you kind of already know
this because you'll you'll have observed

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
this because you'll you'll have observed
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.399
this because you'll you'll have observed
in your own life that when you're

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
in your own life that when you're
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.120
in your own life that when you're
engaged in something that you believe in

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
engaged in something that you believe in
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.539
engaged in something that you believe in
that the time passes properly you know

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
that the time passes properly you know
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.760
that the time passes properly you know
you can see this even if you're maybe

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
you can see this even if you're maybe
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740
you can see this even if you're maybe
you're reading a paper and it's actually

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
you're reading a paper and it's actually
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350
you're reading a paper and it's actually
related in some intelligible manner to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
related in some intelligible manner to
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.230
related in some intelligible manner to
something that you want to learn so even

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
something that you want to learn so even
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880
something that you want to learn so even
though it's difficult you get engaged in

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
though it's difficult you get engaged in
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.289
though it's difficult you get engaged in
it you can remember it better you could

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
it you can remember it better you could
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899
it you can remember it better you could
process it better and you don't you're

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
process it better and you don't you're
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520
process it better and you don't you're
not so likely to fall asleep and you're

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
not so likely to fall asleep and you're
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.870
not so likely to fall asleep and you're
not so likely to want to find

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
not so likely to want to find
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760
not so likely to want to find
distractions all of that you can get

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
distractions all of that you can get
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399
distractions all of that you can get
into it and it would be very interesting

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
into it and it would be very interesting
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620
into it and it would be very interesting
if that was proportionate to the degree

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
if that was proportionate to the degree
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270
if that was proportionate to the degree
of responsibility that you're willing to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
of responsibility that you're willing to
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.800
of responsibility that you're willing to
shoulder and I think you can make a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
shoulder and I think you can make a
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200
shoulder and I think you can make a
strong case for that I've also often

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
strong case for that I've also often
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630
strong case for that I've also often
wondered imagine you could offer people

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
wondered imagine you could offer people
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360
wondered imagine you could offer people
a choice here's the choice you could say

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
a choice here's the choice you could say
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.470
a choice here's the choice you could say
well

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
well
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.080
well
your life isn't meaningful the nihilists

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
your life isn't meaningful the nihilists
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.460
your life isn't meaningful the nihilists
have got it right there's no meaning in

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
have got it right there's no meaning in
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.949
have got it right there's no meaning in
your life and because of that there's no

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
your life and because of that there's no
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.210
your life and because of that there's no
reason for you to accept any

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
reason for you to accept any
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.449
reason for you to accept any
responsibility so you can live a

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
responsibility so you can live a
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.789
responsibility so you can live a
responsibility free life and maybe one

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799
responsibility free life and maybe one
 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.470
responsibility free life and maybe one
of impulsive pleasure-seeking but a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
of impulsive pleasure-seeking but a
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.720
of impulsive pleasure-seeking but a
responsibility free life but the price

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
responsibility free life but the price
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.039
responsibility free life but the price
you pay is that it doesn't get to be

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049
you pay is that it doesn't get to be
 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.710
you pay is that it doesn't get to be
meaningful or you could say to someone

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
meaningful or you could say to someone
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.300
meaningful or you could say to someone
no we're going to do the opposite we're

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
no we're going to do the opposite we're
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.650
no we're going to do the opposite we're
going to say you can live a meaningful

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
going to say you can live a meaningful
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.229
going to say you can live a meaningful
life but it's only going to be as

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
life but it's only going to be as
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.580
life but it's only going to be as
meaningful as the amount of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
meaningful as the amount of
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.140
meaningful as the amount of
responsibility that you're willing to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
responsibility that you're willing to
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.479
responsibility that you're willing to
bear and then you might say well what

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
bear and then you might say well what
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.670
bear and then you might say well what
would people choose because everybody

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
would people choose because everybody
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.250
would people choose because everybody
also always makes noises about wanting

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
also always makes noises about wanting
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500
also always makes noises about wanting
to have a meaningful life but if the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
to have a meaningful life but if the
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.030
to have a meaningful life but if the
price you pay for that is the adoption

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040
price you pay for that is the adoption
 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.770
price you pay for that is the adoption
of responsibility that it's not so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
of responsibility that it's not so
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.599
of responsibility that it's not so
obvious that people would choose meaning

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609
obvious that people would choose meaning
 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.970
obvious that people would choose meaning
over you know over pointless pursuits if

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
over you know over pointless pursuits if
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.819
over you know over pointless pursuits if
they had to if the benefit they got for

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829
they had to if the benefit they got for
 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.259
they had to if the benefit they got for
choosing the pointless pursuits was that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269
choosing the pointless pursuits was that
 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.150
choosing the pointless pursuits was that
they really didn't have to care about

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
they really didn't have to care about
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.250
they really didn't have to care about
anything they ever did like snow

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
anything they ever did like snow
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.050
anything they ever did like snow
responsibility and that's really what

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
responsibility and that's really what
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.910
responsibility and that's really what
Pinocchio is offered and that's what the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
Pinocchio is offered and that's what the
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.990
Pinocchio is offered and that's what the
coachmen offers them and that's

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
coachmen offers them and that's
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.039
coachmen offers them and that's
interesting because you know so far it's

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049
interesting because you know so far it's
 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.259
interesting because you know so far it's
been the Fox and the cat and they're

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269
been the Fox and the cat and they're
 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.150
been the Fox and the cat and they're
kind of two-bit hoods and so the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
kind of two-bit hoods and so the
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.949
kind of two-bit hoods and so the
pathological pathway that they offer

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
pathological pathway that they offer
 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.800
pathological pathway that they offer
Pinocchio is not the worst of the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
Pinocchio is not the worst of the
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.140
Pinocchio is not the worst of the
pathological pathways but here at least

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
pathological pathways but here at least
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.569
