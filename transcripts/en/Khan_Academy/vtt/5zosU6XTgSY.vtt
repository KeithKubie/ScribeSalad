00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.960
What I want to explore
in this video is,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.540
given some length
of string or a line

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.540
or some line segment
right here, b,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.600
can I set up an a, so
that the ratio of a to b

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.530
is equal to the ratio
of the sum of these two

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.230
to the longer side?

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.840
So it's equal to the
ratio of a plus b to a.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.040
So I want to sit and think
about this a little bit.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.780
I want to see is can I
construct some a that's

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.880
on this ratio,
this perfect ratio

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810
that I'm somehow
referring to right here,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.470
so that the ratio of the
longer side to the shorter side

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.086
is equal to the ratio of the
whole thing to the longer side.

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:42.460
And let's just assume that we
can find a ratio like that.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.430
And we'll call it phi.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.550
We'll use the Greek letter
phi for that ratio over there.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.980
So let's see what we can learn
about this special ratio phi.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.560
Well if phi is equal to a over
b, which is equal to a plus b

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.310
over a, we know that
a plus b over a is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.040
the same thing as a
over a plus b over a.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.120
a over a is just 1.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.830
And b over a is just the
inverse of this statement

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.540
right over here.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.940
So b over a-- this thing
right here over here

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.130
is phi-- so b over a is
going to be 1 over phi.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.250
This is going to be 1 over phi.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.580
So this is interesting.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.540
We've now set up a
number, which we're

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.350
going to call this special
ratio, phi is equal to 1 plus 1

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.775
over phi.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.260
Well just that is kind of a
neat statement right over there.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.130
First of all, you
could, if you subtract 1

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.230
from both sides of this,
you get phi minus 1

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.220
is equal to its inverse.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.840
That seems to be a pretty
neat property of any number

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.960
that if I just
subtract 1 from it,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.850
I get its
multiplicative inverse.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.550
And so that, already that
seems kind of intriguing.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.150
But then even this
statement over here

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.460
is kind of interesting because
we've defined phi in terms of 1

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.140
plus 1 over phi.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170
So we can actually
think of it this way.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.322
We could say that phi is
equal to 1 plus 1 over phi.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.030
But instead of writing
phi, we're saying,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.020
wait, phi is just 1
plus 1 over-- instead

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.540
of saying phi-- I could say,
well, that's just 1 plus 1 over

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.160
and I could just write phi again
or I could just keep on going.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.110
I could just keep on
going like this forever.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.110
I could say that's
1 over 1 plus 1 over

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.330
and just keep on going on
and on and on, forever.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.550
And this is a recursive
definition of a function,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.270
or a recursive
definition of a variable,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.240
where it's defined
in terms of itself.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.410
But even this seems like
a pretty neat property.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.410
But we want to get a
little bit further into it.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.120
We actually eventually want
to figure out what phi is.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
What is the value of phi, this
weird number, this weird ratio

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.990
that we're beginning to explore?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.100
So let's see if we can turn
it into a quadratic equation

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.300
that we can solve using
fairly traditional methods.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.980
And the easiest
way to do that is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.820
to multiply both sides
of this equation by phi.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.542
And then you get
phi squared-- let

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:08.800
me write a little bit
different-- phi squared is

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.990
equal to phi plus 1.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.760
phi squared is
equal to phi plus 1.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.260
And then, actually, I'm going
to take a little bit of a side

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.500
here.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.060
But even this is
interesting, because then

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.280
if we take the square root
of both sides of this,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.710
you get-- let me scroll
down a little bit--

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.760
you get phi is equal to the
square root of-- and I'll just

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.880
switch the order here-- the
square root of 1 plus phi.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.340
So once again, we can set up
another recursive definition.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.752
phi is equal to the
square root of 1 plus phi.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:44.460
And I could write phi
there, but hey, phi

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.970
is equal to the
square root of 1 plus

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.760
and I could write phi
there, but hey, phi

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.831
is just equal to the square root
of 1 plus, the square root of 1

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:54.330
plus.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.960
And we could just keep going
on and on like this forever.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.900
So even this is neat.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.858
The same number that can
be expressed this way,

00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:02.020
the same number where if
I just subtract 1 from it,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.150
you get its inverse.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.100
It can also be
expressed in these kind

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.870
of recursive square roots
underneath each other.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.760
So this is already starting
to get very, very, very

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.710
intriguing, but let's
get back to business.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.630
Let's actually solve for this
magic number, this magic ratio

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.060
that we started thinking about.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.130
And really from a
very simple idea,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.990
that the ratio of the longer
side to the shorter side

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.750
is equal to the ratio of the sum
of the two to the longer side.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.930
So let's just solve this
as a traditional quadratic.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.721
Let's get everything
on the left-hand side.

00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.390
So we're going to subtract
phi plus 1 from both sides.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.850
And we get phi squared minus
phi minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.270
And we can solve
for phi now using

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.550
the quadratic formula, which
we've proven in other videos.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.680
You can prove using
completing the square.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.540
But the quadratic formula
you say, negative b.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.950
Negative b is the coefficient
on this term right here.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.570
So let me just
write it down, a is

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.990
equal to 1, that's the
coefficient on this term.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.320
b is equal to negative 1, that's
the coefficient on this term.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.615
c is equal to negative 1,
that's the coefficient,

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:09.180
or it's really the constant
term right over there.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.449
So the solutions to
this, phi-- and we're

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.740
actually only going to care
about the positive solution

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.844
because we're thinking
about a positive--

00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:17.510
when we go to our
original problem here,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.759
we're assuming that these
are both positive distances,

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.310
so we care about a positive
value right over here.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.240
We get phi is equal to-- do
it in orange-- negative b.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.740
Well negative negative
1 is 1 plus or minus

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.680
the square root of b squared.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.200
b squared is going
to be 1 minus 4ac.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.480
a is 1, c is negative 1.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.570
So negative 4 times
negative 1 is positive 4.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.270
So 1 plus 4, all
of that over 2a.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.390
So a is 1, so all
of that over 2.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.967
So phi is equal to 1.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:53.300
And once again, we only care
about the positive solution

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.870
here.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.800
This is going to be
the square root of 5.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.180
If you have 1 minus
the square root of 5,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.710
you're going to get a
negative in the numerator.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.690
So we only care about
the positive solution.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.510
1 plus the square
root of 5 over 2.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.870
So this seems like a
pretty interesting number.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.370
Let's actually take
a calculator out

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.370
and see if we can get the first
few places of this magic number

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.320
phi.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.640
So let me get my calculator out.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.500
Let's just actually evaluate it.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.480
And you might recognize
that square root of 5

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.641
is an irrational number.

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:26.140
And so this whole thing is going
to be an irrational number,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.140
but I'll prove that in
another video, which

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.710
means it never repeats.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.129
It goes on and on
and on forever.

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.420
But let's actually evaluate it.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:41.210
So it's 1 plus the square
root of 5 divided by 2.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.120
So it says 1.6180339.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.280
So let me put that aside.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.154
Let me write it down.

00:06:50.154 --> 00:06:51.570
And this is where
it starts to get

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.430
really interesting
and mysterious.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:01.542
So this number right
over here is 1.618033988

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:04.460
and it just keeps on going
on and on and on, keeps

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.020
on never terminating,
never repeating.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.120
So that by itself,
it's this cool number.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.670
It's this ratio that has all
of these neat properties, which

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.600
are pretty crazy anyway
that you express it.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.240
But what's really neat is if
we revisit this thing right

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.250
over here.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.700
Because what is 1
over phi going to be?

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.610
So 1 over phi, which we
sometimes denote with a capital

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.210
phi.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.860
We already know 1 over
phi is just phi minus 1.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.710
So we actually can
do this in our heads.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.019
1 over this is just
going to be 0.618033988.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:41.560
I don't know.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.720
There's just something
wacky about that,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.630
that the inverse of
the number is really

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.750
just the decimals left over
after you get rid of the 1.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.040
That, by itself, is
kind of a crazy idea.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.060
But it gets even crazier
because this number

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.430
is showing up everywhere.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.360
And as you might imagine
from the title of this video,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.850
this phi right over here, this
is called the golden ratio.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.260
This is the golden ratio
and it shows up everywhere.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.330
It shows up in art.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.600
It shows up in music.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.640
It shows up in nature.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.060
And just to get an idea of
where it shows up in nature,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.250
it shows up in very pure ideas.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.700
So if I were to just
draw a perfect star,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.030
if I were to just draw a
regular star like this.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.480
Let me just draw it like this.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.800
I'll draw it right over here.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.390
So this is just a regular star.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.310
All the lengths are equal.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.429
So I want to draw it a
little bit better than that.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.600
So if I just draw a star
like this right over here

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.299
or sometimes this would
be called a pentagram,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.120
some amazing things
start to happen here.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.110
The ratio of this pink
side to this blue length

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.880
right over here, that's
the golden ratio.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.140
The ratio of this
magenta to this pink

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.580
is the golden ratio, as
it should, by definition.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.710
Now the ratio of the
magenta to this orange

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.350
is also the golden ratio.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.950
It just keeps on showing up
in a ton of different ways

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.000
when you look at a
pentagram like this.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.370
If you look at something
like a pentagon,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.480
a regular pentagon
where all the angles

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.760
are the same and all
the sides are the same,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.460
a regular pentagon.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.970
If you take any of the
diagonals of a regular pentagon,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.130
so right over here, if you take
this diagonal right over here,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.117
the ratio of this green side
to--and when I'm talking about

00:09:31.117 --> 00:09:32.950
the diagonals, ones
that actually aren't one

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.450
of the edges-- the ratio of
any of the diagonals to any

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.290
of the sides is once
again, this golden ratio.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.600
So it keeps showing
up on and on and on.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.370
And we can do interesting
things with the golden ratio.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.230
Let's say that we had
a rectangle, where

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.100
the ratio of the width to the
height is the golden ratio.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.930
So let's try that out.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.760
So let's say that
this is its height.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.400
This is its width.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.480
And that the ratio--
So let's call this a.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.510
Let's call this b.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.390
And the ratio of a
to b is equal to phi.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.330
That 1.61 so on and so forth.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.040
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.060
So that is going
to be equal to phi.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.860
So that's something
interesting to do.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.400
Maybe that's a nice looking
rectangle of some sort.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.910
But let me put
out a square here.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.790
So let me separate this
into a b by b square.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.590
So this is a b by b
square right over here.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.320
And then-- actually let me do
it a little bit, let me draw it

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.600
a little bit differently,
this rectangle actually

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.200
isn't exactly the way I
would want to draw it--

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.670
so the ratio might look
a little bit like this.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.690
So the ratio of the
width to the length,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.190
or the width to the height, is
going to be the golden ratio.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.190
So a over b is going to
be that golden ratio.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.350
And let me separate out a
little b by b square over here.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.080
So this has width b as well.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.650
And so this distance right over
here is going to be a minus b.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:08.400
So now it is a b by
a minus b square.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.820
Actually, I should say,
we have a b by b square,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.770
right over here.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.040
This is b by b.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.240
And then we're left with a
b by a minus b rectangle.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.550
Now wouldn't it be cool if
this was also the golden ratio?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.810
And so let's try it out.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.430
Let's find the ratio
of b to a minus b.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.000
So the ratio of b to a minus b.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.920
Well, that's going to be equal
to 1 over the ratio of a minus

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.570
b to b.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.070
I just took the reciprocal
of this right over here.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.260
And this is just going to
be equal to 1 over a over b.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.570
Let me write this,
a over b minus 1.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.350
I just rewrote this right there.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.100
And that's just going to
be equal to 1 over phi.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.930
The ratio of a to b, we said,
by definition was phi minus 1.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.820
But what is phi minus 1?

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.830
Well phi minus 1 is 1 over phi.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.870
It's this cool number.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.780
So it's equal to 1 over 1 over
1 over phi, which is once again,

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.380
just equal to phi.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.270
So once again, the ratio
of this smaller rectangle,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.990
of its height to its
width, is once again

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.010
this golden ratio, this
number that keeps showing up.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.760
And then we could do
the same thing again.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.030
We could separate this into an
a minus b by a minus b square.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.140
Just like that.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.090
And then we'll have
another golden rectangle,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.756
sometimes it's called,
right over there.

00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:30.150
And then we could separate
that into a square

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.280
and another golden rectangle.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.570
Then we could separate
that into a square and then

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.481
another golden rectangle.

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:37.730
Then another golden rectangle.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.063
Actually let me do it like this.

00:12:39.063 --> 00:12:40.940
This would be better.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.940
So let me separate.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.890
Let me do the square up here.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.460
So this is an a minus
b by a minus b square

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.470
and then we have another golden
rectangle right over here.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.650
I could put a square
right in there.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.520
Then we'll have another
golden rectangle.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.604
Then we could put another
square right over there,

00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:00.020
you have another
golden rectangle.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.530
I think you see
where this is going.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.420
Another square, another
golden rectangle,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.200
which by itself starts to create
a cool design that we can keep

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.230
kind of circling
in and in and in.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.170
And then, if we actually
draw an arc here,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.000
something kind of cool happens.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.369
If we have an arc that
traces these things out,

00:13:15.369 --> 00:13:16.910
we have something,
a pattern that you

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.640
might have seen
many times before.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.140
And that pattern does not
look too different than what

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.476
you might see in something
like a nautilus shell.

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:27.350
And it shows up all over
the place in nature.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.220
And that makes sense
because just the way

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.085
cells construct themselves.

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:33.460
It kind of makes sense to be
the same at different scales

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.126
and the ratio from
one scale to the next

00:13:35.126 --> 00:13:38.490
is maybe the same as
the constituent ratios.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.530
This right here,
and it shows up all

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.490
over a lot of Leonardo
DaVinci's paintings.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.530
He never explicitly
stated it, but there's

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.030
a lot of interesting
ratios in them.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.550
But Salvador Dali, this painting
right here, The Sacrament

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.450
of the Last Supper,
he explicitly

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.170
used the golden ratio.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.740
So the actual ratio of
the width to the height

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.361
is the golden ratio, so
this is a golden rectangle.

00:13:59.361 --> 00:14:00.860
And also there's
all sorts of ratios

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.600
and I'll invite
you to explore it.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.696
The ratio of the different
parts of the tables

00:14:04.696 --> 00:14:06.070
to where it sits
in the painting.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.460
The golden ratio shows up
a ton in this painting.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.670
And then he does have
the pentagons over here.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.110
And we know that the ratio of
the diagonal of the pentagon

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.227
to the sides of the pentagon
are also the golden ratio.

00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:19.310
And so he just thought it
was a really cool thing.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.684
There's all sorts
of neat things.

00:14:20.684 --> 00:14:24.720
That if you find where these
two guys are bowing down are,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.840
if you draw that line right over
here, this is the golden ratio.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.050
The ratio of this
length right over here

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.292
to that length over there.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:32.500
Once again, the golden ratio.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.259
It just keeps showing
up in this painting.

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:36.050
So it's a really,
really, really cool thing

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.540
and I really encourage
you to explore this

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.760
further because it's
kind of exciting.
