00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.380
Here's the same information that we saw in the sequence diagram.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.430
There are three particular objects. One is a client, one is a transaction and

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.830
one is a proxy. There are lines between these particular objects.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.079
Notice that the lines are annotated with numbered message indicators.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.940
The numbers indicate the orders in which those messages take place.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.540
And it's using a kind of, Dewey Decimal notation. So, first step is number 1,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.054
then number 2. And then 2.1, 2.2 and then step 3.
