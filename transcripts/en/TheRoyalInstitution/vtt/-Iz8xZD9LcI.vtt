00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.740
 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.750
Could I have one of
those, please?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.080
And one of those, and one
of those, thank you.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.540
The retina of the eye is made up
of light sensitive cells--

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.150
photoreceptors called
rods and cones.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.270
The rods help you work out the
difference between light and

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.930
dark, whereas the cones help
you figure out what colour

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.340
that light is.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.590
Thanks very much.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.420
 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.710
You have three different
types of cones.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.640
One responds to blue light, one
responds to green light,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.260
and one responds to red light.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.780
Your brain takes all this
information from these

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.370
different receptors and more,
and mashes it all together to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880
give you a kind of impression
of the world.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.780
If there's something wrong with
your red cone, then the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.076
world looks a bit like this.

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.330
Or with your green cone,
a bit like this.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.340
Or with the blue receptor,
a bit like this.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.360
We call all these conditions
colour deficiencies, commonly

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.650
known as colour blindness.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.940
Thank you.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.150
This condition is much
more common in men.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.270
More than one in 20 men
have it, but less

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.790
than one in 100 women.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.130
But why?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.780
It's all down to your genes.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.100
Most of our chromosomes
come in pairs.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.030
We get one from each
of our parents.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.180
But the x chromosome
is different.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.830
Women have two x chromosomes,
one from their mum and one

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.110
from their dad.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.800
Men only have one x chromosome
that they get from their mum,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.470
and a y chromosome that they get
from their dad, which is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.470
much shorter, and in this
demonstration, quite tasty.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.245
The genes for colour blindness
are on the x chromosome.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.440
 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.410
If a woman has something wrong
with one of the copies of this

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.780
gene on one of her chromosomes,
then she's got

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.580
another copy on the other
chromosome to back it up.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.970
You need two broken copies of
the gene to make a woman

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.180
colour blind.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.380
As a man's only got one x
chromosome, if there's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.600
something wrong with that one
gene, then he'll be colour

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.700
blind and forever at risk
of choosing the wrong

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.950
flavour of ice cream.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:22.476
