00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.589
The map idea is something
that arose because I write

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.880
for The Guardian and I'm also--

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.710
Obviously, I'm a teacher at UCL.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.790
And you get used to explaining
fairly abstruse details

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.250
of physics to people.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.170
And if the audience
is paying attention

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.000
and if you're doing
your job properly,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.050
then it can kind of work.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.970
You can pretty much
explain anything.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.670
But then you realise that people
acquire a bit of knowledge here

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.650
and a bit of knowledge there and
they've no real idea of the big

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.260
picture, have these all
things linked together.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.490
So my idea of the map has sort
of come from how, in my head,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.340
I kind of view these things.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.940
The particle
physics, in general,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.520
and what we're trying to
do in particle physics

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.380
in terms of the big picture of
how these things fit together.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.320
So I'm going to try and
talk you through that.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320
You can think of it as--

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.620
I also get asked how do you
picture the strange things

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.860
that you study at CERN.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.490
Well this is, if you'd like, a
view of what goes on in my head

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.344
sometimes.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.760
What we're going to do here--
it could be quite disturbing

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.684
sometimes there.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:09.350
So I'm going to take you on some
journeys into particle physics.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.830
Now we don't have long enough
to go through the whole book.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.600
And I'm not going
to try, don't worry.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.950
So we'll skip over some bits.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.450
But we are going
to try and give you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.070
an idea of what our mission is.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.740
And what it's all
about is understanding

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.630
the fundamental
constituents of matter.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.659
What is the physical
universe made of when

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.700
you get right down to it?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.760
If you break things into
smaller and smaller pieces,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.380
do you end up with a common list
of the same pieces everything

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.020
is made of?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.240
And what are the forces
between those things?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.700
And the answer at the
moment is, yes you do.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.710
You end up with a finite number
of infinitely small, what

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.830
we call, fundamental objects
that everything else is

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.400
made of.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.840
And the first of those objects
was discovered by this guy.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.580
This is JJ Thompson at Cambridge
with his experiment sitting

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.400
on his desktop.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.360
And what he was doing was
studying a phenomenon,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.050
then was called cathode rays.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.480
This is his cathode ray tube.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.460
There's a gas in there
that's fluorescing

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.320
as these mysterious
rays pass through it.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.860
And you create them by
heating up an electrode here

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.630
and applying an
electromagnetic field.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.050
Which was all very cutting
edge stuff at the time.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.970
And he did various
experiments balancing

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.730
electric and magnetic
forces and showed

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.760
that these things were actually
corpuscules that always had

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.234
the same master charge ratio.

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.150
And then they devise
ways to measure the mass.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.740
And in the end it
convinced everyone

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.750
that these were not waves,
they were particles,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.470
they were electrons, in fact.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.440
And that, the electron
than was established

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.060
as the first
subatomic particle and

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.040
the first fundamental particle.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.532
And despite 100
years of trying, it's

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:42.740
still a fundamental particle.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.860
We have not managed to
break one of them yet.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.235
As far as we can see, there's
nothing inside an electron.

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:48.970
It is infinitely small.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.030
And it is our sort of
gateway to this map.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.470
So this is us on a little boat
here coming in from the west.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500
The west here is kind
of everyday life.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.777
And as we go further east
we get smaller and smaller

00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:04.360
and we go to higher
and higher energy.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.318
And I'll show you how
those things are actually

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.010
the same thing shortly.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.510
But the electron is our port of
access to this subatomic world.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.170
And the first place you
kind of go from there

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.080
is atomic physics.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.105
The electron is a
subatomic particle.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.360
There are electrons
in every atom.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.620
And you very quickly start--

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.380
you're able to work out
that an atom is not--

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.600
although an atom of say, sodium,
is the smallest piece of sodium

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.687
you can possibly get.

00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:37.270
It's not the smallest
piece of matter.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.010
You can break a sodium atom up.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.897
You can break it into
electrons and a nucleus.

00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:44.230
And it won't be sodium any more.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.960
But there are still smaller
things inside the atom,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.920
in sodium.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560
And the same for all atoms.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.420
So you start looking around
on the periodic table.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.347
And you find that life is a
little different in this map.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.680
We've travelled to something
that isn't actually looking

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.002
quite like everyday life.

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:06.460
And the first
manifestation of that

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.820
is that when you have electrons
bound to these nuclei,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.240
you find that
they're not allowed

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.620
to have just any old energy.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.140
They're bound in fixed orbits.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.339
Now orbits in the solar system,
which is the kind of model

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.740
that Bohr had for the atom.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.630
Orbits in the solar
system, once you

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.300
fix the distance of a
planet from the sun,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.800
than its velocity, is
period of orbit, is fixed.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.620
So there is a certain
lack of flexibility

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.250
already there, for
a stable orbit.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.895
But with the atoms
it's even worse.

00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.770
There's only certain
orbits that are allowed.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.510
In principle, the
earth could have--

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.674
it could be anywhere on
a continuum from the sun.

00:04:42.674 --> 00:04:44.590
It could be very hot or
it could be very cold.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.162
It can be anywhere in between.

00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:47.620
But that's not true
for an electron

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.661
going around the nucleus.

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:53.099
There's only certain energies
of orbit that it can have.

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.640
And it turns out
that that's actually

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.370
because the orbit model is
not a good model in the end.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.970
It's not a good picture
of what's going on.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.860
The best feature that's
going on is actually

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.620
you have to take this
fundamental particle

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.840
and you have to introduce
wavelike properties to it.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.140
Because the best analogy
that we think of here is you

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.310
can imagine where in nature are
the discontinuous things where

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.580
you can't have a contimum
of energies, for instance.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.750
And that happens with waves, it
happens on the guitar strings.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.890
So a guitar string will
support a fundamental note.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.850
It will support a
harmonic one octave up.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.469
It will support
the next harmonic.

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:29.760
But that's all it will support.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.510
You can't have notes
in between unless you

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.270
start pressing threats
down and changing

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.290
the length of the strings.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.395
And that's the analogy
that Bohr initially used.

00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:38.770
And that's the
analogy that leads

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.860
to quantum mechanics, in fact,
for how the electrons are

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.930
bound around an atom.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.420
So it turns out the
electrons can only

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.270
have these particular orbits
because that certain number

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.450
of wavelengths of the electron
fit into that particular orbit.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.030
There are certain
barren states that

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.150
have particular
resonant frequencies.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.952
And they're the only
ones that are allowed.

00:05:57.952 --> 00:05:59.410
And if you want to
change them, you

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.826
have to change the
electric charge

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:03.070
of the nucleus which
is like changing

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.882
the length of the string.

00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:09.271
So that means that when the
electrons jump between orbits,

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:11.020
and this is how we
knew this was the case,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.715
that they will emit energy
at certain frequencies,

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:15.956
at certain energy levels.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:17.330
And that is, in
fact, how we know

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.020
what anything that we
can't touch or smell

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.900
is actually made of.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.750
So this is a spectrum,
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.070
of a fluorescent bulb.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.652
You can see as you excite
the electrons in there,

00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:32.360
they're jumping between
particular levels

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.026
and they give off
particular wavelengths

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:36.690
of light corresponding
to those energy levels.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.620
And likewise, this is a
spectrum, this is from the sun.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.686
This is the emission
spectrum of the sun.

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:43.310
And you see there
are dark lines in it.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.768
And each one of
these dark lines is

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:47.260
where elements in
the sun's atmosphere

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.100
are absorbing
particular energies

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.870
because those energies,
the electrons,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.550
can jump between levels.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.490
And these characterise the
elements there in the sun.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.800
So the only reason
that we know what

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.860
the stars and the planets
that are not our own planet

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.390
are made of, is by observing
these kind of emission spectra.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.555
In fact, the element helium
was just called helium

00:07:06.555 --> 00:07:07.900
from Heliox, the sun god.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.280
It was discovered on the
sun before we discovered it

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.820
on the earth by looking
at emission lines.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.550
So that introduces, although
the electron started off

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.830
as a fundamental
particle, it's now

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.050
suddenly got wavelike
properties because it's

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.970
like a note on a guitar string.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.410
And that's the kind of, the
insight in quantum mechanics,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.945
actually these fundamental
particles are not particles.

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:31.560
Neither are the ruby waves.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.520
They're a new kind of object
called a quantum excitation,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.120
if you like.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.640
But because of those
wavelike properties,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.630
there's then the very clear
connection between the energy

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.740
and the size.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.727
So on this map, as we
go east, we're going--

00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:49.310
looking at smaller
and smaller things,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.643
deeper into the heart of matter.

00:07:50.643 --> 00:07:52.550
But we're also
going up in energy.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.460
And the best way of illustrating
that connection here

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.330
is in this little
video that I've got,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.840
which I hope I can make work.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.874
This is super high tech.

00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:02.290
You're going to
see a ripple tank.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.750
But I think it really
shows you what's going on.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.970
And this is this connection
between the very small

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.360
and the very large.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.690
So if you imagine this as a
beam of particles, and this

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.920
is my detector here.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.950
OK, and I'm looking
for some new particle.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.960
So someone is going to put
a blob in there in a moment.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.070
Come on with the blob.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.700
They always take longer than
I think they're going to.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.440
So they put a blob in there.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.814
You guys see how a particle
detector will have spotted it

00:08:29.814 --> 00:08:31.530
because this is a shadow.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.305
So you could register
this presence.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:34.679
If you did some
calculations, you

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.770
could probably tell what
size it was, maybe even what

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.393
shape it was if you were very
careful with your measurements.

00:08:40.393 --> 00:08:41.684
So that works as an experiment.

00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:43.919
Now they put another blob in.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.940
This blob now is
completely invisible.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.610
If you look, the
detecter can't see it

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.604
because the waves
reform around it.

00:08:49.604 --> 00:08:52.020
And that's because the blob
is smaller than the wavelength

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.731
of the waves.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:54.480
So we don't have the
resolution to see it.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.370
So what do we do, we
turn up the energy,

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.720
which turns up the frequency,
shortens the wavelength.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200
And now you see the
shadow forming again,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.050
you can see it again.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.560
So that's really
this connection.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.143
That's what particle
physics is about.

00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:10.080
That's why we have
high energy machines.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.050
Because we want to
see small stuff.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.580
If we want to see small stuff,
we need short wavelengths.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.489
If we want short
wavelengths we need to see--

00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:21.030
We need to-- sorry,
I've just spotted

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.845
an old friend in the audience.

00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:22.590
It put me off.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.786
Hi, Nigel!

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.285
If you want to see small things,
you need short wavelengths.

00:09:30.285 --> 00:09:33.750
So that means high frequency,
which means high energy.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.720
So that's why particle physics
is also high energy physics.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.240
That's why we need huge
colliders and things to try

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.420
and see the very small stuff,
because of this connection

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.630
between wavelength,
frequency and resolution.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.047
If you think about it, if our
eyes are sensitive to radar,

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:52.629
then I wouldn't be
able to see you now

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:54.390
because radar has
wavelengths of metres

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.681
and you'd be smaller than that.

00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:56.602
So I wouldn't see you.

00:09:56.602 --> 00:09:58.560
But our eyes are actually
sensitive to hundreds

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.866
of nanometers, which is pretty
good for seeing small stuff.

00:10:01.866 --> 00:10:03.240
But if you wanted
to see smaller,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.820
you'd go up in energy, which
means x-rays, or electron

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.230
microscopes, and in it.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.730
So you can think
of the big particle

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.438
colliders like the
Large Hadron Collider,

00:10:10.438 --> 00:10:12.000
is just the biggest,
most powerful,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.532
highest resolution
microscopes we can build.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.990
So I've already mentioned the
Large Hadron Collider, that's

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.970
one of the stars of the show.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.020
At least you get to
the east of the map.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.380
So I'm kind of
skipping over a whole

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.370
of the rest of this
stuff, which is

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:32.080
there is kind of our exploration
of the subatomic world.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.420
And bringing you right
up to date to what's

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.515
going on the east coast.

00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:38.660
So this, this is
if you like, this

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.952
is the standard model on
the threshold of ruining

00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:42.035
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:10:42.035 --> 00:10:44.810
Now that's my, the weird
stuff that goes on in my head,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.310
if you like.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.380
This is a more conventional way
of viewing the standard model.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:55.420
It tells us that we
have the electron here,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.760
our old friend that we saw.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.460
It's been around
for a long time.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.320
It has a neutrino that
comes with it, which

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.780
is actually very hard to see.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.930
There are lots of
them in this room,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.180
they don't interact very much.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.350
But they're emitted,
for instance, copiously

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.352
from the sun.

00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:10.060
And then we have here
the quarks-- the up

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.940
quark and the down quark.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.720
And if you take an
up and a down quark,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.710
you take two ups and a
down, you can make a proton.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.500
If you take two downs and an
up, you can make a neutron.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.940
If you take protons
and neutrons,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.514
you can make every atomic
nucleus in the periodic table.

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:24.680
If you add the electrons,
you can make every element

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.596
in the periodic table.

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:28.860
And every molecule, and
then so on from there.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.400
So in principle, this is
enough to build everything,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.380
so long as you
include the forces

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.010
like the photon and the gluon,
the strong nuclear force

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.060
is what holds quarks together.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.270
The photon, which is what's
coming out of this laser,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.980
and this is the
electromagnetic force carrier.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.790
And then the W and the zad,
which carried a weak force.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.095
Which is always hard to say
what the weak force does

00:11:49.095 --> 00:11:50.720
because it's so short
range, it doesn't

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.530
get outside the atomic nucleus.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.340
But it is, for instance,
integral to the fusion

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.660
reactions and the sun.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.760
So it's kind of important.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.660
The sun wouldn't
work without it.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.800
And it's the only force the
neutrinos actually experience.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.290
And so that looks like
we got everything really.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.510
But then for the reasons
that are not clear,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.830
these are copied again.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.080
So here we have the charm
quark and the strange quark,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.120
which are like the up and
the down only heavier.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.550
The muon, which is like
the electron, only heavier

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.745
and its neutrino.

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:20.120
And then the top and the bottom
quarks are heavier again.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.180
And the tau lepton and so on.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.816
And then it stops.

00:12:23.816 --> 00:12:25.190
There's no more
copies like that.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.620
There might be other particles
that will come to the end,

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.620
but there's certainly
nothing like this anymore.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.086
We know that.

00:12:31.086 --> 00:12:35.024
And that looks like
everything in the universe

00:12:35.024 --> 00:12:35.690
is made of this.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.523
And this stuff is not
made of anything else.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:38.870
This is fundamental.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.330
And that's where we were when
we turned on the last chapter

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.484
on Collider, and you
could express that.

00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:44.900
We know so much
about this theory.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.480
You could actually
express it mathematically

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.340
and do very precise
calculations with it

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.620
and, actually, correlate
the parameters in it.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.130
So what you see here is a
plot from March 2012, which

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.180
is a significant date, as you
will see in a moment, where

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.534
we've got two of the things
that are not very well known

00:13:01.534 --> 00:13:02.450
in the Standard Model.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.550
So this is the mass
of the top quark.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.350
This is the mass of
the W boson, which

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.237
is one of the carriers
of the weak force.

00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:10.070
Of all the parameters
in the Standard Model,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.410
these are the kind of
two least constrained.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.850
So we're looking at where--

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.470
what all the
calculations tell us,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.269
how they have to be correlated.

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:18.810
And you see these
grey bands on here.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.100
They're telling us where
the missing element

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.320
from the Standard Model is.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.920
And there is a missing element,
which I kind of skipped over,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.230
which is the fact that in the
Standard Model, as I described

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.500
it here, we have a real problem
in that we can't actually

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.260
accommodate the mass
of these particles.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.190
So we know that the
W and the Z boson,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.890
in particular,
have a lot of mass.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.001
As the model was written
down on that slide,

00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:46.500
you can't actually
accommodate that.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.340
What was postulated to
explain that mass is the Higgs

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.170
boson, which you've
probably heard of,

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.760
and which is shown here.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.920
And at this stage,
we could kind of

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.470
say, well, for this whole
theory tying together, A, there

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.460
has to be a Higgs boson, or more
than that, its mass has to lie

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.930
within one of these bands.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.260
Because it has to intersect
these limits here.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.611
Everything else was excluded.

00:14:10.611 --> 00:14:12.110
If it was here,
we'd have a problem,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.526
because it's looking
like it's not

00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:16.140
within the allowed region
from the other parameters.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.790
So it really sort of
had to be in this band.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.450
And that, in terms
of the map, that's

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.736
this fuzzy coastline here.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.360
We don't actually
know what's going on.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.180
We've got the W and
the Z boson here.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.510
They have to have mass.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.120
In order to have mass, we
have to have A Higgs boson,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.570
but we've actually not been
able to survey this land at all.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.990
And that's, of course, where
my experiment comes in.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.359
A little bigger
than JJ Simpson's.

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:40.150
It's not just mine.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.600
There's a few other
people involved.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.240
This is the view you get as you
approach Geneva Airport, which

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:47.740
is here.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.670
This is Mont Blanc
on the horizon.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.997
This is Lake Geneva.

00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:53.080
And this, of course, is
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.500
And what we're doing in there
is colliding the two highest

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.540
energy beams of
particles that we've ever

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.860
managed to control, and
steer, and accelerate.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.790
We're bringing them into
a head-on collision.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.150
Four points on the ring--

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:12.290
CMS over here, ALICE here,
ATLAS here, LHCb here.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.407
We're surrounding those
points with detectors

00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:16.240
that will allow us to
detect the debris when

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.680
the particles collide, and
we're making measurements.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.930
And you know now that
because this is high energy,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.429
these measurements
will be giving us

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:26.860
clues about the very, very
smallest detail that you can

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:31.294
see inside of the proton, which
we know, inside the proton,

00:15:31.294 --> 00:15:32.460
there are quarks and gluons.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.014
But maybe this
could even-- shows

00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:35.180
this stuff inside the quark.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.930
Maybe for the first time,
we'll get over the edge

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.450
and see something there.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.000
And in particular, maybe we
will get over to the east coast

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.510
here.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.530
Well, we certainly will.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.080
It was built in order to have
enough energy to get over

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.470
to the east coast of what we
call-- where the bosons live--

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.915
Bosonia-- and see
what's going on

00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:54.790
and whether the Higgs
is really there or not.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.100
So you probably know
the answer to that.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.805
And we did discover
the Higgs boson.

00:15:58.805 --> 00:16:00.430
If we didn't, the
Nobel Prize Committee

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.342
is going to be very embarrassed.

00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:04.300
But I want to show you
the data, and I want you

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.591
to kind of understand the data.

00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:08.005
Because, also, how
we discovered that

00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:11.410
is important to what we're
doing now and why what

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.110
we're doing now is
important and interesting.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.540
So this is the most
technical of the talk.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.040
Don't panic.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.340
It doesn't get any
worse than this.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.010
This is a diagram representing
a particle collision.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.357
This is how we look at
these particle collisions.

00:16:28.357 --> 00:16:29.440
This is a Feynman diagram.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.898
I'm sure lots of you have seen
them before, but some of you

00:16:31.898 --> 00:16:35.140
certainly will not have done.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.110
They're really intuitive
little cartoons

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.420
of how a particle
collision happens.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.750
So this is supposed to be
an electron coming in here--

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.650
or positron, which
is the anti-particle

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.750
of an electron coming in here.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.040
Annihilation to a photon--
it's the wiggly line here.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.112
And then decay, back again
to electron and a positron.

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:55.160
Now, that's the kind
of intuitive cartoon

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.660
of what might happen
if you collided

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.940
an electron and a
positron together.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.640
But it's more than that,
because every line and vertex

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.930
in this diagram has
a corresponding term

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.163
in the equations you would write
down in quantum field theory

00:17:09.163 --> 00:17:11.329
to actually calculate the
probability of this really

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.490
happening, OK?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.680
And there's a problem
in this if you

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.250
take what we know about physics
and you try and look at this.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.750
If you treat it
classically, there's

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.440
a problem in that we know
that energy is conserved.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.319
So if there's a
lot of energy here,

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.072
there has to be a
lot of energy here.

00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:30.530
There will be a
lot of energy here.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.849
This is what you put in.

00:17:31.849 --> 00:17:32.890
This is what you measure.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.100
So we know there's
lots of energy.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.050
So there must be lots
of energy in the middle,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.370
because energy is conserved.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.090
We also know that energy
is equal to mc squared.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.100
It equals mc squared.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.058
The energy is equal to
the mass of the particle

00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:46.610
times the speed of light
squared of the particle

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.840
if the particle is at rest.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.673
And this guy in the
middle would be at rest,

00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:52.710
because you do it in
the central mass frame.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.810
And we also know that
the mass of the photon

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.400
is zero, which is
a bit of a problem.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.230
Because c squared may be
big, but it's not big.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.320
If n is 0, then mc
squared will be 0,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.750
and energy in the
middle, then, would be 0.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.349
So that's an apparent
contradiction.

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:07.890
And the way around
that contradiction

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.310
in quantum mechanics is--

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.060
as you say, well, actually,
this particle is never observed.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.610
In some sense, it's
not a real particle.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.370
It's required, because if you
don't put it in the equations,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.770
you don't get the right
answer for the probabilities.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.982
But you never observe it.

00:18:20.982 --> 00:18:22.440
It's like in a
two-slit experiment,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.926
trying to ask which slit
the particle went through.

00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:26.550
You're kind of not
really observing it.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.470
Although, the
presence of both slits

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.010
clearly determines
the result you see.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.050
And so we call them
virtual particles.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.220
We say they're not real.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.780
And virtual
particles are allowed

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.870
to have a mass that isn't
exactly what the mass

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.530
of the real version would be.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.780
So our real focus on
those types of zero mass--

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.510
the virtual one doesn't have to.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.090
Now, as a residual--

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.260
as a kind of memory of
what the real mass would

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.140
be in the virtual
particle, there's much more

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.190
chance of this happening if
the particle in the middle

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.495
can have the right mass.

00:18:57.495 --> 00:18:59.370
But if it has to have
the wrong mass in order

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.350
to conserve energy,
then the probability

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.250
doesn't drop to zero.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.180
It will drop, but it will
not drop completely to zero.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.642
OK, so that might tell you--

00:19:06.642 --> 00:19:08.100
it might make you
think-- actually,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.720
this is a pretty silly
experiment to do.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.053
Because if the photon was
zero mass, the more energy you

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:14.490
put in these beams, the less
likely this is to happen,

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.380
the less events you're
going to collect.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.790
Why are you doing that?

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.099
The reason we did it at
CERN, before we had the LHC,

00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:23.640
is because there's
another particle--

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.020
can be in this diagram--
the Z boson, which is the--

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.340
if you remember, it was
one of the force carriers

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.070
of the weak force,
along with the W.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.790
And the Z does have mass.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.860
The Z has a mass about 90
times the mass of the proton.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.740
So if you chain
things up, you can

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.480
make the energies here match.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.710
Then you can make
these guys have

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.620
total energy that's 90 times
the mass of the proton.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.690
And then the Z can have
exactly the right energy

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.870
in the middle of that diagram,
and everything will work.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:53.870
And that's what you see.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.510
So that's the technical
bit, over really,

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.100
because everything
I've just told you

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.250
is now shown again in this plot.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.570
What this plot is showing
you is the probability

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.852
of that process happening, OK?

00:20:04.852 --> 00:20:07.185
Or, actually, with a different
decay, but it's the same.

00:20:07.185 --> 00:20:09.190
The probability of the
electron and the positron

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.657
annihilating to a
photon or a Z. And this

00:20:12.657 --> 00:20:14.740
is as a function of
essentially mass energy, which

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.540
is essentially just the
energy of the wiggly line

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.900
in the middle, or the mass--

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.330
the factor of c squared
in between them.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.360
So what you see
is all the things

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.306
I just described to you,
in that as you push a zero,

00:20:25.306 --> 00:20:27.430
the probability is very
high, because the photon is

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.630
very near its correct mass.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.510
As you push to higher
and higher energies,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.360
the probability drops and drops.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.980
Then as you get to
the mass of the Z--

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.480
when the Z cannot
be a correct mass,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.290
you get a peak in
the probability.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.836
And that's because
at that point,

00:20:41.836 --> 00:20:42.960
those three things line up.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.260
Energy conservation
equals mc squared,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.772
and the Z has the right
mass, till you get its peak.

00:20:47.772 --> 00:20:49.230
And then as you go
higher again, it

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.270
drops again, because
the Z has got to have

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.154
too much mass as well in there.

00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.570
The reason I'm
showing you this is

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.254
because this is basically how
you discover a new particle.

00:20:57.254 --> 00:20:58.920
When you collide two
particles together,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.060
you've got a mass
of stuff produced.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.880
But if there's a new
particle in there

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.290
and you measure the
products of that collision,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.090
then you'll see a peak when
the products of that collision

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.970
lead to it--

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.460
can come from a particle
of the right mass.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.066
So if you make a
Higgs boson, one

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:15.690
of the things it can
decay to is a pair

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.240
of photons, which is
what's shown here.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.191
This is a picture from the ATLAS
detector on the Large Hadron

00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:21.690
Collider.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.000
So if you imagine, this is a
slice through the detector.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.132
It's called the
detector cylinder.

00:21:27.132 --> 00:21:28.590
You imagine one of
the beams coming

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.450
from behind-- from the
back of the room and one

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.699
coming from behind the screen.

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:33.180
And they collide
in the middle here

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.210
and then get these debris
produced when they collide.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.697
Most of this is
not so interesting,

00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:39.780
but these two yellow blobs
are really high energy.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.090
You see the histogram here.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.347
So those are two
photons produced.

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:48.680
One of the things that might
have produced those photons

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.700
is actually that somewhere
in your collision,

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.366
you had a diagram
like the one I showed,

00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:54.770
but it produced the Higgs
boson in the middle.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.335
So you can count those photons.

00:21:56.335 --> 00:21:57.835
You can detect the
pairs of photons.

00:21:57.835 --> 00:22:00.196
And you can do a
bit of calculation

00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:02.570
and say, well, if those photons
came from a new particle,

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.820
what would its mass have been?

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.430
What would the mass
of the wiggly line

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.300
in the middle of that
diagram, basically, have been?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.617
And you could just plot them.

00:22:09.617 --> 00:22:11.450
I'm going to show you
a plot, which is apart

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.380
from the animation-- the same
as the plot you just saw before,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.920
pretty much.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.750
You've got the number of times,
the number of pairs of photons

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.610
up here.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.220
You've got the mass
of the particle that

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.200
might have produced
those photons there,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.450
and you're looking for a bump.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.770
And then you see there's
a lot of statistics,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.310
a lot of fake bumps, which all
kind of recede into the noise,

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.080
but one bump, which
grows and stays--

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.741
which is this one here.

00:22:36.741 --> 00:22:37.740
And that's the evidence.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.580
The first evidence for the fact
that the Higgs boson exists.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.060
And at that point at
125, roughly times

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.640
the mass of the proton,
you have a coincidence,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.780
where now you have a diagram
where two gluons, in fact,

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.320
interlay.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.840
There's a Higgs boson produced
in the case of two photons.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.000
And at that point,
energy conservation

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.150
and the mass of the
Higgs equals mc squared--

00:22:59.150 --> 00:22:59.780
all line up.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.750
And you get a peak in the
probability, which is there.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.010
And if you see it today--

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.580
I showed you a plot from just
before this was announced.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.140
We announced this
on the 4th of July,

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.540
actually 2012, and then
collected a bit more data

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.040
afterwards.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.971
But you see the dates of
which this data was collected.

00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:17.720
That was the discovery
of the Higgs boson.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.190
That was the point
at which we went

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:24.170
from this map with fuzziness
in the east to this map,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.220
where we filled in--

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.800
we find there's a kind of
ridge of mountains here,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.430
which is what we call the
physics changes at that point.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.660
You have the electroweak
symmetry breaking scale.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.599
But, indeed, the Higgs
boson was there as expected,

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:39.140
sitting on the edge
of the coastline,

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.750
there in the extremities
of our knowledge

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.840
in the frontier of energy.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.071
But going back to the
more conventional view,

00:23:47.071 --> 00:23:49.320
this is what we had, before
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.554
and then after the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:23:51.554 --> 00:23:53.970
We had the Higgs boson kind
of making the whole thing hang

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.110
together and allowing the
other particles to have mass.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.470
So that was 2012-- what
we've been doing since.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.410
It was the Higgs boson-- is
the last fundamental particle.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.602
I started with the electron.

00:24:05.602 --> 00:24:07.560
Maybe that's the beginning
of particle physics.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.600
Is particle physics over now?

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.100
Well, no.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.320
There are a few things
missing from this map.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.046
One of them is someone who can
draw Isaac Newton properly.

00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:21.980
But this is supposed to be--

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.720
represent gravity, of course.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.500
There is no mention
in our Standard

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.610
Model of particle physics.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.980
There's no feature on that
map which represents gravity.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.680
So we do have a good
theory of gravity.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.180
We have Einstein's
general relativity,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.400
which gives us a very good
theoretical model, absolutely

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.065
beautiful, and a very
precise theoretical model

00:24:41.065 --> 00:24:42.180
of how matter occurs--

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.070
space-time and how
that leads to gravity.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.480
So you could take the view
that I don't care, OK?

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.280
I've got a Standard Model of
particle physics over here.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.630
Quantum mechanics.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.910
I've got general relativity over
here, which describes gravity.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.504
OK, so they don't work very
well together near a black hole,

00:24:59.504 --> 00:25:01.170
or in the Big Bang,
or whatever, but I'm

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.310
going to ignore that and
just get on with life.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.149
Now, that's not
very satisfactory.

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:06.690
It would allow you
to do most things.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.390
For all practical
purposes, it's not the way

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.120
we like to think about physics.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.899
And also, it's not
good enough anyway,

00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:15.690
even if you want to
just get on and explain

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.320
everyday observations.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.870
So the conflicts between
gravity and quantum mechanics

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.630
at the moment are basically
down to thought experiments,

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.230
but there are real observations
that don't work as well.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.870
So even if you buy general
relativity and quantum

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.560
mechanics and don't worry
about the thought experiments,

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.590
you still cannot explain
how fast stars rotate around

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.932
galaxies.

00:25:38.932 --> 00:25:40.390
If you do the
calculations, you say

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.490
this is how much matter
I see in the galaxy.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.180
It comes from the
Standard Model.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.880
And this is the gravitational
force it should produce.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.860
It comes from
general relativity,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.524
and this is how
fast they're going.

00:25:51.524 --> 00:25:52.440
Then the answer is no.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.204
Then that's not right, because
they're going too fast.

00:25:55.204 --> 00:25:56.370
The galaxy should fly apart.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.050
There isn't enough
gravity to keep

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.740
them spinning at that speed
without them flying off.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.860
So something is awry.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.640
Something has gone wrong.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.660
And obviously,
this is a conflict

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.700
between the Standard
Model, which tells you

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.245
how much mass is in the galaxy
and the general relativity,

00:26:12.245 --> 00:26:14.130
which tells you how
much gravitational

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.460
force that would produce.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.886
And you can say, well--
also, either gravity is wrong

00:26:20.886 --> 00:26:22.510
and there are people
trying to change--

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.890
modify general relativity to
account for that, or you say,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.780
well, actually, there's
more matter in the galaxy

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.730
than we think, and we
call it dark matter.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.010
And it's not part of
the Standard Model.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.450
And we fill the
galaxy with that,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.940
and that provides the
extra gravitational force.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.680
It means things
can sit together.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.427
It means the whole
thing hangs together.

00:26:43.427 --> 00:26:45.900
Now, so you broke--
you've got to break--

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.884
at minimum, either one of the
theories has to be modified.

00:26:48.884 --> 00:26:51.300
Most likely in such a situation,
both of them will change.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.160
And there are other
ancillary-- there's

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.369
a lot more evidence than
just galaxy rotation curves,

00:26:58.369 --> 00:26:59.993
now that there's
something going wrong,

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:01.470
and that it's
probably dark matter.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.830
I would say that most physicists
think dark matter is out there,

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.920
but there are still people
working on modifying gravity,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.000
so you don't need it.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.220
So that's one massive--

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.460
actually, if you do the
sums in the calculations,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.890
it tells you that something
like 80% of the universe

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.752
is dark matter, so it's
not a small correction.

00:27:19.752 --> 00:27:21.210
It's kind of
embarrassing if you're

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.957
trying to explain what the
whole of the universe is.

00:27:23.957 --> 00:27:26.040
And so that claim I made
about the Standard Model,

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.080
that everything is
made of this, is

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.865
clearly wrong by a factor of
five or something, at least.

00:27:31.865 --> 00:27:34.770
So that's pretty bad.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.860
There are other things
missing from our map.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.374
One of them I should--

00:27:39.374 --> 00:27:41.040
Jenny has probably
noticed this already.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.706
But down in the corner, there is
another fuzzy bit of an island,

00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:44.550
actually.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.050
Down here where the
neutrinos live--

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.591
we don't really know
what's going on.

00:27:47.591 --> 00:27:51.150
We only rather recently got into
this region with any confidence

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.330
and discovered that the
neutrinos have mass,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.480
and that they are mixed
up amongst each other.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.855
We still don't know, actually,
whether the neutrinos have

00:27:57.855 --> 00:28:00.240
their own anti-particles, which
is why it sort of fades out,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.323
before it gets into the
southern hemisphere, which

00:28:02.323 --> 00:28:04.830
represents anti-matter in my
twisted view of the Standard

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.840
Model.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.250
So this is an area, also,
where there's unsurveyed land--

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.140
where there are experiments
planned and in operation

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.080
that we'll be shedding light
on-- what's going on there.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.560
That may give us some clue.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.080
There's another--
actually, not as

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.960
gravity missing from
the Standard Model.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.300
Another kind of
major embarrassment,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.924
really, is the fact that most
of the theories in this--

00:28:26.924 --> 00:28:28.590
most of the forces
in the Standard Model

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.260
treat matter and
anti-matter identically.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.177
So if you start off
with a Big Bang,

00:28:33.177 --> 00:28:35.010
you should end up naively
with equal amounts

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.400
of matter and anti-matter
around in the universe.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.889
That's not true.

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:41.430
It's certainly not
true on the Earth,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.140
otherwise it wouldn't
be here, I guess.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.270
But as far as we can tell,
it's also-- all the galaxies

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.936
are made of matter
as far as we can see,

00:28:46.936 --> 00:28:50.880
otherwise we'd see
annihilation, kind of boundaries

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.410
between them, and things where
matter and anti-matter come

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:53.910
together.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.225
So as far as we can see,
the visible universe

00:28:57.225 --> 00:28:59.200
is made entirely of matter.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.010
Anti-matter is easy to produce.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.010
And it should presumably
been produced copiously

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.490
in the Big Bang, but
it's not around anymore.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.510
So we know there are some
clues in the Standard

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.550
Model as to where that
might have come from.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.260
In fact, it's
connected to the fact

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.245
that there are three
copies of matter.

00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:16.870
Once you've got three
copies of matter,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.092
you can introduce slight
differences between the way

00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.550
matter and anti-matter
are treated.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.750
And, indeed, there are those
differences in the weak force.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.720
And, interestingly, if
you have only two copies,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.282
you can't have
those differences.

00:29:30.282 --> 00:29:31.990
Three is the minimum
number of copies you

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.210
need in order to have those.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.126
And three seems to be
what there is in nature,

00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:37.940
so maybe there's a clue
there as to what's going on,

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.010
but it's only a clue.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.920
We don't have a
theory behind it yet.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.440
And the little bits of violation
of the symmetry between matter

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.230
and anti-matter that we
see in the Standard Model

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.780
are not enough to explain
the gross discrepancy that we

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.560
see in the world around us.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.670
The neutrinos may provide
another source of difference

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.190
between matter and anti-matter.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.710
They may even be their own
anti-particles, as I say.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.190
So there's a lot to find out
in that little bit of the world

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.270
as well.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.330
But, really, what we're doing
is looking off the map now.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.240
So I think what we've been
doing in the last five years

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.500
at the Large Hadron Collider--

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.920
I think we've been sort of
sitting on the coastline

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.520
here in the port, sometimes
just sitting around in bars,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.310
listening to wild
stories from theorists

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.310
who've claimed that they've
seen stuff out here.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.690
But we have a ship.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.390
We have a vessel that's sailing.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.010
We're actually
sailing these seas

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.480
with the Large Hadron Collider.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.729
And what you see here is--

00:30:33.729 --> 00:30:34.270
I don't know.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.310
We've got quantum
gravity here, which

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.900
presumably is there somewhere.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.070
We have dark matter.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.134
Something may or
may not be there.

00:30:41.134 --> 00:30:42.300
Maybe these are just dreams.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.300
Maybe something else
entirely going on.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.100
But this is what we're doing.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.141
We have the large hadron.

00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:52.610
As you saw in the animation
with the Higgs bump,

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.600
you saw the points, and
there were error bars.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.100
And as you take
more data, the error

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.516
bars shrink and
shrink and shrink.

00:30:57.516 --> 00:30:59.558
And it's only when they
shrink some point smaller

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:01.432
than the bump that you
actually see the bump.

00:31:01.432 --> 00:31:02.680
You can actually resolve it.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.971
That's really what we're doing.

00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:08.062
We're repeating the same
experiment over and over again.

00:31:08.062 --> 00:31:09.520
As I said, it's
not rocket science.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.459
I don't know.

00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:11.500
We're just sitting there.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.520
We got the beams colliding.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.410
Let's just keep them
colliding as often as possible

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:15.280
and record what happens.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.360
You might think that,
how are we going

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.800
to learn new stuff from that?

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.230
Well, you already saw
in that Higgs plot

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.730
with just a few things there.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.090
The error bars are too big.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.569
There were fake
bumps everywhere.

00:31:24.569 --> 00:31:26.360
You can't work out
anything from the noise.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.690
As you shrink the statistical
uncertainties down,

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.860
you learn more.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.885
It's like if I have a dice.

00:31:32.885 --> 00:31:35.260
If I have a dice and I want
to know, is this a fair dice?

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.880
You could say,
asking the question,

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.350
is the Standard Model working?

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.820
Is the Higgs really there?

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.380
It's like saying,
is this dice fair?

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.970
So I rolled it six times.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.730
And I say, well, the prediction
is if it's a fair dice,

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.505
I should get one 1, one 2, one
3, one 4, one 5, and one 6.

00:31:49.505 --> 00:31:51.130
And I don't when I
rolled it six times.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.745
So, do I conclude?

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:55.120
Well, I conclude nothing, of
course, because that's never

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.260
going to happen.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.360
Very unlikely that you
would just get one of each.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.276
But if I roll the dice,
I've got the patience,

00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:02.130
and I roll the dice
six million times,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.060
then I should really get about a
million 1s, about a million 2s,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.120
about a million 3s,
and about-- and so on.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.951
And if I don't, then
the dice is biassed, OK?

00:32:09.951 --> 00:32:11.200
So that's really where we are.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.010
It's like, how fair is the dice?

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.230
And you can carry on asking
that question forever.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.720
But you're certainly
at the level--

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.360
at the moment now, we only
know at the level of 10--

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.055
20%, whether the
Higgs is really doing

00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:22.930
what it's supposed to
be doing, for instance,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.360
or whether any of these
monsters are actually there.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.550
And as we collect
more data, then we'll

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.220
be either pressing down on
them and ruling them out,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.590
or we'll be finding them.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.080
Just to show you the
kind of game we play,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.060
you know what these
diagrams do now.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.790
This is a diagram just like the
one I had before with, I said,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.190
a quark and an anti-quark
correlating and then

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.537
with a made-up particle
in the middle, OK?

00:32:44.537 --> 00:32:46.870
Call it Z prime, because we
don't have much imagination.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.070
But this is a new particle
with some unknown mass.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.150
And you can say,
well, OK, I know

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.000
how to calculate that diagram
with my made-up particle.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.810
I can go look for it and see.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.830
And if it was there, it would
show up in one of these bumps.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.790
And the data are here.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.350
And today I don't have
any bumps in them.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.230
This is not a bump.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.230
This is just a turnover.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.130
This is the way we
selected the data.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.480
So there are no bumps--

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.850
so there's no-- that
theory is wrong.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.430
And this kind of process
is going on over and over

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.900
and over again
with people trying

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.690
to find ways of explaining
some of the missing

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.616
things on the map.

00:33:17.616 --> 00:33:19.990
They're looking for what the
consequence of those missing

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.120
things would be and
seeing with the data--

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.590
show any bumps in there,
that would possibly

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.060
betray that evidence, and
give evidence for that.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.720
There is another way.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.380
The data on the
Higgs in this slide

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.020
are shown from the ATLAS
and CMS experiments.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.960
I'm on the ATLAS
experiment, actually.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.920
They're the kind of
rivals that what we call

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.840
the general-purpose detectors.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.590
One of the other experiments on
there is doing something else.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.650
It's actually collecting
a lot of particles,

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.286
a lot of hadrons, which
have got quarks inside them.

00:33:50.286 --> 00:33:52.660
It's collecting a lot of those
with b quarks inside them.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.850
And it's measuring their
decays very precisely,

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.882
because the Standard Model
doesn't just tell you

00:33:56.882 --> 00:33:58.090
how particles stick together.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.250
It tells you, also,
how they decay.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.020
And there are some interesting
hints coming from there.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.860
In such talks, it's good to show
some of the-- we're watching

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.380
a lot of weird plots and
worrying about whether

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.342
the noise--

00:34:09.342 --> 00:34:11.800
whether the data is going to
be different from the Standard

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.714
Model or not.

00:34:12.714 --> 00:34:14.380
What you're looking
at here is a thought

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.546
from this other experiment--

00:34:15.546 --> 00:34:17.260
LHCb here.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.147
It has data from the
other experiments on it,

00:34:19.147 --> 00:34:20.980
but LHCb is much better
at this measurement,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.260
because that's what
it was designed to do.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.900
And what you see here is--

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.380
the decay of a particular
particle-- this B0 particle

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.690
decaying to another hadron
and a pair of new ones.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.190
It's not really
important, actually,

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.480
what the particulate decay is.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.429
It's said that the
decay can be calculated

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.440
very precisely in
the Standard Model,

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.210
and then measured by LHCb
in the LHCb data, the most

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.770
precise in this
scatter of things,

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.365
which are the black ones here.

00:34:46.365 --> 00:34:47.739
And the Standard
Model prediction

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.810
is these yellow boxes
with their uncertainties.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.670
And you can see
there's a deviation.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.429
Now, if that deviation
is true-- is correct,

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.860
then the Standard
Model is wrong.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.330
And we have a clue,
then, maybe, of some

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.000
of the questions the Standard
Model doesn't answer.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.390
At the moment,
significance of this is--

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.070
it's not enough for us
to be absolutely sure

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.770
that it's correct.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.820
It could in the end.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.778
As you collect more data
and the errors shrink,

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:18.210
it could regress to the
Standard Model again.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.050
For those who care about sigmas,
it's about-- it's over 3 sigma,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.890
but it's under 5.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.130
It's at 3.4 sigma, which means
that if you did this experiment

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.504
something like 10 million
times, this might happen once

00:35:29.504 --> 00:35:30.420
in five million times.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.929
This might happen once, which
sounds like pretty long odds,

00:35:32.929 --> 00:35:35.220
but we're doing a lot of
experiments a lot of the time,

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.100
so you have to factor that in.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.482
So this is an example of one
of the kinds of distributions.

00:35:40.482 --> 00:35:41.940
As well as looking
for bumps, we're

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.226
also doing things like this.

00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:44.850
And we're watching
it really carefully.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.875
And we're hoping all the time
that one of these monsters

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:49.050
is going to emerge from
the mist on the ocean

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.100
that we're exploring
to the east.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.450
And we're hoping that we
can cope with that monster

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:54.570
when it emerges as well.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.430
But we're hoping it
will give us a clue

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.310
as to some of the questions
that our current map does not

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.570
answer.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.420
So this experiment is ongoing.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.330
What you're seeing
here is the data.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.020
Luminosity is
essentially the number

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.310
of proton-proton collisions
that we've had delivered to us.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.240
You can see here this is each
year, so 2011, 2012, which

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.400
is the green and the blue.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.550
So here and here.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.250
They were running at 7
and 8 tera-electronvolts,

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.070
so about half the design energy
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:30.690
But they were
enough, particularly

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.450
the 2012 data, where we
collected a lot of data.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.840
They were enough to
discover the Higgs boson.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.420
And then we have a gap.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.692
We didn't take any
data in 2013, 2014,

00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:42.400
because we were
refurbishing the machine.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.840
So we could go more closer
to its full design energy,

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.040
so nearly doubled
the energy there.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.990
And then we started
up again in 2015

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.490
and had a bit of a
frustrating year,

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.920
because we didn't manage
to get the machine working

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.364
as quickly as we'd hoped,
maybe in its new configuration.

00:36:56.364 --> 00:36:57.780
Although, the high
energy-- we did

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.071
get the first high-energy data.

00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:00.290
There wasn't very much of it.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.090
But then 2016 was
absolutely a bumpier year--

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.500
here the pink one.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.540
And last year was even better.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.270
And every time-- you
know now what this means.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.730
As we collect more
and more data,

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.000
we've beaten down
the error bars,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.416
and we've got more
and more chance

00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:17.070
of seeing new features emerging
from the statistical noise.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.140
So where we see of them--
where we see a Z prime,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.899
where we see some
dark matter, will

00:37:20.899 --> 00:37:22.440
one of these branching
ratios give us

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.827
a clue as to where the
anti-matter has gone?

00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:25.410
We don't know.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.320
It might be.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.030
Our ship just isn't
powerful enough.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.720
It might be that the
Standard Model is isolated,

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.910
that this ocean
is actually empty.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.620
Now, that would be, in
a way, disappointing,

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.850
because it's always fun to
discover a new particle.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.550
And it would also
be disappointing,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.890
because it would leave
us still without much

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.390
of a clue as to
what that matter is,

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.580
or how gravity-- if it's
in the picture or any

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.600
of the other things.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.850
On the other hand, it would
be really new information.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.100
We would not be anymore
sitting in the bar listening

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.150
to tales from theorists.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.370
We would have a proper
survey of this ocean,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.730
and we wouldn't hold that
there is really nothing there.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.562
And it would be unusual, because
every other bit of energy

00:38:01.562 --> 00:38:03.270
and every other leap
in energy that we've

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.436
had in physics-- we've
actually found new phenomena.

00:38:05.436 --> 00:38:07.980
We found new stuff
and new understanding.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.749
So we would-- if the Higgs is
really the last thing, not just

00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:13.290
the last thing in
the Standard Model,

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.720
but the last thing within
an order of magnitude

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.180
of an energy of the Standard
Model, and within reach,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.220
then that's interesting.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.470
And it will shake up-- it
will kill a lot of theories,

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.260
and it will shake up
a lot of thinking.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.430
And at some level, the
fact that we, so far,

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.260
haven't found anything
here is already

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.189
having that kind of effect.

00:38:30.189 --> 00:38:31.230
But it's very early days.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.000
We're going to get something
like a factor of a hundred more

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.320
data than we have now.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.670
So it's too early to
say this is the case.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.961
On the other hand, people
are taking the idea much more

00:38:38.961 --> 00:38:40.590
seriously now than they were.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.660
And, of course,
we're also thinking

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.280
about what we might do next.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.050
This is a map, a kind of fancy
map, really, at the moment.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.550
But it's a map of--

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.700
this is the Large Hadron
Collider, looking quite dinky--

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.170
or at Geneva.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.810
This is a possible linear
collider you could build.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.990
And this is a possible circular
collider you could build,

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.880
which would go to another
order of magnitude,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.960
up in energy from the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.420
It's 100 kilometres round.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.050
When I say you could build this,
what that means at the moment

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:15.780
is that the geology would allow
you to dig the tunnel, which

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.160
is not insignificant, actually.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.160
I mean, you may think that
digging tunnels is boring,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.740
but it's important.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.240
Sorry.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.950
But what we don't
know yet, of course,

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:33.550
is whether this is
scientifically the right thing

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.050
to do.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.216
We don't know whether there
is really a science case

00:39:36.216 --> 00:39:36.730
to do this.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.012
These things absorb people's
careers for a long time

00:39:40.012 --> 00:39:40.845
and a lot of effort.

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.511
So you need to be
absolutely sure you're

00:39:42.511 --> 00:39:45.540
doing something interesting
before you embark on that.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.580
That's the first stage.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.970
Then, of course, we
have to persuade--

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.886
we have to work on it
to build the technology.

00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:52.287
So we have to get the
magnets and the accelerators,

00:39:52.287 --> 00:39:53.620
so that they will actually work.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.036
And there's a lot of work going
on, on that at the moment.

00:39:56.036 --> 00:39:58.050
And at some level, some
of it will work already,

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.560
and there's more to be done.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.380
And then, of course, we have to
persuade the rest of the world

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.796
that it's worth paying for it,
and that they should do it.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.180
This is a more kind of
artistic and artist impression

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.310
of this from the
ski resort in Jura

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.760
where we were over Christmas.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.980
Looking down, this is
the LHC here again.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.870
Mont Blanc in the
background again.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.640
If you know the region,
it's incredible.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.090
It goes under the lake
and behind the Jura.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.590
It's absolutely bonkers to
think that we would ever

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.540
build anything like
that, just to find out

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.790
how the universe works.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.800
On the other hand, this
is 27 kilometres around,

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.970
and it's pretty bonkers already.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:33.636
So I don't know.

00:40:33.636 --> 00:40:34.140
We did that.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.930
And maybe this will be
the right thing to do.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.680
Maybe we'll do it.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.530
And it's not--
just to finish up,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.470
I like to say, also,
that it's not just

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.250
a matter of bigger tunnels
and more expensive,

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.800
bigger machines in that way.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.300
A lot of technological
innovation

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.850
goes on to build these things.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.730
CERN as an organisation has
had a pretty much flat budget

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.150
for the last two decades or
more and has done more and more

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.020
within that budget.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.799
And the reason for
that is because we're

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:05.340
developing new technologies all
the time, not just that CERN,

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.050
but in collaboration
with industry,

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.500
in collaboration with other
labs around the world.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.280
And that allows us to do more.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.410
And a lot of the kind of
accelerated technology

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.570
that was cutting edge
when it was at CERN

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.124
is now routine use in
hospitals around the world.

00:41:18.124 --> 00:41:20.040
And so I'm just going
to finish by showing you

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.410
one of the kind
of long shot ideas

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:26.490
that's going on in
CERN at the moment,

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.890
which we're also
working on at UCL.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.100
This is the accelerator
complex at CERN.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.200
So this is a lot.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.920
This is actually-- they use
this diagram in the control room

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.550
at CERN to see how--

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.550
it lights up when they've
got the different bits

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.720
of the complex on.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.850
And you see high CERN
has managed to do--

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.266
it's doing a lot more than
just the Large Hadron Collider.

00:41:47.266 --> 00:41:50.490
So the SPS here, for
instance, because the collider

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.860
where the W and the Z
bosons were discovered--

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.780
it was the highest energy
machine at the time.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.450
It's now a booster for
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:02.081
And you see that this is where
there's a linear collider where

00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:03.080
the-- where are we here?

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.215
LINAC 2 and the end software.

00:42:07.215 --> 00:42:08.090
So this is an output.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.035
But this is where the protons
start at LINAC 1 and LINAC 2

00:42:11.035 --> 00:42:12.660
and eventually, go
around various loops

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.326
and end up in the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:42:14.326 --> 00:42:20.310
And here off this SPS, which
is the previous high-energy

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.192
machine before the LHC--

00:42:22.192 --> 00:42:24.150
you see there's a test
beam here and this thing

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.020
called AWAKE on the end of it.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.900
AWAKE is a plus--

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.600
is one of the accelerated
development technologies that's

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.132
going on at CERN.

00:42:34.132 --> 00:42:38.850
And it's using an innovative
way of accelerating particles,

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.095
which I'm going to try
and illustrate in that.

00:42:41.095 --> 00:42:47.880
So you have a plasma, which
is nuclei and electrons freed

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:53.160
from each other in a gas of
electrons and charged ions.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.580
And you fire a laser through it.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:57.690
So you've got to imagine
these particles here

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.841
are particles-- are
electrons in the plasma.

00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:01.340
And as you fire a
laser through it--

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.950
the electrons or a beam
of particles through it--

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.270
then the electrons get--

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.930
move around.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.263
And you see that they oscillate.

00:43:08.263 --> 00:43:11.520
And you think, OK, well that's
not such a huge surprise.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.165
But because they're
oscillating, the electric field

00:43:15.165 --> 00:43:17.647
is being developed in that
in the way that we'll see--

00:43:17.647 --> 00:43:19.230
I'm going to turn
off their field when

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.355
the next one comes through.

00:43:20.355 --> 00:43:21.600
So I turned off the field.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.290
You see there?

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.576
You see there's this kind
of after-bunching coming

00:43:25.576 --> 00:43:28.200
after them as the particle-- the
charged particles of the laser

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.129
go through first?

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:31.920
You see these guys are
getting pulled along

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.970
quite fast behind it.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.550
That's because there's a very
strong electromagnetic field

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.230
following it.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.020
If we pause-- I'm going to turn
off the field once more when

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.240
the next wave comes in.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.860
All right, look at this.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.990
Watch how they loop around, and
you get this huge boost here.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.760
That kind of technique
will actually

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.480
allow you to sustain an
electromagnetic gradient that

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.970
is higher than any
material can sustain.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.910
One of the limiting factors
on the energies we can get to

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.120
in a particle accelerator
is whether you

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.190
can maintain an accelerating
gradient, actually,

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.274
on any piece of material.

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.940
In this case, you
don't need to do that.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.450
If you can fire an electron and
that it could ride this wave,

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.710
you can turn from--

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:17.070
you can turn a 400 GV proton
into a 400 GV electron, which

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.740
is-- and a 400 GV electron
is impossible to get

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.340
in the current Collider setup.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.175
So this is just--

00:44:24.175 --> 00:44:25.758
there are other--
this is one of the--

00:44:25.758 --> 00:44:27.990
if you could build a bunch
of plasma cells like this

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:29.946
and get them focused
and make it work,

00:44:29.946 --> 00:44:31.320
then you could,
in principle, get

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.500
to the energies of the
Large Hadron Collider

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.550
or the 100 kilometre Collider
in order of magnitude

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.642
higher than the LHC.

00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:41.100
You could, in
principle, get access

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.110
to those energies
in a few metres,

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.600
rather than a few-- or
maybe a few hundred metres

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.970
rather than a few
kilometres and consequently,

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.070
save a lot of money and time,
as well if you can make it work.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.000
Now, there's a huge if there.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.700
This technology is
under development.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.950
It doesn't work at the moment.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.710
For very high energies, it's
being tested and developed.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.710
It does, however, already
work, and it's already

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.590
being used in hospitals
to get lower energy

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.190
beams quickly with a laser
and much more cheaply.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.930
So that's the kind
of zone we're in now.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.440
We're sailing eastward
from the Higgs boson

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.540
and with the Large Hadron
Collider at the moment.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.430
We're looking there.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.180
If we find something
there, it may give us

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.920
very clear pointers
for exactly what

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.180
machine we need to build next.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.830
And then we'll come
and start arguing

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.890
with the politicians
and the public

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.170
to persuade them
that it's worthwhile.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.284
If we don't get any
clues, then we'll

00:45:27.284 --> 00:45:28.950
be looking at things
like the neutrinos.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.908
We'll be looking at more
rare decays and things

00:45:30.908 --> 00:45:33.310
as well, looking there
for clues as well.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:35.430
And either way, we'll
be continually pushing

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.950
technologies to allow us to do
more for less, so that we can

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.640
actually study the universe more
closely within the resources

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.600
that we have available.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.900
So what I've given
you there is a kind

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.476
of lightning tour of this
Map of the Invisible,

00:45:48.476 --> 00:45:49.600
starting with the electron.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.330
I skipped the middle
a bit, more or less,

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.950
and ended up in the far east.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.620
But it gives you some idea,
I hope, of what we're doing,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.420
and why, and where we are.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.970
And the rest of
it is in the book.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.689
These journeys are
going to continue.

00:46:01.689 --> 00:46:04.230
It's been an amazing time the
last few years to be a particle

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.660
physicist, but it's continuing.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.027
And I decided to finish
by thanking Chris, who

00:46:10.027 --> 00:46:13.835
drew the figments of my
imagination, in the maps.

00:46:13.835 --> 00:46:14.460
And that's all.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.400
Thank you very much.
