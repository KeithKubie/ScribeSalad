DAN HARRIS: I
always feel bad when

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.100
people have to read the
subtitle of the book.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.250
It's like a Fiona
Apple record title.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.540
So if you had told
me a couple of years

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.640
ago that I was going to
end up as a traveling

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.000
evangelist for meditation, I
would have coughed my beer up

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.479
through my nose.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:26.020
This is kind of the
last thing I ever

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.145
thought would happen to me.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.340
And it's a funny
story, actually.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.520
It all started with a panic
attack on national television.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.856
What you're about to see
happened in June of 2004

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:40.480
on a little show you
may have heard of.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.780
It's called "Good
Morning America."

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.390
Because I'm a masochist, I
asked our research department

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.530
to find out exactly how
many people were watching,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.870
5.019 million, so no big deal.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.620
And so in this clip
I'm going to show you,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.210
I give kind of a blow by
blow my on air Waterloo.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.894
We can play it.

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:03.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.756
-From ABC News, this is
Good Morning America.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:09.260
-Welcome to the most
embarrassing day of my life.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.896
-We're going to go now to Dan
Harris is at the new desk.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:12.395
Dan.

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:13.426
-Good morning,
Charlie and Diane.

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:13.926
Thank you--

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:15.202
-This is me 10 years ago.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:17.660
And the reason this is the most
embarrassing day of my life

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.520
is not that it looks
like I've been attacked

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.950
by a blow dryer and
a can of hairspray.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.960
No, it's that I am
about to freak out

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.010
on national television.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.870
-Health news now.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.390
One of the world's most
commonly prescribed medications

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.280
may be providing a big bonus.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.030
Researchers report people who
take cholesterol lowering drugs

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.460
called statins for
at least five years

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.080
may also lower their
risk for cancer.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.700
But it's too early to
prescribe statins slowly

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.710
for cancer production.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.127
-At this point I realize
I'm helpless, so I bail,

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:46.960
right in the middle.

00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:48.990
-That does it for news.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.341
We're going to go back
now to Robin and Charlie.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:51.840
-All right.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.590
Thanks very much, Dan
Harris at the news desk

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.210
with some of the
headlines of the morning.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.501
Want to go to Tony Perkins now.

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:57.030
He is--

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.230
-Once the fear subsided,
humiliation rushed in.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.440
I knew with rock solid
certainty that I just

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.700
had a panic attack on
national television.

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:09.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.400
I've watched that
clip 1,000 times

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.910
and it never fails to suck.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880
Some people watch it and say,
you know, it wasn't that bad.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940
And that's true.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.644
It wasn't like, has
anybody ever seen

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:25.060
the movie, "Broadcast News"
where Albert Brooks breaks out

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.860
in flop sweat.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.390
I can guarantee you
that I had I not

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.150
had the luxury of tossing it
back to Charlie and Diane,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.830
that I would have
resulted in flop

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.535
sweat and a Tourettic outburst
and the end of my career.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.710
To my vast surprise,
that panic attack

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.060
ended up significantly
improving my life

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.924
in a weird and windy way.

00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:49.090
But I'm going to tell you
a little back story first.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570
At the root of my
freak out was, I think,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.400
something that we all
share, especially, I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.690
would say, here at Google, that
would be especially true, which

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.350
is a desire to be
great at my job.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.905
I arrived at ABC News-- sorry.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.830
That's-- there it is.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.450
I arrived at ABC News in 2008,
excuse me, in the year 2000.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.390
I was 28.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.435
This is the picture they took
of me on my first day at ABC.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.750
A colleague of mine-- this
is for my security ID.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.220
It's still on my security ID.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.400
I can't get them to change it.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.164
A colleague of mine later joked
that if you take a wide shot,

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:30.955
it looks like I might
be holding a balloon.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.000
So, I'm 28 years
old and I'm working

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.570
with these giants like
Peter Jennings and Diane

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.231
Sawyer and Barbara
Walters, and I was green.

00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:43.730
I knew I was green and I was
really self conscious about it.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.700
And my way of coping was
to become a workaholic.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.720
I just threw myself
into the job.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.310
And after 9/11 happened,
I raised my hand

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.860
to go overseas and cover
the ensuing conflicts,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.360
frankly, without
thinking much about

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.220
the psychological consequences.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.740
This is me with the
Taliban in October of 2001.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.680
And I spent the following years
in-- I spent a lot of time

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.520
in places like Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Israel, the West

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.709
Bank and Gaza, and I made
six or seven trips to Iraq.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.510
When I got home from
one particularly long

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.420
and hairy visit to Iraq,
in the summer of 2003,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.550
right when the insurgency was
starting, I got depressed.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.060
And somewhat embarrassingly,
I didn't actually

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.660
know I was depressed,
although I now

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.556
know that I was exhibiting
many of the telltale symptoms,

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:39.430
like I was having trouble
getting out of bed.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.350
I felt like I had a low
grade fever all the time.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.200
And at this point I did a
toweringly stupid thing, which

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.900
was I started to self medicate
with cocaine and Ecstasy.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.470
I hasten to add, it wasn't
like the "Wolf of Wall Street."

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.120
It was reasonably
sporadic, never when

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.060
I was at work, definitely
not when I was on the air.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.550
As I like to say, I was
stupid but not that stupid.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.130
After my panic
attack, I went to see

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.230
a doctor, who asked me
a series of questions

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.116
to get to the root
of the problem.

00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:13.865
One of the questions
was, do you do drugs.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.250
I kind of sheepishly
said, yeah, I do.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.400
And he said, well actually,
he gave me this look

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.430
that I read as, OK, asshole.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.685
A mystery solved.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.610
He explained that even though
I hadn't been doing cocaine

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.780
every day, it was enough to
raise the level of adrenaline

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.912
in my brain and prime me
to have that panic attack.

00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:40.120
This is a huge moment for me.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.860
It really hit me very
hard what a moron I'd been

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.675
and I realized I need
to make some changes.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.180
The first one was a no-brainer.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.200
I quit doing drugs that day.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.020
The second was
that I agreed to go

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.480
see this shrink once or
twice a week indefinitely.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.810
This isn't some
neat, clean story

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.820
where then I started to meditate
and my life has ever since been

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.025
a nonstop parade of
unicorns and rainbows.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.980
There was something else
that needed to happen,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.540
which had to do with this guy,
Peter Jennings, who some of you

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.240
may remember.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.980
He died in 2005.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.790
But he was a huge figure
in American journalism

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.960
and he was my mentor.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.040
And he gave me an assignment
that I really did not want.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.751
He told me I was going to cover
faith and spirituality for ABC

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:26.250
News.

00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:30.020
I tried to explain to him that
I was raised in the People's

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.620
Republic of Massachusetts by a
pair of physician scientists.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.860
I did have a bar mitzvah, but
that was only for the money.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.240
I remember when I was eight
years old, my mom explaining

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.290
to me that not only is
there no Santa Claus,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.140
but there's also no God.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.820
So this is kind of atmosphere
in which I was raised.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.270
And I tried to explain
this to Peter--

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.380
I left out the old
mercenary bar mitzvah part.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.537
--but he didn't care.

00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:03.120
He said, you're going
to do it anyway.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.995
And it turned out to be
a great thing for me.

00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:09.740
I spent the next decade in
megachurches and mosques

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.570
and Mormon temples.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.200
I made a lot of
really good friends.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.760
I really developed a
deep and abiding respect

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.450
for the value of having a
worldview that transcends

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.960
your narrow, personal interests,
which was useful for me

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.130
as a young reporter on the make.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.972
That said, none of what
I encountered really

00:07:25.972 --> 00:07:26.930
spoke to me personally.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.210
I didn't go kosher or
anything like that.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.050
Until the year 2008, when one
of my producers recommended that

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.130
I read a book by this guy,
whose name is Eckhart Tolle.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.650
Has anybody heard of him?

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.150
OK.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.670
We've got a smattering of hands.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.630
I had not heard of him.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.060
He is a mega bestselling
self-help guru.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.462
And as my producer
explained, Oprah loves him.

00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:51.920
All these celebrities
are into him.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.980
He was selling, you
know, millions-- he still

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.607
is, selling millions
and millions of books.

00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:58.440
And her argument was,
well, he's a big deal.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.523
We should maybe look at
him and do a story on him.

00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:02.420
So I ordered one of his books.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.790
And at first I thought it
was irredeemable bullshit.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.060
There's all this weird language
about vibrational fields

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.900
and these grandiose claims.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.450
First off, there's a lot
of pseudo scientific claims

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.730
and then these grandiose claims
about how this book is going

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.390
to produce a spiritual
awakening in you, the reader,

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.720
and that, after his own spirit
awakening at the age of 29,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.970
he lived in a state of
bliss on park benches

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.880
in the city of
London for two years,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.860
a city, which as far
as I know, has winter.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.320
Suffice it to say,
I was not terribly

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.720
impressed at first blush.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.820
But as I continue to
read, Tolle started

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.232
to unfurl a thesis about
the human condition

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:48.690
that I'd never
heard before, that I

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.610
found incredibly compelling.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.350
His argument is that we all have
a voice in our heads, by which

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.690
he is not referring to
schizophrenia or hearing

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.320
voices, he's referring to your
inner narrator, the voice that

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.930
chases you out of
bed in the morning

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.030
and has you constantly
wanting stuff, not

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.410
wanting stuff, judging
people, criticizing

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.630
yourself very harshly.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.435
One of the hallmarks
of the voice

00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:13.510
is that you are
constantly thinking

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.060
about the past or
the future, instead

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.090
of focusing on what's
happening right now.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.810
My friend, Sam Harris,
who some of you

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.600
may have heard of-- we're not
related but we're good friends,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.660
he describes the voice in the
head or his voice in the head

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.910
or in his head, as,
when he thinks about it,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.640
he feels like he's
been kidnapped

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.810
by the most boring
personal alive, who just

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.892
says the same shit over and over
again, most of it negative, all

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:41.850
of it self-referential.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.820
The laughs indicate you
know what I'm talking about.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.750
And when you're unaware of
this nonstop conversation

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.020
you are having with
yourself, according to Tolle,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.040
it yanks you around.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.000
It's why you find yourself
with your hand in the fridge

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.920
when you're not hungry,
you find yourself

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.320
checking your
mobile device when--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.800
I should say Android.
--when --when somebody's

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.840
trying to talk to you, or why
you're losing your temper when

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.020
it's strategically unwise.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.880
And for me, this was
another huge aha moment.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.710
I realized, A, it's
intuitively true.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.120
B, it's really true for me.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.910
And that the voice
in the head explained

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.140
the most embarrassing
moment of my life.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.644
It's why I went to war zones
without thinking it through.

00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:34.060
Its why I came home and got
depressed and didn't even know

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.380
it, and then blindly
self-medicated

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.560
and it all blew up in my face.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.360
Suffice it to say, it was
mildly embarrassing to be

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.630
a self-styled, skeptical newsman
and thinking, this guy gets me.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.036
But there was a bigger
problem than the ego bruise.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.500
As far as I could tell, there
was nothing in Tolle's book

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.060
that was practical
or actionable.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.500
He didn't give any
concrete advice.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.230
Perhaps I was being
obtuse, but I could not

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.900
divine any concrete
advice for dealing

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.400
with the voice in the head.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.240
I actually went, and this
delighted my producer, who

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.900
was a little bit less cynical
about Tolle than I am,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.200
I went and interviewed the guy.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.407
And I sat down and
asked him, what

00:11:22.407 --> 00:11:23.990
do you do about the
voice in the head?

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.031
It was my first question.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:32.547
And his answer, wait for it,
was take one conscious breath.

00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:33.755
What the fuck does that mean?

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.570
And then it got even weirder,
because I started asking him

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.562
if he ever gets into a bad mood.

00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:44.020
And maybe the
gentleman in the back

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.780
can play you what he said to me.

annoyed, irritated, sad,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.230
anything negative?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.360
-No, I accept what is.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.530
And that's why life
has become so simple.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.940
-But if somebody cuts
you off in your car?

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.520
-It's fine.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.650
It's like a sudden gust of wind.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.660
I don't personalize
a gust of wind.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.380
And so, it's simply what is.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.645
-And you're able to
enjoy every moment, even

00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:18.370

ton of annoying questions?

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.610
-Yes, that would be fine.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.350
So it's really--

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.230

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.213
He was so frustrating.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.850
It was like he had pointed
out that my hair was

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.565
on fire and then refused to
give me a fire extinguisher.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.970
And I was at wit's end.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.580
I mean, I was really, really
intrigued by his thesis

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.170
and just determined
to figure out

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.010
if anybody had any ideas for
doing something about it.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.470
And I then threw myself
into the world of self-help,

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.905
not knowing what else to do.

00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:56.560
It is not a pretty place.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.000
I met a lot of these
questionable characters who

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.530
promise that you can
solve all of your problems

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.110
through the power of
positive thinking,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.680
which I hate to break it to
you, is not going to happen.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.050
And I can get on my high
horse about positive thinking

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.836
in the Q&amp;A session if you want.

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:15.710
But in the interest of
speeding things along,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.970
I will say that I found
it deeply unsatisfying,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:20.610
this world.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.990
And I was even more frustrated.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.830
And then one night, my
then fiancee, now wife,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.520
came in with the save.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.830
She-- I walked into
the apartment one night

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.250
and she said, You know,
I've been listening to you

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.208
talk about Eckhardt Tolle
and blah, blah, blah,

00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:37.230
with varying levels of cogency.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.140
And it made me realize,
it reminded me of a book

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:47.630
that I read a long
time ago by, not him,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:52.772
that guy, who is a shrink,
based here in New York City.

00:13:52.772 --> 00:13:54.105
His name is Doctor Mark Epstein.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.700
He actually has
credentials and he

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.565
writes about the overlap
between Buddhism and psychology.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.350
And notwithstanding the
fact that I was ostensibly

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.750
a religion reporter, I actually
knew nothing about Buddhism,

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.270
other than the fact
that at the age of 15,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.599
I had stolen a Buddhist statue
from a local gardening store

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:17.890
and put in my bedroom because
I thought it looked cool.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.160
Unbeknownst to me, this
guy, heretofore known

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.980
to me only as a lawn
ornament, had 2,500 years

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.350
before Eckhart Tolle started
cashing his royalty checks,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.234
this dude was talking about
the voice in the head.

00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:34.900
He had a slightly
different term for it.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.108
He called it the monkey mind.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.960
According to the
Buddha, our minds

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.120
are like furry little
gibbons, constantly

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.250
lurching through a forest of
urges and impulses and desires,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.030
always grasping at things
that will not last,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.420
in a universe characterized
by impermanence,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.260
and hurling ourselves from
one pleasant experience

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.470
to the next, one sexual
encounter, one meal, one

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.596
promotion to the next, and
yet, never fully satisfied.

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:03.220
I mean, if you think
about it, how many

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.520
great meals if you had?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.140
Are you done?

00:15:07.165 --> 00:15:07.915
We are insatiable.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.690
And unlike-- so again,
very, very interesting.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.920
And unlike, Eckhart
Tolle, the Buddha

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.440
had a very specific
piece of advice

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.492
for dealing with
the monkey mind.

00:15:20.492 --> 00:15:21.950
Fresh problem arises
at this point,

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.220
which is, what he was suggesting
I found to be repellent.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.730
Because what he was
suggesting was meditation.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.980
My view was that
meditation was only

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.210
for hippies and freaks and
people who live in a yurt

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.110
and are deeply into aromatherapy
and ultimate Frisbee and Cat

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.270
Stevens and John Tesh and
wear little finger symbols

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.360
and use the word
Namaste un-ironically.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.840
My view is actually
perfectly summed up

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.889
by Alec Baldwin's
character on "30 Rock," who

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:53.680
said the following.

When I saw that, I was

00:16:07.517 --> 00:16:08.850

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.010
But then I started
do some research

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.420
and I've found that there's
been a fascinating explosion

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.670
of scientific research
into meditation.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.480
It's still in its
early stages, but it's

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.580
strongly suggestive of a
long and almost laughably

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:32.850
long, almost laughable, list of
health benefits, starting with,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.960
it can lower the release
of stress hormones.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.335
It can lower your
blood pressure.

00:16:36.335 --> 00:16:38.000
It can boost your immune system.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.130
It can help with
depression, anxiety, ADHD,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.939
age-related cognitive decline.

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:44.980
The further I get into my
40s, the more important

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.270
that becomes to me.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.010
It could even help with
seemingly unrelated things

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.660
like irritable bowel
syndrome and psoriasis.

00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:54.370
And here's where things
get truly sci-fi.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.870
Neuroscientists have
been peering directly

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.570
into the brains of
meditators and finding

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.630
that, when you meditate you
are, in effect, performing

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.440
a kind of neurosurgery
on yourself.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.970
And this is not just true
of people who wear robes,

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.730
it is true for the rest of us.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.750
There was a study done at
Harvard a few years ago, that

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.369
took people who had
never meditated before

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.839
and gave them an
eight week class.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.255
During this eight
week class, they

00:17:21.255 --> 00:17:24.170
meditated for short
periods of time every day.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.560
At the end of the eight weeks,
they scanned their brains.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.330
They actually scanned it the
beginning and then at the end.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.870
What they found in those
second set of scans, was

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.290
that the areas of the brain
associated with self awareness

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.480
and compassion, the gray
matter literally grew.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.770
And the area associated with
stress, the gray matter,

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.795
literally shrank.

00:17:45.662 --> 00:17:47.120
I found this very,
very compelling.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.650
And then I learned
something else.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.080
Meditation does
not-- let me just

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.840
say that the word meditation
is a bit like the word sports.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.074
It can describe a whole
variety of activities.

00:17:57.074 --> 00:17:59.240
Badminton and water polo
don't have a lot in common.

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:01.810
The type of meditation
that is mostly

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.170
being studied in the
labs is something

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.440
called mindfulness meditation.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.450
And this type of meditation does
not involve a lot of the things

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.420
that I had feared, like
finger symbols or whatever.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.614
It does not involve sitting
in a funny position, which

00:18:14.614 --> 00:18:15.530
was one of my worries.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.300
That's my cat Ruby
with Gus behind her.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.768
She's actually watching the
Real Housewives in that shot.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.470
That's not a lie.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.020
Many of the other things I'm
saying are probably lies,

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:31.980
but that is not a lie.

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:35.590
So you don't have to
sit in a funny position.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.610
You can if you want,
but for somebody like me

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.130
who's not particular limber,
you can sit in a chair.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.150
It also doesn't involve joining
a group, paying any fees,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.990
wearing special outfits,
believing in anything

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.990
in particular.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.700
It's simple and secular
and, as we've established,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.090
scientifically validated
in many, many ways.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.090
So there are three steps.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.620
I'm not going to make you do
this, but just so you know,

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.941
the first step is
to sit up right,

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.690
to sit comfortably
with your back upright.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.380
Again, you can sit
in a chair or if you

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.630
want to get all cross-legged,
that's cool too.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.070
The second step is to
focus your full attention

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:16.790
on the feeling of your breath,
coming in and going out.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.740
Pick a spot,
wherever your breath

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.790
is most prominent, your
nose, your chest, your belly.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.580
You just want to feel
the breath coming in

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.402
and feel the breath going out.

00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:26.610
The third step is the biggie.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.734
As soon as you try to do this,
your mind is going to go nuts.

00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:32.650
You're going to start
thinking about what am I

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.680
going to have for lunch?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.714
Why did I say that
dumb thing to my boss?

00:19:35.714 --> 00:19:37.630
Why did "Dances with
Wolves" beat "Goodfellas"

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.070
for Best Picture in 1991?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.200
Why do celebrities only
marry other celebrities?

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.260
Whatever, your mind's
going to go nuts.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.080
And that's fine, that's fine.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.590
The whole game is to notice
when you're lost in thought

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.740
and to start over and
start over and start over.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.450
And when you do that, that is
a bicep curl for your brain.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.190
And it shows up on
the brain scans.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.490
Not incidentally, it
is also a radical act.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.580
You are breaking
a lifetime's habit

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.760
of walking around in a fog,
in a daydream of projection

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.710
into the future and
rumination about the past.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.500
And you're actually
focusing on what's

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.580
happening right now, which,
I know it's a new age cliche,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.204
but it is always now.

00:20:18.204 --> 00:20:20.370
And that's where your life
is at, and yet most of us

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.078
don't live there.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.746
So when I learned all of this,
I decided to start meditating.

00:20:25.746 --> 00:20:27.620
I started with like five
or 10 minutes a day.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.078
That's a picture my wife took
of me, meditating on vacation

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:33.025
with some opportunistic
chickens trying to bum rush me.

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.150
And I'm not going to lie to you.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.185
It wasn't like, awesome.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.620
You know, it's hard.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.030
The act of sitting there,
trying to focus on one thing,

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.530
getting lost, and returning,
is-- it takes grit.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.940
It's kind of like holding
a live fish in your hands.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.150
And especially when you're
new, it's like learning,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.420
it is-- It's not like, it
is, learning a new skill.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.760
And it takes a little
while to get used to.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.430
That being said.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.810
I very quickly started to notice
some significant benefits.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.140
The first was, my ability
to focus got better.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.970
I can't prove this,
just so you know.

00:21:09.592 --> 00:21:11.050
I feel that it's
true, but I didn't

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.240
have my brain scanned
before or after.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.410
However, there have
been studies that

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.010
show that meditation can help
with your ability to focus.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.880
We live in the
age, an age that's

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.330
been called the Info Blitzkrieg.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.440
You know this
better than anybody.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.150
And it is very hard to
do one thing at a time.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.540
In my job, I literally
have other people's voices

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.690
directly in my ear
through an earpiece.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.700
It's really hard to focus
and yet very important

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.610
that I do so, because I need
to get the story correct.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.980
I need to report it correctly.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.952
So I just found that
the daily exercise

00:21:46.952 --> 00:21:49.160
of trying to focus on one
thing and then getting lost

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.076
and starting over, really
helped me with that.

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:54.030
The second benefit
was the big one.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.972
And it's this word mindfulness.

00:21:55.972 --> 00:21:58.640
It's become somewhat
of a buzz phrase.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.810
Oddly, it's also kind of like
a boring anodyne-sounding word,

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.140
but is a game
changing proposition.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.310
A simple serviceable
definition of mindfulness--

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.050
which by the way, it's
an incredibly rich term.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.950
It goes back 2500 years.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.890
It's all the Buddhist texts.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.050
But let me give you a
simple definition that

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.350
can be relevant in your life,
which is, it's the ability

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.530
to know what's happening in
your head at any given moment

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.185
without getting
carried away by it.

00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:29.010
I was going to say that
again, not to be didactic,

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.390
but it is useful
to hear it twice.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.260
It's the skill of knowing
what's happening in your head

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.130
right now without
necessarily taking the bait

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.200
and acting on it.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.380
So let's just think about
how useful this could be.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.230
You're standing on
line at Starbucks

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.020
or one of your 5,000
micro-cafeterias here

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.620
and somebody cuts you off.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.460
What happens?

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.620
You think to
yourself, I'm pissed.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.560
What happens next?

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.900
You automatically,
reflexively, habitually inhabit

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.510
that thought.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.470
You actually become angry.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.630
There's no buffer between the
stimulus and your reaction.

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.300
When mindfulness is on
board with a little bit

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.060
of meditating, you
might be able to notice,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.990
after that person cut you
off, my chest is buzzing.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.990
My ears are turning red.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.900
I'm having a starburst of
self righteous thoughts.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.394
I'm getting angry.

00:23:19.394 --> 00:23:21.310
But maybe right now I
don't need to act on it.

00:23:25.886 --> 00:23:29.150
I like to think there's another
way to think about this.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.430
I'm not a good artist
but I drew this.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.640
You can think of the
mind as a waterfall.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.450
And that's water coming down.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.620
Those are your thoughts.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.250
Most of them have to
do with me, me, me.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.730
Mindfulness is the area
behind the waterfall.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.250
You are stepping
out of the traffic

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.213
and watching what's
happening nonjudgmentally.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.120
We have three habitual
reactions to every piece

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.500
every stimulus in our lives.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.400
We want it.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.213
We don't want it.

00:24:00.213 --> 00:24:01.050
We don't care.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.430
And mindfulness is
a fourth option,

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.900
which is to just see
it dispassionately,

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.390
without getting involved.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.450
If you think I'm
making this up, it

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.550
is worth noting that
we, as a species,

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.640
are classified as homo sapiens
sapiens, which means the man

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.050
or woman who thinks
and knows he thinks.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.839
But the second sapiens has
been atrophied with time,

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:30.130
because nobody points out to
us that we have this bonus

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.226
level in our brain, which is the
ability to step out and watch

00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:35.475
it calmly and nonjudgmentally.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.040
Let me just get back
to Starbucks example.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.847
I suspect some of
you may be thinking,

00:24:40.847 --> 00:24:42.680
aren't there times when
I need to get angry?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.880
Yes, although I would argue
probably less than you think.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.260
The idea here, the
argument I'm making,

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.300
is not that you
should be rendered

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.930
into some lifeless,
nonjudgmental blob.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:03.920
The argument is that there
are times when it makes sense

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.900
to get angry, but most
of the time it doesn't.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.360
So what mindfulness
gives you is the ability

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.490
to respond wisely to
things that are happening

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.490
instead of reacting blindly.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.390
I love this, respond not react.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.830
There are many, many cliches
in the meditation world

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.120
that make me kind of put a
little bit of vomit right here.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.894
But respond not react
is a brilliant one

00:25:26.894 --> 00:25:28.435
and it's a life
changing proposition.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.960
And as you can imagine, it
has so many applications

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.970
in the workplace, which is why
it's now being offered here,

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.675
Procter &amp; Gamble, Aetna,
Target, General Mills.

00:25:39.412 --> 00:25:41.370
These are the people that
make Hamburger Helper

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:46.180
and they have meditation
rooms in every building

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.375
in their corporate campus
in Minnetonka, Minnesota.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.075
It's now very big
in Silicon Valley.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.140
This is a clip from "Wired"
magazine, where they referred

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:02.590
to meditation and mindfulness as
the new caffeine, which I love.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.970
I also love the
irony of the fact

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.480
that you people,
who are developing

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.840
all of the technologies that
are destroying our ability

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.630
to focus, are embracing
this technology.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.460
This is just--
it's just awesome.

00:26:14.852 --> 00:26:16.560
And it's not just in
a corporate setting.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.809
This is the quarterback for
the Seattle Seahawks, who,

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:21.330
as you may recall,
dominated in the Super Bowl.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.820
They have a meditation coach.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.490
Novak Djokovic, who did
reasonably well at Wimbledon

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.000
not too long ago, a meditator.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.730
Many, many, many
Olympians, meditators.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:35.760
The New York Knicks,
not doing great,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.370
but they just
started meditating.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.328
Let's see how they do at
the end of the season.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.290
It's also happening
among entertainers.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.190
That's a lead singer of Weezer.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.320
Katy Perry does it.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.300
Fifty Cent, that dude
got shot nine times.

00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:51.630
He deserves some peace of mind.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.790
Perhaps most compellingly
though, it is now

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.100
being done by the US Army
and the US Marines, who

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.550
are spending millions
of dollars to research

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.680
whether meditation can make more
effective and more resilient

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.340
soldiers and whether it might
be something that could be used

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.145
to cut down on the scourge,
the epidemic, of PTSD.

00:27:16.712 --> 00:27:18.170
So at this point,
I'm going to make

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.330
a little bit of a
prediction, with a caveat

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.890
that my powers of
prognostication

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.930
are historically weak.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.150
Just as an example of
that, in the early 2000s,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.910
I convinced my younger
brother to invest with me

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.290
in a company that
makes the Palm Pilot.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.500
That didn't go super well.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.350
Having said that,
I firmly believe

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.170
that meditation is the next
big public health revolution.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.564
In the 1940s, if
you told somebody

00:27:43.564 --> 00:27:44.980
you were going
running, they would

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.420
have said, who's chasing you?

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.720
What happened?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.040
We then saw a ton of
scientific research

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.030
that proved, beyond really
a shadow of a doubt,

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.129
that physical exercise
is really good for you.

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:01.920
And now we all do it
and if we don't do it,

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920
we feel guilty about it.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.220
I think this is where we're
heading with meditation.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.430
I think meditation is going to
join the bucket of no-brainers,

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.980
like brushing your teeth, taking
the meds that are prescribed

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.730
to you, getting enough sleep,
et cetera, et cetera, when

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.440
it comes to physical and
psychological wellness.

00:28:23.226 --> 00:28:23.850
Think about it.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.220
We spend so much time working
on our stock portfolios,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:33.190
working on our home decor,
working on our bodies,

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.940
and almost no time tuning up
the filter through which we

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.810
experience everything,
and that is our minds.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.690
Now despite the fact
that I've become this,

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.260
to my surprise,
this weird traveling

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.495
meditation evangelical,
I want to be clear,

00:28:51.495 --> 00:28:53.245
it's not going to solve
all your problems.

00:28:54.217 --> 00:28:56.550
It's not going to, and I have
learned this the hard way,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.960
it's not going to
regrow your hair

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.043
or help you win the lottery
or like fix everything

00:29:00.043 --> 00:29:03.270
in your love life, which
is why I wrote a book

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.100
and I called it "10% Happier."

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.370
That's an absurd
unscientific estimation,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.707
but it's true enough.

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:12.790
And I like it because it
sounds like a good return

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.373
on investment.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.225
I would argue that it
does compound annually.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.960
My idea is that if
you can strip away

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.390
all of these saccharine, syrupy,
and frankly, pretty annoying,

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.280
language, which has been
used to promote meditation

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.850
for too long, it could
be accessible to lots

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.960
of smart, skeptical people
who would never otherwise

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.820
go near it and don't use
the word Namaste ever.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.000
And at the core of it is a
simple and really attractive

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.536
and really fascinating idea,
which is that we assume,

00:29:50.536 --> 00:29:52.910
consciously or subconsciously,
that our happiness depends

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.820
on external factors, the
quality of our childhood,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.070
did we get a promotion
recently, how's our love life.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.580
But in fact, it's
not-- now, I'm not

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.880
argue that those external
factors don't matter.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.795
But in fact,
happiness is a skill,

00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:12.570
that you can train your mind
and your brain to be happy,

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.350
just the way you can train
your bicep in the gym.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.530
And that is an incredibly
powerful and liberating notion.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.620
And it should be accessible
to everybody, not just

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.340
the folks who have been
drawn to meditation

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.460
since the Age of Aquarius.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.820
As for me, I've been
meditating for five years now

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.630
and I am still, I think you
could probably fairly describe

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.925
me as a workaholic, just like
I was when I was a 28-year-old.

00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:46.500
And I still firmly
believe that if you're

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.800
trying to be great at anything,
either your job, your volunteer

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.370
work, parenting,
whatever, there's

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.130
a certain amount of stress and
plotting and planning involved.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.580
There's just no
getting around it.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.040
But what I've learned is to
draw the line, at least 10%

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.270
of the time, between
what I call constructive

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.880
anguish and useless rumination.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.850
And that has made a huge
difference in my life

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.850
and in my relationships.

00:31:12.522 --> 00:31:13.980
That said, if my
wife was here, she

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.180
would give you her 90%
still a moron speech.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.290
And my younger
brother, the one who

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.820
I convinced to invest
in the Palm Pilot,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.760
he recommended that
we re-title the book

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.609
"From Deeply Flawed
to Merely Flawed."

00:31:31.609 --> 00:31:33.400
I'm going to close,
but I just want to say,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.880
I just want to leave you
with one exhortation, which

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.050
is, give it a try.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.272
Whatever your
preconceptions are,

00:31:40.272 --> 00:31:41.605
they're probably misconceptions.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.570
I think five to 10 minutes a
day is a great way to start.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.760
You can tell yourself,
you'll never do more.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.040
And I don't care
how busy you are.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.710
I don't care if you have
three jobs and 15 children,

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.260
everybody's got five minutes.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.390
Right when you wake up,
right before you go to bed,

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.970
before you-- when you park
your car in the driveway,

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.270
if you drive, right before
you go into your house,

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.752
there are five minutes for you.

00:32:05.752 --> 00:32:07.210
And here's my little
tagline, which

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.860
is, if it can work for a
fidgety, skeptical newsman,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.240
it can work for you.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:12.740
Thank you.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:19.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.710
So we have time for questions.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.390
There's a microphone over there.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.050
Yes, sir.

00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:25.970
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.240
My name is [? Adityah, ?]
and I'm an engineer here.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.050
And I've got a story that
has some similarity to yours.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.090
I joined Google six
years ago, in part

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.810
to help teach meditation.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.240
And I apologize
if my question is

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.160
a little bit outside
the scope of your talk,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.980
but I really enjoyed
your conversation

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.220
with Sam Harris,
the one on his blog.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.320
I think it's called
"Taming the Mind."

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.020
And I was particularly struck,
because in that conversation

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.960
you bring up nonduality, which
is something a little bit

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.230
difficult to speak about.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.190
It's not exactly the same
thing as mindfulness,

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.440
but there's obviously
some overlap.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.436
And what I've noticed
in the last maybe

00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:03.810
5 or 10 years is
that mindfulness

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.040
has become more mainstream.

00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:08.250
There are more people sort
of willing to talk about it,

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.210
to listen to it.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.930
Your talk is a very
timely in that regard.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.370
I'm curious if
you've see anything

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:17.330
with regard to nonduality
and if that's something like,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.300
could be a meditation two
point, or what you perceive

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.374
the public openness to that is.

00:33:23.374 --> 00:33:24.790
DAN HARRIS: It's
a great question.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.415
Let me just explain
what nonduality is.

00:33:26.415 --> 00:33:32.229
So my whole thing is to make
this as attractive as possible

00:33:32.229 --> 00:33:32.770
to everybody.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.110
But the mindfulness comes
out of Buddhist teachings

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.455
and it's just one part
of Buddhist teaching.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.300
And it has been
secularized, I think,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.660
in a really great way, which
is the way it's offered now,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.620
in many contexts, there's
no Buddhism at all.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.070
And I'm completely
fine with that.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.600
I think the Buddha himself
would be fine with that.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.390
He wasn't trying to
start a religion.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.947
He never envisioned an ism.

00:34:03.037 --> 00:34:04.620
But one of the things
he talked about,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.980
which is a little bit
deeper than mindfulness,

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.220
is the fact that the self, the
voice in your head, the you,

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.170
that you think is
so real, actually

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.359
doesn't exist in the
way you think it does,

00:34:16.359 --> 00:34:19.179
that it's actually an illusion
that you are creating moment

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.130
to moment.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.982
Very tough concept to
get your head around.

00:34:22.982 --> 00:34:23.940
And I struggle with it.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.620
Sam Harris, who-- [? Adityah, ?]
is that your name?

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.529
--referenced, who I
talked about before.

00:34:30.529 --> 00:34:32.820
He's the guy who said he
thinks that he's been hijacked

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.153
by the most boring person alive.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.760
He is a famous atheist
writer, and also,

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.940
and this was a big surprise to
a lot of his fans, a very, very

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.870
serious meditator.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.175
And he's just written a book
called "Waking Up," which

00:34:45.175 --> 00:34:46.800
is an excellent book
and I recommend it

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.706
to everybody, in which
he talks about the fact

00:34:51.706 --> 00:34:53.350
that mindfulness
meditation is great.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.756
But really the point is to see
that this self that you think

00:34:57.756 --> 00:35:00.130
is so real, is actually the
source of all of your misery.

00:35:02.054 --> 00:35:03.470
And so to answer
your question, do

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.250
I think this is the next
thing coming down the pike?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:05.754
I hope so.

00:35:05.754 --> 00:35:06.920
I think that would be great.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.180
And I think Sam's book, which is
still on the top 10 York Times

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.710
bestseller list after four
weeks, is a great first step.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.600
I think it's a very
tough thing to talk about

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.030
in a comprehensible way.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.700
I'm not even sure
I've done that here.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.640
But one of the
things I think about

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.400
is, whether, maybe
in my next book,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.180
I can learn to talk
about it in a way

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.410
that is simple and engaging and
seems practical and applicable

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.982
in daily life.

00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:34.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:35.773
DAN HARRIS: Appreciate it.

00:35:37.819 --> 00:35:38.610
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.610
My name's Nick and I
wanted to thank you

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:40.790
for coming and talking.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.740
And my question is, kind of
speaks to your story before.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.160
About when you first started
doing some of the meditation,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.870
and sort of the way
you think about it

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.330
seems to be very
parallel to myself

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.550
and I'm hoping some
of the others here.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.450
When I first started doing some
of the more mindfulness stuff,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.675
I can't help myself
but think about it

00:35:59.675 --> 00:36:01.890
in terms of what I'm
trying to accomplish.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.750
And every time I get
distracted and I come back,

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.620
I get this feeling
of, I'm failing.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.010
I'm not doing it well.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.590
And after doing it for a month,
and getting no better at it,

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.090
based on the name of your book,
I'm guessing you understand.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.230
It feels like I'm not
accomplishing something.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.380
I'm not getting better.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.460
Why am I doing this?

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.669
And I just leave more
frustrated than I entered,

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:21.710
and I was hoping you could
talk to that a little.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.950
DAN HARRIS: OK.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.050
I have a million things
to say about that.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.410
The big one is you're not alone.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.510
I mean, that's the deal.

00:36:28.451 --> 00:36:30.700
The good news is, let me
just lead with the good news,

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.330
because it is that
it gets easier.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.070
It just does.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.770
I've been doing
it for five years.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.020
It's still hard, but
it's a lot easier.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.640
And I do much more
now than I used to.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.580
I do 35 minutes a
day and I sometimes

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.380
do a supplemental
second sitting before I

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.171
go to bed because I
find it helps me sleep.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.780
Not because I have to, nobody's
putting a gun to my head.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.350
It's just grown organically
and it's gotten a lot easier.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:54.015
But is it hard?

00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:54.515
Yes.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.716
Sometimes people come
to me and say, I get it.

00:36:59.716 --> 00:37:00.590
You make a good case.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.715
Meditation is good for you.

00:37:01.715 --> 00:37:04.050
But you don't understand,
I could never do it.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.400
My mind is too busy.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.705
I call this the
fallacy of uniqueness.

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:12.510
Welcome to the human condition.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.170
Everybody's mind is crazy.

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:19.080
Think about it like
going to the gym.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.720
If you go to the gym and
it's easy, you are cheating.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.450
And if you're meditating,
and it's easy,

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.985
you're probably cheating,
maybe you're enlightened,

00:37:29.985 --> 00:37:30.610
or you're dead.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.090
You are fighting, as I said
in my speech, a lifetime

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.780
habit of just blah, blah,
blah, blah, me, me, me.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.910
And it is hard to stop that.

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:46.740
By the way, you don't
have to clear your mind.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.530
You're just focusing
on one thing.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.820
That is the game.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.905
So drop that.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.070
And yet, here I
am, five years in,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.410
and when I find myself lost
and distracted, there's like a,

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.984
I think I used this phrase in my
book, a tornadic blast of self

00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:01.525
flagellation.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.100
The whole game is to
just notice that too.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.670
Oh, I'm beating myself up.

00:38:08.294 --> 00:38:09.460
Let's go back to the breath.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.630
And Sharon Salzberg, who is an
amazing meditation teacher, who

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.487
spoke here yesterday,
I had brunch with her

00:38:16.487 --> 00:38:18.070
on Sunday morning,
and we were talking

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.480
about my problem of
beating myself up

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.700
when I get lost in thought.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.866
And she said, it's helpful
to have a sense of humor.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.980
Because, as much as
you may think your life

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:34.020
is about big things like faith,
honor, fidelity, patriotism,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:38.204
or whatever, and that may be
true, but most of your life--

00:38:38.204 --> 00:38:40.620
And I could prove it to you
if you just sit down and close

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.828
your eyes and watch what
happens. --most of your life

00:38:42.828 --> 00:38:44.670
is about, what am I
going to have for lunch.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.120
It's funny, right?

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.650
So we're all assholes,
you know, and so,

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.120
like so just to sit
down and close your eyes

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.000
and then find yourself
lost, if you can do it

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.900
with some lightness, if you can
do it with a sense of humor,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.509
it makes it much easier.

00:39:00.509 --> 00:39:02.050
And then, just know--
And I'll repeat

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.258
what I said at the beginning.

00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:04.620
--that it does get easier.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.390
It just does.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.600
And so you may not feel like
you're accomplishing anything,

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.225
but I'd like to hear, after you
do it for a couple months, what

00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:12.629
people who live and work
with you say about you.

00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:14.920
Because it was my wife who
started noticing it before I

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.420
did.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.210
I started hearing her
say at cocktail parties,

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.410
Harris is less of a jerk.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.440
And that really was
a good motivator.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.700
And great teachers will
say to all the time,

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.810
the real litmus test is
what people around you

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.220
are saying about your behavior.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.780
So just keep going.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.300
Don't worry.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.180
This is unlike everything
else in your life,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.515
where you do something and
expect a preordained result.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.640
It requires, and I know
this is a sticky word,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.160
it requires a little
bit of faith or trust

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.437
that it is worth it, which
is what I'm trying embody.

00:39:49.437 --> 00:39:50.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:51.186
DAN HARRIS: Good luck.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:54.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.684
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:39:56.887 --> 00:39:58.220
When I first started meditating.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.040
I went to a meditation
retreat and I

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.900
was telling my boyfriend
and best friend

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.420
that I was going there.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.412
And I felt like,
after I told them

00:40:05.412 --> 00:40:07.620
that, I had to convince them
I wasn't joining a cult.

00:40:09.044 --> 00:40:10.960
But the thing is, that
I think it would really

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.066
benefit both of them.

00:40:12.066 --> 00:40:13.940
I'm never sure though,
how to tell the story.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.660
I mean, obviously you're
promoting meditation now,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.776
with your book, but before
you decided to write it,

00:40:19.776 --> 00:40:21.400
was it something that
you were actively

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.950
recommending to other people?

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.670
And if so, how were you
talking about in a way that

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.380
would make sense to a western,
college educated person?

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.862
DAN HARRIS: Well, there
was a "New Yorker" cartoon

00:40:33.862 --> 00:40:35.570
that I'm trying to
get into my PowerPoint

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.460
because it's awesome.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.760
It was recent and
it has two people

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.190
a lunch and one
of the women says,

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.070
I've been gluten free for a
week and I'm already annoying.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.510
That's kind of my
view about meditation.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.240
I'm perfectly happy to
get up and put a mike on

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.530
and say, you guys
all need to meditate.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:59.040
But I won't do it one to one,
because it's really annoying.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.290
And there's just
no way around it.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.250
And I think-- my wife
doesn't meditate, by the way.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.530
I mean, she's a
physician, scientist,

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.950
and she's seen all the data.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.810
She buys it.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.410
She loves that I'm
less of a jerk.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.730
But she doesn't do it.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.080
And I know the shortcut
to a smack in the head

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.570
and her never meditating,
would be for me

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.060
to a lecture about when she
stressed about how, maybe it

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.185
would help if you meditate.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.710
Bad idea.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.140
I'm going to steal something
from my Christian friends.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.880
They often say that
the best thing to do

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.680
is not to evangelize one to
one, but to live your faith

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.500
in a way that is
convincing and compelling

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.716
to the people around you.

00:41:41.716 --> 00:41:43.340
And over time, you
may find that people

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.060
come to you of
their own volition,

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.780
and say, what's this all about?

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.480
Because I guarantee you, in
a world, as I said before,

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.870
that is characterized
by both impermanence.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.800
I.e. nothing lasts, and
entropy, where everything's out

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.700
of our control, your
friend and your boyfriend

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.834
are going to have
crises in their lives.

00:42:01.834 --> 00:42:03.500
And they may, at that
point, come to you

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.000
and say, tell me about
this thing you're doing.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.640
One last cliche, it's often
said in Buddhist circles

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.640
that it's better to be a
Buddha than a Buddhist.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.240
And so, I would just
say, live your life.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.350
Maximize your own happiness
through your practice.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.560
Don't wag your finger
at those around you.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.870
And let them come to
you, because they will.

00:42:24.427 --> 00:42:26.010
AUDIENCE: I have a
follow up question.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:26.370
DAN HARRIS: Yes.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.350
It's worked really well
with my cat, that cat Ruby.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.770
She hated me for a
long time but then

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.520
when I started ignoring
her, she loved me.

00:42:33.022 --> 00:42:35.480
AUDIENCE: So, Sharon, yesterday
inspired me to start again,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.630
because I'm kind of
off again, on again.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.660
And the thing that happens
when I meditate in the morning,

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.690
is when Peter's in the
shower, I'm always like,

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.880
let's hope the meditation
ends before he gets out

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.470
of the shower.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.810
Because when he gets out
and comes out into the room

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.480
and sees me sitting there, he
inevitably asks me if I'm OK.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.650
Like I go to that place when
I'm sad or something like that.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.710
And I'm never sure
how the quite tell

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.020
the story without going
into-- I don't know, in a way

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.540
that he's going to comprehend
and make him feel like I'm not

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.300
doing it because I'm
feeling depressed.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.457
I'm just doing it--

00:43:06.457 --> 00:43:08.790
DAN HARRIS: You need to start
talking to him the way you

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.140
would about physical exercise.

00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:12.859
You should start--
This, I think you

00:43:12.859 --> 00:43:14.400
could say to him
pretty aggressively,

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.830
just view this as if
you came out and found

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.070
me doing jumping jacks.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.560
You know, this is
just part of upkeep.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.340
You don't have to do it.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.215
It's totally cool if
you don't want to do it.

00:43:24.215 --> 00:43:25.620
But this is my
thing and I'm just

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.590
trying to be consistent about
doing it five to 10 minutes

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.090
a day.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.080
And that's way every
westerner can grasp.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.500
And if you're
doing it every day,

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.820
he's not going to think, he will
not have any reason to think,

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.150
you only do when you're sad.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.432
And let me just make
a pitch for dailyness.

00:43:41.432 --> 00:43:45.090
I think it's more powerful to
do short daily doses than once

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.580
in awhile long.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:50.750
It's that daily collision with
the asshole in your head, that

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.340
will help you fend off
its shitty suggestions.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.920
Because that's it's job.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.860
And what you want
is the wherewithal

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.050
to not follow those
bad suggestions.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.350
And you get that through
the daily collision, which

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.600
is why I say five
to 10 minutes a day,

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.877
time we all have, no
question about it.

00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:12.980
And you can always get
it down to two minutes

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.070
on your super busy days.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.040
It's just the
dailyness of it that

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.660
helps you really stick with
it over long periods of time.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.290
And when you're
sitting there worrying

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:26.340
about your boyfriend's going
to say, just notice worrying.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.230
That's what, that this
is what worrying's like.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.660
Then go back to your breath.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.368
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.530
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Andrea.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.180
My dad and I both
read your book.

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.480
And we really liked it.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.450
It's great that you
admit that you're flawed

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:43.269
and it makes it seem
more realistic and more--

00:44:43.269 --> 00:44:45.060
DAN HARRIS: Thanks for
bring that up again.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.980
AUDIENCE: No problem.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.280
That's what I'm here for.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.520
I'm curious if you've looked
into positive psychology at all

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.470
and if you've considered
incorporating that

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:55.704
as well into your life
or your next book.

00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:58.120
AUDIENCE: I don't know anything
about positive psychology,

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.680
per se.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.537
That usually doesn't stop me
from to speaking at length.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.250
But I'm going to use
this is an opportunity

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.000
to talk about positive thinking.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.500
Sorry.

00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:13.900
Positive thinking,
there's actually

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.390
a scientific term for it.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.390
I believe the scientific
term is bullshit.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.320
This idea that you can
get anything you want--

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.390
Don't watch this, but there
is a DVD called "The Secret."

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.830
It was very popular a while ago,
for reasons that I cannot fully

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:32.520
comprehend.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.050
And there's a DVD which, again,
I don't think you should watch,

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.510
in which they
basically argue, you

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.760
can get anything you want,
like a diamond necklace

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.290
miraculously, a cure for cancer,
and a that better love life,

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.681
if you just think positive
thoughts all the time.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.610
It's just demonstrably untrue.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.740
And think about the
inverse of the logic

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.416
and how damaging an
argument this is.

00:45:57.416 --> 00:45:59.040
First of all, it's
damaging because you

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.210
don't want to be
telling people, you

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.376
don't need to go the doctor.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.410
That's just a terrible
thing to suggest.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.000
But with the inverse
of the logic is,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.880
so anybody born in a
refugee camp in Africa

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.550
was thinking
negatively in utero?

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.954
Everybody in Port Au
Prince, Haiti in 2010

00:46:15.954 --> 00:46:17.370
was thinking
negatively and that's

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.466
why they got hit
by an earthquake?

00:46:19.466 --> 00:46:19.965
It's crazy.

00:46:21.136 --> 00:46:22.010
And it's not helpful.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.570
And the only people
I know who've

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.610
had their problems solved
through these books

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:26.776
are the people writing them.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.830
So I would urge
you to stay away.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.199
I will do some research
on positive psychology.

00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:33.490
I suspect it's less pernicious.

00:46:34.372 --> 00:46:35.330
AUDIENCE: A little bit.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:36.937
And one quick
follow up question?

00:46:36.937 --> 00:46:38.770
Are there any meditation
apps you recommend?

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.450
DAN HARRIS: Yes.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.740
Headspace.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.810
Really good.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.510
And those guys know
what they're doing.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.093
They're legit.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.580
Andy, the guy who founded
it, was a monk for 10 years

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.820
and yet is young and really,
really cool and can juggle.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.520
And so, it's a good app.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.990
It's very sticky.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.200
People tend to like it
and I think it's great.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.135
I don't think you need
technological assistance, just

00:47:03.135 --> 00:47:03.760
for the record.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.720
But if you want an
app, that's a good one.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:09.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.710
My name's Daniel
and I'm an engineer.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.710
In your book, you mention
going on a retreat.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.800
What role did that
play in your journey

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.694
and are there any good
places in New York?

00:47:19.694 --> 00:47:20.360
DAN HARRIS: Yes.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.210
OK, that's a great question.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.390
I went on a 10 day silent
meditation retreat,

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.315
which was the most annoying
thing I've ever done.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.900
And also, the happiest
I've ever been.

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:41.332
I don't think you need to do it.

00:47:41.332 --> 00:47:43.316
I did it because I
was writing a book.

00:47:43.316 --> 00:47:44.732
I needed some shit
to write about.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:47.479
So, but, it's a
great thing to do

00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:48.895
if you're getting
into meditation.

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.150
The reason why I'm just
being a little careful

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.920
is because I don't want
people to think in order

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.290
to be a meditator, you need
to go off and do 10 days

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.280
with people who wear
socks and sandals.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.790
But it is a great thing to do.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.020
It can really
deepen your practice

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:09.000
and give you-- because
this is, again,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.350
to use the physical
exercise analogy,

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:16.130
once you're on 10 days
and its what you're

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.429
doing all day, every day,
you get into great shape

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:20.470
so to speak, and you're
going to have experiences

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.928
that are different
than what you're

00:48:21.928 --> 00:48:23.740
doing in your daily life.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.530
And for me, I had
an experience where

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.360
I just, all of the struggling
and striving and the suffering

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.020
kind of just, whew, just
evaporated for about 36 hours.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.609
And I was just right there
with whatever was happening.

00:48:38.609 --> 00:48:41.150
It wasn't spiritual, there was
no white light or string music

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:42.090
or anything like that.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:45.020
I just had this
incredible 36 hours

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.720
of being fully where I was.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.660
And that was accompanied with
a big blast of serotonin.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:56.130
And then it went away and
it went back to sucking.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.110
But I think that
meditation retreats

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.290
are where your practice
really changes.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.600
And if you're starting
to get serious--

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.784
there's a bit of a spectrum.

00:49:05.784 --> 00:49:07.950
There are people who just
do a little bit every day,

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.200
and I think that's fantastic.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.580
But some people
move up the spectrum

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.690
where they get more
serious about it,

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.439
then I think going on
a meditation retreat

00:49:13.439 --> 00:49:15.160
is a great, great idea.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.070
And there's a place
in Massachusetts,

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.060
three hours drive from here.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.990
It's called The Insight
Meditation Society.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.880
Sharon Salzberg, who was here
yesterday, she co-founded it.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.760
And they run meditation
retreats all year.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.710
It is a font of wisdom.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:34.270
It is where this revolution,
mindfulness revolution,

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.300
started.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.077
And you are getting
the purest of the pure

00:49:38.077 --> 00:49:39.910
and they're not going
to try to inveigle you

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:42.540
into some fancy religion
or get your money.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.040
It's cheap.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.267
It's super legit, and I
would recommend it highly.

00:49:49.267 --> 00:49:50.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.270
DAN HARRIS: Pleasure.

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.900
It's 1:00.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.530
I suspect maybe you
guys have to work.

00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:56.750
I'll answer questions
as long as you want.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.083
I love talking about this stuff.

00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:01.700
But if you need to go
back to work, I'm sorry.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.500
Thank you.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.050
Appreciate it.
