00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
You know that old joke about women being too tired for sex?

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.100
Turns out, it's not just an excuse.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.160
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660
Hey, everyone. Julia here for DNews.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.820
Not getting enough sleep really screws you up.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.180
You can't remember things as well.
You can't focus.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.140
You might make some pretty poor decisions.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.640
You get the picture.
Really we've talked about it before!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.260
Check out some links down below.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.440
But it seems not getting enough sleep, 
even screws up your screwing.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.020
Yeah, okay, it sounds like a "no duh" kind of thing

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.520
But there really haven't been any studies on this
in women until now.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.220
A somewhat small study published in the Journal
Sexual Medicine

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.400
found that women who slept more
were more likely to have sex.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.880
The study asked 171 female college students
about their sleep and sexual habits.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.120
Most of the women were straight, and about half of them were in relationships.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.760
The results seems to focus mostly on those groups.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.260
Every morning they filled out a questiomnaire, that asked questions like

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.360
how long did it take you to fall asleep, and have you had sex in the last 24 hours?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.800
The researchers found that for each extra hour of sleep the women had

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.140
they were hornier, and had 14% increase in the likelihood of sex the next day.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.480
Even after factoring for things like age, sexual problems, fatigue or menstruation.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.940
But not only did they get more action the next day, they performed better.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.360
Women who slept more, also reported more vaginal lubrication during sex

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.080
than those who didn't sleep as much.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.000
This does seem like common sense, but scientists still aren't sure on why this is.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.920
The researchers think that maybe poor sleep messes with a women hormone levels that quote:

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.740
 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.780
And gentlemen I'm not letting you off the hook either, you need your, sleep too.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.400
A study published in the Journal of American Medical Association

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.700
found that men who don't get enough sleep, have testosterone levels closer to a man fifteen years older

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.940
even after just one week's worth of poor sleep.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.060
That lowering of testosterone leaves men feeling less in the mood.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.040
So ladies and gents
if you wanna get some, get some sleep.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.180
Speaking of sleep if you want to know more about sleep and why we need it, check out this playlist down here
