Hopefully, here's how you found out what

00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:04.170
gundega's name means in English. You'd go

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.070
to the API's explorer and search or scroll to the translate API. You list the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.170
translate API functions, and choose language.translations.list.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.970
Enter the text to translate, which in this case is gundega and enter

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.330
the target language, in this case, en. Then you press

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.800
the Execute button. And here's the response from that execution. See the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.410
request, but more importantly the response. We see that the translated text, is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.300
buttercup. What a lovely name. And the detected source language is LV,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.240
which is Latvia. Let me check if that's correct. Gundega, where are you from?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.650
&gt;&gt; That is correct,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.890
I am indeed from Latvia
