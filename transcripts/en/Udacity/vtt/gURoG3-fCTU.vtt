00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;From our discussion of
human color vision,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.330
we know what's going on with the r,
g, and b in the color class.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.650
But what's this alpha thing?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.060
Alpha is another component of
a color that computers use for

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.590
compositing, which is
a fancy way of saying,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.719
what happens when you draw
stuff on top of other stuff?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.650
If you draw a shape with alpha equals
one, then it's totally opaque.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.620
Whatever the background color was,
it's totally gone.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.190
If you draw a shape with alpha equals
zero,then you haven't actually

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.160
changed anything.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.560
The new color is totally transparent.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.780
If alpha equals .5, then the new color
is half the background color and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.130
half your new color.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.860
So your drawing looks translucent.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.380
For now, we're going to be
drawing everything fully opaque.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.370
So any time you see an alpha field,
just set it to one.
