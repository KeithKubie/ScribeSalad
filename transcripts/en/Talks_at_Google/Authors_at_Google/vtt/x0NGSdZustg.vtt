FEMALE SPEAKER:
I'm really, really

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.970
excited today to bring a friend
of mine and speaker, a author,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.910
Mike Robbins, to Google
San Francisco to talk

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.470
about his latest book,
"Nothing Changes Until You Do."

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.570
This is Mike's third book.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.990
He's also written two other
books that you may know,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.720
"Focus On the Good
Stuff" and "Be Yourself,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.520
Everyone Else is Already Taken."

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.030
So without further ado,
I'll introduce Mike Robbins.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.732
Thank you.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:32.940
MIKE ROBBINS: Thanks, Rachel.

00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:38.780
All right, I think I
might come around here.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.990
How many of you guys have ever
had like a goal or a dream

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.140
or something you really
wanted to have happen,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.234
but you couldn't figure
out how to make it happen?

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:48.650
You've had that
experience, right?

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.910
You probably have certain
things in your life

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.480
like that right now.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240
I thought a good way
for me to get started

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.260
to talk a little
bit about this book

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.070
and what I'm going to
talk about here today

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.760
is actually tell a
little bit of my story.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.968
Some of you may know that,
some of you on live stream

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:03.637
may know that as well, but also
sort of as it relates to some

00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:04.970
of the core themes of this book.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.630
But it's actually story related
to the first book that I wrote,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.690
which is called "Focus
on the Good Stuff."

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.870
So as some of you know, my
background-- I grew up here

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.600
in the Bay Area, I played
baseball most of my life.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.380
I actually got drafted right out
of high school by the Yankees.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.720
Didn't end up signing
with the Yankees

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.136
because I got an opportunity
to play baseball at Stanford.

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.395
So I go to Stanford,
play there, then I

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:28.510
get drafted out of Stanford
by the Kansas City Royals,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.590
signed a pro contract.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.215
The way it works in professional
baseball here in the US,

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:34.180
some of you know, you sign a
pro contract with a major league

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.470
team, you still have to
go in the minor leagues.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.149
I ended up injuring
my pitching arm

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.190
when I was in the minor
leagues with Kansas City,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.500
so my career ended a lot
sooner than I wanted it to.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.140
So that was an interesting
challenge that I went through.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.962
But as I was kind of making it
my way through that process--

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.420
I had to get a job,
figure out what

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.740
I was going to do with the
rest of my life, right?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.615
It was the late '90s.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.960
I got a job working for
an internet company,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.907
actually, not that
far from where

00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:57.990
we're standing right here.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.180
I worked for 24/7 Media.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.750
Our biggest competitor was
DoubleClick at the time.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.362
So I was in online
ad sales, actually.

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:06.070
Worked there for about
a year and a half.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.520
Then I went to go get a job
at a sports website called

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.020
rivals.com, and it was
kind of a new startup

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.150
and a lot of VC backing.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.790
We were all going to get rich,
it was going to go public.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.940
And then the dot.com bubble
burst and I lost my job.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.610
But I had this
idea-- and this had

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.604
been for a number of years--
that I really wanted to speak

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:25.020
and I wanted to
write and I wanted

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.320
to try to inspire people.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.820
I didn't really
know how to do that,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.710
but I got some encouragement
and I got some coaching,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.510
and I decided at the
beginning of 2001,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.230
even though I was nervous,
to start my own business

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.330
as a coach, as a speaker.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.080
And one of the things
that I wanted to do,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.690
and one of things I
figured you have to do

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.510
is write a book, right?

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.940
I mean, that's part
of how you do that.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.340
So I decided I
wanted write a book.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.270
And I didn't know anything
about writing a book,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.880
but I started reading books
about how to write a book,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.004
and I started meeting people
about how you do that.

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.390
And within not that long,
maybe about nine months,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.407
a year, I had met a
guy who was helping me

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.240
and kind of coaching
me and putting together

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.330
a book proposal.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.230
Because that's sort of what you
have to do to then get an agent

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.040
and then get a book deal, and I
was learning all these things.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.123
OK, so I start to do this.

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:01.920
So then fast
forward, it literally

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.860
goes over the span
of about five years.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040
I go through two
literary agents.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.890
I get rejected 25 times by
every publisher on the planet.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.790
And I'm frustrated.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.490
And now it's like
early 2006, I'm

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.220
on my second literary agent.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.910
We've gone through all
these series of rejections.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.879
And I'm frustrated.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.920
And I've been speaking
now for a number of years,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.836
and I've been working
with some cool companies

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.010
here in the Bay Area
and around the country.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.440
And my agent says
to me, listen, Mike.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.459
You're a nice guy.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.000
I know you're really passionate
about this whole appreciation

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.980
thing.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.680
But you know what, I don't
think it's going to work.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.890
Maybe you gotta change the
topic, or I don't know,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.340
but the publishers
aren't into it.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.160
And I listened to
her on the phone.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.549
This is like late
February, 2006.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.840
My wife, Michelle, and I--
we live in the Bay Area now.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.687
We live up in Marin.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:48.020
We've lived here our whole life.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.030
She's from here as well.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.140
We had just had our
first daughter, Samantha,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.097
who was a new baby,
who's now eight.

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:54.430
But Samantha had just been born.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.721
So I have this conversation
with my agent on the phone,

00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:59.210
and I listen to her feedback,
and I go to sleep that night.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.740
But I'm pissed.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.430
Like, I can't even sleep.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.012
And I'm not necessarily mad at
her, I'm just mad in general.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:06.720
And I don't know what
the anger is about.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.690
And I'm talking to my wife and
she's trying to go to sleep,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.760
and I can't sleep.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.270
And then finally in the
middle of the night it hit me,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.870
and I went, you know what?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.290
I realize what's going on.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.420
I keep waiting for permission.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.910
I'm waiting for someone
to tell me I'm ready.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.600
I don't know if it's my agent or
some publisher or some someone.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.110
And I said, you know what?

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.350
I'm gonna write this book.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.400
So I called her
the next day and I

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.066
said, listen, I
appreciate the feedback,

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.500
But I gotta tell you something.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.167
I'm not waiting anymore.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:31.750
I've been waiting
for your permission,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.060
I've been waiting-- I'm
just not waiting anymore.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.268
I'm going to write this book.

00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:35.900
I'll publish it
myself if I have to.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.650
That's what I'm going to do.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.900
And she said, all right, Mike.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.191
I understand you're frustrated.

00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:42.599
Listen, she said,
before you do that, I've

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.890
got a couple other publishers
that I hadn't reached out

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.890
to yet.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.590
Let me send it out
to all three of them

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.365
and see what they think.

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:50.990
She calls back two
days later and says,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.365
you're not going
to believe this.

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:54.880
All three of them want it.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.490
And I ended up publishing
my first book with Wiley.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.320
And what was interesting about
it, because I looked at it--

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.770
and I remember thinking to
myself even at the time,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.960
but especially now
looking back-- nothing

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.720
had changed with
my book proposal.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.260
Quite frankly, I had literally
had the same proposal

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.230
for almost five years.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.438
I mean, I had adjusted it
a little bit along the way.

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.110
It was the same thing.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.980
The only thing that
changed was me.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.300
Something shifted inside of me.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.250
I got mad.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.390
I don't know, I just
had a new daughter,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.850
I don't know what it was,
but something shifted.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.290
And now I can see, looking
back-- that was 2006,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.930
I wrote the book, it came out
in '07-- I can see in hindsight

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.790
now, looking back,
oh, you know what?

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.040
I wasn't actually ready
up until that moment.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.550
And the moment I was ready,
that's when it happened.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.300
And you can probably
look in your own life

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.674
and see there's been a lot of
situations and circumstance

00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:36.030
that happened just like that.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.956
You can't always
tell in the moment.

00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:40.080
You connect the dots when
you look back and go, oh,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.680
that's why that happened.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.820
So a lot of the focus of this
new book that I just wrote

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.550
is about that.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.930
How do we shift internally?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.570
What do we need to shift
and change internally

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.230
so that the world
around us changes?

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.740
But in addition to that,
it's also really about

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.800
that one of the core themes of
this book is self-compassion.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.290
Self-compassion.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.090
And I've been fascinated
by this and have

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.430
started to research
this a little bit.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.990
It's been something that I've
both struggled with and found

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.870
interesting over the course of
most of my life and my work.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.630
And especially
when I find myself

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.680
in environments
like here at Google

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.570
with a lot of really
smart, talented people,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.010
I find that many of us
struggle with our relationship

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.550
with ourselves.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.230
And how do we treat ourselves
with that sense of compassion?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.980
So what I hope to do here
is to talk a little bit.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.110
I'm going to share a few stories
from the book and a few ideas

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.960
related to
self-compassion and how

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.930
we can make some of
those internal shifts.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.270
But I also hope-- and even
though I know some of you

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.300
are watching this
video or you're

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.530
watching us on live stream-- for
those of you here in the room,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.770
that we have a
bit of a dialogue,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.980
that I'll be able to
answer some questions.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.771
But we'll talk about
this, how this relates

00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:41.830
to you and to your life, so that
you can take some things away

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.530
that you can actually use.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.710
Cool?

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.430
So take a moment right
now, if you would.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.430
and if you're watching us on
live stream you can do this.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.480
If you're by
yourself, maybe just

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.050
jot it down or think about it.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.080
If you're watching
the video, same thing.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.970
But for those of you here,
pair up with someone and talk

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.350
a little bit about for you,
thinking about--and I'll talk

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.800
a little more about
self-compassion-- but for you,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.020
in terms of your
relationship with yourself,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.600
what do you find makes it
difficult or challenging

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.500
for you to be kind and
compassionate to yourself?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.510
Because I know for many
of us, myself included,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.850
that can be challenging.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.430
So what kind of
things do you find

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.790
get in the way of
your own ability

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.757
to be kind and
compassionate to yourself?

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:20.340
So pair up with someone and just
chat a little bit about that,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.220
and then we'll dive into it.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:30.156
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.550
MIKE ROBBINS: right.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.980
So did everybody get a
chance to talk a little bit?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.600
OK.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.730
So let's talk a
little bit about this.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.620
So what makes it
difficult, what makes it

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.980
challenging, if
you will, or what

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.265
gets in the way of us being kind
and compassionate to ourselves?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.999
OK.

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:01.540
And I'll repeat this
for those of you

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.081
who are on live
stream and the video.

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:06.170
So you say if you're too
compassionate with yourself--

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.300
if you are-- then the fear is
that I won't achieve my goals,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.800
right?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.480
How many of you
can relate to that?

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:12.990
Yeah.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.698
And look, this is a
really important one,

00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:16.850
because so many of
us, myself included,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.400
this is one of the places
where we really get stuck.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.300
And we get trapped in
this idea of, like, oh,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.940
if I'm too compassionate
with myself,

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.322
then I'm not going
to be focused,

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:26.780
I'm not going to
be driven, I'm not

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.069
going to get to the
next level, right?

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.110
Now look, we all gotta
figure this out on our own

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.693
and what works for
us and what doesn't

00:08:32.693 --> 00:08:34.169
work and all that, right?

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.390
I have found in my life-- now
I'm 40 years old now, right?

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.682
So I've got a lot more
life to live, I hope.

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:41.140
But I've lived a
few years and what

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.780
I've learned over time
is that that fear,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.020
that concern has been there.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.103
And it was a lot stronger
for me as I was younger.

00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.560
As I'm getting a little bit
older I'm starting to notice,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.340
I'm not so sure
that's actually true.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.670
And I think we buy
into that notion.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.280
Culturally we buy
into that notion.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.760
In environments, especially an
environment here like Google

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.750
where there's a lot of
really smart people,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.260
there's a lot of really
ambitious people, this idea

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.800
that compassion is-- oh,
well then I'll be lazy,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.780
well then I won't be so-- right?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.159
And again, just as
a challenge to you--

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:14.450
but I appreciate you bringing
it up, but to all of us--

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.880
maybe it's not true that pushing
ourselves and driving ourselves

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.500
is actually what leads
us to being successful.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.510
But that's definitely
a concern or a fear.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.340
Well, like if I'm too easy
with myself or soft on myself,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.842
right?

00:09:29.842 --> 00:09:32.300
You know, I'll share a story
from the book related to that,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.800
because I think it's
really important

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.080
and I think it's
so poignant here.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.538
And as Rachel
mentioned, look, I've

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:38.649
spoken at 15 Google
offices around the world

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:39.690
over the last four years.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.410
I've had a chance to work
with literally thousands

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.493
and thousands of Googlers.

00:09:42.493 --> 00:09:44.340
So I'm not an expert
on your culture,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.410
but I have some
perspective, right?

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.590
And also other companies
here in Silicon Valley

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.370
and other companies where
there are people like you,

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.760
gets the best and the
brightest, doing really well,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.385
people-focused.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.360
There's something-- so I went
to Stanford as an undergrad.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.070
And the day that I showed
up on campus at Stanford--

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.740
some of you may have heard me
share this story because I talk

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.615
about it when I'm here
at Google especially--

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:07.670
was simultaneously one
of the most exciting

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.767
and one of the most
humbling days of my life.

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:11.850
Because not only-- Stanfor's
a really good school,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.170
as you probably know,
right? --but not only

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.380
is Stanford a great
school, but it's

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.550
got a great baseball program.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.466
And I played baseball.

00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:18.872
I mean, that was my focus
as a kid growing up.

00:10:18.872 --> 00:10:21.080
So to get an opportunity to
play baseball at Stanford

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.380
is literally the brass ring.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.230
I mean, as a high
school baseball player,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.180
if you're a decent student
and a decent baseball player,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.980
you want to go to Stanford.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.770
There are thousands of
kids across the country who

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.460
want to go.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:30.980
I got in.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.710
I was excited.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.335
And my whole senior
year in high school

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.125
I was like, the guy
who got into Stanford.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.375
I mean it was like a big deal.

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:37.890
I mean, this is like
my whole identity.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.920
Then I show up on campus at
Stanford the very first day,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.680
I'm all excited.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.138
I get there and I
look around and I

00:10:42.138 --> 00:10:44.720
went-- I had a very basic
but profound realization:

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.670
Oh, everybody else
got into Stanford too.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.130
Like I wasn't so
special anymore.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.347
And not only was I not
special, immediately

00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:54.180
that little voice in
my head started saying,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.443
dude, you don't belong here.

00:10:56.443 --> 00:10:58.729
Dude, look how could he
is, look how smart she is.

00:10:58.729 --> 00:11:00.020
And it wasn't just in baseball.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.436
It was like all
the kids, everyone

00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:04.110
seemed way smarter than me,
way more talented than me,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.390
way more confident than me.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.886
And I'm thinking, I
must have snuck in.

00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.260
Like I'm sure
someone's literally

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.340
going to knock on my door and be
like, Robbins, come over here.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.110
You gotta go.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.940
Like that was the
feeling that I had.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.520
Now what we call this
in psychological terms

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.691
is the impostor syndrome.

00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.190
And what's important, and when
I write about it in the book,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.150
I talk about, remember,
everybody experiences

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.280
that impostor
syndrome, everyone.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.295
It does not matter how
talented anyone is.

00:11:28.295 --> 00:11:30.420
It does not matter how
accomplished they are.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.878
Look, in some of
the work that I do

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:34.160
I'm always amazed when I
started to work with people

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.620
I meet, people
who are incredibly

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.129
accomplished, incredibly
talented, and just, wow.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:40.670
You get down below,
as I like to say,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.490
the water line of the
iceberg a little bit,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.364
and they start sharing
what's really going on

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:46.420
and how they're really
feeling, oftentimes

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.116
there's an enormous
amount of insecurity,

00:11:49.116 --> 00:11:50.240
an enormous amount of fear.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.156
And all the way back to
what you talked about,

00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:55.900
then this idea that we've got
to be driven in such a way

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.790
that that's going to
lead us to success.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.330
And I think in a lot
of ways, it's not true.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.142
But we believe it
and we buy into it.

00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:06.600
So I appreciate
you bringing it up,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.141
because that's a
very real-world one.

00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:08.680
What else?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.971
What else do you find makes
it difficult or challenging

00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:14.321
to be compassionate
with yourself?

00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:14.820
Yeah.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.520
So denial.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.020
So denying compassion
for ourselves,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.930
that we're so
focused, we're just

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.596
moving on to whatever
the next thing is.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:25.400
This idea, I don't need
that, who needs that, right?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.862
Yeah, like what's
the value of it?

00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:29.070
Well, you know it's interesting,
because as I started

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.210
to write this book, I didn't
know for sure exactly,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.470
quite frankly, what the
book was going to be about,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.640
which is always an
interesting thing.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.160
Like, pitch the
publisher, it was

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.312
a new publisher on this
one, hey, what are you

00:12:37.312 --> 00:12:37.920
gonna write a book about?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.003
I don't really know yet,
we'll see what comes out.

00:12:40.003 --> 00:12:42.720
But the idea was I knew I wanted
it to be about our relationship

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.630
with ourselves.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.512
Because for me I have
always found, in my life--

00:12:46.512 --> 00:12:48.220
and maybe you can
relate to this or not--

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.800
most of the things
that I attempt to do,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.332
even the most challenging ones--
parenting, marriage, writing

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.040
a book, doing some of
the work that I do,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.300
dealing with some
of the challenges.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.895
I write a lot about in the
book of a lot of challenges

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:01.019
that I've faced in my life.

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:03.810
Most of those things
are relatively easy.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.590
The hardest part, always, is
dealing with myself in relation

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.780
to those things.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.530
Marriage-- actually,
my wife is fantastic.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.360
My marriage is a piece
of cake except when

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.610
I'm being difficult about her
or about life or about whatever.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.649
Parenting-- my
girls are fantastic.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:18.690
They do whatever they do.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.047
The hardest part of
parenting for me is me.

00:13:21.047 --> 00:13:22.880
When I'm in my head,
oh, what are you doing?

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.760
You should spend
more time with them.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.090
You should be like this,
you shouldn't be like that.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:25.970
Stop doing that.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.030
They're going to turn
out the wrong way.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.720
Look, that other kid.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.219
Whatever.

00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:30.994
All that craziness,
that's all in my head.

00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:32.660
So back to what's the
purpose, or what's

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.940
the point of self-compassion?

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.106
Well, I started to find--
there's a woman, actually,

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:39.600
who I've become friends with
now and really respect her work.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.457
She's a professor at the
University of Texas in Austin.

00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:44.040
Her name's Dr. Kristin
Neff, and she's

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.171
been studying self-compassion
for about a decade.

00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:48.670
She's one of the world's leading
experts in self-compassion.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.190
Some of you may be
familiar with her work.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.190
If you're not, check her out.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.320
She has a great Ted talk.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.140
She's been researching
this and really

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.470
looking at-- in the same
way that Brene Brown has

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.499
been researching
vulnerability and shame

00:13:58.499 --> 00:13:59.540
and other human emotions.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.990
Some of you may be
familiar with her.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.656
Kristin Neff's been
doing the same thing

00:14:02.656 --> 00:14:03.710
with self-compassion.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.690
So I had an opportunity
to talk to her

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.487
and actually interview
her, which was cool

00:14:07.487 --> 00:14:09.570
because we recorded the
interview because I wanted

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.210
to keep it and share
it with people.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.700
And here's what
she basically said.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.310
She said look, as
a culture, here's

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.550
what we've done over the
last generation or two,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.294
with good intentions, is we've
focused a lot on self-esteem.

00:14:20.294 --> 00:14:22.210
The idea that people
have to have self-esteem.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.280
Young people have
to have self-esteem,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.110
we've got to have self esteem.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.120
So we've raised a
generation, or generation

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.980
or two of young people, some
of you now in the workforce,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.864
with this idea that
like, high self-esteem.

00:14:31.864 --> 00:14:32.530
And that's good.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.530
And she says the psychological
research shows us

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.570
that people who don't have high
self-esteem, major problems

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.740
can happen.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.060
Depression, suicidal tendencies.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.710
So having a certain level of
self-esteem is fundamental.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.510
However, when we focus so
much on self-esteem, the way

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.785
that we've socialized
this idea of self esteem--

00:14:48.785 --> 00:14:50.410
and every single one
of us in this room

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.826
and all of you
watching this video

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:53.390
can totally relate
to this-- we then

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.800
have our self-esteem be
a comparative process

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.040
about how we stack
up with other people.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.934
It's a global evaluation of
our relative worth or value.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.350
That's why when you show up
in an environment like Google,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.040
just as an example, you may feel
good about yourself, but all

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.650
of a sudden, you don't
feel as good about yourself

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.316
because there's other
people around you.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:12.740
And you say, I don't know
where I stack up in comparison

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.720
to these other people.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.750
It's why a lot of people
in our Western culture,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.374
particularly here in
the United States,

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:19.010
we have an enormous
amount of abundance

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.457
but we're constantly feeling
like we don't have enough.

00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:24.040
You travel somewhere
else in the world

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.120
and realize, oh my goodness,
there's so much abundance

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.520
everywhere.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.165
I just wasn't paying
attention, because

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:29.250
of the comparative nature.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.871
So that's the negative, sort
of dark side of self-esteem.

00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:34.370
Because the reality--and Kristin
talks about this, actually,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.649
in her Ted talk-- but I
love when she says, look,

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.440
giving a talk, like
I'm giving a talk here.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.148
If you came up to me
after this and went,

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.680
hey Mike, that was very
average, I would be mortified.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.444
Like oh gosh, average is awful.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.110
But if you think about
it statistically,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.850
we're mostly going to be
average at most things we do.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.360
But that seems like a bad thing.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.510
And we're obsessed
with this idea

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.300
that we have to
be above average,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.800
we have to be
exceptional at things.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.826
And if we're not exceptional
then we're not good enough.

00:15:56.826 --> 00:15:58.200
So you see how it
becomes a trap.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.480
Self-esteem becomes a trap
because it's an insatiable,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.290
never-ending--

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.090
Self-compassion,
on the other hand,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.423
very different than self-esteem.

00:16:04.423 --> 00:16:06.880
Self-compassion has
three components to it.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.870
First of all a sense of
awareness or mindfulness.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.440
Not denial.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.940
How am I relating to myself?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.124
What am I thinking, what am
I feeling, what's going on?

00:16:16.124 --> 00:16:18.040
It's a core element of
emotional intelligence,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.910
but it's a real core
element self-compassion.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.400
What's going on?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.006
The self-talk.

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.880
Most of us-- look, they
say the average human

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.090
being has between 50 or 60,000
separate thoughts every day,

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.400
and on average, 80%
of those thoughts

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.579
are negative or critical.

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:34.120
And if you're anything like me,
the majority of your thoughts

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.960
focus on yourself,
so guess what,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.100
we're having 80% negative
thoughts about ourselves

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.720
every day.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.470
And that's a really
important conversation

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.928
that we're having in our head
about ourselves all day long.

00:16:42.928 --> 00:16:44.910
And often it's very critical.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.400
So the first thing is just
noticing it, being aware of it.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.220
The second thing is bringing
a sense of kindness.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.220
And we all know how to
bring a sense of kindness

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:52.920
and compassion.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.330
Think of someone you love.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.570
Think of even like a child
or an animal, especially

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.100
someone that you're not-- have
a big ego connection with.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.600
Sometimes with our
significant other

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.310
it can be positive or
negative, you know what I mean?

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.620
But just someone--
we know how to bring

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.750
kindness and compassion.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.030
You see someone on the
street or someone who's

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.780
having a tough time,
we'll show up, right?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.599
Tragedies happen in
our world, people

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.210
show up with an enormous amount
of compassion and kindness

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.200
for strangers, because it's
part of human nature, part

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.947
of our human spirit, right?

00:17:16.947 --> 00:17:19.530
The question is, do we do that
to ourselves, or for ourselves?

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.190
And often we don't.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.470
How do you react when you fail?

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.040
How do you react when
you get negative feedback

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.815
from your manager, from a
co-worker, from a friend?

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.940
You mess something up, you
hurt someone's feelings.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.250
How do you treat yourself
in those moments?

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.376
And oftentimes we're
incredibly hard on ourselves.

00:17:36.376 --> 00:17:38.000
One of the stories
I share in the book,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.954
actually-- I was on my way
to Dublin to deliver a couple

00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:43.620
sessions at the Google
office in Dublin.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.470
This was a couple years
ago, end of I think 2012.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.970
And I showed up at
the airport, SFO,

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.470
and I get in line for my flight.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.053
And I'm about an
hour and a half, hour

00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:53.679
and 45-- pretty
good for me, early.

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.470
It's an international
flight, so I'm there.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.010
And then I realize, oh my
gosh, I forgot my passport.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.016
And it's a Sunday.

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:03.890
And we were living in
San Rafael at the time.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.570
And my home office-- I mean,
it's literally, the passport

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.180
sits right by my
phone in my office.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.420
It's always there because
I can't forget my passport

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.280
when I'm going in--

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.609
I forgot my passport.

00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:14.400
So I run up to the
front and I say to them,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.733
I don't have my passport, can
I still get on the flight?

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:17.300
No.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.160
I'm trying to talk to them,
someone has to bring it.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.600
So I call my wife, Michelle,
who's at home with the girls.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.250
It's a Sunday, we had some
friends staying with us.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.365
And I'm in a panic.

00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:27.531
Babe, I forgot my passport,
can you rush-- you know,

00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:30.130
and they basically tell me,
she has to be here in an hour.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.570
You have to have your
passport and everything.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.403
We can check you in.

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.160
If it's past, closer than
an hour before the flight,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.020
you can't get on.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.145
So it's racing, racing,
Michelle's trying to do it,

00:18:38.145 --> 00:18:40.930
get the girls handled, the
whole thing, gets to SFO,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.860
gets me the passport.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.590
But it's 45 minutes
before the flight,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.960
and before she even gets
there I'm told by them

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.080
I'm not going to be able
to get on the flight.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.200
And I am mortified.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.504
And the voice in my head is
just going to town on me.

00:18:52.504 --> 00:18:54.920
Because I'm thinking of some
of the annoying conversations

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.044
I've had with my wife about
certain things like not

00:18:57.044 --> 00:18:59.530
itemizing a receipt from
Costco or whatever, right?

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.990
And here I am, like--

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.670
And I then find
out I will probably

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.090
be able to get on another
flight and get to Dublin just

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.300
in time for my event, but it's
going to cost me like $1,300

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.000
to do so on my dime.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.870
And it completely-- as we call
in sports, an unforced error,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.152
like it didn't need
to happen, right?

00:19:17.152 --> 00:19:19.110
And like the little
gremlin in my head is like,

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.780
you idiot, what
is wrong with you?

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.540
You've been doing this for a
long time, you know better.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.974
By the time my wife showed
up, I was literally in tears

00:19:25.974 --> 00:19:27.390
when I went out
to give her a hug.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.000
She was not upset
with me, actually.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.750
She was incredibly
kind and compassionate.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.490
She knew how upset I was.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.610
And I got so upset, literally,
by the time I got to Dublin,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.842
I was actually sick,
physically sick.

00:19:37.842 --> 00:19:39.800
But for me it was actually
a great wake-up call

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.830
because I realized, wow, I
don't respond so well when

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.227
I make a mistake, especially
when I think it's a big one

00:19:45.227 --> 00:19:47.310
and it shouldn't have
happened and all that stuff.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.660
That's the way that little
gremlin, that little voice,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.410
works, right?

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.144
So self-compassion is
awareness, kindness.

00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:54.310
Can we be kind to ourselves?

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.580
And the third piece, and
this is really important,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.390
is a sense of common humanity.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.231
We're not the only one.

00:20:01.231 --> 00:20:02.480
Back to the impostor syndrome.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.690
When you start to feel
insecure here, or in your life,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.148
or you show up
somewhere and think,

00:20:06.148 --> 00:20:07.399
how did I get invited to this?

00:20:07.399 --> 00:20:08.440
Or am I cut out for this?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.340
Or you get a new job.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:09.920
You ever have that happen?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.560
You get a promotion, you're
all excited and proud,

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.221
and then you're like, oh gosh,
I don't know if I'm prepared,

00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:15.470
I don't know if I can do this.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.630
Whatever.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.017
Have not only awareness
and kindness for yourself,

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:20.600
but then a sense of
oh, you know what,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.060
this is part of being human.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.560
And when we do that,
all of a sudden

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.970
it makes it less
personal, and we

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.390
can be not so attached to it.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.070
Oh, I'm just having
this human reaction.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.770
That make sense?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.890
So that's the difference.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.140
And nothing wrong
with self-esteem.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.280
Nothing wrong with wanting us
to have confidence in ourselves,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.363
but we so obsessed with,
I have to be exceptional,

00:20:40.363 --> 00:20:41.710
I have to be above average.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.077
We set ourselves up.

00:20:43.077 --> 00:20:44.410
And then we never quite achieve.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.570
Back to what you
were talking about,

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.190
this idea that I have to keep
pushing and driving and pushing

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.570
and driving, and then
it's never quite enough.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.890
And sadly it takes, often
sometimes something tragic

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.970
or something really painful to
happen to slow us down and go,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.775
you know what, maybe
I had things not quite

00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:02.400
in perspective.

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:05.270
So what else?

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.320
Other thoughts you have about
this idea of self compassion,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.930
either what makes it
difficult, or just,

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.320
even as I'm going through this,
any questions you have as I'm

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.236
talking about it.Yeah.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.620
So the idea that
being indulgent,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.950
or someone might judge me.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.533
Oh, if I'm going to
be compassionate--

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:26.219
because now you're starting
to talk a bit about self care,

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:28.010
how do we honor and
take care of ourselves?

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.420
What do I need?

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.840
I need to take a little
extra time in the morning,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.256
I'm going to go
get a massage, I'm

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:33.324
going to do certain things
to manage my wellness.

00:21:33.324 --> 00:21:35.240
And then other people
might perceive it either

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.079
as being selfish or indulgent,
or who do you think you are?

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.870
And look, there is a
balance at some level.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.740
Look, we're in
relationship with people.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.082
Personally we're in relationship
with people at work.

00:21:45.082 --> 00:21:47.540
Your manager or your boss says,
you have to get this to me,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.110
and here's the deadline.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.570
It's like, well, that doesn't
really feel good to me.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.932
That may be a true response.

00:21:52.932 --> 00:21:54.890
The manager might come
back and say, I'm sorry,

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.570
it still has to be
done by this time.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.350
So we have to negotiate
it to some degree.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.933
But here's the thing that we do,
and especially in our culture

00:22:00.933 --> 00:22:05.720
these days, is that we
have this notion that

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.560
not doing that is
somehow heroic,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.430
and doing that is
somehow selfish.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.314
I remember years
ago, a mentor of mine

00:22:14.314 --> 00:22:15.480
said this great thing to me.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.370
He said Mike, one of the most
selfish things you can do

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.800
is be miserable.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.952
I went, what do you mean?

00:22:21.952 --> 00:22:23.410
He said, look, if
you're miserable,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.040
everybody in your life who cares
about you worries about you.

00:22:28.717 --> 00:22:30.800
So it's really important
to take care of yourself.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.785
Focus on yourself, not to be
self-absorbed and unaware,

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.160
but actually
there's that balance

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.400
between the better we care for
ourselves, the more available

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.430
we are for other people.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.310
My wife and I have had to
navigate this quite a bit

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.934
over the last eight
years, having kids.

00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:46.002
We've got an eight-year-old
and a five-year-old.

00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:47.710
I'm on the road
traveling, doing my work,

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.220
she's at home with the girls.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.300
And there was a
whole bunch of stuff.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.550
And we've been
together for 14 years

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.040
and have a great relationship,
communicate really openly,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.706
really honestly.

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:57.300
But it was way harder
than we anticipated.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.240
We didn't expect it
to be easy, but we

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.986
had no idea what we were in for.

00:23:01.986 --> 00:23:03.860
And part of it, one of
the biggest challenges

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.320
for both of us,
especially for her,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.110
is finding the
balance between how

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.246
do I go take care of
myself, and at the same time

00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:12.870
show up for my girls
and for my husband

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.310
and for my life and
all those things?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.434
And in fact, one of the
best things that we started

00:23:16.434 --> 00:23:18.089
to do a few years
ago, was we each

00:23:18.089 --> 00:23:20.630
will take time-- as busy as we
are with everything going on--

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.155
to go away by ourselves, not
only for our own mental health

00:23:24.155 --> 00:23:24.780
and well-being.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.410
It makes our marriage better.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.362
It makes us better parents.

00:23:29.362 --> 00:23:31.570
But we didn't learn that
until all of a sudden we got

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.810
so stressed out, so burned out,
so frustrated with each other,

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.000
with parenting, with life,
we just got to a point

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.400
where it was like, uncle.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.300
We don't know what to do.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.590
And that's a big piece
of self-compassion,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.540
actually, is being
able to get to points

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.210
in your life in certain
places and say you know what?

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.640
Even though look, every single
one of you in this room,

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.098
everyone watching this video
or watching us on live stream,

00:23:51.098 --> 00:23:53.117
you've had a certain
amount of success.

00:23:53.117 --> 00:23:54.950
You've achieved certain
things in your life.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.200
You're good at certain things.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.994
That's fantastic.

00:23:56.994 --> 00:23:58.910
But one of the ways you
get to that next level

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.740
isn't necessarily
by driving harder.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.115
It's actually by being able
to put your hands up at times

00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:06.080
and go, I have no idea
how to handle this.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.780
I'm now out of my-- right?

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.977
And that's a good thing.

00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:10.560
When you get out of
your comfort zone,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.970
you get into a place
you're not used to,

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.600
you don't know how to
handle, that's fantastic.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.750
That means you can grow.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.209
But a lot of us, because we're
so worried about looking bad

00:24:17.209 --> 00:24:18.583
and what people
will think, and I

00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.750
don't like to sound like
an idiot or make mistakes,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.969
we don't even let
ourselves go there.

00:24:23.969 --> 00:24:25.635
I love what Brene
Brown talks about when

00:24:25.635 --> 00:24:26.884
she talks about vulnerability.

00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:29.960
It's a big part of
the work that I do.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.610
And vulnerability--
she says look,

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.040
you can't get to courage without
walking through vulnerability.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.790
That means it's going
to be uncomfortable.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.920
So sometimes, even if
someone reacts negatively

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.660
when you say I'm gonna
take some extra time,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.666
I'm going to go do this thing
that really nourishes me,

00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:47.040
it's OK if they
react negatively.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.820
And you might need to negotiate
a little bit with them.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.532
But it's OK.

00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:52.740
And the more we give ourselves
permission to do that,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.823
the easier it gets for us.

00:24:53.823 --> 00:24:56.260
And the more that we literally
train the people around us,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.680
here's what's important
to me, and find out

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.040
what's important to them.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.010
And the challenge is, especially
working in an environment

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.010
like here at Google, and
where most of us work

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:07.470
and how we work these days,
it's all day, 24/7 expectation

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.310
that you're going
to be on, connected,

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.730
communicating, and doing stuff.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.030
And we have to manage
ourselves now more than ever,

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.211
so that we figure out
when we can unplug.

00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:20.260
You know, I heard
someone awhile back

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.940
at a conference-- it was here
in Silicon Valley-- works

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.170
at another company here,
and he was saying look,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.650
this whole idea of
it's a marathon,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.670
not a sprint, he said,
doesn't fit for us.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.787
We're sprinting all the time,
and we're not going to stop.

00:25:31.787 --> 00:25:33.495
He said what we have
to learn how to do--

00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:35.280
and this was a senior leader
in this organization--

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.920
is we have to learn
how to train people

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.920
and teach people and make
the environment conducive so

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.310
that we're taking pauses.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.560
As Rachel knows, working
on a book on that, right?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.530
Pauses in the midst of the
sprinting, if you will.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.580
And that's at work, but
that's also in life.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.510
Because again, we're
all walking around now

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.610
with our whole life, work
and otherwise, in our pocket

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.750
or in our purse.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.220
Literally, it's there.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.420
And if we want to we could
focus on that 24/7 and still not

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.550
get anywhere close to
caught up with everything.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.360
That make sense?

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.790
So other thoughts
or other questions

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.860
or comments about this.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:15.472
Yeah.

00:26:15.472 --> 00:26:16.972
So the idea that I
have so much work

00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:18.690
to do that it's selfish
to sit here for an hour

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.731
and listen to me talk and
have this conversation.

00:26:22.735 --> 00:26:24.860
Well yeah, and then figure
out the balance of that.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.760
Look, we all have stuff to do.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.634
A friend of mine posted
something on Facebook

00:26:27.634 --> 00:26:29.280
that I saw this
morning and it said,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.946
I had all these things
to do yesterday--

00:26:30.946 --> 00:26:33.260
she's similar to me, writes
and has her own business--

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.995
and she said, but
I decided-- and she

00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:39.040
had a picture of her garden--
I decided to do this instead.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.420
The idea being,
whatever it is-- we

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.000
all have jobs and
responsibilities

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.875
and commitments and
people expecting things--

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.060
we've got to manage that
to whatever degree we can.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.404
But now more than ever, I
think it's more important

00:26:50.404 --> 00:26:52.570
that we take some time for
ourselves and figure out,

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:54.760
what do I need to
nourish myself?

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.210
The G-Pause program, which
I don't know the specifics

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.590
about it, but you guys
can talk more about it.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.950
But one of things I
gotta say, and you guys

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.991
know this, any of you
who've worked anywhere else

00:27:01.991 --> 00:27:04.570
outside of Google-- there's
a lot of cool stuff going on

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:05.070
here.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.630
It's not perfect
and utopia, right?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.921
Every place has its challenges.

00:27:07.921 --> 00:27:09.809
But there's such
a commitment here

00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:11.350
in a way that's
pretty extraordinary.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.990
And I have been-- for 14 years
I've been traveling around.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.740
I live here in the Bay Area,
but I travel around the country

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.730
and at times around the world
speaking to and working inside

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.250
of organizations.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.930
There's a genuine commitment
here by a lot of people

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.670
at a pretty high level
to focus on wellness,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.560
to focus on well-being, to focus
on mindfulness and pausing.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.310
And at the same
time, you guys are

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.339
an incredibly driven,
focused organization

00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:35.880
that's very
metric-driven, and you've

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.700
got numbers and quotas
and goals and things

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.616
you got to accomplish.

00:27:38.616 --> 00:27:41.326
So right here, it's the perfect
dichotomy of our culture.

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.700
There's a commitment
to wellness,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.680
there's a commitment to
pausing, to slowing down.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.638
And there's an enormous
commitment and pressure

00:27:46.638 --> 00:27:48.710
to continue to
succeed and achieve

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.090
at the incredibly high level.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.850
But think of that
at a meta level.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.870
What happens here at Google
is just like in our lives.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.490
And then the question
becomes, can we

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.770
listen to those multiple voices
inside of us and be the one,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.754
as my own sort of
personal coach counselor

00:28:02.754 --> 00:28:05.170
likes to say to me, all the
different voices in your head,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.520
you've got to be the
chairman of the board.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.620
You've got to say,
no, no, I'm in charge,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.960
and literally then make
decisions and choices that best

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.060
serve you.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.040
One of the things
about the book--

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.490
I wrote it in
short essay format,

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.757
so there's 40 short essays.

00:28:21.757 --> 00:28:24.340
So it's literally like you can
just kind of open it up or read

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.860
the Table of Contents
and go, that's

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.402
the message that I need
about forgiving myself.

00:28:28.402 --> 00:28:30.360
Or that's one that would
be really great for me

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.380
about vulnerability.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:31.900
Or whatever.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.202
But it actually made it
really fun and easy to write.

00:28:35.202 --> 00:28:37.660
Which one of the things I had
to deal with as I was writing

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.620
this book was it was way
easier than my first two,

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.196
and I realized how committed
to struggling and suffering I

00:28:43.196 --> 00:28:44.610
am at times.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.110
Literally.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.800
Like I was talking to my coach
and she was saying to me, Mike,

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.770
you think that for
something to be valuable

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.870
it has to really be hard.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.707
You have to sweat and
it has to be difficult

00:28:53.707 --> 00:28:54.665
and you have to suffer.

00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:57.421
And she was like, maybe
you could give that up.

00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:59.870
And I was like, but, really?

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.310
And I really had to
look at that, that so

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.640
much of my life, the thing,
the story becomes well,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.110
you know, I don't know
what I was afraid of,

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.810
but people are going
to come in and go,

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.170
your life's been
really easy. no, no.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.120
Let me tell you all the hard
things I've gone through.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.495
Or, that was really
easy for you.

00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:13.310
Like it was somehow
some badge of courage

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.980
to suffer and struggle.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.850
So that's one piece.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.820
But there's-- one of
the chapters I write,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.880
I tell the story in there about
this game that I play with

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.292
my girls.

00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:23.750
And the chapter is
called "Remember

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.840
That You're Valuable
Just Because You're You."

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.000
And here's the
way the game goes,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.340
and I started playing
this game with my girls

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.131
a couple years ago.

00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:31.020
Remember, they're
eight and five.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.170
I think they were probably
like six and three or something

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.420
when I first started to do it.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.180
And we do this all the
time, almost daily.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.620
I'll say to one of my girls-- I
try to do it with each of them

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.450
but individually.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.680
I'll say-- Samantha's eight,
Rosie's five-- I'll say,

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.252
hey Rosie, how much
does Daddy love you?

00:29:46.252 --> 00:29:47.210
And she goes like this.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.644
This much.

00:29:48.644 --> 00:29:51.060
Sometimes she's laying in her
bed, so she goes, this much,

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.121
and it's pretty cute.

00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:53.120
And I say, that's right.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.911
And then I ask a really
important question.

00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:58.180
I say, how come Daddy
loves you so much?

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.040
And you know what she says?

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.780
Because I'm me.

00:30:03.762 --> 00:30:06.857
And I say, that's right,
honey, just because you're you.

00:30:06.857 --> 00:30:07.940
And look, here's the deal.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.050
I do it for them,
absolutely, because I

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.292
want them to get the message for
me, especially as young as they

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:16.500
are, especially as girls,
that I don't just love them

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500
because they're
cute, I don't just

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.920
love them when they kick
a goal in the soccer game,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.980
I don't just love
them when they listen

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.063
or when the teacher says
something nice about them

00:30:24.063 --> 00:30:26.930
in class, all that stuff.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.310
I love them no
matter what, and I

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.630
want them to get that message.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.850
But I say it for
myself for two reasons.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.350
First of all, as a
parent, because I

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.200
gotta remind myself--
even as young as they are

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.783
and as sweet as they
are at this age--

00:30:37.783 --> 00:30:40.470
there are times it's hard for
me when they're doing things

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.560
that I don't like.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.900
It's hard for me not to react
really harshly and really

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.052
negatively.

00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:47.010
And even though part of
my job is to train them

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.150
and to parent them and to have
boundaries and all that stuff,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.149
I don't want them to think
that it's conditional

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.361
based on their behavior.

00:30:53.361 --> 00:30:55.110
And I'm going to have
to probably continue

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.550
to remind myself as
they get older, right?

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.680
But the second reason that I
do it is very personal for me,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.000
because I still need that
message all the time,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.023
that I'm not just valuable
because I wrote a book

00:31:10.023 --> 00:31:12.210
or because I'm speaking
here at Google,

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.940
or whatever the accomplishments,
achievements of my life may be.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.773
And the achievements
and the accomplishments

00:31:16.773 --> 00:31:19.100
in my life, they're
important to me, absolutely.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.990
But it's really important for
me to continue to remind myself

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.420
that that's not who I am.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.006
And it's hard.

00:31:26.006 --> 00:31:28.630
Any one of you in this room, any
one of you watching this video

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.189
or watching is on
live stream-- when

00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:32.730
you've achieved and accomplished
certain things in your life,

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.190
or you're in an
environment that's really

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.040
focused on achievement
or a culture that's

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.790
focused on achievement like we
are-- it's hard not to assume

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.290
that my happiness
and my fulfillment

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.099
lies in some achievement
that I've yet to achieve yet.

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:46.140
It's out there somewhere.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.390
I'll get there and then I'll--
but we've all learned the hard

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.050
way, it doesn't work that way.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.080
It doesn't matter how
great the achievement is.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.420
And sometimes the hardest part
about achieving something great

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.000
is that hollow
feeling we have after,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.920
when we realize
oh, you know what?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.250
That actually didn't
fill the hole in me

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.384
that I thought it was going to.

00:32:04.384 --> 00:32:07.050
And instead of really looking at
that and going deeper into that

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.910
and saying, how do I
make peace with myself,

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.970
we erroneously then think, oh
no, it's another achievement.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.470
And that one wasn't good enough,
that one wasn't big enough,

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.850
it'll be the next one and the
next one and the next one.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.230
And if we keep on that path
it literally never ends.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.880
And for better or
worse-- and you guys

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.390
have been creating some
of this technology--

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.431
we're sharing all kinds
of things with each other

00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.080
all the time.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.110
So now we get to deal with
the cesspool of comparison.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.424
It happens all day,
every day, as we

00:32:36.424 --> 00:32:38.340
check what other people
are doing and bragging

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.640
about on social
media and otherwise,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.640
which then can bring us
right back down to like,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.670
well, I'm not good enough.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.630
And it's a trap.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.510
Make sense?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.985
So before we go
on-- I want to see

00:32:50.985 --> 00:32:53.110
if you have questions or
thoughts about this-- turn

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.680
back to your partner.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.030
Some of you have come in
since we paired up before.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.650
Pair up with someone.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.260
And again, if you're
watching the live stream,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.750
you can write down if you're
not with another person

00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.400
or watching the video.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.941
But just, how does all of this
what I'm talking about so far,

00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:03.805
how does this relate
to you specifically?

00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:05.930
Where are there pieces of
this where it's like, oh,

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.170
I can see that in my life?

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.100
I'll give you a
minute just to talk

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.390
with each other about that.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.765
And then I'll see if there's
some questions I can answer.

00:33:11.765 --> 00:33:17.471
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.520
MIKE ROBBINS: Thoughts?

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.220
Anything anybody
wants to ask or share

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.150
about what we're
talking about here?

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.569
Yeah.

00:33:36.569 --> 00:33:38.110
So the mechanisms
for sort of dealing

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:42.750
with the guilt when I
take time for myself.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.770
That's a good question.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.250
I think-- I'm a talker by
nature, it's what I do, right?

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.790
So I think communicating
and talking

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.220
is a really important thing.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.587
So acknowledging it
if I'm feeling guilty.

00:33:52.587 --> 00:33:54.670
And usually the places
where I tend to feel guilty

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:58.637
are with my wife and my girls,
because again, I'm on the road

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:00.220
and that poses a
challenge in my life.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.750
I'm away from my family more
than I'd ultimately like to be.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.470
And then when on
top of it I say,

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.250
hey babe, I really need to go
up Calistoga for a couple days,

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.350
Napa, whatever.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.221
Sometimes some guilt and-- but
then we'll talk about that,

00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:13.679
and I'll say, I
feel really guilty.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.260
And then we'll communicate,
and sometimes it's

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.843
a negotiation a bit
about what's going

00:34:16.843 --> 00:34:19.150
to work, what's not going to
work, where the impact is.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.760
The other place where
I tend to feel guilty,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.468
because relationships
and connections are

00:34:22.468 --> 00:34:24.580
so important to me-- but
as my life has gotten

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.360
bigger and busier and I'm doing
more things both professionally

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.530
and then with my
family, I don't get

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.980
to connect with and see a
lot of my friends and people

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.080
I care about a lot.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.219
So that poses a challenge.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.927
But again, to me it's
about communicating

00:34:36.927 --> 00:34:40.194
that, not like an excuse,
but just being real about it.

00:34:40.194 --> 00:34:42.110
Instead of pretending,
because for a long time

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.960
I would do the thing
like, hey, yeah, great,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.320
we should get
together, all right?

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.030
You know, all that BS
stuff that but we do.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.370
Because really what I
was feeling is like,

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.330
gosh, I don't know
how to manage my life

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.745
and all my relationships
and connections.

00:34:52.745 --> 00:34:54.870
And now, look, again, with
all the great technology

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.820
and all the way we're
now more interconnected,

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.070
there's just more people in
my sphere than used to be,

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.250
and I'm sure that's
true for most of us.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.590
And then the question becomes
the level of authenticity

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.490
and the real connection
of those relationships.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.580
So it's a challenge
to some degree,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.500
but I also think the more
real we are about it,

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.310
people can understand.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.450
And even again, talking
from that perspective

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.010
of-- sometimes
when I'm concerned,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.180
if I'm going to do
something that might seem

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.920
selfish or self-absorbed or I'm
worried someone might judge me,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.960
I will often just bring that up.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.890
But not like a
critique, but more just

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.700
like from that
vulnerable place of like,

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.274
here's what I really want
to do, but I'm afraid

00:35:30.274 --> 00:35:31.940
if I do that, you're
going to think this

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.690
or it's going to be a
problem or whatever.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.600
So then we talk about it.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.940
Does that make sense?

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.691
And you know, I had
another mentor of mine

00:35:38.691 --> 00:35:40.648
say this great thing to
me a couple years back.

00:35:40.648 --> 00:35:42.880
He said, you know, Mike,
what stands between you

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.546
and the kind of
relationships you really

00:35:44.546 --> 00:35:45.770
want to have with people?

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:46.770
And I said, what's that?

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.686
And he said, probably a
ten-minute sweaty palm

00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:50.831
conversation you're
too afraid to have.

00:35:50.831 --> 00:35:53.330
He said, you get really good
at those ten-minute sweaty palm

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.710
conversations, you'll have
fantastic relationships.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.440
He said, but if you avoid
them like most people do,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.615
things will be tricky.

00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:01.990
And you hope you roll the dice
and get really cool people

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.448
to work with and
really cool people

00:36:03.448 --> 00:36:06.160
in your family, whatever, but
that's not usually the way

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.010
it works out naturally.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.514
So that make sense?

00:36:10.514 --> 00:36:11.180
Other questions.

00:36:13.886 --> 00:36:15.360
AUDIENCE: So
building off of that,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.810
can you talk about
some tips for when

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.070
wanting to be a
certain way and do

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.500
these things is in
conflict with the culture,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.420
specifically to work.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:24.960
MIKE ROBBINS: The environment.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.085
Yeah.

00:36:25.085 --> 00:36:27.370
AUDIENCE: So, for example,
if your environment is

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.680
we value putting
in a lot of hours,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.430
and you know I am at my best
when I take care of my health

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.140
and when I'm sleeping right
and doing all those things.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.275
And having those
conversations may

00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:39.525
be tough to shift the culture.

00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:40.660
Can you talk about that?

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.180
MIKE ROBBINS: Yeah.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.920
I think, look, I think
it's a real challenge.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.711
And guys here at Google
and a lot of people

00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:46.994
working in intense environments
can relate to this.

00:36:46.994 --> 00:36:49.160
Even people like myself who
have our own businesses,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.690
it's not that
someone outside of me

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.750
is demanding that, it's
literally like, taking time off

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.250
at times means business
might not happen, right?

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.630
And so it doesn't
matter where we are,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.180
but if the environment
doesn't seem

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.096
like it's conducive for
that, or we celebrate,

00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:05.850
hey, you know, John was
working all weekend, great!

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:07.030
And it's like, OK.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.270
Or the expectation
is, stay late,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.220
get here early, all that stuff.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.650
One thing is
communicating, just again

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.870
from that authentic place,
not like how it should be,

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.870
because that's a judgment,
but how it is for me.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.740
Here's what I know
I really need.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.450
And then figuring out if what
I need and what works for me

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:23.950
is going to work
in the environment.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.136
And sometimes the hard
reality is, it's not.

00:37:27.136 --> 00:37:29.200
It doesn't mean you're
bad or they're bad.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.890
It just means, wow,
I'm either going

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.307
to have to inauthentically
abide by these norms-- and look,

00:37:36.307 --> 00:37:37.640
we do this all the time in life.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.250
So this doesn't make us
a terrible, weak person,

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.120
like, I'm gonna do that.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.970
But be real about it with
ourselves first, and even

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.650
with other people.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.066
But a lot of times there's
more wiggle room in negotiation

00:37:45.066 --> 00:37:46.479
than we think.

00:37:46.479 --> 00:37:48.270
One of my favorite
sayings is, the answer's

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.580
always no if you don't ask.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.540
So we make assumptions
about stuff

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.710
that may or may not be true.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.793
So that's the first thing.

00:37:54.793 --> 00:37:56.570
The second thing
is-- I think it's

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.850
really important-- boundaries.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.280
Having clear and clean
boundaries does not

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.960
mean that we're
righteous about them

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.050
or they're etched in stone.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.961
But not having boundaries
creates problems down the road

00:38:07.961 --> 00:38:09.460
because people take
advantage of us,

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.084
people do things that don't work
for us, we don't say anything,

00:38:12.084 --> 00:38:14.380
and then we finally
do, we get pissed.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.340
And then it's a problem
for them and for us.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.020
And all of a sudden, whoa.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.540
Think about conflicts that have
arisen at work about something

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.030
that you knew it was an
issue for a long time,

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.230
you just didn't say anything.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.410
And then you finally
said something

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.500
and it has all this anger
and animosity behind it

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.708
because you've been holding
onto it for three months.

00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:28.640
You know what I mean?

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.059
So it can be tricky.

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:31.850
And at the end of the
day, you have a boss,

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:32.600
you have an employer.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.980
There are rules,
there are norms,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.610
there are things that
we got to abide by.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.193
If we're going to play that game
we gotta play by those rules.

00:38:38.193 --> 00:38:39.410
I played baseball, right?

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.827
Even if I really felt like it,
you can't run to third base

00:38:41.827 --> 00:38:43.326
first, you have to
run to first base

00:38:43.326 --> 00:38:45.220
first because that's
the rules of that game.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.350
And I could argue
all I want, but it's

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.760
more comfortable for me to
go that way than this way,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.720
and they'd say, sorry,
Mike, you're out.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.810
You don't get to play.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.710
So there is some
balance of that.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.080
And then the other thing is,
I think now more than ever,

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.252
there's a lot of things
happening in our culture

00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:59.210
where we're finding--
there's a lot of research

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:01.970
out there-- Arianna Huffington
just wrote a great book called

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.594
"Thrive" that some of you may be
familiar with, where she talks

00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:06.870
specifically about the
importance of sleep-- it's

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.030
probably the main
crux of that book,

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.640
sleep, take care
yourself, meditate,

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.130
take care of your inner life.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.074
And she tells the story of
collapsing in her office

00:39:16.074 --> 00:39:18.490
and literally hitting her head
on the desk on the way down

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.740
as she was launching
the Huffington Post.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.949
And she ends up on the
floor in a pool of blood.

00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:24.990
And she says-- and I've
seen her speak about this

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.800
and maybe some of
you have as well--

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.758
she goes, look, by every
conventional measure I

00:39:27.758 --> 00:39:29.340
was successful.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.070
But by any sane
definition of success,

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.750
when you're laying on your
office on a pool of blood,

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.420
you're not successful with the
way you're living your life,

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.040
right?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.890
So the idea is that
this actually is going

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.490
to create--and some of you,
especially here at Google,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.281
you're young enough,
you're healthy enough,

00:39:41.281 --> 00:39:44.200
you can get by doing it,
but the reality is it's not

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.380
sustainable.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.990
And I think again
organizationally,

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.150
people understand
that here at Google,

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.060
and even your own
manager or your own team,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.310
start to make some agreements.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.190
How do we get the work done,
and how do we do it in a way

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.890
that people aren't
fried in the process?

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.450
Because everyone's
dealing with that.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.658
And at the very least start
to have the conversation,

00:40:00.658 --> 00:40:02.380
to be open to are
there different ways

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.730
we could work and communicate?

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.820
Are there different ways
we could keep hours?

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.532
I don't know.

00:40:06.532 --> 00:40:08.240
And depending on your
role and your team,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.990
and sometimes there's
deadlines or there's

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.140
products or things-focused,
it's going to ebb and flow.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.040
But I think there's
a lot more discussion

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.415
we can have about
it, and there's

00:40:16.415 --> 00:40:19.300
a lot of science and research
backing up the importance of it

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.990
on our physical well-being and
then on our productivity level.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.725
Arianna just did an
interview with Oprah

00:40:24.725 --> 00:40:27.099
on "Super Soul Sunday", and
they were both talking about,

00:40:27.099 --> 00:40:30.635
as two very, very successful
people, two things that came up

00:40:30.635 --> 00:40:32.510
in that interview I
thought were interesting.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.840
They were talking about
burnout, and Oprah

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.007
was saying, if you work one
of those crazy, long, 14-hour

00:40:38.007 --> 00:40:39.590
days, you know those
last couple hours

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.715
you're not very productive.

00:40:40.715 --> 00:40:43.040
It's just impossible.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.457
But the other
thing-- Arianna said

00:40:44.457 --> 00:40:46.123
one of the questions
she gets, and Oprah

00:40:46.123 --> 00:40:47.580
mentioned someone
said this to her

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.371
when she knew she was
going to have Arianna

00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:52.407
on-- oh, yeah, easy for you
guys to say sleep eight hours

00:40:52.407 --> 00:40:53.490
and take care of yourself.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.490
Now you're Oprah Winfrey
and Arianna Huffington.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.894
Like, how did you get there?

00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:59.060
But they both said that
actually some of the biggest

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.800
regrets they had in their
lives and their careers were

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.790
the times they worked
too much, and they

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.070
had things out of
balance and out of-- it

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.540
wasn't ultimately sustainable
and didn't lead them

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.812
to where they got to.

00:41:10.812 --> 00:41:12.270
Now most of us
aren't at that level

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.220
and probably won't
get to that level.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.240
But all of us have busy
lives and lots to manage.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.760
And so in terms of
how you influence

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.570
the environment around
you, you communicate,

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.534
you model it, and see
if you can engage.

00:41:23.534 --> 00:41:24.200
That make sense?

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.670
AUDIENCE: Maybe you can to talk
a little bit about-- so you

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.253
said that I think
in our culture we're

00:41:28.253 --> 00:41:30.420
very used to this idea that,
like, no pain, no gain.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.340
So unless it's you know,
things of great worth

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.402
take great effort,
unless it's painful,

00:41:35.402 --> 00:41:36.860
we don't actually
get what we want.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.193
And you said that with your
third book, that you kind of

00:41:39.193 --> 00:41:41.340
had this revelation of
like, wow, this is easy.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.590
Tell us a little bit about
how you worked through that

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.970
and how that could be
applicable for people like us.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.030
MIKE ROBBINS: So how
it could be easy.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.040
Yeah, I mean I first had
to confront the fact that I

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.870
was really attached to
suffering and struggling.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.530
And that had been
for most of my life.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.630
And look, it's not like
I have this figured out.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.790
I mean in the process of
this, that part of my-- look,

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.710
I mean one of the
things as an athlete--

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.699
you know, we all have a
story about ourselves.

00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:03.740
Some parts of it are really
heroic and wonderful,

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.889
some parts aren't so much.

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:07.180
We constantly need to revisit
that story and realize A,

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.014
it's not true.

00:42:08.014 --> 00:42:10.180
We keep making it up and
the more we tell the story,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.570
the more real it becomes.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.270
But part of my story has
been, I'm a scrapper.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.920
I'm kind of a scrappy guy.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.624
Like I'm barely six feet tall.

00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:18.790
I was a left-handed pitcher.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.248
So this started in
baseball for me.

00:42:20.248 --> 00:42:22.020
I wasn't the most
physically talented guy,

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.670
but there were very
few guys I ever

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.530
played with who worked
harder than I did.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.140
And I got a lot of
positive feedback.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.540
Look at Robbins, he's
always going the extra mile.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.670
Look at Robbins, he's staying
after practice, way to go.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.794
And for me it was like,
OK, that's one of the ways.

00:42:32.794 --> 00:42:34.460
I wasn't blessed to
be six foot five.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.160
I couldn't throw
95 miles an hour.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.380
And as I started to
get better in baseball,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.880
I realized that hard work--or
this is what I made up and was

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.296
told-- Robbins, you're going
to have to just keep grinding

00:42:43.296 --> 00:42:44.280
hard.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.990
OK.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.770
I could do that.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:46.680
Because I could control that.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.013
My effort level I could control.

00:42:48.013 --> 00:42:50.510
I couldn't always
control my talent level.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.312
I got what I got.

00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:52.770
And I couldn't
control the outcome.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.290
In baseball-- even if you
don't follow baseball,

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.665
one of the things
about baseball,

00:42:55.665 --> 00:42:58.280
it is filled with an
enormous amount of failure.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.600
It is a game-- the best
hitters in baseball

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.254
get out seven out of 10 times.

00:43:04.254 --> 00:43:05.170
It's a lot of failure.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:06.102
I was a pitcher.

00:43:06.102 --> 00:43:07.560
And pitching, and
some of you heard

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.352
me tell-- pitching is
awful in lot of ways.

00:43:09.352 --> 00:43:11.518
Because you know what happens
to a pitcher in a game

00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:13.600
when the pitcher
doesn't do well?

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.672
They literally stop the
game and take you out.

00:43:17.672 --> 00:43:19.880
Can you imagine if you're
having a rough day at work,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.584
you mess something up, and
literally your manager bursts

00:43:22.584 --> 00:43:24.750
in the door or pops up on
your screen and says, you.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.350
Leave.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.740
And you have to walk out
and some other person

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.030
starts doing your work for you.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.920
It's pretty humiliating.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.700
So a lot of failure in baseball.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.140
But I worked really
hard, worked really hard,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.480
worked really hard.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.330
When I got into my business--
I start my business

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.950
at 26 years old.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.530
Now back in 2000-2001 when I
started my business as a coach

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.460
and wanting to be
an author, it was

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.140
starting to be a
bigger industry.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.919
But there was no social media,
there was no blog world.

00:43:52.919 --> 00:43:54.460
The only ways people
went about doing

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.400
that was you had to
go through pretty

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.450
conventional, traditional
ways to do it.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.880
Hope to write a book, get some
notoriety, get on some TV show

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.522
or whatever.

00:44:05.522 --> 00:44:07.480
And it was like, I'm
going to work really hard,

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.610
I'm going to hustle.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.900
So all of that to say,
that's kind of in my DNA.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.200
And there are some
positive sides to that.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.050
It's not like I want
to throw that all out.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.120
But I think the process
for me has been looking at,

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.770
who the people
that I know-- this

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:20.130
is a big thing, modeling
other people-- who

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.810
are the people that I know that
look like they're able to make

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.250
things happen with a
minimal amount of effort.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.420
Because people like that, it's
like there's pixie dust on them

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.490
somehow and everything
they touch turns to gold?

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.460
That is actually a
conscious, deliberate thing,

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.016
whether they're fully aware
of what they're doing or not.

00:44:36.016 --> 00:44:37.390
And I started to
realize, I think

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.820
I want a little more of that.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.490
And I'll share this with you,
just because in the context--

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.406
I didn't write a book.

00:44:43.406 --> 00:44:45.327
I wrote my first book
'07, my second book '09.

00:44:45.327 --> 00:44:47.660
"Focus on the Good Stuff"
came out in '07, "Be Yourself"

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.710
came out on '09.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.730
And we had two babies
and I wrote two books

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.830
in the span of three years.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.270
I didn't sleep much,
I wasn't very healthy,

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.622
I wasn't very happy.

00:44:56.622 --> 00:44:59.080
The end of 2009-- and I write
a lot about this in the book.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.452
Michelle and I both.

00:45:00.452 --> 00:45:02.660
I literally looked at her
one day and said, hey babe,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.250
I got an idea.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.220
How about we stop focusing
so much of our attention

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.360
on trying to look
happy and successful

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.206
and actually be
happy and successful?

00:45:11.206 --> 00:45:12.580
Because I bet if
we actually are,

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.966
we'll probably look like it too.

00:45:14.966 --> 00:45:16.340
Because here we
were in this life

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.463
that we thought we wanted,
with kids and I was doing work,

00:45:18.463 --> 00:45:19.320
it was all great.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.230
But underneath we
were stressed out.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.150
We were tired.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.650
We were in debt.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.480
Things weren't how
we wanted them to be.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.240
So when I started to think
about writing the next book,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.900
I didn't even know what it was
going to be about, but I said,

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.960
I don't know what it's
going to be about,

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.251
but it's going to be a much
more pleasurable experience

00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:36.070
to write.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:37.570
And it took me many
years to finally

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.821
get ready to be in a place
where I could do that.

00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:41.070
Lots of ups and downs in life.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.528
But things started
to go well and I

00:45:42.528 --> 00:45:44.860
started to feel like,
OK, I can do this.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.526
When I finally sat down to
write this book last summer--

00:45:48.526 --> 00:45:50.880
I have a tendency sometimes
to procrastinate on things.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.490
And of you ever do that?

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.220
Big deadline.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.610
But I finally committed,
I'm going to do this.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.285
I wrote the book in seven weeks.

00:45:59.285 --> 00:46:03.170
Now I kind of had to
because it was due, right?

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.780
But it was actually 17
days of writing, that's it.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.552
I use Dragon speech
recognition software

00:46:08.552 --> 00:46:10.760
because I'm such more of a
talker than I am a writer.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.385
But you know what,
for the longest time

00:46:12.385 --> 00:46:13.570
I thought that was cheating.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.445
Can't really talk a
book, you gotta write it.

00:46:15.445 --> 00:46:16.730
It's got to be hard, right?

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.313
And I share that
with you because what

00:46:18.313 --> 00:46:22.950
happened for me is I started to
realize, it's OK if it's easy.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.257
I don't have to
apologize for that.

00:46:25.257 --> 00:46:27.590
So for a lot of us-- look,
nothing wrong with hard work.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.060
I'm not saying
that's a bad thing.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.240
But this idea that we have
to suffer and struggle

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.980
and things have to be
hard-- I'm now to the point

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.420
where my new practice in
life is, if it's too hard,

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.300
I'm actually going
to rethink about

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.554
do I really want to do it.

00:46:40.554 --> 00:46:42.220
Or as a friend of
mine used to say to me

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.080
all the time, just because you
can doesn't mean you should.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.580
Yeah.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.600
AUDIENCE: We all have
had successes in life.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.350
But some of my best
successes felt really easy,

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.090
and when people would actually
congratulate me, I would like,

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:02.830
just-- I wouldn't accept--
internally I wouldn't accept it

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.664
and I'd be like,
oh, that was easy.

00:47:05.664 --> 00:47:07.080
So how do we get
over, how do we--

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.730
MIKE ROBBINS: I think
we take a lot of things

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.630
for granted about ourselves,
some of our strengths, some

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.780
of our gifts and things
that do come easy.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.730
And I would really challenge
all of us not to do that,

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.940
to really be grateful for
the things that come easy.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.648
And then ask ourselves
a deeper question,

00:47:19.648 --> 00:47:22.510
less about the outcome and
more about the experience.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.300
Is this what I want?

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.450
And if it does come
easy, be grateful

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.490
and feel blessed that it does.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.450
Say thank you to
whatever you believe in.

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.130
Thank you.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.340
This is easy for me.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.090
And be mindful of the fact that
it's not easy for everybody.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.423
So without bragging about it
or being arrogant about it,

00:47:36.423 --> 00:47:37.840
it's like, wow.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.780
Something for me.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.470
I speak.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:40.990
I've worked at this.

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:43.550
But this actually is
really easy for me.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.940
And it's taken me awhile--
wow, wow, you're good at that.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.440
I've done it a lot,
that makes it easier.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.380
But I was born with a certain
gift, that this is what I do.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.720
This is how I express myself.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.361
So that's OK.

00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:57.360
Then we focus on the
things that don't, and then

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.901
we spend a lot of
time thinking, I've

00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:00.530
got to improve those things.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:01.680
So it's big one.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.096
Now let me say
this, because we've

00:48:03.096 --> 00:48:04.720
got to wrap this
up, just time-wise.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.290
I'll stick around for
those of you who are here

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.250
if you've got questions,
you want to chat with me.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.010
Happy to talk to you.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.800
Those of you on the video
or on the live stream,

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.802
we can stay in touch
just through my website,

00:48:12.802 --> 00:48:13.510
mike-robbins.com.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.167
But I want to close
with one last story just

00:48:16.167 --> 00:48:17.750
to kind of bring
this all full circle,

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:20.395
because one of the key
things for us in all of this

00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:22.530
is perspective.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.945
I wrote this book primarily
about perspective,

00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:27.070
perspective in my own life.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.736
And one of the things-- and many
of you sitting here in the room

00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:32.072
have the book itself-- but
I write a bit in the book

00:48:32.072 --> 00:48:33.530
about an experience
that was really

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.900
poignant in my life over
these last few years,

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.160
and that's the death of my mom.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.570
So my mom died in 2011.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.640
And what was interesting
about that experience--

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.060
and any of you who've
lost people close

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.476
have probably had
this experience.

00:48:45.476 --> 00:48:47.820
Really painful,
really difficult,

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.130
but incredibly growth-inducing,
and actually quite beautiful,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:54.440
even in the midst of
the pain and sadness.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.420
And one of the most poignant
moments for me-- my mom got

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.120
diagnosed with lung cancer in
March and she died in June,

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.370
so it happened pretty quickly.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.380
And in some ways that
was actually a blessing.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.770
But she knew it was
going to happen,

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.894
and she really surrendered.

00:49:07.894 --> 00:49:08.780
And my mom was tough.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.114
My mom was like, single
mom, raised two kids,

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:12.030
we grew up in Oakland.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.446
You couldn't mess with my mom,
she was that kind of woman.

00:49:14.446 --> 00:49:16.930
But towards the end she
really started to surrender

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:17.840
and she really
started to open up.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.332
And we had beautiful
conversations,

00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:20.790
and there was
amazing healings that

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.970
happened in our
relationship and our family.

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:25.860
It was just-- now none of
us wanted it to happen,

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.860
so it was really sad and
painful on many levels.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.485
But it was such a
beautiful experience.

00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:32.830
And there was a morning I got
up--it was probably about,

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.510
I don't know, a
month and a half,

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.674
two months before she died-- but
we knew, OK, this is serious,

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:38.840
we know where this is going.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.970
There wasn't thought of--
it happened even quicker

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:41.636
than we thought.

00:49:41.636 --> 00:49:43.370
So I'm on this run.

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.920
I had spent the night at my
childhood home in Oakland.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.960
A lot of emotion.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.750
I get up that morning,
I go for a run.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.834
And I'm thinking in
my mind about my mom

00:49:50.834 --> 00:49:52.750
and the whole situation
and I think to myself,

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.840
I wonder what it's like
for my mother right now,

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.257
knowing that she's going to die?

00:49:57.257 --> 00:49:58.340
What would that feel like?

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.270
What would that be like?

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.810
And as I'm having that thought
I literally stopped running

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:06.220
and I went, wait a minute.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.560
I know I'm going to die.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.660
I just don't know when.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.526
But I don't live like that.

00:50:13.526 --> 00:50:14.900
I live with this
erroneous notion

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.440
of certainty, like I know
what's going to happen,

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.960
like I know my girls
are going to grow up,

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.330
and my wife, and this,
and I'm going to do this,

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.610
and I have all these
plans and these goals.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.609
And those things are all
really important to me.

00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:25.400
But I stopped and
went, wait a second.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.960
What if I started to live
my life in a healthy way,

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.820
in an empowering way, from
that perspective of knowing

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.350
I'm not going to
be here forever.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.570
None of us are going
to be here forever.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:35.880
Everybody we're
in a relationship

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.796
with, everything we're
doing, everything here,

00:50:37.796 --> 00:50:41.410
as extraordinary as this place
is, Google, it's temporary.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.480
It's not permanent.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.389
And if we can remember that,
and hold life-- hold our goals

00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:47.930
and our dreams and
our relationships,

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.270
and even the things that
are most important to us--

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:53.070
with an open hand, with
a sense of intention

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.935
but not grasping so hard to
it, that all of a sudden,

00:50:55.935 --> 00:50:58.560
a lot of the stuff that we worry
about and that we stress about

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.310
and that we get
upset about, it just

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.670
doesn't matter in
the face of that.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.360
And that's one of
the many blessings

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.400
that I got from that
very painful experience.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.330
And if we start to live our
lives from that perspective,

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:11.860
and look around
and realize we're

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.530
the common denominator in
every relationship we have

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.380
and everything we do.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.880
And when we can
shift internally,

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.020
be more kind and compassionate
and loving towards ourselves,

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.250
keep things in perspective,
then everyone and everything

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:28.780
we interact with
literally changes.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.000
Thanks for coming.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.650
[APPLAUSE]
