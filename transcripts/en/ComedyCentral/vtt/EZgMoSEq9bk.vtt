00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.569
(folk music)

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.745
- One time, I did a pull
up on some scaffolding

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.147
in the city, so I'm pretty fit.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wanna see me
one-bite this calzone?

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.084
I too am pretty fit.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:21.654 align:start position:0%
- I read all of the Karma
Sutra and didn't jerk off once.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.224 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I read all of the
Sauna of Ice and Fire,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.459
and I can't say the same.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.161
- Watergate was an inside job.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
- A lot of people
think Christ was black,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.564
and I'm cool with it.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We have season four of
Entourage back at the house.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.835
- And an old molly pill our
friend Kenny Wu gave us.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:37.404
- We'll split it four ways.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.239
- This is fun, but we
have to go tanning.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.340 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You guys just
came from tanning.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.608
- You don't get us.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.575
(phone rings)

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.343
- Oh wait, we'll be right back.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:44.344
- Just wait.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.981
- Wing Shop.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.815
- Hey.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.050
- Uncle Sal, uh.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.518
- Why are you cheese
dicks at the Wing Shop?

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.487 align:start position:0%
I'm getting calls from customers
saying that you're closed.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.457
- Uh, yeah we're
here, it's fine.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.591
Everything's fine here.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.126
Um, the people are calling,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.261 align:start size:88% position:13%
we don't know why
they're calling,
because we are here, so.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.762
- Oh, come on guys.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.964
The Long Island above-ground
pool volleyball tournament

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.534 align:start size:88% position:13%
is next week, and
Wings is sponsoring it.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.503
This will finally put us
on the Long Island map!

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.606 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh yeah, the
volleyball tournament.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:17.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
We were just about to
start training for that.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.812
- Well, you better!

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.282
I got some serious cheddar
riding on your pale asses!

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.253
- Ladies, we'd love to
stay here and try to get

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:30.957 align:start size:97% position:3%
handjobs from each of you,
but we gotta get back to work.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.592
- You could come check
us out in the Long Island

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.561 align:start size:97% position:3%
above-ground pool volleyball
tournament this weekend.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.728
It's at our mom's house.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.298
[Both] - Ooh, we like jocks.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.133
#

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.170 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Do you blend raw eggs or raw
chicken to make you strong?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.638
- Uh, let's try both.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.475
- Aw, a circle of life shake.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.943
(blender whirring)

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:50.777
- Yeah.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.249
- Ugh!

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.952
- Dude, it's time you start
converting this to muscle,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.987
and I've got just the thing.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I got this from a disgraced
Russian javelin thrower

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.258
that I met online.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.993
- Aren't you concerned
at all about drug testing

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.461
or anything?

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.563
- No dude, as long as we use
low doses, we're gonna be fine.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.799
(shouting)

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.003
(techno music plays)

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.419
(hip-hop music plays)

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.892
- Sign right there, yeah.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:39.926
- Here you go.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.161
- Thank you, my dear.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.562
Oh, don't forget
your Wings coupon.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:43.763
- Thank you!

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Complimentary
foot rub with that!

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.467
Go ahead, girl.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.036
(growling)

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.672 align:start size:94% position:6%
Hey, boys, so now you
come late for a tournament

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.474
in your own backyard?

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.642
- We got next.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.681
- You better not be
peeing in those cups.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.187
What do I need with your pee?

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.289
- For the drug test.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.791
- Guys, there is no drug test.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.863
And this doesn't
even look like pee.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.499 align:start size:97% position:3%
Jesus Christ, guys, what are
you doing to your bodies?

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.333
- Training.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.167
- Eating.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.939
- You want next, you got next.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.074
The Lombardo brothers.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.877
- Hey, gonna be a
good game right?

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.312
- Let's have some fun.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.648
(growling and shouting)

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.322
- We gotta impress these chicks.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.693
(shouting)

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.197
(rock music playing)

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're here to have fun,
right guys, that what we're--

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.306
(shouting and splashing)

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We got to keep a lot of
the registration fees, 'cause

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.360
everyone ran in fear.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.461
- So, we won.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.198
- I feel like human garbage.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.667
- I had two distinct heart
attacks during that rampage.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I've been ejaculating
water for an hour.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.505
- Man, there better not
be any wings in the pool.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.073
- Danny, Mark.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.709
[Both] - You guys looked
pretty wild out there.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.411
- Wanna go to your bedrooms?

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.749 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think you mean
bedroom, that we share.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.318 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Or we could just give
you guys handjobs out here.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.552
Whichever you prefer.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.521
- Uh-Oh, I best be
getting out of here,

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.156
give you guys some privacy.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:50.990
- See ya.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.725
- Thanks, uncle Sal.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.527
- I think we're gonna go with--

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.429
[Both] - Handjobs.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.365
(video game music)

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.069
