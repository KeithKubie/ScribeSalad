Today on Smarter Every Day you're gonna
learn about big rockets and big cameras.

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.387
Is it going now? Woah!

00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:09.244
[Rushing air]

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.394
Woohoo! Yeah! Oh!

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:24.048
Hey it's me, Destin. I'm at the U.S. Space
&amp; Rocket Center with my new friend Darren,

00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:25.811
Who's got a great big camera.

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:28.743
So I contacted him when I found
out he was doing a road trip,

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:32.542
and I knew a great big camera's
needed to film great big things

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.957
and one of the coolest things in
America is the Saturn V rocket.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:37.025
So Darren agreed.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.105
[Music]

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.659
(Darren) I had to do a lot of research
before I could even build this camera.

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.889
There are certain things that
you have to know ahead of time,

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:51.235
because you don't want to get to a point
where you've invested time and money

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.570
and then suddenly you realize
that you've miscalculated,

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:57.226
you know, the image circle for your lens

00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:01.160
and suddenly, you're not covering
the entire piece of film.

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:05.737
So I had to do research on lenses -

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.178
If they were big enough;
which ones were big enough.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.765
I like detail,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.540
and I'm getting more detail than I think
you can get with any digital camera, so...

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.577
You know, when you got a piece of
film that's 504 square inches,

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.573
you get a lot of information
from those photos.

00:01:25.193 --> 00:01:28.203
Okay, we're gonna shoot f/90 this time.
(Destin) f/90?

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.663
- Yeah. So I'm going to meter one
more time, just to double-check.

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:34.697
And I have 90 2/3 in 8 seconds.

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:40.495
It's roughly... The numbers - the green
numbers - are what I'm looking at.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.284
So 64 is here, but then
we're going two more stops.

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.343
You can see how... It's
64 and it keeps going.

00:01:46.368 --> 00:01:49.733
So that's 128. That's 90.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.542
Yeah, it was just a lot of calculations.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.694
Knowing how much chemistry
to use to develop a sheet...

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.957
a film that large.

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:03.084
Um... and then also being
able to calculate how much

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.783
extra coverage I would have
that would give me the...

00:02:07.808 --> 00:02:09.867
the movements that I
would use on the camera

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:13.004
I had never had to really think about

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.263
you know, things like image
circle and bellows draw.

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:19.948
So there was a little bit of math
that hadn't been used in a while.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.563
I wanted to make every shot count,

00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:25.916
and now that I've got a 70 pound camera,

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:28.186
It's more pressure, I suppose.

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.533
But it's also more rewards,
bigger rewards, so...

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:35.093
The challenges are always part of the fun.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:47.773
