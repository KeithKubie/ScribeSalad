00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:05.820
INTERVIEWER: In a
lot of ways, this

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.690
just looks like graffiti on
a wall, the type of thing

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.260
you'd see anywhere.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.750
But with that
ghostly white writing

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.780
and the floating,
faceless hoods,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.770
there is also something
haunting about it.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.799
The picture was
taken by this woman.

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:23.715
CECILIA BRODER: Hi, my
name is Cecilia Broder,

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:25.510
and I'm from
Littleton, Colorado.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.440
INTERVIEWER: Cecilia took this
photo in Bariloche, Argentina,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.300
while traveling
around the country.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.450
CECILIA BRODER: I was
wandering around Bariloche,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.274
and came to the central square,
and noticed these painted

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.170
throughout.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.730
I took a few pictures, and
then asked what they were for.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.145
I then began my learnings
about the Mothers of May,

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.182
and what these paintings
and names represented.

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:44.640
INTERVIEWER: The
Mothers of May are

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
a group of Argentinian women
who came together in the 1970s

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.120
to raise awareness of
their missing children,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.290
a group known as The
Disappeared," who

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.670
went missing during
the Dirty War,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.730
a time in Argentina's history
when a military dictatorship

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.632
ruled the country, terrorizing
anyone who spoke against them.

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:04.090
CECILIA BRODER:
Many of the mothers

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.070
came together in their grief.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.960
They began to
demand to be heard,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.930
wanting to know where
their children were.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.950
When they were not
given any information,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.730
14 mothers began, on April
30, 1977, a silent vigil

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.850
in the Plaza de Mayo
in Buenos Aires,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.860
the site known for protests.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.250
More joined them, and it became
a weekly event on Thursdays.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.580
Standing there silently,
they were identified only

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550
by their white
kerchiefs, and some

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.460
with pictures of their
missing children.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.630
INTERVIEWER: It was a horrific
time in Argentina's history.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.610
The government would
silence its protestors

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.510
with extreme violence,
kidnapping, torturing,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.514
and killing up to
30,000 citizens.

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:44.930
CECILIA BRODER:
Azucena Villaflor,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.554
one of the founding
mothers, whose name

00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:48.970
is written in the central
square in Bariloche,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.240
was kidnapped outside her home.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.830
It was reported that she was
taken to a torture center,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.615
and was on one of
the death flights

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.990
to the middle of
the ocean, where

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.140
victims were drugged, stripped,
and flung into the sea.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.900
Her body washed up on a beach.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.150
Families today still
wait for answers.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.490
The mothers, now grandmothers,
continue their march

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.750
every Thursday at
3:30, making sure

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.850
that Argentina doesn't
forget this brutal part

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.720
of its history.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.990
INTERVIEWER: And as Celia
walked around the plaza,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.020
seeing the names of the missing
scrawled across the stone,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.810
she felt for all the victims--
those who disappeared,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.900
and those who are still
waiting for answers.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.934
It saddened her, but she also
took away something else.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.350
CECILIA BRODER: From looking
at simple paintings and names

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.785
on a plaza, to understanding
the history of a nation,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.910
I came away with a deeper
understanding of the word

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.190
"courage."

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.620
The courage of these
women, then and now,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.840
exemplifies the love
and bond of a mother

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.470
with her son or daughter
that can never be broken,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.260
no matter what.

00:02:48.575 --> 00:02:49.950
INTERVIEWER: "This
Happened Here"

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.160
is a photography series that
showcases fascinating images

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.797
and the stories behind them.

00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:56.630
If you like this video,
be sure to check out

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.657
this one on the daily
life of Cuba's youth.

00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.115
Cuba continues to
face restrictions

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:02.990
under their government,
from their press

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.240
to their internet access.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.080
The cost of Wi-Fi
alone makes using

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.900
the internet impossible
for the average Cuban.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.590
Thanks for watching.
