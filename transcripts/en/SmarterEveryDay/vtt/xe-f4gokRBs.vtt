00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Today we're gonna do awesome science with

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.980
Orbix Hot Glass here at Lookout Mountain Alabama. Goggle up.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.980
Science is about to happen. We're gonna use a high speed camera and learn about Prince Rupert's Drop.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.980
[whispers] It's never been done on the internet. You're gonna learn something.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.980
Let's go.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.980
OK we are here inside the shop with

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.980
Cal. Cal owns the place. Can you show me how to make a Prince Rupert's Drop?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.980
(Cal) Sure. I'm gonna gather some glass, drop it in a bucket of

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.980
cold water.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.480
[sizzling sound]

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.980
(Destin) So after it cools down, this is what you're left with.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.980
It kinda looks like a tadpole, but it has some really interesting mechanical properties.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.980
We can actually hit this thing with a hammer and it won't break.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.980
OK I'm ready. [bang]
Didn't go.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.980
OK I think Cal is kind of a pansy so I.. You think you can break it? [laugh]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.980
So we're gonna try again only this time I'm gonna make him hit it really hard

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.980
and I'm gonna record it with high speed. Does that work? Think you can break it? Alright. Let's do it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.980
The challenge is on.
(Cal) Just hit it?
- Yep.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.980
[bang] [shattering] [laughs]
So do you think you actually broke it? I don't think

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.980
you did. You think you broke it?
- I know I broke it. [laugh]

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.980
- Let's look at the high speed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.980
[music]

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.980
OK so the drop broke, but technically it wasn't the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.980
hammer that broke it. If you look close in the high speed you can see that it's the wiggling of the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.980
tail that makes it go. This is the mystery of the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.980
Prince Rupert's Drop. You can try

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.980
as hard as you can to break the bulb, but you can't.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.980
But, if you even nick the tail, the entire thing will explode. Not shatter,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.980
but actually explode. Let's go outside and I'll show you more.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.980
OK we're gonna just run an obscene frame rate here. We have this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.980
Phantom V1610. So, glass breaking occurs

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.980
so fast that you have to have like hundreds of thousands of frames per second, so we're gonna

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.980
have a lower resolution and we have to have a lot of light as well. We're also gonna use this Miro over

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.980
here to run about 3000 frames per second so we can get a wide shot to see the whole event.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.980
as well.
3..2..1.. go.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.980
[shatter]

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.980
      [Awesome Music by Gordon McGladdery}

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.980
OK now we understand what a Prince Rupert Drop does, but at this point

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.980
we don't quite understand why it does it. Let's take a closer look.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.980
OK this is called a polariscope and basically what it is is it's a filtered piece of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.980
glass that's polarized. I have another filter here. You can see if I turn it,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.980
then I can block out the light. Now if I put this on the camera

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.980
that you're looking through here, and then I put the Prince Rupert's Drop in between

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.980
the two pieces of glass, you should be able to see the internal stresses built up

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.980
inside the Prince Rupert's Drop. So to understand how these stresses got here, let's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.980
use the color grey to represent nice and strong solid glass. We use red

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.980
to represent molten glass and because of the thermal expansion coefficient it's safe to assume that the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.980
higher the temperature the larger this glass wants to be. Blue represents glass that's cooling

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.980
off, or transitioning between the two states. Because of that same thermal expansion coefficient 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.980
this glass is shrinking and basically pulling in on itself. Think of a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.980
Prince Rupert's Drop as a bunch of little infantessimal pieces of glass with each piece trying to interact

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.980
with the pieces around it. When the molten glass is first dripped into the water, the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.980
outside layer touches the water and immediately solidifies. This locks in that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.980
outside shape of the drop. The inside of the drop however is still a hot expanded

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.980
liquid. As heat's transferred to the water that glass on the inside slowly begins to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.980
cool down, and pulls in against that outside layer. The problem is that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.980
because it's already locked in as a round solid, it only compresses tighter against

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.980
itself. This actually makes it stronger. Kind of like how an arch compresses and gets stronger when

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.980
you put your weight on it only this is in all directions. And because the cooling glass can't

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.980
move that outside layer it begins to pull against itself, causing it to be

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.980
in extremely high tension. It then hardens in this state of tension and there you have it, a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.980
Prince Rupert's Drop. The outside is in extremely high compressive stress and the inside is in

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.980
extremely high tensile stress. If one link in this tension chain is ever cut, it

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.980
breaks on down the line, feeding off of its own stored up energy just like a chemical

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.980
explosive does. The difference here is that instead of releasing chemical potential energy

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.980
mechanical strain energy is released. This wave of energy is what we call a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.980
failure front. You can directly measure the velocity of that failure front as long as

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.980
you have a camera fast enough. Let's give it a shot at 130,000 frames

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.980
per second.
3..2..1..go.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.980
Got it?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.980
[music]

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.980
So a big thanks to Cal from Orbix Hot Glass. If you found this

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.980
interesting and you want to support him by buying stuff go click on the link, wherever I

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.980
put it, and go check out his web site. Click the cat to subscribe.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.980
With the helmet. [laugh] It's a sad looking cat.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.980
You've never caught the cat on fire, ever?
- Never.
- Not even once?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.980
- Never.
- These things are named for a guy named Prince Rupert, imagine that,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.980
who lived in Bavaria back in the 1600s.
Here, here.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.980
[shins banging on concrete laughter through pain]

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.980
He brought these over as a gift to King Charles II in England who gave them to his

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.980
Royal Society to try to figure out.
Yep ready. [clang]

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.980
Holy smokes!

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.980
- Aah the tension's killing me. [shatter]
-(Destin in background) NO DON'T BLOW UP!

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.980
- You know it blow.. blowed up?
- Yep, it blowed up.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.980
- It BLOWED UP Y'ALL! [laugh]

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.980
Captioning in different languages welcome.
Please contact Destin if you can help.
