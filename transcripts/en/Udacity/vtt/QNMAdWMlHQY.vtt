00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.210
So I do want to mention before
we move on to something else

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.790
that privacy I've said in
a individual's ability to control.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.140
But it doesn't just have
to apply to individuals.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.810
There may be reasons for
universities, hospitals,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.760
charities, or even political action
committees sometimes don't need to

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.990
tell the rest of us who's contributing
to their cause and whatever.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.310
So when you talk about privacy you
focus a lot on the individual and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.850
their ability but it also applies to
organizations and some of those examples

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.850
we have here either because they want
to protect date about people who

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.770
are affiliated with those
organizations as their employees or

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.930
are their employees and
things like that.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.050
So, although privacy we largely
talked about individual,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.740
but we should keep in mind that
it also applies to organizations.
