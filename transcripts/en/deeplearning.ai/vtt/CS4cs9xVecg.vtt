00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.340
Hello, and welcome. As you probably know, deep learning has already transformed traditional internet businesses like web search and advertising.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.699
But deep learning is also enabling brand new products and businesses and ways of helping people to recreate it.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.759
Everything ranging from better healthcare where deep learning is getting really good at reading X-Ray images to

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.299
delivering personalized education, to precision agriculture,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.539
to even self-driving cars and many others.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.119
If you want to learn the tools of deep learning and be able to apply them to build these amazing things,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.059
I want to help you get there. When you finish the sequence of courses on Coursera called a

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.449
Specialization, you will be able to put deep learning onto your resume with confidence. Over the next decade,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.140
I think all of us have an opportunity

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.719
To build an amazing world, amazing society that is AI powered

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.189
And I hope that you will play a big role in the creation of this AI-powered society. So that it. Let's get started.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.089
I think that AI is the new electricity.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.680
Starting from about a hundred years ago, the electrification of our society

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.699
transformed every major industry ranging from transportation, manufacturing to healthcare communications and many more.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.390
And I think that today, we see a surprisingly clear power for AI to bring about an equally big transformation and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.379
of course the part of AI that is rising rapidly and driving a lot of these developments is deep learning.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.560
So, today, deep learning is one of the most highly sought-after skills in the technology world and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.379
Through this course and a few courses after this one. I want to help you to gain and master those skills

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.390
so here's what you'll learn in this sequence of courses also called a

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:53.729
Specialization on Coursera. In the first course you'll learn about the foundations of Neural networks to learn about neural networks and deep learning

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.389
This video that you're watching is part of this first course,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.710
which lasts four weeks in total. And each of the five courses in this specialization will be about two to four weeks,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.009
where most of them are actually shorter than four weeks.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.509
But in this first course you learn how to build a neural network,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.900
including a deep neural network and how to train it on data and at the end of this course, you'll be able to build a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.750
deep neural network to recognize, guess what?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.390
Cats. For some reason there is a cat meme running around in deep learning and so following tradition in this first

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.920
course, we'll build a cat recognizer

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.060
Then in the second course you'll learn about the practical aspects of deep learning.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.029
So you'll learn now that you've built in your network how to actually get it to perform well to learn about hyper

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.539
constituting, regularization, how to diagnose lies and variants and advanced optimization algorithms like

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.230
Momentum RMSprop and the Atom Optimization algorithm

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.479
Sometimes it seems like there's a lot of tuning even some black Magic and how you build in your network?

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.550
So the second course which is just three weeks will demystify some of that black magic

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.429
In a third course which is just two weeks you learn how to structure your machine learning project

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.160
It turns out that the strategy for building a machine learning system has changed in the area of deep learning

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.390
So for example the way you fit your data into train

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.920
Development or depth also called holdout cross validation set and test sets has changed in the era of deep learning

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:36.048
So what are the new best practices for doing graph and whatever your training set and your test set come from different distributions

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.779
That's happening a lot more in the area of deep learning so how do you deal with that and if you've heard of?

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060
End-To-end deep learning

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.929
You also learn more about that in this third course and see when you should use it and maybe when you shouldn't

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.349
The material in this third course is relatively unique

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.789
I'm going to share with you a lot of the hot one lessons that I've learned building and shipping

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.590
Quite a lot of deep learning products this as I know this is actually material that is not taught in most

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.950
universities that active learning causes

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.419
But I think I'll really help you to get your deep learning systems to work well in the next course will then talk about

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.440
convolutional Neural Networks often abbreviated see

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.850
convolutional net works or

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.659
Convolutional Neural Networks are often applied to images

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.259
so you learn how to build these models in Course 4

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.360
Finally in Course 5 you learn sequence models and how to apply them to natural language processing and other problems

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.480
so sequence models includes models like recurrent Neural Networks, abbreviated to RNNs, and

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.000
Ost-N Models, sensor long Short-term memory models. You learn

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.600
what these terms mean in Course 5 and be able to apply them to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800
natural language processing problems

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.480
So you learn these models in Course 5 and be able to apply them to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.580
Sequence Data. So for example natural language is just a sequence of words and you also understand how these models can be applied to

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.200
speech recognition or to music generation and other problems.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.650
So through these courses you learn the tools of deep learning. You'll be able to apply them to build amazing things,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.150
and I hope many of you through this will also be able to advance your career

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.020
So that. Let's get started, please go into the next video. We will talk about deep learning applied to supervised learning.
