MALE SPEAKER: Today
I want to introduce

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.490
to you the very amazing
and inspirational guy, who

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.560
happened to be born
without arms or legs.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.630
The funny thing is that
you wouldn't know it

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.680
by hanging out with him.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.190
Chris is a man who challenges
what some people consider to be

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.910
the norm for a disabled person.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.230
But I think it's best if I allow
Chris to speak for himself.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.835
So we're going to start
first with a video.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:31.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370
-Here's is the latest original
short from filmmaker John

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.815
Chester over at
Apricot Lane Farms.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:44.102
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.020
-Everyone knows that farming
requires hard physical labor,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.190
especially in the summer.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.380
Fortunately, we get
a lot of friends who

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.780
offer to come and help us out.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.690
But none have been as
memorable as Chris.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.990
While most are new
at farming, Chris

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.600
has been farming
his entire life.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.380
But he has a few limitations.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.080
-Things that I can't do--
I can't drive legally.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.205
I can't operate a chainsaw.

00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:18.621
Mind you, I've
never really tried.

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.790
I can't weed-whip or weed-whack.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.070
I cannot swim to save my life.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.950
You drop a bowling ball and me
in the water at the same time,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.960
I will beat the bowling
ball to the bottom

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.740
nine times out of nine.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.260
I was going to say 9 times
out of 10, but no, it's 100%.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.820
It takes me upwards
of 400% more energy

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.652
to do everyday tasks than
somebody with arms and legs.

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:54.610
I'm hopping on one leg.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.990
It's a good little workout.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.800
-So what can a farmer with
no legs and no arms do?

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.740
-When I tell people
that I'm a farmer,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.690
I'm pretty sure people
are like, yeah, right.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.170
-There were my ideas of
what Chris could safely

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.750
do to help out.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.625
And then there were his.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.117
-So how do you break?

00:02:25.117 --> 00:02:26.700
-Go to the shop and
get a chunk of two

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.783
by four about three feet
long, cut a groove in it,

00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:31.610
and I'd be driving this thing
in about two or three minutes.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.060
I'm sure in the back of
your mind you're probably

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.220
wondering, well,
how does he do it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.292
and how competently
can he do it?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
When I was born, my grandma
actually set the tone right

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.960
at a very early stage.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.250
Perfect.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.850
My uncle phoned my
grandma and grandpa

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.590
let them know that my mom
and dad had a baby boy.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.720
Healthy, but not
everything was there.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.780
And my grandma didn't even
hesitate for a second.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.910
She said, Bruce-- my dad-- never
did finish anything he started.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.780
[LAUGHS] I grew up right around
the tractors, the combines.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.310
And I'd say when I
was about 9 or 10,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.060
I wanted to start
driving them on my own.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.490
And I've been basically
doing it ever since.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.570
-One might assume
Chris's parents had

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.720
hand a hand in developing his
extraordinary independence,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.150
but not in the way
that you might think.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.790
-Talking to my dad,
I asked him, what

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.990
did you do differently
with me than you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.960
would have any other kid?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.140
He said, nothing.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.590
So my independence is
almost endless now,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.350
because of their approach.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.380
-There was very
little he couldn't do.

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:11.460
-I remember as a kid being
sent down to the office

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.130
because I wouldn't wear my
prosthetic arm at school.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.320
They weren't really for me.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.920
I don't think I even realized
I was missing arms and legs.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.150
-He's not only overcome the
many physical challenges

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.760
of his life, but he's
gracefully navigated the most

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.680
awkward moments.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.910
-I was handing out
Halloween candy one year

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.830
and kids were like,
aw, awesome costume!

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.900
I was like, I'm wearing
jeans and a t-shirt.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.870
This is not a costume.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.474
This is me.

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.140
Come back here on the
first of November,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.431
I'll be wearing the same thing.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.990
Some people are ashamed
of their freckles.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.780
Some people are ashamed of that
spare tire around their waist.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.310
They have big ears or
a big nose or whatever.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.349
I think if you're worried
about how you look,

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.265
you're cheating yourself
out of opportunities.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.780
-Chris's powerful courage
is fueled by the acceptance

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.430
that he has for himself.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.928
Imagine, if in our own lives,
we could all do the same.

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:34.912
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:18.238 --> 00:06:19.780
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.480
How's everybody
doing this morning?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.060
Very good.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.210
I want to first of all start off
by thanking Akshay and Google

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.950
for making it all possible
for me to come here today.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.120
I also want to thank
you guys for stopping by

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.660
as well as everybody
that's watching

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.234
this, streaming from their
desks here at Google.

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:39.150
My name is Chris Koch.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.490
I am from Canada, so I'll
probably say things like

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.470
"aboat" and "hoas," talk a lot
about hockey and say "sore-ee"

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.040
a lot.

00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:54.090
Like I said, I'm from Canada.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.110
And as you can see, I--
born without arms and legs.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.930
There's no real known reason
as to why I was born like this.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.154
And a lot of people
will make the assumption

00:07:04.154 --> 00:07:06.070
or they'll ask the
question, it must have been

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.862
difficult growing up like that.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.760
And it was actually quite easy.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.670
And two things-- one was
a good sense of humor

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.560
that my grandma had
right from day one,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.020
as you saw in that video,
accusing my dad of never

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.210
finishing anything he started.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.407
And that really set the
stage right from day one.

00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:26.990
It wasn't going to
be, oh my goodness,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.680
what are we going to do?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.160
Our grandson, or my son,
my nephew, whatever,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.410
has no arms and legs.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.020
This is horrible.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.302
It was going to
be, you know what?

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:39.760
We're just take
this all in stride.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.926
We're going to laugh it off.

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:44.020
And to this day, I
still make light of it.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.170
I joke around about it.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.030
When I call and make a
reservation at a restaurant,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.920
I call in and make a
reservation for 5 and 1/2.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.840
My girlfriend
always jokes around

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.110
about how I might not
necessarily be her better half.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.680
It's maybe more like
a third, a quarter.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.400
I don't know.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.690
We're not that
good at fractions.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.310
But you have fun with it.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.910
And if you can't laugh at
life, what can you laugh at?

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.310
Things happen in life.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.350
There's bumps in the road.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.580
There's hiccups.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.010
And you can do
one of two things.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.430
You can let it defeat you
and take over your day

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.670
and ruin your day, or you
can put a funny spin on it

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.020
and just say, you know what?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.275
I'm going to laugh this off,
shrug it off, continue on

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:25.774
with my day.

00:08:25.774 --> 00:08:28.000
And another thing you can
do is when you get to work

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.690
or you get home or
whatever, you can

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.520
tell your friends or your family
that funny story that happened

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.330
on the way and make them
laugh too, instead of, oh,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.400
this horrible thing.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.176
I mean, I could be throwing this
pity party and everybody I meet

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:46.676
or I talk to, I could be talking
about how unfortunate it is

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:48.070
that I'm missing arms and legs.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.020
No, it's fine.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.380
Life has been
absolutely amazing.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.430
And, you know, what
if our purpose in life

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.970
is to have fun and enjoy it?

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.000
I think a lot of people
take life far too seriously.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.110
And they forget to just
enjoy life and have fun.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.980
And it's a lot less
stressful way to live life.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.326
And I mean, I'm not saying
that you need-- there's

00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:13.450
bills that need to be paid.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.020
Your career has to
be taken care of.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.250
Your children, your family,
whatever-- all those things do

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.600
need to be taken care of.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.370
And I guess another
thing I should say

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.970
is all the things that I'm going
to talk to you today about,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.780
these are all things that
have worked well for me.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.510
And the way I've
lived my life is not

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.000
going to be the
perfect answer for you.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.710
We all have our own puzzle.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.420
We all have our own
pieces of that puzzle

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.049
that we're putting together.

00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:48.090
You can't take pieces from
somebody else's puzzle

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.620
and fit it into yours.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.940
You can look at what
the other person's doing

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.160
and say, OK, I see how
that worked for that person

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.340
and I see how that
worked for that person.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.320
So I'm going to take
little bits and pieces

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.830
and apply it to my
life and hopefully find

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.110
the perfect answer for me.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:10.000
So like I said, my life has
been absolutely amazing.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.430
Growing up wasn't difficult.
I grew up fairly normal,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.170
if there is such a thing.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.220
I played sports
with all my friends.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.810
I got in trouble
for the same things.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.380
Sometimes I got in
trouble for things

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.380
that I thought I wouldn't
get in trouble for,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.600
because I thought I
blended well into everybody

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.590
else-- well, with
everybody else.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.510
Has anybody ever played the
game-- everybody calls it

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.450
something different-- but Nicky,
Nicky Nine Door, Knock Knock

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.330
Ginger or whatever?

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.540
I played that with a
couple friends one night.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.564
And when I got
home, mom asked me,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:48.980
so what were you
up to last night?

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.630
Or, what were you up to tonight?

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.020
I said, oh, nothing just hanging
out with Jackie and Jody.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.929
Were you playing
Nicky Nicky Nine Door?

00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:57.470
I said, no, absolutely
not, I wasn't.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.290
She said, well, everybody
in the neighborhood

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.080
has phoned and
said that you were.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.330
Because when I run up to
somebody's door and knock

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.110
on the door and
then hop away, it's

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.700
pretty obvious who
in the neighborhood

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.860
was just playing that game.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.790
I don't blend into the
general population,

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.180
which actually earlier, I had
to do a quick costume change.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.570
I had a pair of dark gray
pants and a lighter gray shirt.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.260
And as you can see, it's
kind of a lighter gray wall

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.130
and a darker gray carpet.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.680
So I blended in perfectly
to the background.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.912
It's not very often
do I get to blend in.

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:36.370
So I still had to
change my clothes

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.890
to make sure that I stand out.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.930
As I said before, growing
up was quite easy.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.130
And one of the reasons, the
other reasons that growing up

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.730
was so easy was
my parents' hands

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.830
off approach-- pun intended--
to how they raised me.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.104
They knew early on that if
they did everything for me,

00:11:56.104 --> 00:11:58.020
I wasn't going to learn
how to be independent.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.120
And part of that was made it
a lot easier with the fact

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.040
that I was born like this.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.300
I've never known what it's
like to have arms and legs.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.150
I've never known
anything different.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.190
This has been my
normal for 36 years.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.210
It's a long time.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.660
This has been my normal.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.490
And being born
without arms and legs

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.550
is really no different than
being born with arms and legs.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.600
You were born with fingers
and toes and knees and elbows.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.272
When you're a baby, you
learn how to grasp things.

00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:38.060
Then you learned how to crawl
and you learned how to walk

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.950
and then you'll
learn how to run.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.658
And it was just that
natural progression.

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:44.190
And now everything
is just natural.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.770
And it was the
same thing for me.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.640
And I've always said I have
an enormous amount of respect

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.180
for somebody who has
lost a limb or limbs

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.530
or had an accident
later in life and had

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.747
to relearn all those things.

00:12:57.747 --> 00:12:59.830
And not only do you have
to re-learn those things,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.970
you have that emotional
and psychological hurdles

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.560
to overcome.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.940
And some of the most incredible,
amazing, inspirational people

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.730
I have ever met in
my life are people

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.320
who have had an accident
or an unfortunate situation

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.790
and still not let
that get them down.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.570
And I have an
amazing opportunity

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.820
where I get to share my story
and motivate and inspire

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.620
people.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.090
And I get to meet a
lot of people who've

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.130
been in certain situations
where their ability to use

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.110
their hands, legs, whatever
has been taken away from them.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.950
And I just have the
utmost respect for them.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.590
Growing up, I actually used
to wear artificial legs

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.490
up until about four years ago.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.420
And I walked everywhere
on those legs.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.810
Even if I was doing something
as simple as going down

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.800
to the corner store to
grab a carton of milk.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.570
I'd put on the legs
and it would take me

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.850
upwards of 15 minutes at times,
and a good amount of energy

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.110
to get those legs on.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.640
There were some times when by
the time I got those legs on,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.720
I was so tired, I just wanted
to take the legs right back off,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.030
have a shower and
crawl back into bed.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.100
But that was just something that
accepted as part of my norm.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.710
Get the legs on, get over it,
and get done what I had to do.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.020
And the legs were-- they
worked well, obviously,

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.560
because I wore them
everywhere I went.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.420
They weren't
comfortable but they

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.100
weren't overly
uncomfortable either,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.630
and I kind of liken
it to women's shoes.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.972
Or a Canadian analogy
would be to hockey skates.

00:14:42.972 --> 00:14:45.180
They're not the most
comfortable things in the world,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.480
but they look great.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.380
I'm going back to women's shoes.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.220
And you wear these
shoes all day long.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.520
They hurt your feet, but damn,
do you look good in them.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.300
By the end of the day,
you are looking so forward

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.270
to getting home and
taking off those shoes.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.834
It was the same for me.

00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:06.000
By the end of the day, I
could not wait to get home.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.375
And instead of kicking off my
shoes, I kicked off my legs

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.980
and relaxed.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.690
So the legs, they worked well.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.160
But about four years ago,
I was down in Florida

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.840
and bought a longboard,
just for fun.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.590
Because when I was a kid,
about fifth or sixth grade,

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.320
I'd whip around on a skateboard.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.885
And so I bought a
longboard just for fun.

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:24.260
And it turned out
to be something

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.850
that was way, way easier to
get around then the legs.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.080
I could cover a lot more ground.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.270
And it was a lot cooler, too.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.490
The reaction I get from
people on the longboard

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.710
is way different
than the reaction

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.740
I got when I was
wearing artificial legs.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.281
There was actually
some people that I

00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:47.560
worked with for an airline
when I was living in Canada.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.550
I was working for an
airline called West Jet.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.570
And there was
people that I worked

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.945
with for three years that had
no idea that I was actually

00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:53.540
missing legs.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.550
They just thought I was
shorter and walked funny.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.560
So yeah, the legs worked
great, but the longboard

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.830
was absolutely awesome.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.090
And I'm in the board, I can
get anywhere I need to get to.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.760
If there is a terrain that's
not overly board friendly,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.880
I could throw the board
underneath my arm and hop

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.640
to wherever I needs to get to.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.960
Stairs aren't a problem all.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.810
The board has worked
really, really well for me.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.720
As far as arms are
concerned, artificial arms

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.560
really have never
been something that

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.950
have been a good fit for me.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.420
I haven't found a set
of prosthetic arms

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.790
that I felt I could
maneuver better

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.110
than just what I have here.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:43.840
And a lot of things-- I can do
everything with just my arms.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.910
And there's some
things that-- just

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:53.100
finite little-- skills that
require very fine motor

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.310
skills, like
maneuvering a phone--

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.960
and I'm going to actually
call on somebody,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.125
if they don't mind.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:04.089
And I'm going to
issue a challenge.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.829
But as far as microphones
are concerned,

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.204
one thing I learned very early
on is I have great balance.

00:17:09.204 --> 00:17:14.369
I have dropped very few
phones, surprisingly.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.750
I'm able to longboard
and send text messages

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.469
without any problems.

00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:22.510
Every one in awhile, you
find a pretty good crack

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.762
in the sidewalk and
that will stop me dead.

00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:26.470
But I've never actually
dropped the phone

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.020
because I lost
the balance on it.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:33.490
But I can swipe in and
send text messages.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.316
I don't have to use Siri.

00:17:35.316 --> 00:17:38.000
As you saw in the very first
video, I work on a farm.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.020
That farm is actually
in Saskatchewan.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.650
She never gets
Saskatchewan right.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:47.040
So I could type-- I could
probably type on my iPhone--

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.630
how's that for product
placement-- on my phone

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.560
probably just as
fast as you guys can.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.690
The only thing that I
really have any issues with

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.320
is when I'm looking at
pictures or a website.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.105
When you guys zoom in
to your smartphones,

00:18:07.105 --> 00:18:10.180
you use your-- forgive
me for not knowing

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.310
the proper terminology for the
said fingers that are used,

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.510
but I believe it's your thumb
and your pointer finger.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.920
Yeah, I nailed it.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.730
You do that.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.482
I have to my mouth
when I zoom in.

00:18:22.482 --> 00:18:24.190
My boss always gives
me grief about that.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.547
He's like, oh, so who's picture
are you looking at right now?

00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:29.255
I'm a narcissist.

00:18:29.255 --> 00:18:31.560
It's one of myself.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.380
So now, to the challenge
that I wanted to issue.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.010
I want to see if somebody
can, without using

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.280
their fingers and
their hands-- I'm

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.340
going to get my girlfriend
to come up front here and sit

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.470
on the board beside me.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.050
And I want to see if somebody
can take a picture of us

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.880
on their phone.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.840
Do I have a willing participant?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.360
Awesome.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.740
Thank you so much.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.670
What's your name?

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.410
AUDIENCE: Chris.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.305
CHRIS KOCH: Perfect.

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:00.430
AUDIENCE: Also from Canada.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.780
CHRIS KOCH: Also from Canada.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.550
It is such a small country.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.680
We all have the same name.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.112
I'm from the Calgary area.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.320
You're probably from Toronto.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.107
And it's shocking that we don't
actually know one another.

00:19:13.107 --> 00:19:15.190
So I'm going to get my
girlfriend Ally to come up.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:19.380
And if you can take
up a picture with us--

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.840
we want to get you in the
picture, so we'll sit over here

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.030
and you can come over there.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.230
So you can use your
phone, because you

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.842
might want to use your tongue
and your mouth or whatever.

00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:36.550
Sorry, but I don't
want that on my phone.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.580
You can't use your
hands or your fingers.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.074
So I want you to be
logged out of your phone.

00:19:44.074 --> 00:19:45.490
I want you to put
the password in.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.602
AUDIENCE: Oh, man.

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.310
CHRIS KOCH: I'm making
you work for this.

00:19:57.544 --> 00:20:01.918
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.918 --> 00:20:08.339
CHRIS KOCH: Oh, it's not
a thumbprint one, is it?

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:10.380
I don't have that feature
on my phone, obviously.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.129
AUDIENCE: It's going to take
me awhile to log in here.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:13.670
Can I log in?

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.340
CHRIS KOCH: Yeah, l'll
let you cheat and log

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.214
in with your fingers.

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:18.525
But the photo actually has
to be taken without fingers.

00:20:23.915 --> 00:20:24.415
Oh.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.645
I'm not responsible for
cracked screens on there, am I?

00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:32.895
AUDIENCE: They signed waivers.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:48.360
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.213
AUDIENCE: Look at the strain.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:57.004
CHRIS KOCH: Wishing he
had a longer tongue.

00:21:00.012 --> 00:21:00.720
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.160
CHRIS KOCH: Got it.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.659
All right.

00:21:01.659 --> 00:21:04.380
Everybody give Chris a hand.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.000
Awesome.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.380
Let's see the picture here.

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:12.650
That's pretty good.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.770
AUDIENCE: Oh, no, we
have to do another one.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.770
CHRIS KOCH: She blinked.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.061
All right, thank you very much.

00:21:17.061 --> 00:21:17.915
I appreciate that.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.730
So that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.980
Actually, that's the first
time I ever tried that one.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.440
It was Akshay's idea
that we try that one.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.245
I'm going to get
another-- I'm going

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:36.010
to do another exercise,
audience participating

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.460
exercise, to kind of put you
into my proverbial shoes.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.830
So I'm going to
get-- Akshay is going

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.660
to come down and do this one.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.610
And I need another
person other than Akshay.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.920
And I want you guys to
race and try and get

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.370
into the water bottle
without using your hands.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.360
Do I have another
audience participant

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.390
to race Akshay on this?

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.610
Yep, come on up.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.700
What's your name?

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.250
OK, Rigette.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.950
Perfect.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.792
Rigette and Akshay
are going to race

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:12.125
to get into these water bottles.

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:18.773
MALE SPEAKER: That's the
last time I invite you here.

00:22:18.773 --> 00:22:25.156
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:25.156 --> 00:22:27.000
CHRIS KOCH: It's
a friendly race.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.780
AUDIENCE: So we
got to open it up?

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.196
CHRIS KOCH: Open
the water bottle.

00:22:30.196 --> 00:22:32.620
You can't use your hands.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.370
Use your forearms.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.670
You can use your mouth.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.916
If you have that much
dexterity with your feet,

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:40.166
you're more than welcome to
use your feet if you want.

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:41.920
You just can't use your hands.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.080
On your mark, get set, go.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.910
Oh, wow.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.820
That's pretty good.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.090
And surprisingly little
water on the floor.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.430
Awesome, and congratulations.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.190
Well, OK, Rigette won.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.560
Congratulations.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.500
And you won a free
bottle of water,

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.750
which actually was provided
by Google for free anyway.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.222
So give these guys a hand.

00:23:13.222 --> 00:23:17.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.580
I'm going to show you
guys another video.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.500
[BEGIN PLAYBACK]

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.888
-Notice, all by
himself on a T bar.

00:23:45.888 --> 00:23:48.744
It's interesting, not
having any arms and legs.

00:23:48.744 --> 00:23:51.348
It's quite fantastic
for this little boy

00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:53.838
to be able to go up the hill
and come down by himself.

00:24:19.066 --> 00:24:21.966
-The gracefulness of a cat
and the speed of a mongoose.

00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:53.776
Today I've just been
moving around some bales

00:24:53.776 --> 00:24:54.401
with a tractor.

00:24:54.401 --> 00:24:56.894
So come on in.

00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:58.393
I'll show you how
to work a tractor.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.108
A lot of the new tractors, it's
all hydrostatic transmission.

00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:11.048
So you don't need feet at
all to run these things.

00:25:11.048 --> 00:25:14.492
It works out well for me.

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:16.132
When I was a little,
little kid, I

00:25:16.132 --> 00:25:19.185
used to ride on the tractor
on the combine for hours.

00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:23.060
Finally I got sick of having
to have somebody in the tractor

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.042
with me, so I just
said, you know what?

00:25:25.042 --> 00:25:26.970
I'm just going to
do this by myself.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.290
If I can go snowboarding,
why not you?

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.210
If I can go surfing in
Brazil, why not you?

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.980
The possibilities are endless.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.480
Enjoy.

00:25:45.017 --> 00:25:45.600
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.183
CHRIS KOCH: So I was
asked a while ago

00:25:47.183 --> 00:25:49.720
if I had the perfect job in
the world, what would it be?

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.550
And my honest answer
to that question

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.860
is, I'm doing it right now.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.450
I get to travel around
the world, share my story,

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.290
and inspire and motivate.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.756
And I've had the opportunity
to speak at down here

00:26:00.756 --> 00:26:02.380
at the States now,
speaking at Google--

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.600
and that's amazing-- all
across Canada, Australia,

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.440
Nepal, and Cambodia.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.204
And it's so awesome to
have the opportunity

00:26:12.204 --> 00:26:13.620
to see so many
places in the world

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.510
and meet so many
incredible people.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.370
And I love doing that.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.490
But I also love
working on the farm.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.990
It's something that
I grew up doing,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.820
and it's just something
that-- it's in your blood.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.150
You can't really explain
why you love it so much.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.610
And there's lot of people like,
how could you possibly stand

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:37.900
sitting in a tractor for
12, 14, 18 hours a day?

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.600
I love it.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.510
And actually, a lot
of my great ideas

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.320
or maybe not so great
ideas with my presentations

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.650
come to me in the tractor.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.941
You get lot of time to reflect.

00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:53.710
And it's a nice
juxtaposition of a life.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.330
It's hectic.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.880
It's life on the road.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.450
It's airports and
stuff like that.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.150
And it's just a nice, calm
peacefulness of the farm.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.050
And I love it.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.850
And the other reason why
I love farming is it's

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.600
not a job that you expect
a guy without arms and legs

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.100
to be doing.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.790
And I love that wow factor.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.170
I love when I can tell
somebody at an airport when

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.195
they ask what I do, that I drive
large combines and tractors.

00:27:16.195 --> 00:27:17.640
And they're like, really?

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.620
Or when I'm passing by somebody
in one of those machines.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.590
And you can see in the picture
that the cab is all glass.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.970
It's all window and it's a
very narrow steering column.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.490
So when I drive
by in the tractor

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.270
and you pass me and I
give you a big wave,

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.930
you can clearly
see the guy in that

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.540
machine has no arms no legs.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.430
And there's a lot of very
perplexed, confused looks

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.810
as to what they just saw.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.850
The other reason why I
love being on the farm

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.391
is, it's one of the
few jobs that you

00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:50.100
can do where you can spend so
much time with your family.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.810
And one of my other
actions in my life

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:57.100
is my incredible, amazing
family that I have.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.630
And I wouldn't be
in the position

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.660
that I am today without
my family's support

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:08.530
and them doing such an
amazing job of raising me.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.030
Some might argue that they maybe
didn't do the greatest job.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.090
No, I'm kidding.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.120
They did an amazing job.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.970
I have an amazing
family, amazing community

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.830
that I grew up in in
southern Alberta-- Nanton,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.710
about an hour south of Calgary.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.480
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the best place

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.580
in the world to have grown up.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.149
Some of you may argue and
say that where you grew up

00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:28.440
is the best place in the world.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.030
And I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.750
It's Nanton.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.940
I'm telling you.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.100
But no, I do get back home
quite often to help on the farm

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.280
as well spend time with
my nephews and my niece.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.790
I have two nephews and a niece.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.700
That little guy in
the picture, Braden,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.670
he's a little over two now.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.850
Loves riding around in
the tractor with me.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.810
He'd ride around for
hours if you let him.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.310
And then there's
also a set of twins

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.460
and they just turned one
here a long time ago.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.700
And I have not been able to get
a picture of all three of them.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.170
And anybody who has kids
or nieces or nephews

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.180
especially, that many in such
a short, young age range, it

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.440
is impossible to get
them all settled down

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.140
for one good picture.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.134
One's usually crying.

00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:14.050
The other one's usually
looking the other way.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.341
And the other one's usually
got a finger up their nose.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.380
A lot of people
find-- for me, I find

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.950
what I do to be fairly
normal, I guess.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.010
I live a regular life.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.680
I just do what I do.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.190
And in doing what
I'm doing, I've

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.540
had the opportunity to meet
some incredible people.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.200
One of those people is my
absolutely amazing girlfriend.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.850
She's incredibly beautiful.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.370
And she's incredibly beautiful
outside as well as inside.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.530
And we've had an
opportunity in the time

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.630
that we've been together
to travel around, meet

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.130
some amazing people, see
some beautiful places.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.160
That's one of my favorite
pictures of us right there.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.010
And not only is it just blessed
to have an amazing girlfriend,

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.960
but she works a lot
with me in helping me

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.750
with my presentations.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:20.850
She also helps me a lot in
this whole "If I Can" movement,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.090
I guess, foundation, of getting
out there and encouraging

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.050
people to get out there and
live life to the fullest.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.180
And so I'd also like to
take this opportunity

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.190
to brag about how we met.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:39.680
We started dating on Valentine's
Day, which is very Hallmark.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.230
And part of the reason is
just so we remember when

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.850
our anniversary is going to be.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.140
The whole world advertises when
our anniversary is coming up,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.050
so it's perfect.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.560
You'll never forget that.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.720
But also, I like to brag
about our first kiss.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.020
It was epic.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.620
Now, growing up in the small
town of southern Alberta

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.160
in the prairies, this
doesn't happen very often.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.330
It was on the beach in Malibu,
underneath the moonlight.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:08.300
It was absolutely perfect,
so I had to brag about that.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:08.900
It's my stage.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.590
I can talk about
whatever I want, right?

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.030
That brings me to
the whole theme

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.440
or the motto of what I speak
about, which is "If I Can."

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.210
It's pretty simple.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.400
And a guy without
arms and legs, myself,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.560
if I can longboard, if
I can travel the world,

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.330
if I can work on the farm,
if I can snowboard, surf--

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.960
if I can do all these
things, absolutely anybody

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.540
is capable of anything.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.510
One of the obstacles that
we encounter in our lives

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:44.640
are ones that we
have made ourselves.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.410
Or if it is a
legitimate obstacle,

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.210
we turn that obstacle
into something

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.880
that's maybe this big
into something that's

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.400
seemingly insurmountable.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.300
Now if I was taller
and I had arms,

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.400
the difference would be much
greater, of greater effect.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.050
So you're just going to have
to do the extrapolation for me.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.210
But it's true.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.260
And there's times
where I wake up

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.470
and I'm not quite
feeling it for that day,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.240
and just those
little tiny things

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.980
happen to throw your day off.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.580
And they're so
trivial, seemingly

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.274
nothing things that happen.

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.940
But on a day when
you're not feeling it,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.250
it just gets blown
out of proportion.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.930
All of a sudden, you're
having a crappy day.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.040
You just need to stop and slow
yourself down and realize, OK,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.907
everything's going
to be all right.

00:32:36.907 --> 00:32:38.490
And you can look at
things that you've

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.640
done in your past to apply
the whole "If I Can" model.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.830
Look at obstacles and challenges
that you've faced and overcame

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:51.156
in your lives and
apply those to things

00:32:51.156 --> 00:32:52.780
that you might
encounter moving forward

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.610
and say, well, if
I was able to do--

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.250
if I was able to land a job at
Google, if I was able to bust

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.980
my butt in university to
get that degree that I got,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.090
if I was able to run that
marathon that I did--

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.700
whatever-- I've got the power.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.710
I've got the fuel moving
forward to accomplish

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.680
absolutely anything.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.840
"If I Can" originally
started off

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.610
as an idea for a travel show.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:24.670
A good buddy of mine,
J.R., he took off

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.460
traveling through Asia.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.030
He started in Thailand,
worked his way

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.499
all the way down through
Cambodia, Malaysia,

00:33:35.499 --> 00:33:37.790
Philippines, all the way down
to Australia, New Zealand

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.539
all the way back up
to Mongolia and China.

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:40.809
He was gone for 18 months.

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:42.600
And I watched his travel
posts like a hawk.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.390
And I thought,
traveling like that is

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.270
something I would love to do.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.150
And we got back from
his trip, I asked him.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.690
I said, do you think
I'd be able to travel

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:50.620
in that same capacity?

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.520
He said, absolutely.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.227
There's no reason why
you wouldn't be able to.

00:33:54.227 --> 00:33:55.810
So I thought, let's
put it to the test

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:58.840
and actually see
if I can do that.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.120
And I also thought it would be
a neat idea for a travel show.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.370
So we headed down to Brazil.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.670
And the deal was,
while we're in Brazil,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.460
anything that had to be
done, I had to do on my own.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:17.199
If I had to lug my 35-pound
backpack 15 blocks to the bus

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:20.030
station and load that
up on the bus myself,

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.639
then that's what had to be done.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.030
And now this talk is
going to be recorded.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.880
So I have to make sure that I
stick with those numbers now.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.130
Because a year from now, it's
going to be a 45-pound backpack

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.360
and I had to carry
that 35 blocks

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.460
and load it up onto
a double decker bus.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.489
But J.R. probably looked like
the worst friend in the world.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:45.270
And I'm struggling to get
my backpack up on the bus

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.370
and random strangers are
jumping in, trying to help out.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.760
And J.R.'s going, no, no, no.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.426
Leave him alone.

00:34:50.426 --> 00:34:52.320
He can do it.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.250
Meanwhile, he's just standing
there holding the video camera,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.250
telling these people,
he might fall.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.390
This is true.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.280
But if he does, I got
the camera rolling.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.080
And Ally has said
the same thing too.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.830
And I'm often so oblivious
to what goes on around me.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.390
I've had surprise parties thrown
for me and not even realized.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.740
But I digress.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:19.240
But she has noticed when
I'm skateboarding along

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.740
and I get to a curb and I pick
up the board and lift it up,

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.520
throw it up on a
curve and jump up,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.350
or I carry my own
board up the stairs,

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.600
or get myself up into a
chair in a restaurant,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.330
and when people realize that
Ally and I are together--

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.890
and actually they
also don't always

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.030
assume that we're
together, together.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.320
They make the assumption,
oh, what a nice sister

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.710
he has, or what a nice
helper he has-- oh, that's

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.080
an amazing girlfriend
that I have-- but don't

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.360
realize that we're
together and she's

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.650
letting me do my own thing.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.999
She knows that if she jumps
in-- if I need help, I'll ask.

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:56.040
She doesn't need to jump
in and just help me out.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.700
I'm good to go.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.561
So yeah, same thing, people not
helping me out and people I'm

00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.810
with not helping me out and
they look like bad people.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.940
But I would much rather that.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.260
And people often ask
me if I need help.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.490
And I'll say, no, it's OK.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.700
And then they feel like
they've offended me.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.867
I would much rather
graciously and politely say,

00:36:16.867 --> 00:36:17.450
you know what?

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.860
I'm good.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.260
I got it.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.926
Thank you very much
for helping, than be

00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:23.201
a situation where I really
need some help and nobody seems

00:36:23.201 --> 00:36:23.700
to care.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.290
And you see all those
videos circulating around

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.990
on Facebook and
YouTube and stuff

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.690
like that where somebody's
in dire need and nobody

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.430
wants to help.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.990
I actually very
fortunately have never

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.550
experienced anything like that.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.830
But this next video
is some surfing

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.167
from the big waves
of southern Alberta,

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:46.750
as well as some of
the stuff that J.R.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.086
And I filmed in Brazil.

00:36:50.086 --> 00:36:52.082
[BEGIN PLAYBACK]

00:36:55.076 --> 00:36:59.567
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.420
-I'm heading back.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.810
I sure hope those
boards hold me.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.816
-You look like Shakira.

00:37:33.816 --> 00:37:36.980
-I haven't missed
out on anything.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.730
-By far today has been
the most beautiful day.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.053
We're just walking into
the rainforest right now.

00:37:45.053 --> 00:37:46.466
It's a bit of a hike.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.490
Pretty much just itching
to go in the water.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.750
It's been decided that it's best
that I not go out there, even

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.860
with the life jacket.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.940
Pretty bummed out right
now, to say the very least.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:07.230
But that's not to say that
I can't do it tomorrow.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:21.600
Anything I do, I want
to do it to the max.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.580
I want to do it the
best as I possibly can.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.240
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:32.270
So moving forward, the whole
concept of traveling on my own

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.650
in this capacity,
going backpacking

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:40.380
through Brazil or
Australia or Europe,

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.462
I've been able to
do that and more.

00:38:43.462 --> 00:38:44.670
I've hit five continents now.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.461
The only two continents
that I haven't done

00:38:46.461 --> 00:38:48.310
are Africa and Antarctica.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.740
And I plan on
crossing those two off

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.537
as quickly as I possibly can.

00:38:52.537 --> 00:38:54.120
And a lot of those
trips I've actually

00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:00.104
done solo or with people kind
of joining me from time to time.

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.520
Or if I do travel
with somebody, I

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.170
make sure I take care of
all the stuff on my own.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:11.960
As far as the idea for a travel
show, that's very much alive.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.060
And I can't go into great
detail, but we're very, very,

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.909
very close with a network, which
unfortunately I cannot name.

00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:22.700
But we've been filming
over the last couple

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.270
of weeks with this travel show.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:30.960
So Ally and I, as well as a
few of my good friends, J.R.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.080
being one of those
friends who helped

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.051
build this whole
concept of "If I Can."

00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:43.070
This is from mud run I
did on Monday, in Tracy,

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.450
so I guess would be about
an hour east of here.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.970
And it was a lot
of fun, actually.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.610
I'd never done a mud run before.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.146
And Ally had done one before.

00:39:53.146 --> 00:39:54.520
We just had a lot
of fun with it.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.740
We just tried to do as
many of the obstacles

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.260
as we possibly could.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.860
And I was actually-- not
necessarily surprised

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.270
but very excited about
how many of the obstacles

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.370
I was able to do without
really any assistance.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:11.570
And I figured I'd ham it
up with the commando crawl

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.530
through the mud, which was
actually easier than hopping.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.370
Because when I'd hop
in the mud, my leg

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.869
would just sink far
down in the mud.

00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:20.790
So a commando crawl was
actually way easier.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.130
And when I came
off the top there,

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.110
I decided to do a belly
flop into the mud.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.514
Ally's shielding herself.

00:40:29.514 --> 00:40:31.180
But yeah, we've done
a bunch of filming.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.638
Actually, one of
the amazing things

00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:39.650
that we did as part
of the filming is we

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.110
hiked five miles
up to the Bridge

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.960
to Nowhere to go bungee jumping.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.860
But I'll talk about
that a little bit later.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:53.300
Some things that I've learned
in life, both from people

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.772
that I've encountered and
mentors and people that I've

00:40:55.772 --> 00:40:57.230
idolized in my life
and just things

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.999
I've come to the
realization on my own--

00:40:58.999 --> 00:41:01.540
if you worry about how you look,
you're cheating yourself out

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.450
of opportunity.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.530
That one is a Chris Koch quote.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.860
I should put that
underneath there.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.550
I know I look different.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.700
I get stared at
every single day.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.675
But I'm comfortable
in my own skin.

00:41:15.675 --> 00:41:17.166
I don't care that people stare.

00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:18.790
I don't care that
people ask questions.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.320
I would be more than
happy-- I am more than

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.690
happy-- to answer as many
questions as people have,

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.440
take the time to answer
a couple questions

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.150
and give them the right
answer than for them to make

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.560
the incorrect assumption.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.812
Make the incorrect assumption
that Ally is my helper and not

00:41:37.812 --> 00:41:39.770
my girlfriend, or make
the incorrect assumption

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.680
that life's been
really difficult

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.290
and life's pretty miserable for
a guy without arms and legs.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:46.540
No, life's great.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.970
And I have a lot of fun with it.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.140
And staring is a lot of fun too.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.480
And a lot of people
that I hang around with,

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.300
friends and family-- they get
actually way more aggravated

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.360
with the staring than I do.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.150
I like to have fun with it.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:07.620
And in North America
especially, different cultures

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.300
approach staring differently.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.990
North Americans try
to be very discreet.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.950
So if I'm longboarding down
the sidewalk and somebody's

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:18.470
walking towards me,
they'll be looking forward.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.321
This is them walking.

00:42:20.321 --> 00:42:21.820
And they'll be
looking forward but I

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.250
can see them look out of
the corner of their eye

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.610
as I get a little bit closer,
and then they're looking.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.580
And I know when I see that,
that once we cross paths

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.310
and I turn around, I'm going to
catch them doing a double take.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.901
And then they do this one.

00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:36.400
Really?

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.810
You were staring up
there at nothing?

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:39.735
No.

00:42:39.735 --> 00:42:42.310
I caught ya.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:43.744
But it's a lot of fun.

00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:47.400
And kids-- kids are the best.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.270
They have no filters.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.000
And they just ask
what's on their mind.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.530
And they come up and they'll
stand right in front of you

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.190
and just stare.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.780
And one of my favorite things to
do when I worked at the airport

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.560
in Calgary is the
check-in kiosks.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.500
I would be standing
upfront helping people

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.890
with those sometimes.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.730
And a kid would walk
by with their family.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.730
And they'd pull on
Mum or Dad's sleeve,

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.190
and-- Mum, Dad,
look at that guy.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.770
He's got no arms and legs.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.480
And before they
would turn around,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.037
I would hide behind one
of the check-in kiosks.

00:43:22.037 --> 00:43:23.370
And there would be nobody there.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.810
They're thinking, my
kid is losing his mind.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.250
I would eventually go
and make myself visible

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.500
and let them in on the joke.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.470
But it's fun to have
fun with that one.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.550
But once again, if you
can't laugh at life,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.630
what can you laugh at?

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.300
This picture here--
actually a while ago,

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:55.010
I had an amazing photographer
in to do a talk here at Google.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:58.660
His name's Ben Wong or
Von Wong if any of you

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.920
had a chance to come and see
him, or check out the talks

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.300
at Google and Von Wong.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.450
He's an amazing photographer
and a good friend,

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.290
a mutual good friend of ours.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.977
And now his
girlfriend, Anna Tenne,

00:44:10.977 --> 00:44:12.810
she took a lot of these
pictures that you're

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:13.970
going to see up here.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:16.780
This picture was in a
little village in Cambodia

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.180
this past winter, just
behind Angkor Wat.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.710
And we went to this
little village.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:26.580
And when we first
got there, kids

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.710
didn't know what
to think about me.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:32.470
They were pretty apprehensive,
keeping their distance.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.930
And then I'd let them play on
the longboard for a little bit.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:38.751
And then I got in there and
I played on the longboard

00:44:38.751 --> 00:44:39.250
with them.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.760
And then, I'm going to say it
wasn't much more than three

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.690
or four minutes
after we got there

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.990
that this photo was taken.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.680
When I walk around,
wander around,

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:56.020
stroll around,
whatever-- and I'm

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.680
very self conscious
about how I look

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.554
and the fact that I have
no arms and no legs,

00:44:59.554 --> 00:45:02.000
people are going to pick
up on that insecurity.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.020
And they're going to be
insecure about it too.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.120
If I just go through life
not worrying about it, which

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.440
I don't, and treat
myself and deliver myself

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.950
as just like any
other person, they're

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:17.250
going to pick up on that.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:19.276
And so when I first
got there, these kids

00:45:19.276 --> 00:45:20.400
were very nervous about me.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.310
And five minutes
later, I guarantee you

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.870
they had no clue that they
were playing with this guy

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.630
without arms and legs
on the skateboard.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:31.460
And it's so amazingly
quick how fast it happens,

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.680
how fast the transition
happens from, I'm not

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.360
too sure about this guy,
to, this guy's awesome.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.840
I might be pumping my
own tire on that one.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.830
And the good sense of humor
has done very, very well

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:46.900
for me in that.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.870
I joke around and tell
people that I have

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:52.052
a very disarming personality.

00:45:52.052 --> 00:45:53.176
Yeah, you have fun with it.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.440
You get into life
what you put into it.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.550
These photos again taken
by the amazing Anna Tenne.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:05.625
These were in Nepal.

00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:09.750
I had the opportunity to
speak with some refugees that

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.140
were in Nepal.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:16.200
And surprisingly, hardly
any of them if any of them

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.135
had ever been on a
longboard before.

00:46:18.135 --> 00:46:20.010
And surprisingly and
thankfully, none of them

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.650
broke any limbs doing that.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.952
I have low center of gravity
on my side, so it's easy for me

00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:25.910
to stay on a longboard.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.350
When you're six foot
two, not so much.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.101
You get out of life
what you put into it.

00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:33.100
You put out positivity,
you will get positivity.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.960
You put on negativity,
you'll get negativity.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.190
And the best way I can
really bring this point home

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:45.340
is my trip to Europe that I
took about three years ago now.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.590
It was three months in Europe.

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.920
It was the first time I'd
ever done a trip completely

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.170
solo and on my longboard for
that extended period of time.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.360
And I had no itinerary.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.540
It was three months.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.440
Beyond that, I was
just winging it.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.869
And my mom thought it
was a horrible idea.

00:47:01.869 --> 00:47:04.160
She figured for sure something
bad was going to happen.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.030
I told her, everything's
going to be fine.

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.570
Nothing's going to happen.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.950
And then when I had
eight hours on the plane

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.460
to think about this adventure
I was about to embark on,

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.660
I got to thinking, you
know, Mum might be right.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.060
This could go horribly wrong.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.550
I thought, OK
well, maybe it does

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.100
but at least I'm putting
myself out there and trying.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.308
But I was playing through
all the different scenarios

00:47:25.308 --> 00:47:26.410
as to what might happen.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:30.570
And the thing that played
over and over again in my mind

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:36.080
as to the most likely, was
people would try to rob me.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.570
I thought, I would be the
ideal person to mug or to rob.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:49.725
I mean, I'm unarmed. [CHUCKLES]
I tell that one and-- I don't

00:47:49.725 --> 00:47:52.225
know if people are not too sure
if they're supposed to laugh

00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:53.290
or if they don't get it.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.180
But eventually, they get it,
and OK, that's pretty clever.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.640
Anyhow, if you do steal
my money-- I mean,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.710
I got no legs, so it's
a pretty easy getaway.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.130
But the absolute
opposite happened

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.540
when I was over in Europe.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.930
People were literally tracking
me down and chasing me down

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.430
in the streets, trying
to give me money.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.470
I'd be longboarding from
Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.419
Square or from the Louvre
to the Eiffel Tower,

00:48:15.419 --> 00:48:17.460
and people would be chasing
me down-- here, here,

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.543
can I give you this money?

00:48:18.543 --> 00:48:19.120
No, it's OK.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.570
I don't need the money.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.760
I'm travelling.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.350
I'm good, which was a huge lie.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.780
I was traveling and I
really needed that money.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.320
But OK, I'm not going
to take the money.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.210
After about the third insistence
that I take this money,

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.050
I'd say, OK, fine,
thank you very much.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.020
You're far too kind.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.290
You didn't have to--
all those things

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.860
I was able to say in about three
or four different languages.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.940
And in my three months
traveling around Europe,

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.560
I was given, easily, over $400.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.790
And I firmly believe that the
reason why I was given money

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.520
instead of being robbed
was I'm out there

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.280
and I'm just having fun living
life, a smile on my face.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.600
I say hi to everybody.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.670
I acknowledge everybody
that passes by,

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.180
laughing, having fun.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.460
And they pick up on that.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.310
They're not going to
try and harm somebody

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.590
that's got lots of confidence
and is happy and comfortable

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.090
in their own skin.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.190
And they want to--
if anything, they're

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.122
trying to reward
that positivity.

00:49:16.122 --> 00:49:16.705
You know what?

00:49:16.705 --> 00:49:18.038
You just put a smile on my face.

00:49:18.038 --> 00:49:20.917
I want to give you
something back.

00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:22.750
Sometimes it's a hug
that they give me back.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.280
Sometimes it's a kiss.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.010
Sometimes it's money.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.910
Sometimes it's some odd things.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.140
But anyways, it was amazing.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.120
It is so incredibly amazing.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.850
And I'm just going to tell
one quick, funny story.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:41.990
When I was in Europe,
Paris, got into Paris.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.209
I took the bus from
London to Paris.

00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:46.250
And yes, I know the English
Channel's in the way.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:50.890
But I took the ferry
from Dover to Calais.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.910
Anyways, when we got into Paris,
it was very late at night.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.770
I didn't have any
cash, any euro on me.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.500
All I had was British pounds.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.230
And I couldn't find a cash
machine at the bus depot.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.520
So I got into a
taxi and was trying

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.839
to convey to the taxi driver
that I didn't have any cash.

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:08.880
Could I pay with my Visa?

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.180
He said, no Visa.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.480
And he took me my hostel
and said, don't worry.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.662
It free-- gratuit.

00:50:17.662 --> 00:50:18.370
That was awesome.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.200
Thank you so much.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:19.950
I really appreciate that.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.760
I got to my hostel.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.080
And the hostel also
wouldn't accept my Visa.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.530
They wanted cash.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.330
And they said we'll let you
stay here tonight and just get

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.330
the cash in the morning.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:30.370
It's one o'clock in the morning.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.411
You're in downtown Paris.

00:50:31.411 --> 00:50:34.570
We're not going to expect you to
go around trying to find cash.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.750
I also hadn't had any
food for quite a while

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.520
and I was thirsty.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.710
So I was sick and tired
of not having cash.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.450
So I decided, I'm going to go
out and find a cash machine.

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:48.251
So, one o'clock in the morning,
I'm longboarding around Paris,

00:50:48.251 --> 00:50:49.500
trying to find a cash machine.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.170
I finally find one,
but it was too high.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.610
I couldn't reach it.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.640
In downtown Paris, one
o'clock in the morning,

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.200
I was kind of
surveying the scene,

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.540
and people are walking by.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.260
But I just couldn't
bring myself to trust

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.140
that if I pull over
a random stranger

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:10.450
and say, OK, sir or ma'am,
I'm going to give you my Visa.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.550
And I'm going to tell
you my PIN number

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.190
and trust that you're not
going to steal all of my money.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.630
Couldn't bring
myself to do that.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:23.950
But I noticed, just a couple
doors down, there was a bistro.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:28.310
It was closed, but they had all
the chairs and tables outside.

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:32.126
So I went over and
I grabbed a chair.

00:51:32.126 --> 00:51:33.375
And I'm carrying it like this.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.860
And there's a person inside
of the restaurant cleaning up

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.500
after they had closed.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.510
And the back rest of the
chair was blocking me,

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:49.510
so all he could see was
this chair floating along.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.280
And so he came running outside
trying to figure out why

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.050
his chairs were floating away.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.892
And by this time, I'd had
the chair set up at the cash

00:51:56.892 --> 00:51:58.100
machine pulling out my money.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.975
But there's a lot of really
good stories that I could tell.

00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:04.100
I could go on and on and
on with stories like that.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.070
But it's been an amazing
ride and a lot of fun.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.800
And you know, these
bad things fortunately

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.130
have not happened to me
because of, in my opinion--

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.820
and I feel very
strongly about this--

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.290
the positive energy you
put out comes back to you.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.105
And a lot of times, it
comes back to you tenfold.

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.716
The core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:36.960
And I also say that be more
afraid of regret than failure.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.350
Now, experiences can
mean a lot of things

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.600
for a lot of different people.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.380
And I've taken this from the
movie/book "Into the Wild."

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.280
It wasn't the
happiest of endings,

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.300
but the premise of
what he was doing I

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.690
really agree with, but just
getting out there and living

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.200
life as much as
he possibly could,

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.940
crossing off as many
items off his bucket list

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.820
as he possibly could.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:08.040
For me, traveling
is the experience

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:13.270
that I love-- adventure,
the whole adrenaline.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:17.300
That's something that
really matters most to me.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.260
Ally, she's not a big
adrenaline junkie.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:27.050
So the other day, as part of
this pilot that we're filming,

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:32.260
we hiked up to the
Bridge to Nowhere.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:36.220
It was a five mile hike up
and a five mile hike back.

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.490
And I had just gotten
new artificial legs,

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.410
because I wanted to
get these legs going.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.920
Because while I
was in Nepal-- I'm

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.017
kind of mixing two stories
here into one-- when

00:53:47.017 --> 00:53:48.600
I was in Nepal this
winter, we went up

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.170
to Namche Bazaar, which
is a quarter of the way up

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:52.830
to Mount Everest.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.480
And I thought, if I got a
set of legs going again,

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.470
I'd be able to do this trek
the whole way, all the way up

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.240
to Mount Everest.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.570
And so the plan is-- so I've
got these legs going now,

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.670
and the plan is to trek all
the way to Mount Everest base

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:07.910
camp as part of a fundraiser.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:10.120
And I'm hoping do that.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.800
If we can't have it ready to
go for the second half of May,

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.120
we'll be looking at doing
this in the end of August.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:25.090
And so we were, in filming this
pilot, we had these legs going.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.360
And it was kind of like
the second or third time

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.330
that I had worn legs and
walked in like four years--

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.900
maybe bit off a little
more could chew.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:39.180
But we walked, or I walked
the first mile or so.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.370
And then the legs
weren't working.

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:45.570
So we had to kind
of bail on the legs.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:51.110
And between my buddies
JR, Muldoon, and Stevie,

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:55.180
they threw me on their backs
and helped me up to the bridge.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:03.800
And I was actually feeling
incredibly defeated,

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.840
because I want things
to go perfectly.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.200
And I'm not going to lie to you.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.600
I was POed.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.540
And I was, you know,
what's the point, this

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:14.980
is- what a waste of time.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:20.400
These legs are-- I had other
words that I was using.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:26.610
And Ally was very, very good
to just calm down and be like,

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.830
hey, look at your own motto.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:31.750
And sometimes you lose
sight of what you're doing.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.000
And you just get too
caught up in the moment.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.880
And I took it as failure.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.997
And Ally pointed out
like, first of all,

00:55:38.997 --> 00:55:40.580
how the legs were
going the first time

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.620
and how they're going
right now, you're

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.020
actually doing way better.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.100
You just walked almost a mile.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.690
So don't be too
hard on yourself.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:51.880
And this is part of a process.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.140
I'm going back to the drawing
board with these legs.

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.590
And we'll get it figured out.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:58.990
And we are going to get
to the Everest base camp.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.934
There's no doubt in my
mind that we are going

00:56:01.934 --> 00:56:03.100
to get to Everest base camp.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:07.449
I will not stop until I do it.

00:56:07.449 --> 00:56:09.240
There's going to be
some bumps in the road.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.380
But this back to
experience, experience

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.430
means something
different for everyone.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:19.140
An event that happens-- everyone
experiences it differently.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:23.150
As far as the bungee
jumping was concerned,

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.820
I experienced the potential
of going bungee jumping

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.370
much differently than Ally did.

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:33.230
Ally, she's not an
adrenaline person.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:35.210
But she got up there.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:36.730
She did the hike.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.430
I didn't even do the hike.

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:40.630
My buddies had to
piggyback me up there.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.390
She did the hike in and out.

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:46.880
But she got herself
to a point where

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.380
she realized, you know, I don't
need to do this bungee jump.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.950
I'm OK with not jumping off
a perfectly good bridge.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:54.940
Can't say as I blame her.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.437
And she was at peace with that.

00:56:56.437 --> 00:56:58.020
That experience was
different for her.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.670
And when I'm talking about
the core of man's spirit

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:05.760
being-- the core of
man's spirit comes

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.330
from new experiences, travel
and adventure-- whatever

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:13.150
is what that means for me.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.180
That's how I get
my satisfaction.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:20.520
For you, it might be painting
or music or trying out

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.640
new restaurants or
cooking or whatever.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.330
The point of this is, don't
get complacent in life.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.000
Keep enriching
your lives with as

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.780
many different and
new experiences

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.190
as you possibly can.

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:36.670
We get in our comfort zone and
we forget to challenge ourself

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:37.910
and test ourselves.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:41.100
And we forget to remind
ourselves just how resilient

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:48.610
and how incredibly capable
we are of such great things.

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:56.790
And failure is only failure
if you treat it as that.

00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:59.730
I'm way more afraid of
regret than I am of failure.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:05.570
I do not want to look at my
life and look back and say,

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:06.820
I wish I would have done this.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.510
I wish I would have done that.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:11.500
I was ready to just quit
on the legs altogether.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.650
And if I would
have done that, I'd

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:15.630
be regretting that for
the rest of my life.

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:19.820
And luckily, I have
amazing people around me

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.630
to help keep that in check.

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:24.840
And we all have amazing
people around us

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.090
to help keep us in check.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.340
And we got to
remember to make sure

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:30.835
we feed off those resources.

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.637
That, by the way,
another picture by Anna.

00:58:35.637 --> 00:58:37.720
That's Mount Everest and
that's as close as we got

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.260
to Everest here in February.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.820
I'm hoping to have--
no, I'm not hoping.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:45.725
I will have another
picture where

00:58:45.725 --> 00:58:50.480
we're right at the base of
that great big mountain.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.330
We-- will have-- Stevie,
Ally, Muldoon, JR,

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:59.457
myself, and anybody
else that wants to join.

00:58:59.457 --> 00:59:01.290
So if anybody wants to
come to Nepal with us

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:03.800
and raise some money-- so
the fundraiser I want to do

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.990
is for the Child Amputee Program
in Canada, an organization

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.700
that I benefited
from a great deal.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.990
They help child amputees
throughout the country

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:17.470
with funding for limbs,
post-secondary education.

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.690
And it's also just an
amazing support group.

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.440
The other half of the
money that I raise I

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.460
want to contribute to
the people of Nepal,

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.492
specifically people with
disabilities in Nepal.

00:59:26.492 --> 00:59:27.950
When I was over
there, I was seeing

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:33.160
a lot of instances
where they're not

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.770
getting the same level of
assistance, and in some cases

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.730
not even close to the
same level of assistance,

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:44.350
as we enjoy in North America
as Canadians and Americans.

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:47.892
So that is my goal
and I will achieve it.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:54.887
This next video is one that
Von Wong did with Anna and I

00:59:54.887 --> 00:59:56.370
on our trip in Cambodia.

00:59:56.370 --> 01:00:00.490
And I figured I'd share that
with you before I wrap up.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.020
[BEGIN PLAYBACK]

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.940
-It's always nice to share a
experience with someone else.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:09.289
But Chris more than anyone else,
you never know what to expect.

01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:11.330
You never know how people
are going to treat him.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:13.870
I like it because I
get completely ignored.

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.620
Everyone's looking at
Chris, so I can just

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.310
watch the interaction.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:20.210
And I really love that.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.100
-When I was young, I would
actually always look at maps,

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.391
thinking, I'd love to go
there or I'd love to go there.

01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:27.740
I guess I never really
did a whole lot about it.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.000
I found excuses to not
do it, whether it be,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.500
I have work I've
got to worry about,

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.490
money I got to worry about.

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:36.160
And finally I was
just like, screw it.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.260
Went out and booked the
ticket and said to myself,

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.560
you got four months to
make this trip happen.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.010
-It would be ideal to generate
some income while traveling.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.020
But I feel so lucky that
I can do what I love,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.410
which is travel and
photography at the same time,

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:52.058
I'm helping Chris
make a difference.

01:00:52.058 --> 01:00:54.328
He's really impacting a
lot of people's lives.

01:00:54.328 --> 01:00:58.410
And people realize that
if he can, they can.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:00.630
-What drives me
is the opportunity

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.830
to meet a lot of people as
well as get to share my story

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.200
and hopefully encourage
others to live

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.050
life a little more full, get
out and travel or get out and do

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.496
something that they've
always dreamt of doing,

01:01:14.496 --> 01:01:16.950
but have always made
excuses for themselves.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.700
I was one of those people.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:23.290
I wanted to travel, but
I just kind of figured,

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.290
it's going to be tough
without arms and legs.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.972
I was like, you know what?

01:01:27.972 --> 01:01:29.930
Just figure that out and
just go out and do it.

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.540
If somebody wants to
travel bad enough,

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.540
they can make it happen.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.130
And that goes with
anything in life.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.270
If you want to do
something bad enough,

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.210
if you want it bad enough,
you will find a way to do it,

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:45.930
to go above and beyond what you
need to do to make it happen.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:51.040
And the ability for human
beings to do whatever they want

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.820
is absolutely there.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.670
They just need to
realize that and do it.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.530
I read somewhere that
dreams never die.

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.940
People just give up
them too quickly.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.760
[END PLAYBACK]

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.245
People say that
you only live once.

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:13.620
I tend to disagree
with that one.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.810
I think you only die once.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:19.350
When you woke up on the
morning of January 1 of 2015,

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:22.770
you were given 365
opportunities to live life

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:25.770
to the absolute most,
to the absolute maximum.

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.120
And I encourage everybody
to do just that.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.410
Each day is a gift.

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:31.510
Treat it as that and
make the most of it.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:35.500
If today's not going so great,
you have the rest of today

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.800
to make up for it.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.060
And just enjoy life.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.430
It's a precious gift.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.560
And we're all here to
have fun and enjoy it.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.800
So if I can do all
these things, you guys

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.380
are capable of absolutely,
absolutely anything.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.720
I do do the social media.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.150
If I Can, www.IfICan.ca
is my website.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:04.460
There's links to my
Twitter and my Instagram.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.790
I don't do Snapchat,
because Snapchat is selfies.

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:13.357
And with my phone, I have to
hold my phone up and press

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:14.440
the button with my tongue.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.989
So all my selfies just
end up me taking a picture

01:03:19.989 --> 01:03:21.030
of the bridge of my nose.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:26.420
Check me out at Google.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:26.920
Cross-eyed.

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:32.260
And then I also have Facebook.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.680
And I have these social
media sites, pages,

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.169
whatever you call them.

01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:41.460
Every Monday, I try do a
Motivational Monday, something

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.720
that I'm up to or something that
somebody else that I know of

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.480
or I've seen that is doing some
incredible stuff to start off

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.980
the week on a high note.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.020
And then on Fridays, I try to do
a Friday Funny, just something

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.170
to give people a good laugh
to finish off the week

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.840
and start off the weekend.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.860
I've got all kinds
of corny ones.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.060
I want to do a
meme of me in front

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.750
of, like, a palm
reader with a quotation

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:08.280
like, I'm a little skeptical.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.750
That's kind of the-- a
lot of very similar vein.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:14.410
But guys, I want to
thank you so very much.

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:18.060
And Facebook-- sorry--
is Chris Koch, If I Can.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.090
Chris Koch is just
my personal one.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.680
That's all family and friends.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.950
Chris Koch If I Can is I update
everything that I'm up to.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:26.820
But I want to thank
you guys so very much.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.778
I want to thank Google.

01:04:27.778 --> 01:04:30.390
I want to thank Akshay for
making this all possible

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.640
and putting this all together.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.270
And I want to thank
everybody here

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.590
in the audience, as well
as watching, streaming

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:39.140
from their desks for joining.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.522
Please keep in contact.

01:04:40.522 --> 01:04:42.230
I love to hear some
of the amazing things

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:43.290
that you guys are up to.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.770
So thank you again.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.420
And if I can, anybody can.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.752
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.952
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Chris.

01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:56.410
You said you worked
for an airline.

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:58.045
Have you ever tried
flying an airplane?

01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:00.340
CHRIS KOCH: I have never
tried flying an airplane

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.430
and it's something that I
would really love to try out.

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:04.740
I love aviation.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.720
I'm a plane geek.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.860
I used to work at an air museum
in my hometown of Nanton,

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.250
Lancaster Museum.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.560
And working for
the airline-- one

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.400
of the big reasons I
got in with an airline

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.229
is because of my
love for planes.

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:19.020
So it's something that
I want to look into.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:19.811
I got a good buddy.

01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:21.900
He's missing his hand.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.740
And he flies for
Air Canada Jazz.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.240
And he's one of those people
that I look up to and admire.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.120
And he's got one hand and
he's flying commercially.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.723
I don't know if the passengers
would like to know that.

01:05:33.723 --> 01:05:36.894
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:36.894 --> 01:05:38.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:42.090
When you travel cross country,
there hasn't been ever any need

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.190
for fingerprinting or--

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.490
CHRIS KOCH: Fingerprint, yeah.

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:47.800
Like, your NEXUS pass?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.800
AUDIENCE: Like visa or
whenever you enter a country,

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.140
they print you.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.960
CHRIS KOCH: Yeah, no, I
haven't had any issues

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.940
with needing to
do fingerprinting.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.470
Like when I had a pass so
I could go through security

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:04.070
or bypass security, sorry,
when I worked at the airline,

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:06.490
I did the retina scan.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:11.050
But as far as fingerprinting,
I haven't had to do that.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.560
And I always find it
funny-- it would be awesome

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.590
if I, like, robbed
a bank or something

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:18.110
and they dust for fingerprints.

01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:20.190
It appears that the
perpetrator robbed

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.790
the bank with his elbows.

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.380
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chris.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.970
I'm wondering what you do-- I
love your attitude towards life

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.530
and how you exude positivity.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.970
How do you do that when
you're not at your best?

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.470
I know you mentioned
you had friends

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:37.170
that kind of helped carry you.

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:43.170
And mentally, do you do anything
daily to keep yourself going,

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.040
anything like that?

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.100
CHRIS KOCH: Yeah.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:52.870
A practice that Ally and
I have done every morning

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.370
is just checking
in with one another

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:58.290
and reminding one another of how
lucky are to have one another

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:03.300
and how lucky we are to have
the opportunities that we have.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.650
And before then,
it was just looking

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:09.970
at all the incredible
opportunities that I have

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:12.250
and how much I love
people, how much I

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.430
love my family-- my
nieces, my nephews.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.702
And when I'm in that funk,
I kick myself out of that

01:07:17.702 --> 01:07:20.220
as quickly as I
can, because there's

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.270
the line from "The
Shawshank Redemption"--

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:25.540
get busy living get busy dying.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.370
And there's so many
things out there

01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.840
that I would regret so
much for not experiencing

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.310
if I just sat at home
and felt sorry for myself

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.790
and threw that pity party.

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:39.160
So I'm able to kick myself out
of that as quickly as I can,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.300
whether it be just getting
out and going for a longboard,

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.350
getting some fresh air, spending
time with my girlfriend,

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:48.400
spending time with my
nephews and my niece, family,

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.460
people that make me laugh, even
something as simple as throwing

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.252
in a movie-- a good
Jim Carrey movie.

01:07:53.252 --> 01:07:54.710
That'll turn a
person's day around.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:55.779
Put in "Yes Man."

01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:56.320
There you go.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.000
AUDIENCE: You've
shown us surfing thing

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.790
and you've done all kinds
of courses and hiking

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.680
in everything, talked
about bungee jumping.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.786
What's next for you?

01:08:05.786 --> 01:08:08.240
CHRIS KOCH: What's next for me?

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.857
The sky's the limit.

01:08:09.857 --> 01:08:10.690
Anything's possible.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:11.773
There's all those cliches.

01:08:11.773 --> 01:08:14.940
I'm pretty much
game for anything.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.689
Yes, skydiving is something
that I would love to do.

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:19.779
I'd love to do a big long kayak.

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:23.729
Mount Everest base
camp is something

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:25.380
that is very much on the list.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:29.800
And getting these legs
up and running-- Ally

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:34.550
and I are planning on doing
a lot of just little treks

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:36.460
and then just build it
up bigger and bigger

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:41.359
so we're ready for when the
time comes to do base camp.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:44.300
AUDIENCE: I've actually
been a long-term skydiver.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.660
And I broke my neck skydiving
and came back from that.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.493
And I'm coming back
from ankle injuries now,

01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:50.310
and I kayak open ocean.

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:51.994
So it's entirely possible.

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.660
You're welcome to
join me in either one,

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.810
the Golden Rangers at
Fort Knox, I think it is,

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.540
are going to take
me skydiving again.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.640
CHRIS KOCH: I'm all ears.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.904
Absolutely all ears.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.529
MALE SPEAKER: Your
girlfriend, it says,

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:05.189
what are your
experiences in dealing

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:06.910
with others as they
interact with Chris,

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.394
both good and the bad?

01:09:10.394 --> 01:09:13.550
AUDIENCE: I guess he
kind of touched on it.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.960
It's interesting to watch
people's interpretation

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.260
of our relationship and their
reaction to my standing aside.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.713
Like, I'll get a lot of
looks of like, [WHISPERS]

01:09:22.713 --> 01:09:25.520
I can't believe he would
just let him struggle.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.532
But I know that if
I step in, there's

01:09:27.532 --> 01:09:28.990
no need for me to
step in for that.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:32.270
So, just an interesting
thing to watch.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.899
But I think when we
first started dating too,

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.500
I had some interesting reactions
of people when they found out

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.930
that we were dating.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:42.490
I had people
actually start crying

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:45.486
and just-- that's so amazing.

01:09:45.486 --> 01:09:47.069
CHRIS KOCH: I thought
they were crying

01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:50.670
because they had dated me.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:52.040
You sure?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.590
AUDIENCE: It's been
really interesting.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.750
It's a very, very
different perspective.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:03.130
Anna even talked about it,
being able to sit back and just

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.650
watch.

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.050
It's been really neat.

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:10.074
AUDIENCE: So how was it in
middle school and high school?

01:10:10.074 --> 01:10:11.240
I mean, is there any advice?

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.430
Because there's kids that try
to stand out, be different,

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:18.510
and some that they just
plain are different.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:21.740
And they get bullied and
teased in the younger years,

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.890
in elementary and middle
school especially.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:27.134
So how was that experience
for you growing up,

01:10:27.134 --> 01:10:28.050
probably a small town.

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:31.447
But what advice would
you give for those kids

01:10:31.447 --> 01:10:32.155
that do struggle?

01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:33.510
CHRIS KOCH: Yeah, you're right.

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:35.710
I did have the luxury of
growing up in a small town where

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:36.460
everybody knew me.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:42.110
Everybody was familiar
with my situation.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.517
But I was always-- like
I said in that video,

01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:49.600
there's a lot of times
where I didn't even realize

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.047
I was missing arms and legs.

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:52.880
I've always been
comfortable in my own skin.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.610
I was never treated like a
kid without arms and legs.

01:10:57.610 --> 01:11:00.050
So I never felt as such.

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:02.330
And it's all about confidence.

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:07.640
And that's a really
tough thing to learn.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:14.360
And especially middle
school and into high school,

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.450
I honestly think it's
getting tougher and tougher

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:24.340
as time passes for kids in
that age bracket growing up.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:28.360
There's online bullying and
everything is so instant.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.630
You do one thing and it
is magnified instantly.

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:42.490
And also, society too-- not
to make fun of specific shows,

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:44.730
but there are shows out
there where they deliberately

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:53.140
have people in auditions
that are not good performers,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.100
parade them in
front of everybody

01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.140
just for the purpose
of ridiculing them

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.770
and putting them down.

01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:07.270
No wonder people are so happy
to bully and write stuff

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:11.610
online about so and so.

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:14.550
My advice-- I guess it's really
tough, because I was never

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.960
really bullied.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.470
For bullies, stop.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:20.090
It's not cool.

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:27.400
You are hurting people a
lot more than you think.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.850
You might come across
as just fun razzing.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:32.990
But some of that stuff
cuts really deep.

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:36.950
And you catch person
on that wrong day-- you

01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:40.590
were saying for me if
I'm having a bad day--

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:41.840
and this happened a while ago.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.800
I was having kind of a bad day.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.480
I went out to the
promenade in Santa Monica

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.720
and getting energy of people.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.520
And there was a
couple kids passed by

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.270
and they jumped back and
like, oh, look at that freak.

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.120
And I thought, really?

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.060
Today?

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.320
Really not having a good day
and you had to do this today?

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.900
Normally, I wouldn't
even notice that.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.860
But that particular day,
I was not feeling it.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.051
And it cut a little bit deeper.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.550
Actually, there's a lot of times
where that stuff might even

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.050
happen.

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:15.690
And Ally might notice it but
I'm completely oblivious.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:18.120
Because I'm too busy looking
at all the positive things

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.840
that are out there.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.660
So I guess my advice to
people who are getting

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.590
bullied-- don't let it happen.

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:27.750
Tell somebody.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.290
Do not just allow
yourself to suffer alone.

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:38.670
And within yourself,
celebrate your positives.

01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:40.320
Celebrate your strengths.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.760
And don't worry about
your perceived weaknesses,

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760
because a lot of times
your perceived weaknesses

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.880
are ones that you are
seeing within yourself.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.820
And that, what you're feeling,
you're putting out there

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.840
and people are
picking up on that.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.259
If you're out there, you're
having fun and enjoying life,

01:13:57.259 --> 01:13:59.300
people aren't seeing a
guy without arms and legs.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.150
They're just seeing a guy
that's out there enjoying life.

01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:02.858
They're not seeing a
person with big ears

01:14:02.858 --> 01:14:04.572
or a big nose or
overweight or whatever.

01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:06.030
They're just seeing
a person that's

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:07.350
out there with a big smile.

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:11.100
And that smile is
incredibly contagious.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.949
That's a very long answer.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.490
MALE SPEAKER: It
says, other than not

01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:18.690
watching the Toronto Maple Leafs
play, that was the end of that.

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:20.735
CHRIS KOCH: I'm a
Calgary Flames fan.

01:14:20.735 --> 01:14:24.150
And I was making fun
of Maple Leafs fans

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:28.170
at a presentation I was
doing just outside Toronto.

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:33.060
Because the way the
place was set up,

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.407
it was just all chairs
sitting on the floor.

01:14:35.407 --> 01:14:36.990
So the people in
back couldn't see me,

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.870
because I'm not very tall.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.550
And I told them, I'm not
the tallest presenter

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:40.120
you've ever had.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.411
I might not even be the best
presenter you've ever had.

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:43.940
But in a room full
of Leafs fans,

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.390
you're used to being let down.

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:47.680
And then two days later,
the Leafs played the flames

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.690
and the Leafs won, so
I was eating my words.

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:52.066
I don't make those
jokes anymore.

01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:53.773
MALE SPEAKER: And then
there are a couple

01:14:53.773 --> 01:14:55.210
of technology-related questions.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:58.380
One is, what, if any, Google
products-- YouTube, Gmail,

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.680
Google Maps, do you
use, and can you

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.541
tell us about your
experience using them?

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:06.950
CHRIS KOCH: I use Google
Maps all the time.

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:08.500
I do have Gmail.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.905
Aw, I completely forgot.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.280
I was going to, at the very
beginning of my presentation,

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.780
say, sorry, I just have to
check my Hotmail really quickly.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.990
But I forgot to do that.

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:22.720
So yeah, I use a lot
of the Google-- Maps,

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.010
translator-- I love
Google Translate.

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:27.815
That has come in very, very
handy on numerous occasions.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:33.960
I would say, other
than Maps, Translate.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.060
Good job on Translate.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.040
Anybody here work on that?

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.222
Thank you.

01:15:40.222 --> 01:15:41.627
MALE SPEAKER: And
last question--

01:15:41.627 --> 01:15:43.710
Chris, what are some of
the toughest obstacles you

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:44.918
face in your day to day life?

01:15:44.918 --> 01:15:47.610
Can technology help to
alleviate some of them?

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.830
CHRIS KOCH: Such
simple, little things.

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:55.752
Ironing my shirt-- I once
bit my lip ironing my shirt.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.210
So obviously, I
was doing it wrong.

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:03.500
When I stay in hotels,
especially if I'm there

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.820
on my own, I don't know why.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:10.280
I think it's because when
the cleaners are in before

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.080
and they're washing
out the shower,

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.810
they turn the shower head
off, put it off to the side

01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:16.930
so the shower's not
going right on them

01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.120
and then they forget
to tip it back.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.000
So when I get in and
that shower head's

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.750
pointed against the
wall-- so I have

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.760
to shower underneath the
faucet or something like that.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.590
So, just tiny little
things-- and I mean,

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:32.680
I've used broom handles
and my skateboard,

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.620
stood up on the side of
the tub held my skateboard

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.980
and tipped the shower head
to-- where there's a will,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.410
there's a way.

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.410
You'll figure out a way.

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:41.820
I've used an ironing board
to move the shower head.

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.700
But it's way easier
to just ask Ally, hey,

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.920
do you mind moving
the shower head?

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.130
When I was traveling
with Anna in Asia,

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:52.060
I couldn't even
turn the shower on,

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.200
because all the taps
were up so high.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.400
So I would hide
in behind the door

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.350
and she would come in
with her eyes closed

01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:02.315
and turn the shower on
and then run back out

01:17:02.315 --> 01:17:05.330
and hopefully not hit the
wall and find the doorway

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:06.224
and then shower.

01:17:06.224 --> 01:17:08.390
And then when I was done,
[INAUDIBLE] she'd do that.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:11.550
So yeah, good friends
also help out.

01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:13.910
MALE SPEAKER: So, thank you
so much, Chris, for coming.

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:14.951
CHRIS KOCH: Thanks again.

01:17:14.951 --> 01:17:18.160
