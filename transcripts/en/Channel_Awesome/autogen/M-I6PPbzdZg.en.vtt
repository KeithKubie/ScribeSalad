anything like that in this review but
 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.340
anything like that in this review but
Doug did need some bigger stage pieces

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
Doug did need some bigger stage pieces
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.100
Doug did need some bigger stage pieces
he had mentioned to me initially that

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
he had mentioned to me initially that
 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.900
he had mentioned to me initially that
you were probably gonna need the basket

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910
you were probably gonna need the basket
 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.340
you were probably gonna need the basket
of a hot-air balloon

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350
of a hot-air balloon
 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.130
of a hot-air balloon
I thought that was a key element but we

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140
I thought that was a key element but we
 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.080
I thought that was a key element but we
met and showed me all the shots and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090
met and showed me all the shots and
 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.030
met and showed me all the shots and
stuff like that that he wanted in

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040
stuff like that that he wanted in
 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.980
stuff like that that he wanted in
advance because we're recreating

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990
advance because we're recreating
 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.960
advance because we're recreating
something that already exists that we've

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970
something that already exists that we've
 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.370
something that already exists that we've
kind of already had all the shots and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
kind of already had all the shots and
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.620
kind of already had all the shots and
stuff like that to look at and one of

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
stuff like that to look at and one of
 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.430
stuff like that to look at and one of
the trickier elements is the balloon

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440
the trickier elements is the balloon
 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.010
the trickier elements is the balloon
basket and the actors and everything

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
basket and the actors and everything
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.670
basket and the actors and everything
have to be able to rotate 360 degrees in

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680
have to be able to rotate 360 degrees in
 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.710
have to be able to rotate 360 degrees in
order to do that obviously I have to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720
order to do that obviously I have to
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.180
order to do that obviously I have to
build the full basket and it has to be

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190
build the full basket and it has to be
 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.370
build the full basket and it has to be
able to rotate easily enough and sturdy

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
able to rotate easily enough and sturdy
 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.290
able to rotate easily enough and sturdy
enough for three actors so that's gonna

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300
enough for three actors so that's gonna
 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.940
enough for three actors so that's gonna
be a bit of a challenge in the time

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950
be a bit of a challenge in the time
 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.280
be a bit of a challenge in the time
constraints that we have in addition to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290
constraints that we have in addition to
 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.060
constraints that we have in addition to
that we also need to build a staircase

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070
that we also need to build a staircase
 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.500
that we also need to build a staircase
that again can accommodate three actors

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510
that again can accommodate three actors
 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.070
that again can accommodate three actors
and it has to be small enough to fit on

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
and it has to be small enough to fit on
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.820
and it has to be small enough to fit on
the green-screen

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
the green-screen
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.399
the green-screen
stage like and there so we can shoot it

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409
stage like and there so we can shoot it
 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.300
stage like and there so we can shoot it
but also

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
but also
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.599
but also
can't be too big or too high because

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609
can't be too big or too high because
 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.520
can't be too big or too high because
ceiling only goes to about ten feet in

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
ceiling only goes to about ten feet in
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.130
ceiling only goes to about ten feet in
that room or at least the screen only

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
that room or at least the screen only
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.039
that room or at least the screen only
goes to about ten feet but building the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049
goes to about ten feet but building the
 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.020
goes to about ten feet but building the
stair shouldn't be that difficult it's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
stair shouldn't be that difficult it's
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.759
stair shouldn't be that difficult it's
just going to be some basic construction

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769
just going to be some basic construction
 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.569
just going to be some basic construction
and today I'm just gonna start doing

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579
and today I'm just gonna start doing
 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.190
and today I'm just gonna start doing
that because that'll be easy and I can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
that because that'll be easy and I can
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.979
that because that'll be easy and I can
think about how I want to build the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989
think about how I want to build the
 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.990
think about how I want to build the
basket and the rotation situation so

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
basket and the rotation situation so
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.990
basket and the rotation situation so
we're just gonna jump right in and yeah

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000
we're just gonna jump right in and yeah
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.289
we're just gonna jump right in and yeah
I don't know well just like always we'll

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299
I don't know well just like always we'll
 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:05:43.100
I don't know well just like always we'll
just see what happens

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110
 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.250
all right so our stairs are complete

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
all right so our stairs are complete
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.280
all right so our stairs are complete
very basic Doug is going to green-screen

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290
very basic Doug is going to green-screen
 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.900
very basic Doug is going to green-screen
it and basically animate the stairs or

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910
it and basically animate the stairs or
 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.990
it and basically animate the stairs or
use a cutout or drawing for whenever

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000
use a cutout or drawing for whenever
 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.970
use a cutout or drawing for whenever

there's the Sacketts stairs or whatever
so we don't really need to do anything

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600
so we don't really need to do anything
 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.300

here's my plan
I've got that round piece of board it's

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:29.559
I've got that round piece of board it's
 

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:34.499
I've got that round piece of board it's
about 4 feet circle should be big enough

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:34.509
about 4 feet circle should be big enough
 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:38.149
about 4 feet circle should be big enough
for three actors stand on all ends and

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159
for three actors stand on all ends and
 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.820
for three actors stand on all ends and
make it rotate so I'm gonna do is I have

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
make it rotate so I'm gonna do is I have
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.989
make it rotate so I'm gonna do is I have
these fixed casters 8 of them I find the

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:48.999
these fixed casters 8 of them I find the
 

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:53.719
these fixed casters 8 of them I find the
center point mark it all off to 8 points

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
center point mark it all off to 8 points
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:59.969
center point mark it all off to 8 points
attach these so that there they go in a

00:07:59.969 --> 00:07:59.979
attach these so that there they go in a
 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.159
attach these so that there they go in a
circle and then I'm going to create a

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:02.169
circle and then I'm going to create a
 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:06.899
circle and then I'm going to create a
box that is the height of the casters

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:06.909
box that is the height of the casters
 

00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:09.829
box that is the height of the casters
which is two and a half inches and

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:09.839
which is two and a half inches and
 

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:14.450
which is two and a half inches and
attach a lazy susan

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460
 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.030
so that you can rotate and evidently the

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.040
so that you can rotate and evidently the
 

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.800
so that you can rotate and evidently the
same access and then this these should

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:21.810
same access and then this these should
 

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.430
same access and then this these should
give it the support on the outside so

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440
give it the support on the outside so
 

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.930
give it the support on the outside so
that it doesn't flip over or anything

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:26.940
that it doesn't flip over or anything
 

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.100
that it doesn't flip over or anything
like that and it also helps it rotate so

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.110
like that and it also helps it rotate so
 

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.430
like that and it also helps it rotate so
that's the plan

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440
that's the plan
 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.460
that's the plan
in theory I think it should work so I'm

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:37.470
in theory I think it should work so I'm
 

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.310
in theory I think it should work so I'm
just gonna build it and see what happens

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320
just gonna build it and see what happens
 

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:56.240
just gonna build it and see what happens
so let's try it

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.250
 

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.559
okay so as you can see it's actually

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:58.569
okay so as you can see it's actually
 

00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:01.290
okay so as you can see it's actually
supporting my weight I can walk to the

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:01.300
supporting my weight I can walk to the
 

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.160
supporting my weight I can walk to the
edge and it doesn't flip up or cup over

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.170
edge and it doesn't flip up or cup over
 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.350
edge and it doesn't flip up or cup over
so that part is working really good I

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360
so that part is working really good I
 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.809
so that part is working really good I
think then definitely just building the

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:09.819
think then definitely just building the
 

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.490
think then definitely just building the
box and add an editing the lazy susan

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.500
box and add an editing the lazy susan
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.379
box and add an editing the lazy susan
give it a head of support in the center

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:13.389
give it a head of support in the center
 

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:16.949
give it a head of support in the center
and a great access point to mount that

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959
and a great access point to mount that
 

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:21.840
and a great access point to mount that
box then to surface underneath and then

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:21.850
box then to surface underneath and then
 

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.579
box then to surface underneath and then
we can just attach a strap on one end

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:23.589
we can just attach a strap on one end
 

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:27.059
we can just attach a strap on one end
and pull it off screen and it should

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:27.069
and pull it off screen and it should
 

00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:30.030
and pull it off screen and it should
rotate without shifting side to side

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040
rotate without shifting side to side
 

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.870
rotate without shifting side to side
anything like that and yeah that should

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880
anything like that and yeah that should
 

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.490
anything like that and yeah that should
probably do the trick thank goodness

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500
probably do the trick thank goodness
 

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.699
probably do the trick thank goodness
because I don't have much time to

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:40.709
because I don't have much time to
 

00:09:40.709 --> 00:10:28.500
because I don't have much time to
experiment here

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:28.510
 

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:34.750
all right so as you can see it works or

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760
all right so as you can see it works or
 

00:10:34.760 --> 00:11:22.580
all right so as you can see it works or
at least good enough for our purposes

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:22.590
 

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.850
all right so the structure of the basket

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860
all right so the structure of the basket
 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.780
all right so the structure of the basket
is ready now my idea to kind of make it

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:30.790
is ready now my idea to kind of make it
 

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.760
is ready now my idea to kind of make it
look like a basket is to take some foam

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:35.770
look like a basket is to take some foam
 

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.870
look like a basket is to take some foam
that we have a big sheets of foam I'm

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:39.880
that we have a big sheets of foam I'm
 

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.090
that we have a big sheets of foam I'm
gonna cut them into strips and basically

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.100
gonna cut them into strips and basically
 

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.050
gonna cut them into strips and basically
weave a basket out of it and then wrap

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.060
weave a basket out of it and then wrap
 

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.890
weave a basket out of it and then wrap
it and paint it and hopefully it looks

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:49.900
it and paint it and hopefully it looks
 

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.400
it and paint it and hopefully it looks
enough like the best good of a hot-air

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.410
enough like the best good of a hot-air
 

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.490
enough like the best good of a hot-air
balloon I think I can add some material

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:56.500
balloon I think I can add some material
 

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.860
balloon I think I can add some material
stuff to the top throw some sandbags

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:58.870
stuff to the top throw some sandbags
 

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.230
stuff to the top throw some sandbags
over it and stuff like that

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240
over it and stuff like that
 

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:07.140
over it and stuff like that
it pulls and it should put your back the

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:07.150
it pulls and it should put your back the
 

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.280
it pulls and it should put your back the
right way to put it on the rotating base

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.290
right way to put it on the rotating base
 

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:17.130
right way to put it on the rotating base
and yeah pretty much go command all

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.140
and yeah pretty much go command all
 

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:27.290
and yeah pretty much go command all
right

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300
 

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.530
all right so this is basically how it'll

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:31.540
all right so this is basically how it'll
 

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.690
all right so this is basically how it'll
look I don't need to do the entire piece

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:36.700
look I don't need to do the entire piece
 

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.060
look I don't need to do the entire piece
for the full-size basket I think just

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:42.070
for the full-size basket I think just
 

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.830
for the full-size basket I think just
getting the corners the front is enough

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:45.840
getting the corners the front is enough
 

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.780
getting the corners the front is enough
so I don't have to do any more work than

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:48.790
so I don't have to do any more work than
 

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.520
so I don't have to do any more work than
I need to so I think I'm good with the

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:50.530
I need to so I think I'm good with the
 

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.050
I need to so I think I'm good with the
bottom half I just have to finish the

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.060
bottom half I just have to finish the
 

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.290
bottom half I just have to finish the
top half it goes all the way around and

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.300
top half it goes all the way around and
 

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.010
top half it goes all the way around and
then attach everything paint it paint

00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.020
then attach everything paint it paint
 

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.070
then attach everything paint it paint
the poles and then there's just a few

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:02.080
the poles and then there's just a few
 

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.890
the poles and then there's just a few
other minor things we got to do some

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:04.900
other minor things we got to do some
 

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.720
other minor things we got to do some
little props I still have to break the

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:06.730
little props I still have to break the
 

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:40.300
little props I still have to break the
ropes

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.310
 

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:45.550
right pretty much done on this wait for

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560
right pretty much done on this wait for
 

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.879
right pretty much done on this wait for
two more of the poles to dry it kind of

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:48.889
two more of the poles to dry it kind of
 

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:53.410
two more of the poles to dry it kind of
sort of Mokpo make the illusion of ropes

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.420
sort of Mokpo make the illusion of ropes
 

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.929
sort of Mokpo make the illusion of ropes
I guess but yeah see I just built this

00:13:58.929 --> 00:13:58.939
I guess but yeah see I just built this
 

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:09.730
I guess but yeah see I just built this
corner the side is open so the actors

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:09.740
corner the side is open so the actors
 

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.100
corner the side is open so the actors
can go in and out much easier and you

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.110
can go in and out much easier and you
 

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.129
can go in and out much easier and you
really only need that corner or the

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:15.139
really only need that corner or the
 

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:19.559
really only need that corner or the
front and then the top part because it

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:19.569
front and then the top part because it
 

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:26.259
front and then the top part because it
detaches and from there so then this is

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:26.269
detaches and from there so then this is
 

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:28.389
detaches and from there so then this is
360 all the way around so that we can do

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399
360 all the way around so that we can do
 

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:30.100
360 all the way around so that we can do
it for certain shots where we need to

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.110
it for certain shots where we need to
 

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.249
it for certain shots where we need to
see the 360 and it's an extra scrap

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:33.259
see the 360 and it's an extra scrap
 

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:35.280
see the 360 and it's an extra scrap
material that I just ran along the top

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.290
material that I just ran along the top
 

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.579
material that I just ran along the top
kind of give it that look at the inside

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:39.589
kind of give it that look at the inside
 

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:42.129
kind of give it that look at the inside
of the basket like it's aligned with

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:42.139
of the basket like it's aligned with
 

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:45.370
of the basket like it's aligned with
something

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:45.380
 

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.360
yeah all right

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.370
yeah all right
 

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.360
yeah all right
so talk to Doug earlier today and

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.370
so talk to Doug earlier today and
 

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.910
so talk to Doug earlier today and
basically he said that the stairs need

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920
basically he said that the stairs need
 

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.460
basically he said that the stairs need
to be green so that it's easier to key

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:58.470
to be green so that it's easier to key
 

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.610
to be green so that it's easier to key
out and everything so that's what we did

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620
out and everything so that's what we did
 

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.890
out and everything so that's what we did
in the stairs Green's Barney came in for

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:06.900
in the stairs Green's Barney came in for
 

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.579
in the stairs Green's Barney came in for
a few hours and poked me with some of

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:10.589
a few hours and poked me with some of
 

00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:13.760
a few hours and poked me with some of
the he put the a on the Elven costume

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:13.770
the he put the a on the Elven costume
 

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.420
the he put the a on the Elven costume
and the hat and cut some green poster

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.430
and the hat and cut some green poster
 

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:23.300
and the hat and cut some green poster
board or foam board to act as the risers

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:23.310
board or foam board to act as the risers
 

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.560
board or foam board to act as the risers
the stairs so I didn't have to build

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:27.570
the stairs so I didn't have to build
 

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.780
the stairs so I didn't have to build
anything else

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:29.790
anything else
 

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:34.190
anything else
but painted the green and the lazy susan

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.200
but painted the green and the lazy susan
 

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.430
but painted the green and the lazy susan
I just painted green just in case so

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440
 

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.790
yeah I think that's all that's left is I

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800
yeah I think that's all that's left is I
 

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.090
yeah I think that's all that's left is I
have to Casper gap today I need to build

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100
have to Casper gap today I need to build
 

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.310
have to Casper gap today I need to build
a harp kind of thing whatever

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320
a harp kind of thing whatever
 

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.790
a harp kind of thing whatever
I think Doug is gonna play like a harp

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800
I think Doug is gonna play like a harp
 

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.670
I think Doug is gonna play like a harp
like it's a guitar or something so I'm

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680
like it's a guitar or something so I'm
 

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.070
like it's a guitar or something so I'm
just gonna cut a pattern out on this

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.080
just gonna cut a pattern out on this
 

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.490
