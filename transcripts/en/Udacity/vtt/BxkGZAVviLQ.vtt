00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.530
So using the genetic code, we see that this mutation

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.130
is best represented as a missense mutation. And the reason is

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.730
because we change from a Glutamate codon, to a Lysine codon.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.940
The change in amino acid, is best described as a missense.
