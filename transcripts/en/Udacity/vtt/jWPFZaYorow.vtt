00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.657
The essential methods
are numberOfRowsInSection,

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:08.300
cellForRowAtIndexPath and
didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.050
The first two are data
source protocol methods.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.630
And they're so important that
they're the only required methods in

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.550
the protocol.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.900
If you keep writing IOS apps, before
long you'll have written dozens of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.010
tables, and
these methods will become second nature.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.820
The third method is used all the time
to respond to the user selecting a row.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.220
We'll see it a little bit in this
lesson and a lot in Lesson 5.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.770
Okay, time to actually create a table.
