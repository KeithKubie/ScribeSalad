00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.030
Now, could you talk a little bit about
sort of how we go from adversarial

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.070
mindset to beating diversity and

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.450
thinking about how to exploit
the humans at the other end?

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.364
&gt;&gt; Well, I think what our adversaries do
And you want an adversarial mindset so

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.535
you can for this thinking and look for

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.365
these vulnerabilities
before someone else does.

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:28.210
I think typically what they'll do is
they'll probe the perimeter of a system.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.010
Looking for vulnerability.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.430
And it's really on multiple layers.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.910
You can think of the technical layer,
and if the system is secure technically,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
which is a very rare thing, but
let's assume that's the case.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.130
Or maybe if they decided the amount
of work, the work factor involved

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.400
to bypass something technically
just too expensive in some ways.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.060
Then they'll go looking for the ever
present weak link, which is the human,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.270
and often times by
studying the given users

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.720
Finding their weaknesses themselves,
their personal vulnerabilities.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.120
Those can then be exploited.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.750
So I tend to think against
well-resourced and motivated adversary,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.630
that the adversary will always
prevail given enough time and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.770
resources to put into it
