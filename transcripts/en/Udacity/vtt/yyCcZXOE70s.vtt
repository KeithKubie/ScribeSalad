We've got a lot done so far. You've thought about the business problem, which is

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.590
this music festival. You've visualized that on

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.920
a schema by creating objects and fields, and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.320
you created a record for your first

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.830
music festival. Then you related these objects together,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.258
so that you can do things like create

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:21.220
roll up summary's, and add formulas and validations.
