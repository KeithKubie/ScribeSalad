00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.506
Hello?

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.508
(woman on phone)
<i>Hi, Amy, you've got
Dan, Allen, Isaac,</i>

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.610
<i>Matt, Allie, Jen,
and Russell.</i>

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.844
(man on phone)
<i>There she is!</i>

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.079
<i>There's our girl.</i>

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.380
<i>Ames,
what's shaking?</i>

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.082
<i>What'd you get into
last night, girl?</i>

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.050
Nothing much.
Just hanging out.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.453
<i>(laughs hysterically)
You kill me!</i>

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:20.587
<i>You kill me!</i>

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.055
What's up, guys?

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.590
(man)
<i>We know you've been looking
to make the transition</i>

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.158
<i>to doing more
off-camera work.</i>

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.560
I never said that.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.629
<i>They want you for the next
big animated kids' movie.</i>

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:32.733
<i>It's like "Charlie's Angels,"
but with meerkats!</i>

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.601
<i>Jessica Alba and Megan Fox
have already signed</i>

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.170
<i>to play the other two.</i>

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.771
Uh, I'm in.
I'm-- Yeah.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.640
<i>Awesome, we'll download you
on the deets</i>

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.175
<i>as soon as we circle back
with Tad, Allen out.</i>

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.342
As soon as you do
what with who?

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.477
<i>Hanging up.</i>
Hello?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.078
(phone beeps)

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.250
Bing.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.822
(man)
Welcome, Amy.

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.591
Are you thirsty?
Are you hungry?

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.092
Did you find
your snacks okay?

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.661
No, I brought this tea.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.163
Okay, well, the snacks are
here for when you need them.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.264
Okay?
Snacks.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.399
Okay.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.539
Red leather, yellow leather.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.842
Hey, did Meg and Jess
already do their stuff?

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.343
All right,
let's just roll it.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.678
Page one, scene one.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.613
You'll hear a beep,
you'll say your lines.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:20.914
Okay, cool.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.852
(audio playing back)

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.321
(beeping)

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.424
â™ª

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.094
I'm pretty <i>and</i> nice.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.099 line:0%
 
I'm sexy, but I love math.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.101 line:0%
 
Karate!

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:42.703
(loud thud)

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.472 line:0%
 
(beeping)

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.178
(man)
Okay, that was your cue.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.779
Uh, we'll take it again.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.982
Just, when you hear
the beep, say the lines.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.251
That one's me?
(flatulence)

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.553
Yep, that's you.

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:02.189
Um, why doesn't my meerkat
have any pants?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.058
Our animation team
is out of Japan,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.693
and they don't have anybody

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.730
as big as Dumpy the Frumpy
Meerkat over there,

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.832
so they literally
couldn't figure out

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.767
how to make pants
to fit on you.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.569
They couldn't even,
you know, fathom it.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.970
But it's a cartoon.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.338
They can't-- why couldn't
they just draw pants?

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.573
It blew their minds.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.674
They had no idea.
They didn't see the point.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.075
(long beep)

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.345
Worms.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.648
Okay, we really need you
to drop it down a bunch.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.082
Like a whole bunch.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.586
It's gotta be more like...
(deep voice) "Worms!"

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.087
You know, like you
really love worms

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:35.289
and you're disgusting.

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:37.090
Tell you what,
why don't we just have you

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.726
do some wild feeding noises?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.361
Can you find your snacks?

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.897
(munching and mumbling)

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.099
Okay, just give me one where
you eat for a little bit

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.302
and then you stop to (bleep)

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.304
and then go back
to eating again.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:52.873
Paging Ms. Streep!

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.908
I mean, you are a star.
You're killing this.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.844
She is
killing this, right?

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.880
No, no, no, I think we need
to get me out of this.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.549
Schumes, what are we
talking about here, okay?

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.884
You are crushing this.

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:08.088
My character
has a pussy.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.656
Have you eaten
any snacks?

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.325
Yes, I have my snacks.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.160
I'm sensing you're
not totally jazzed,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.695
but I think I have
something

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.864
that's gonna
change your tune.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:21.068
Amy, meet...

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.470
your action figure.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.405
(motor squeaking)

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.443
It's (bleep).

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.645
Yeah, the thing
retails for $42.99.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:35.449
You get 60% of
the back end.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.385
Worms!

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.089
(gobbling)
(flatulence)
