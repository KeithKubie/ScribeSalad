00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.270
The fifth and final issue in basics about evolutionary thinking as they pertain

2
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:14.461
to evolutionary medicine is that there are quite different styles of thought and

3
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:18.850
in particular in this area,
we can think typologically,

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.870
we can think of the population level or we can think about evolutionary trees

5
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.760
and the way that one is thinking makes quite a difference to the analysis of the

6
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.594
problem.

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.560
<v 0>so in general,
in understanding arguments,</v>

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.520
we need to ask what are the implicit assumptions that are being made?

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.120
What different meanings are people assigning the words?

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.080
What issues are hanging unexpressed in the background and in brief are people

12
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:48.254
coming from?

13
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.583
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.640
<v 0>Let's start with typological thinking.</v>

15
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.400
If one is thinking typologically,

16
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.210
then the most important thing to know about something is the category that it

17
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:04.600
represents.
That is the quote normal condition.

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.340
<v 0>This way of looking at the world derives from Plato's theory of ideals and</v>

20
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.080
Aristotle's theory of types.

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.610
The type embodies the essence of the thing,

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.740
and scientific examples include the hydrogen atom,

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
the vertebrate kidney,
the eukaryotic ribosome.

24
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.890
In other words,
if you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.690
<v 1>Okay?</v>

26
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.920
<v 0>It's actually quite useful</v>

27
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.710
whenever the average properties of a thing are much more important than its

28
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:41.544
variation.

29
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.330
<v 0>That's sometimes the case in molecular biology and cell biology and physiology,</v>

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.710
but but not always.

32
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.040
It is a powerful simply simplification that makes life a lot easier.

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.830
So the importance of thing about type of logical thinking is to know when can

34
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:01.664
you get away with it.

35
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260
It will mislead you when you are thinking about evolution or about the adaptive

36
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.600
immune system or about many other things.

37
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.380
It is useful in cell and molecular biology.

38
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:22.381
It is useful to have a concept of an animal cell as we have here on the left

39
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.150
that has a certain structure.
It has a cell membrane,
it has a nucleus,

40
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:31.690
it has cytoplasm,
it has endoplasmic reticulum,

41
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:33.460
it has mitochondria and so forth.

42
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.890
It is useful to think of the Ribas ohm is having a certain structure and

43
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.560
performing a certain function in protein synthesis.

44
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.670
And that is an example where it probably is a good idea to think typologically

45
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.370
on the other hand,
population thinking is the most important,
uh,

46
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.800
type of thinking in evolutionary biology.
And when you're that,

47
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.150
then the most important thing to know about it is the variation in the

48
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.510
population from which the trait is drawn.

49
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.980
That is tied to Darwin's insight into the central role of variation and natural

50
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:19.300
selection
examples,
gene frequencies,

51
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.920
relative risk of heart disease,

52
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.921
stratified by sex or lifestyle or all of the recent developments leading to

53
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.350
personalized medicine.

54
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.150
So this way of looking at the world emphasizes variation in the population and

55
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:40.450
in the processes that change it with individuals,

56
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.920
seen his samples,

57
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.550
whose traits can be estimated from population frequencies.

58
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.010
Population thinking is useful whenever it is important to know whether and how

59
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:56.900
fast something will evolve.
That includes antibiotic resistance,
pathogen,

60
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.520
virulence,
cancer,
malignancy,
and anything related to the Microbiota.

61
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.580
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.580
<v 0>population thinking forces us into conceptualizing frequency distributions,</v>

63
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.290
patterns of variation and space and time and probabilities rather than

64
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.124
certainties.

65
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.960
<v 0>Here's an example.</v>

67
00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:22.961
Here's a very interesting case of antibiotic resistance analyzed recently,

68
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.250
uh,
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts,

69
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.650
there were Gut microbiome isolates taken from two humans.

70
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:38.120
The differed in percentage of isolates that are resistant to single and multiple

71
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:42.170
antibiotics.
So one human here is in red.
The other humanism blue,

72
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.400
the samples from the humans are these,

73
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.850
every vertical line is a particular kind of bacterium.

74
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.890
Every horizontal row is a particular kind of antibiotic,

75
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.790
and the intensity shows how well that particular bacterium is growing in the

76
00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:08.000
presence of that particular antibiotic.

77
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.540
And what you can see is that the two humans differ.

78
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.370
So there is variation in the human population in their microbiota.

79
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.240
You can see the bat that the bacteria found in those two humans also differ in

80
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:27.140
their ability to grow in the presence of antibiotics.

81
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.260
The most striking thing about this is that neither of these two humans had been

82
00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:36.170
using antibiotics recently,
and nevertheless,

83
00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:39.680
they each contained hundreds of different bacteria that were resistant to

84
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:41.300
multiple antibiotics.

85
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.040
<v 0>Now what about cancer?</v>

87
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.010
Every individual cancer is a process of clonal evolution and you can see clones

88
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.430
here in different colors,

89
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.870
and the idea is that selection is applied to the clones.

90
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:12.920
They are competing with each other for local resources,
nutrients,
oxygen,

91
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.810
space,
things like that.

92
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.580
At some point,

93
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.360
a particular clone acquires the ability to move and invade other tissue.

94
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.760
That is this line here leading to some metasticies.

95
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.250
Then TX means therapy.
Chemotherapy is being applied.

96
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.090
One of the metastatic clones manages to survive and that then leads to the

97
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.850
recurrence of the cancer because this one is resistant to that type of

98
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:44.690
chemotherapy.

99
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.220
So we think about a cancer as being a genetically heterogeneous set of clones.

100
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.270
So as a population

101
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.650
it's a population of clones and they deliver,

102
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.260
they differ in their history of mutations.

103
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.010
Selection is allowing some of them to expand and some of them eventually to

104
00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:14.850
escape from chemotherapy.
The ecosystems they occupy,

105
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.140
our different tissues to which clones can become locally adapted.

106
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.340
And this way of looking at cancer as a micro evolutionary process shows us that

107
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:31.500
one of the reasons for the recurrence of cancers after chemotherapy is the

108
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:35.520
genetic heterogeneity of the clones that that therapy is operating on.

109
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.470
<v 0>What about tree thinking?
If one is engaging in tree thinking,</v>

111
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:44.750
then the most important thing to know about something,

112
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.690
it's where does it sit on a phylogenetic tree?

113
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.090
<v 0>This derives from the insight that all species are related in a single tree of</v>

115
00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:54.924
life.

116
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.020
They're not independent replicates within a larger class,

117
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.630
but they're connected within a phylogenetic tree.

118
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.740
What basically that means is that many of the properties of descendants are

119
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:08.180
inherited from ancestors

120
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.300
that emphasizes explanations within the context of phylogenetic trees in which

121
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:22.400
differences arise by deviation from the last common ancestor.

122
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.220
It's useful whenever there's an insight to be drawn from comparisons among

123
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:31.130
species and in evolutionary medicine.

124
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:36.131
Such comparisons suggest the insights that include the Association of Invasive

125
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.580
Placentas with metastatic cancer,

126
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.050
the Association of Upright posture with problems of childbirth.

127
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.210
Why whales and elephants do not all die of colon cancer as teenagers.

128
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.350
Pedro's paradox,

129
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.890
why African green monkeys have Siv but they don't progress to aids and why heart

130
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.380
disease presents differently in chimpanzees.

131
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.530
So knowing the phylogenetic context of a particular disease or trait can often

132
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:10.821
give us quite a bit of comparative insight into its origin and therefore

133
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:12.540
possibly into its causes.

134
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.360
Knowing where on the tree of life and condition is present or absent immediately

135
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:21.630
gives us clues to its correlates and causes.

136
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.200
Let's do some tree thinking about birth.

137
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.570
What we have here in the picture are diagrams of the birth canals,

138
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.730
of mechanics,
of givens,

139
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.550
of Orangutans,
chimpanzees,
gorillas and humans.

140
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.370
And the thing that strikes you if you're just looking at the upper part of the

141
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.204
picture,

142
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.840
is that the head of the infant being born in a mechanic is completely filling

143
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:49.920
the birth canal.

144
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.470
And so is the head of a human infant completely filling the birth canal weather.

145
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.160
Whereas it looks as though birth is much easier and orangutans,

146
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.130
chimpanzees and gorillas.
Now,

147
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.030
what is the primitive and what is the derived state here?

148
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.750
Is it really that the human birth canal is filled by the head of the human

149
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:18.291
infant because humans are similar to mechanics or is it some other comparisons?

150
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:21.750
It's more appropriate.
Well,

151
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.980
if we look at the phylogenetic tree than we see immediately that the key

152
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:30.540
comparison isn't between mechanics in humans is between chimpanzees and humans.

153
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.380
And that tells us that the difficulties encountered in human childbirth are a

154
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:42.870
fairly recent derived condition that must be associated with something that

155
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.750
changed between chimpanzees and humans.

156
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.880
And we will go into that later in the course.
Now,
what about cancer?

157
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.040
In this case,
what you see is a phylogenetic tree.

158
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.610
It starts here with a normal cell goes to initiated to herself with the

159
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:02.574
mutation.

160
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.690
There is then a process of some clonal selection and then there are some

161
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:11.691
phylogenetic branches which lead into metasticies that colonize lung or liver.

162
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.340
They can be genotyped and the tree can be reconstructed and that gives us real

163
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.640
estimates of relationship in age.

164
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.970
What it tells us is that in this case,
these cases of pancreatic cancer,

165
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.560
the cancer's originated about 18 years before they were detected.

166
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.830
We use a molecular clock to estimate the time between the initiative to herself

167
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.150
and the death of the patient and the harvest and metastasis.

168
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.490
Now knowing that gives us new ideas for methods of detection that could prevent

169
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.400
growth and spread of pancreatic cancer.

170
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.880
So tree thinking is useful in the clinic in understanding how the history of a

171
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:04.300
particular cancer develops.
So to summarize,

172
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.450
people think about problems in profoundly different ways.

173
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.550
It's important to match the way that you think to the problem that you're trying

174
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:16.030
to solve.
Population and tree thinking,

175
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:18.370
our standard and evolutionary biology.

176
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.210
They emphasize the importance of variation in populations of frequencies,

177
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.000
probabilities,
history,
and comparisons.
