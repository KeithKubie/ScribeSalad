each other
so one strand flows from I guess you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470
so one strand flows from I guess you
 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.990

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.320
60s and early 70s and that led to
Nixon's election and then later on to

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
Nixon's election and then later on to
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.050
Nixon's election and then later on to
Vegas election at the end of the 70s and

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060
Vegas election at the end of the 70s and
 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.170
Vegas election at the end of the 70s and
and the decline of the New Deal order so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180
and the decline of the New Deal order so
 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.379
and the decline of the New Deal order so
that's that's one way it's been seen and

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389
that's that's one way it's been seen and
 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.080
that's that's one way it's been seen and
however there always been other other

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090
however there always been other other
 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.850
however there always been other other
ways that historians have seen the rise

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
ways that historians have seen the rise
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.589
ways that historians have seen the rise
of American conservatism many have

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599
of American conservatism many have
 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.500
of American conservatism many have
linked it back to the immediate post-war

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510
linked it back to the immediate post-war
 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.650
linked it back to the immediate post-war
period itself when you see the growth of

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660
period itself when you see the growth of
 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.420
period itself when you see the growth of
an intellectual conservatism the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430
an intellectual conservatism the
 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.250
an intellectual conservatism the
founding of National Review in the mid

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260
founding of National Review in the mid
 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.330
founding of National Review in the mid
50's the some people go back even

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
50's the some people go back even
 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.250
50's the some people go back even
further to the New Deal and see the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260
further to the New Deal and see the
 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.900
further to the New Deal and see the
reaction against the New Deal as the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910
reaction against the New Deal as the
 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.370
reaction against the New Deal as the
real birth point of modern conservatism

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380
 
 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.800
 
so there's an and the the suggestion

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810
so there's an and the the suggestion
 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.790
so there's an and the the suggestion
that there's been you know kind of the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800
that there's been you know kind of the
 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.220
that there's been you know kind of the
growth of a grassroots conservative

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230
growth of a grassroots conservative
 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.060
growth of a grassroots conservative

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.640
activism throughout the 50s and 60s and
70s and that that that movement that

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650
70s and that that that movement that
 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.190
70s and that that that movement that
kind of forward-looking grassroots

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200
kind of forward-looking grassroots
 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.720
kind of forward-looking grassroots
movement is really what has given them

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730
movement is really what has given them
 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.640
movement is really what has given them
given conservatism it's staying power

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650
given conservatism it's staying power
 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.830
given conservatism it's staying power

not just the the backlash of the late
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.150
not just the the backlash of the late
60s and early 70s but also this longer

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
60s and early 70s but also this longer
underlying trends I mean I think they're

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170
underlying trends I mean I think they're
 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.810
underlying trends I mean I think they're
historians to go further still and say

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820
historians to go further still and say
 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.890

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630
that there that you can find the
 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.250
that there that you can find the
dominance before the New Deal of Alessa

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260
dominance before the New Deal of Alessa
 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.430

fair set of economic ideas that all of

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440
fair set of economic ideas that all of
 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.690

these parts kind of racial conservatism

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700
these parts kind of racial conservatism
 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.760

all of those things go back before the

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200
all of those things go back before the
 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.540
all of those things go back before the
New Deal and so in some ways they were

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550
New Deal and so in some ways they were
 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.310
New Deal and so in some ways they were
there waiting to be reawakened so that's

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320
there waiting to be reawakened so that's
 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.429
there waiting to be reawakened so that's
yet another view

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:10.439
 
 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.619
 
well I would say first well one thing is

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629
well I would say first well one thing is
 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:13.999
well I would say first well one thing is
I think the Republican Party is

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009
I think the Republican Party is
 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.769
I think the Republican Party is
different from the conservative movement

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779
different from the conservative movement
 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.219
different from the conservative movement
and really especially in the post-war

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229
and really especially in the post-war
 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.600
and really especially in the post-war
period this is important to keep in mind

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610
period this is important to keep in mind
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.609
period this is important to keep in mind
because there were also liberal

00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:22.619
because there were also liberal
 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:24.589
because there were also liberal
Republicans and so there's a lot of

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599
Republicans and so there's a lot of
 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.899
Republicans and so there's a lot of
tenants who are not you know they're not

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909
tenants who are not you know they're not
 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.850
tenants who are not you know they're not
the same and also the concern movement I

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860
the same and also the concern movement I
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.259
the same and also the concern movement I
think has had a lot of impact on

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:30.269
think has had a lot of impact on
 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:32.540
think has had a lot of impact on
Democrats as well so it in some ways

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550
Democrats as well so it in some ways
 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.309
Democrats as well so it in some ways
it's it's always a little confusing what

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319
it's it's always a little confusing what
 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.269
it's it's always a little confusing what
the relationship is between the

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:35.279
the relationship is between the
 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.909
the relationship is between the
political parties and these social

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919
political parties and these social
 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.279
political parties and these social
movements well I think the you know

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289
movements well I think the you know
 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.219
movements well I think the you know
there are I guess there are different

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229
there are I guess there are different
 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:47.749
there are I guess there are different
schools of thought about this but the

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759
schools of thought about this but the
 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:53.299
schools of thought about this but the
concern that suggests that the ability

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:53.309
concern that suggests that the ability
 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:55.189
concern that suggests that the ability
of conservatives to attract these very

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199
of conservatives to attract these very
 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.699
of conservatives to attract these very
dedicated grassroots activists in places

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:58.709
dedicated grassroots activists in places
 

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.059
dedicated grassroots activists in places
like Orange County California that that

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069
like Orange County California that that
 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.469
like Orange County California that that
enabled the movement to just kind of

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479
enabled the movement to just kind of
 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.629
enabled the movement to just kind of
slowly grow almost under the radar

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639
slowly grow almost under the radar
 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.969
slowly grow almost under the radar
screen until it was a kind of

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979
screen until it was a kind of
 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.759
screen until it was a kind of
consolidated its power and that the

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:10.769
consolidated its power and that the
 

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:12.859
consolidated its power and that the
activists carrying out the work of the

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:12.869
activists carrying out the work of the
 

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:14.389
activists carrying out the work of the
movement we're doing really the same

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:14.399
movement we're doing really the same
 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.730
movement we're doing really the same
kind of thing that civil rights

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740
kind of thing that civil rights
 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.299
kind of thing that civil rights
activists were doing or labor act the

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:20.309
activists were doing or labor act the
 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:21.829
activists were doing or labor act the
union activists are doing they're

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:21.839
union activists are doing they're
 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:24.350

they're slowly kind of meeting people

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360
they're slowly kind of meeting people
 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.369

one on one holding coffee klatches
 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.689
one on one holding coffee klatches
participating in rallies that kind of

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699
participating in rallies that kind of
 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.699
participating in rallies that kind of
activity and slowly but surely they

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:31.709
activity and slowly but surely they
 

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:34.540
activity and slowly but surely they
built a movement

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
 
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.640
 
I think though that it actually is

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650
I think though that it actually is
 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.950
I think though that it actually is
problematic to see conservatism as a

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960
problematic to see conservatism as a
 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.160
problematic to see conservatism as a
purely grassroots movement and that one

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.170
purely grassroots movement and that one
 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.330
purely grassroots movement and that one
of the things that really makes the

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340
of the things that really makes the
 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.160
of the things that really makes the
conservative movement different is that

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.170
conservative movement different is that
 

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.900
conservative movement different is that

it's always been able or throughout the
 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.180
it's always been able or throughout the
post-war period it's always been able to

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190
post-war period it's always been able to
 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.720
post-war period it's always been able to
attract a lot of support from business

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:52.730
attract a lot of support from business
 

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.280
attract a lot of support from business
organizations and from very wealthy

that these people have played I would

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.750
infrastructure and conservatives have
access to that in a way that I think

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:25.760
access to that in a way that I think
 

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.100
access to that in a way that I think
labor activists just don't and and civil

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.110
labor activists just don't and and civil
 

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.930
labor activists just don't and and civil
rights activists don't and so they are

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:31.940
rights activists don't and so they are
 

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.950
rights activists don't and so they are
able to you know survive to feed in part

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:35.960
able to you know survive to feed in part
 

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.560
able to you know survive to feed in part
because they are connected to people who

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:38.570
because they are connected to people who
 

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.290
because they are connected to people who
have a lot of social power regardless so

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:41.300
have a lot of social power regardless so
 

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.060
have a lot of social power regardless so
I think you know the grassroots activism

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.070
I think you know the grassroots activism
 

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.860
I think you know the grassroots activism
is an important part of the story but

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:44.870
is an important part of the story but
 

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.510
is an important part of the story but
it's not the whole story you need to

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:46.520
it's not the whole story you need to
 

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.670
it's not the whole story you need to
look at the financing and the

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680
look at the financing and the
 

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.730
look at the financing and the
institutions and the role of the role of

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:53.740
institutions and the role of the role of
 

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.760
institutions and the role of the role of
companies and these groups that don't

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:57.770
companies and these groups that don't
 

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.530
companies and these groups that don't
rise and fall with elections or with

00:08:59.530 --> 00:08:59.540
rise and fall with elections or with
 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.290
rise and fall with elections or with
particular legislative battles

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300
 
 

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.420
 
all right do people see conservatives

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.430
all right do people see conservatives
 

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.360
all right do people see conservatives
differently well I think it is

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:10.370
 
 

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.470

McCrea Lee since we have the election
it's interesting we've seen an enormous

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:16.830
it's interesting we've seen an enormous
 

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.240
it's interesting we've seen an enormous
amount of condescension and hostility

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.250
amount of condescension and hostility
 

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.590
amount of condescension and hostility
that from liberal groups towards

that from liberal groups towards
 

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.120
that from liberal groups towards
conservatives and it is a combination

00:10:14.769 --> 00:10:14.779
 
 

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:17.930
 
just looking down on them and their

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940
just looking down on them and their
 

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.810
just looking down on them and their
ideas and also I I guess one thing about

ideas and also I I guess one thing about
 

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.100

it is that it it merjan Eliza's the

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.110
it is that it it merjan Eliza's the
 

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.230
it is that it it merjan Eliza's the
extent to which a lot of the ideas of

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240
extent to which a lot of the ideas of
 

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.550
extent to which a lot of the ideas of
the consumer I really entered the

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560
the consumer I really entered the
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.880
the consumer I really entered the
mainstream and I think one of the things

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:31.890
mainstream and I think one of the things
 

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.460
mainstream and I think one of the things
that we really need to look at today

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:33.470
that we really need to look at today
 

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.240
that we really need to look at today
historians and anybody interested in

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.250
historians and anybody interested in
 

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.690

politics is the that are the successes

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700
politics is the that are the successes
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.519
politics is the that are the successes
of the conservative movement and the way

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:40.529
of the conservative movement and the way
 

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:42.769
of the conservative movement and the way
that it really has been able to shape

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779
that it really has been able to shape
 

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.079
that it really has been able to shape
both political parties and the whole way

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:45.089
both political parties and the whole way
 

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:46.670
both political parties and the whole way
that we think about politics may we

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680
that we think about politics may we
 

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.050
that we think about politics may we
think about the market the way we think

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060
think about the market the way we think
 

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.990
think about the market the way we think
about the role of the state it seems to

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000
about the role of the state it seems to
 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.430
about the role of the state it seems to
me that in some ways what people

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440
me that in some ways what people
 

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.590
me that in some ways what people
shouldn't start to do is stop studying

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600
shouldn't start to do is stop studying
 

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.439
shouldn't start to do is stop studying
only the conservatives and start looking

00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:57.449
only the conservatives and start looking
 

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:00.110
only the conservatives and start looking
at you know the mainstream and the

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120
at you know the mainstream and the
 

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.540
at you know the mainstream and the
consensus and how that has shifted I

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:02.550
consensus and how that has shifted I
 

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.730
consensus and how that has shifted I
think in large part as a result of the

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740
think in large part as a result of the
 

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.500
think in large part as a result of the
the work of the conservative movement

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:06.510
the work of the conservative movement
 

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:12.230
the work of the conservative movement
but you know kind of conceived broadly

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240
 
 

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.269
 
well I think and I think that the

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279
well I think and I think that the
 

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:16.369
well I think and I think that the
biggest the deepest impact is really in

00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:16.379
biggest the deepest impact is really in
 

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:18.290
biggest the deepest impact is really in
economic ideas and there's just a lot

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300
economic ideas and there's just a lot
 

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.569
economic ideas and there's just a lot
that the kind of old confidence and the

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579
that the kind of old confidence and the
 

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.960
that the kind of old confidence and the
idea that the state could you know that

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:23.970
idea that the state could you know that
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.049
idea that the state could you know that
by taking the state had the ability to

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:27.059
by taking the state had the ability to
 

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:29.689
by taking the state had the ability to
take positive action in order to to

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:29.699
take positive action in order to to
 

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:33.109
take positive action in order to to
change economic relationships and create

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:33.119
change economic relationships and create
 

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:35.749
change economic relationships and create
a more equal fair just economy I think

00:11:35.749 --> 00:11:35.759
a more equal fair just economy I think
 

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:37.730
a more equal fair just economy I think
that the contemporary Democratic Party

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740
that the contemporary Democratic Party
 

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.210
that the contemporary Democratic Party
you know even under Obama is not

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.220
you know even under Obama is not
 

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.230
you know even under Obama is not
committed to that in the same way and I

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240
committed to that in the same way and I
 

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.369
committed to that in the same way and I
think one place we really see this

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:43.379
think one place we really see this
 

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:45.460
think one place we really see this
actually is with regard to labor unions

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:45.470
actually is with regard to labor unions
 

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.129
actually is with regard to labor unions
and the you know really complete lack of

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:49.139
and the you know really complete lack of
 

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:50.960
and the you know really complete lack of
commitment of the Obama administration

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:50.970
commitment of the Obama administration
 

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.429
commitment of the Obama administration

to passing labor law reform you know I
 

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:57.049
to passing labor law reform you know I
think we see it all over though I mean I

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:57.059
think we see it all over though I mean I
 

00:11:57.059 --> 00:11:58.069
think we see it all over though I mean I
think you can see it in the health care

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079
think you can see it in the health care
 

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.929
think you can see it in the health care
debate and the way in which what's

00:11:59.929 --> 00:11:59.939
debate and the way in which what's
 

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:01.660
debate and the way in which what's
actually being talked about now is is

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:01.670
actually being talked about now is is
 

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.460
actually being talked about now is is
substantially watered down and it's

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:04.470
substantially watered down and it's
 

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.350
substantially watered down and it's
quite far from a you know anything like

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360
quite far from a you know anything like
 

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.059
quite far from a you know anything like
a single-payer program which might

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:08.069
a single-payer program which might
 

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:10.639
a single-payer program which might
actually which many experts think we

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:10.649
actually which many experts think we
 

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:12.710
actually which many experts think we
would have the you know greatest chance

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720
would have the you know greatest chance
 

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.269
would have the you know greatest chance
of actually delivering on the goal of

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279
of actually delivering on the goal of
 

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:16.040
of actually delivering on the goal of
truly universal health care but it's not

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.050
truly universal health care but it's not

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.080
I don't I don't think that it it is I
think the whole concept of post-partisan

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.090
think the whole concept of post-partisan
 

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.950
think the whole concept of post-partisan

the way that things really change is

through people being willing to take
 

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.490
through people being willing to take
positions and and fight for them and I

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500
positions and and fight for them and I
 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.530
positions and and fight for them and I
think the idea you can avoid the fight

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540
think the idea you can avoid the fight
 

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.590
think the idea you can avoid the fight

conflict but the it's impossible to
 

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.750
conflict but the it's impossible to
actually avoid it I mean you know in the

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760
actually avoid it I mean you know in the
 

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.870
actually avoid it I mean you know in the
ways in which he's been attacked for the

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880
ways in which he's been attacked for the
 

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.360
ways in which he's been attacked for the
reforms that he's tried to put through

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:47.370
reforms that he's tried to put through
 

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.030
reforms that he's tried to put through
especially in health care you can see

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040
especially in health care you can see
 

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.270
especially in health care you can see
this dynamic where he's putting

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:53.280
this dynamic where he's putting
 

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.030
this dynamic where he's putting
something forward that seems quite

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040
something forward that seems quite
 

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.250
something forward that seems quite
moderate really but it doesn't matter

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260
moderate really but it doesn't matter
 

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.530
moderate really but it doesn't matter
how moderate it is it still gets

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540
how moderate it is it still gets
 

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.600
how moderate it is it still gets
attacked and so that's why I think it's

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:02.610
attacked and so that's why I think it's
 

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.360
attacked and so that's why I think it's
it's it's I don't think he has a post

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.370
it's it's I don't think he has a post
 

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.740
it's it's I don't think he has a post
partisan president but I also think it

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:06.750
partisan president but I also think it
 

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.780
partisan president but I also think it
wasn't really the right thing to try for

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:11.790
 
 

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.550

to a anti-government set of positions
and I think that if Obama did try to

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:56.850
and I think that if Obama did try to
 

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.630
and I think that if Obama did try to
take things further to the left that we

00:15:59.630 --> 00:15:59.640
take things further to the left that we
 

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.700
take things further to the left that we
would see a stronger reaction against it

from those groups and from those people
 

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.150
from those groups and from those people
and unless you know unless there's

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.360
and unless you know unless there's
another kind of political movement that

another kind of political movement that
 

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.700
another kind of political movement that
comes into existence around something

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:13.710
comes into existence around something
 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.080
comes into existence around something
like health care that can really counter

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.090
like health care that can really counter
 

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.420
like health care that can really counter
it I think that they you know the

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.430
it I think that they you know the
 

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.570
it I think that they you know the
underlying ins for conservative success

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:20.580
underlying ins for conservative success
 

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.130
underlying ins for conservative success
are still there they haven't really

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.140
are still there they haven't really
 

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.890
are still there they haven't really
changed so I don't know whether will

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:25.660
happen in
 

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:30.150
happen in
the midterm elections or 2012 but I

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160
the midterm elections or 2012 but I
 

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.190
the midterm elections or 2012 but I
definitely think I wouldn't write the

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:47.480
 
well I think that today there is there's

and lower taxes and so on and so forth
and so there there's a sense that the

and so there there's a sense that the
 

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.590

social conservatives are really running

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600
social conservatives are really running
 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.230
social conservatives are really running

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240
the show you know I think that it is
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.840
the show you know I think that it is
complicated I mean III would both say

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:47.850
complicated I mean III would both say
 

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.000
complicated I mean III would both say
that it there's this question of what's

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.010
that it there's this question of what's
 

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.610
that it there's this question of what's
happened to the mainstream but even in

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620
happened to the mainstream but even in
 

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.170
happened to the mainstream but even in
the Republican Party there are still a

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:54.180
the Republican Party there are still a
 

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.730
the Republican Party there are still a
lot of people who are very committed to

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740
lot of people who are very committed to
 

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.360

this low tax anti-regulation program the

00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.370
this low tax anti-regulation program the
 

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.450
this low tax anti-regulation program the
problem is that I mean and and you know

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460
problem is that I mean and and you know
 

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.550
problem is that I mean and and you know
I think that the two sides people have

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:04.560
I think that the two sides people have
 

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.200
I think that the two sides people have
always been able to kind of hold both

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.210
always been able to kind of hold both
 

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.000
always been able to kind of hold both
positions and even though it seems like

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.010
positions and even though it seems like
 

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.640
positions and even though it seems like
there ought to be a conflict in actual

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:10.650
there ought to be a conflict in actual
 

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.670
there ought to be a conflict in actual
practice there isn't and we can talk

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:13.680
practice there isn't and we can talk
 

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.710
practice there isn't and we can talk
more about you know how these positions

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720
more about you know how these positions
 

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.420
more about you know how these positions
hold together but I think they do for

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:17.430
hold together but I think they do for
 

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.190
hold together but I think they do for
people and so it's not experienced as a

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200
people and so it's not experienced as a
 

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.860
people and so it's not experienced as a
contradiction exactly I think the real

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:21.870
contradiction exactly I think the real
 

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.160
contradiction exactly I think the real
issue for the the real anti-government

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.170
issue for the the real anti-government
 

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.870
issue for the the real anti-government
the hardcore anti-government people in

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880
the hardcore anti-government people in
 

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.880
the hardcore anti-government people in
Oakland the party is that the recession

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:28.890
Oakland the party is that the recession
 

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.910
Oakland the party is that the recession
and the financial crisis has really

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:31.920
and the financial crisis has really
 

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.040
and the financial crisis has really
called their ideology into question and

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.050
called their ideology into question and
 

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.530
called their ideology into question and
in a way that it hadn't been challenged

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:36.540
in a way that it hadn't been challenged
 

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.480
in a way that it hadn't been challenged
for some time and so just this sort of

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.490
for some time and so just this sort of
 

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.810
for some time and so just this sort of
pure market ideology now seems you know

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820
pure market ideology now seems you know
 

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.120
pure market ideology now seems you know
irresponsible Mike it led to this this

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.130
irresponsible Mike it led to this this
 

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.590
irresponsible Mike it led to this this
huge panic and so I think it's harder to

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600
huge panic and so I think it's harder to
 

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.900
huge panic and so I think it's harder to
advance it in the same kind of confident

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:50.910
advance it in the same kind of confident
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.130
advance it in the same kind of confident
directed way that we've seen in the past

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:53.140
directed way that we've seen in the past
 

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.900
directed way that we've seen in the past
I think you know it's funny you see the

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:54.910
I think you know it's funny you see the
 

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.450
I think you know it's funny you see the
other people in holding a party maybe in

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:57.460
other people in holding a party maybe in
 

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.210
other people in holding a party maybe in
response to the total failure of their

00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220
response to the total failure of their
 

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.960
response to the total failure of their
ideas with with recent economic events

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:03.970
ideas with with recent economic events
 

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.450
ideas with with recent economic events
trying to advance other ways out the

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:06.460
trying to advance other ways out the
 

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.430
trying to advance other ways out the
problem is that they're they're not from

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440
problem is that they're they're not from
 

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.390
problem is that they're they're not from
for them is that they're really not

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400
for them is that they're really not
 

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.410
for them is that they're really not
committed to it and so you know I just

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:13.420
committed to it and so you know I just
 

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.510
committed to it and so you know I just
think it creates real problems

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520
think it creates real problems
 

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.540
think it creates real problems
there's just something two contradictory

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:18.550
there's just something two contradictory
 

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.370
there's just something two contradictory
about saying the state can be used in

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.380
about saying the state can be used in
 

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.230
about saying the state can be used in
this way but not that way and I don't

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240
this way but not that way and I don't
 

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.410
this way but not that way and I don't
know I think it's internally incoherent

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.420
know I think it's internally incoherent
 

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.450
know I think it's internally incoherent
for them

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.460
 
 

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.430
 
I think it's just hard to be a

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440
I think it's just hard to be a
 

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.550
I think it's just hard to be a
libertarian today or to win new

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:33.560
libertarian today or to win new
 

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.690
libertarian today or to win new
supporters to libertarian causes you

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:37.700
supporters to libertarian causes you
 

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.930
supporters to libertarian causes you
know in the wake of the recession and

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:42.940
know in the wake of the recession and
 

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.090
know in the wake of the recession and
fiscal financial crisis at the same time

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.100
fiscal financial crisis at the same time
 

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.640
fiscal financial crisis at the same time
I think there's a lot of criticism of

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:48.650
I think there's a lot of criticism of
 

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.330
I think there's a lot of criticism of
the bailout and of the actions of the

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:52.340
the bailout and of the actions of the
 

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.160
the bailout and of the actions of the
state with regard to the auto industry

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.170
state with regard to the auto industry
 

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.440
state with regard to the auto industry
and a sense that Obama represents

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:58.450
and a sense that Obama represents
 

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.880
and a sense that Obama represents
business interests in some ways or has

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:00.890
business interests in some ways or has
 

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.560
business interests in some ways or has
been willing to work with business

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:02.570
been willing to work with business
 

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.260
been willing to work with business
people and hasn't taken them on directly

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.270
people and hasn't taken them on directly
 

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.030
people and hasn't taken them on directly
and I think this actually does fuel a

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:07.040
and I think this actually does fuel a
 

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.650
and I think this actually does fuel a
certain libertarianism I see and among

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:08.660
certain libertarianism I see and among
 

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.890
certain libertarianism I see and among
my students actually a sense that

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:11.900
my students actually a sense that
 

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.120
my students actually a sense that
there's this relationship between

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.130
there's this relationship between
 

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.640
there's this relationship between
business and government and neither is

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:15.650
business and government and neither is
 

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.370
business and government and neither is
really standing for the market and that

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:18.380
really standing for the market and that
 

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.620
really standing for the market and that
the market is the way to you know

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:20.630
the market is the way to you know
 

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.720
the market is the way to you know
success and prosperity for everybody so

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:22.730
success and prosperity for everybody so
 

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.360
success and prosperity for everybody so
I feel like that that idea actually is

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.370
I feel like that that idea actually is
 

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.200
I feel like that that idea actually is
given a lot of strength by the you know

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:29.210
given a lot of strength by the you know
 

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.320
given a lot of strength by the you know
by things like the bailout and by

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330
by things like the bailout and by
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.030
by things like the bailout and by
Obama's relationship with the financial

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.040
Obama's relationship with the financial
 

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.820
Obama's relationship with the financial
sector and banking industry and so I

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:36.830
sector and banking industry and so I
 

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.620
sector and banking industry and so I
think that that kind of thing

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.630
think that that kind of thing
 

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.390
think that that kind of thing
I mean that actually would speak to the

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400
I mean that actually would speak to the
 

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.080
I mean that actually would speak to the
a more rapid resurgence of conservatism

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.090
a more rapid resurgence of conservatism
 

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.340
a more rapid resurgence of conservatism
I suppose this sense that there's this

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:47.350
I suppose this sense that there's this
 

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.250
I suppose this sense that there's this
cozy nexus and a feeling of being

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.260
cozy nexus and a feeling of being
 

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.730
cozy nexus and a feeling of being
Outsiders and wanting you know a kind of

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:54.740
Outsiders and wanting you know a kind of
 

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.280
