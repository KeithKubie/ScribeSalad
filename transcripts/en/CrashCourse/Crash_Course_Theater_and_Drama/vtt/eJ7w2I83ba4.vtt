00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.189
Hey there!

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.590
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today we’ll be discussing the

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.020
Theater of the Absurd.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.020
Godot?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.270
That’s your cue.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.270
Godot?

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.270
Godot?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.650
It’s fine, plenty of time to wait for that
guy: not a lot happens in these plays.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:30.880
lights up, when you get around to it, I guess!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.860
INTRO
What is the Theater of the Absurd, and how

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.890
absurd is it?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.050
Glad you asked!

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.050
Very!

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
Sometimes.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.370
It’s a movement that got going in the 1950s,
influenced by the events of forties.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.249
Because, after you’ve come out of a world
war in which millions of people were killed,

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.239
with atrocity after atrocity, and the world
would never be the same, maybe light comedy

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.019
doesn’t really do it for you anymore.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.629
The Theater of the Absurd wasn’t one of
those moments where everyone hung out in bars

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.370
and had parties together.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.100
And maybe that’s good, because some of those
parties would have been… dour.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.719
No, it was more of a loose style that a bunch
of playwrights started writing in pretty much

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.940
independently.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.360
And then, one day, critic Martin Esslin noticed
and wrote an essay about it, and—bam!—a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.870
movement was born.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.270
Or identified.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.270
Or whatever.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.010
The Theater of the Absurd is another style
that rejects realism.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.300
Absurdism, like Dadaism and Surrealism, is
predicted on the idea that life doesn’t

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.550
really make sense.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.850
So theater shouldn’t make sense either.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.660
This isn’t absurd like comedy-in-2018, more
of a deeply dissatisfied, questioning kind

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.790
of absurd.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.430
Plots are disordered.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.550
Nothing happens, or if stuff does happen,
it’s unmotivated.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.380
Words don’t make meaning in the usual way,
and characters aren’t consistent.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.770
Mysteries don’t get solved, and order doesn’t
get restored.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.031
… LOL
Philosophically, the worldview of the Theater

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.170
of the Absurd is similar to existentialism,
probably because Esslin was

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.180
influenced by Albert Camus.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.020
In “The Myth of Sisyphus,” Camus wrote:

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.280
“A world that can be explained even with
bad reasons is a familiar world.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.280
But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly
divested of illusions and lights, man feels

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.590
an alien, a stranger.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.160
His exile is without remedy since he is deprived
of the memory of a lost home or the hope of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.890
a promised land.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.090
This divorce between man and his life, the
actor and his setting, is properly the feeling

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
of absurdity.”

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.980
… LOL
Esslin thought that the Theater of the Absurd

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.440
could help its audience to accept life as
meaningless and maybe not be so depressed

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440
about this.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.080
He wrote: “It is a challenge to accept the
human condition as it is, in all its mystery

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.070
and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity,
nobly, responsibly; precisely because there

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.900
are no easy solutions to the mysteries of
existence, because ultimately man is alone

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540
in a meaningless world.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.540
The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting
illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.840
it a sense of freedom and relief.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.010
And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre
of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.530
but the laughter of liberation.”

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.530
… … LOL?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.970
There are a lot of playwrights who get labeled
absurdist, including Alfred Jarry, Guillaume

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.910
Apollinaire, and also the Italian playwright
Luigi Pirandello, king of the it-happened-like-this-no-it-happened-like-that-nope-I’m-never-gonna-understand-this-because-the-world-is-fundamentally-unknowable

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.910
play.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.140
We’re going to look at three other absurdist
playwrights today, Jean Genet, Eugene Ionesco,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.140
and Samuel Beckett.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.130
Jean Genet was born in France in 1910 and
was abandoned soon after.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.440
As a kid, he tried to run away a lot, and
he often stole.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.350
When he was fifteen, he was sent to French
juvie.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.130
When he turned eighteen, he joined the French
Foreign Legion, but he was drummed out for

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.130
being gay.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.670
He wandered around for a while, supporting
himself with prostitution and petty theft.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.930
He was in and out of prison, and it was in
prison that he began to write, completing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.620
an experimental novel, “Our Lady of the
Flowers,” in 1944.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.310
Genet became popular with the French intellectual
crowd.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.800
So when he was threatened with life imprisonment
in 1949 for more theft, those intellectuals

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.510
came together to petition the government to
free him.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.770
And the government said okay.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.440
Philosopher and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre
was such a fan that he wrote a seven hundred-page

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.620
analysis of his life and work called “Saint
Genet.”

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.230
When Genet turned to the theater, first with
the short play “Deathwatch,” he established

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.460
the themes that would fascinate him for years:
sex, power, beauty, degradation, ritual, and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.650
theatricality itself.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.100
Most of the characters in Genet’s plays
are consciously playing roles that can suddenly

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.100
be reversed.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.580
And with a shift in power dynamics comes a
shift in sexual dynamics.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.020
Reality often shifts, too, which gives the
plays a disturbing, decentering quality.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.060
You can see this in “The Balcony,” which
is set in a brothel that caters to sexual

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.130
role play,
and in “The Blacks,” in which a cast of

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.710
black actors perform in white face.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.780
Genet died in Paris in 1986.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.700
Let’s take a closer look at Genet’s work
by dusting off his three-character 1947 drama,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.030
“The Maids.”

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.430
Grab a mop, ThoughtBubble:
“The Maids” begins with a scene between

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.270
a mistress and her maid, Claire.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.590
Their relationship isn’t great.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.380
Madame insults Claire, and Claire bullies
Madame, forcing her to wear a red dress.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.790
Claire spits at her.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.540
Then an alarm clock goes off, startling both
women.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.060
We realize that “Madame” is actually the
maid Claire, and “Claire” is her sister

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.000
Solange, and that this is an elaborate psychosexual
game they play, taking turns as Madame.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.690
As they wait for Madame, the phone rings.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.210
It’s Monsieur, Madame’s lover.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.490
He’s been in prison, mostly because of an
anonymous letter the maids sent.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.680
Now he is out on bail.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.730
Bad news for the maids.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.110
They’re afraid he’ll recognize their handwriting.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.699
They’re frightened, and also they’re disgusted
by their own poverty and servitude.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.690
As Solange says, “I want to help you.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.610
I want to comfort you, but I know I disgust
you.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.680
I'm repulsive to you.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.720
And I know it because—you disgust me.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.600
When slaves love one another, it's not love.”

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.490
Claire replies, “And me, I'm sick of seeing
my image thrown back at me by a mirror, like

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.850
a bad smell: You’re my bad smell.”

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.180
So out of revenge and disgust, and in a not
very sane attempt at self-preservation, Claire

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.700
decides to murder Madame.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.210
Madame returns, and Claire puts sleeping pills
into her tea.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.180
But before she can drink it, Solange tells
her that Monsieur is free, and Madame leaves

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.830
the tea untouched.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.820
The maids begin their game again, but this
time it’s darker, crueler, and even weirder.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.790
Claire is playing Madame.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.240
She orders Solange to bring her a cup of tea.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.509
Claire lies down on Madame’s bed and drinks
the poisoned tea, killing herself.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.979
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.770
That was not hygienic.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.050
While Genet based his play on an actual real-life
French murder, Genet was obviously not trying

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.449
to create true crime or realism.

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.770
Genet’s pal Sartre suggested that adolescent
boys should play all the roles as a way to

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.960
enhance the unreality.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.610
But with its gowns, flowers, and sadomasochistic
humiliation, it’s already pretty unreal.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.430
Our next absurdist is Romanian playwright
Eugene Ionesco, author of deceptively simple,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.990
sometimes allegorical works like “The Chairs”
or “Rhinoceros.”

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.520
Ionesco was born in Romania in 1909 and moved
between Romania and France several times.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.070
When Ionesco was almost forty, he decided
to learn English by memorizing simple sentences.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.470
Those sentences made their way into an absurdist
and sometimes silly work called “The Bald

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.470
Soprano.”

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.460
In this play, one nice couple, the Smiths,
invite over another nice couple, the Martins.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.669
The Martins think they are strangers to each
other and then discover they’ve been married

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:47.669
for years.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:49.669
Here’s an excerpt:
MRS.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.979
MARTIN: Bazaar, Balzac, bazooka!

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:53.979
MR.

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:55.250
MARTIN: Bizarre, beaux-arts, brassieres!

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.250
MRS.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.480
SMITH: a,e,i,o,u, a,e,i,o,u, a,e,i,o,u, i!….

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480
MRS.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.470
SMITH: Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo,
choo, choo, choo, choo, choo!

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:11.490
The director wasn’t really sure how to stage
it, and initially the play was a flop.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.110
But other writers and intellectuals championed
it—yay, intellectuals!—and Ionesco kept

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.110
going.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.860
Ionesco was influenced by Dada and the Surrealists,
and a lot of his work is about a desire to

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.680
access some other, better, probably unreachable
world.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.020
He’s best known for a cycle of plays centered
on a naïve everyman figure called Bérenger

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.120
who pops up in different times and situations.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.651
These plays are “The Killer,” “Rhinoceros,”
“Exit the King,” and “A Stroll in the

00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:36.651
Air.”

00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.190
Some of these plays have a more political
orientation, but some don’t.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.270
Bérenger is always struggling with the problem
of human endeavor and free will in a seemingly

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.680
random universe.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.630
Ionesco’s plays are written in simple, sometimes
even simplistic language.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.580
But that disguises serious preoccupations
and serious despair.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.790
Because, y’know, randomness, entropy, death.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.459
Ionesco died in France in 1994.

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.380
And this here is your friend and mine, Samuel
Beckett.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.590
Is Beckett the greatest modernist playwright?

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.590
Yes.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.470
I’m sorry, that’s just a fact.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.610
His plays are weird and funny and horrifying
and deeply moving.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.760
Just when you think you’ve got one of his
plays nailed, the meanings have a way of sliding

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.790
out from under you.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.960
We’re big fans.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.830
Beckett was born in Ireland in 1906.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.380
After university, he moved to France to teach,
where he eventually became the research assistant

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.850
of James Joyce.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.290
Beckett wrote poems, novels, and short stories.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.580
Also all great.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.430
And like Genet, he was at one point stabbed
by a pimp.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.600
He also drove Andre the Giant to school on
occasion!

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
True story.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.260
During World War Two, Beckett was active in
the Resistance.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.800
And after the war, he began his career as
a playwright, typically writing in French.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.350
His best-known play is “Waiting for Godot,”
a bleak tragicomedy from 1948 about two tramps

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.270
waiting for a man who—spoiler alert—never
arrives.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.790
One critic called it a play in which nothing
happens.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.790
Twice.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.860
It’s part vaudeville and part philosophy,
and honestly - it’s pretty awesome.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.800
I mean, it’s made fun of as a quintessentially
weird, modern play for a lot of good reasons…

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.200
but it is ALSO a good play.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.040
Other notable Beckett plays include “Endgame,”
“Happy Days,” “Krapp’s Last Tape,”

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.209
and “Play,” because there were no titles
left, I guess.

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:18.070
Beckett’s plays are almost completely empty
of action.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.990
The characters are barely there.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.870
The dialogue goes in circles.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.860
Every rule Aristotle ever wrote, Beckett breaks
except for unity of place.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.510
And as we all know, Aristotle never even wrote
that one!

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.480
Are Beckett’s plays realistic?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.730
Nooo.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.230
So why are his plays so great?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.990
They are about people trying to live in a
world that doesn’t make any sense.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.779
And that’s, I mean, that’s most of us.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:40.779
They are bleak.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:43.540
But they’re also very funny and perversely
humane.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.750
Even in a senseless world, we still have each
other.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.880
Beckett died in 1989, and, well …
Nothing to be done.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.980
Am I?

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.070
Me too.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.620
No.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.590
Not now, not now - there’s work yet to be
done!

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.590
Thanks for watching.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.100
We’ll see you next time when we take a break
from all of this existential despair and the

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.290
search for meaning in a seemingly random universe.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:28.470
Grab your Playbills and start stalking the
stage door, because Crash

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.690
Course Theater is going to Broadway, baby!

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.769
Oh wait.

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:41.330
Yorick says that existential despair is there,
too.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.930
Aaargh.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.710
Caftan, curtsy, cup-o-noodles…

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.309
Curtain!
