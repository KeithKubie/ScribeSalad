00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Welcome.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.820
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.120
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Thank you for coming.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.780
It's my great pleasure to be
here today to talk with Marie Lu.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160 position:56%
As most of you, probably all of you
know, she is the best-selling author

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.060
of the Legend and Young Elite
Series, books that have swept us

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.460
through time and taken us through
thrilling places and introduce us

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.620
to all sorts of dark and
complicated characters.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.140
Her new book, which I was lucky
enough to get early, is Warcross.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.510
It comes out in 10 days.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.190
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.660 position:56%
So I've had the privilege of
reading the book before it came out,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.730
and I can tell you that it
will keep you up all night,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.070
but it won't give you nightmares.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.110
It's a lot of fun.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.690
So this time, she takes us into
a world that she knows very well.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.480
It's about video games, and as you
may know, she previously worked

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.130
in the videogame industry, and
here she uses that experience

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.610
to create a very exciting story
set in the not-so-distant future

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.910
about another bad-ass
girl, if I can say that.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.210
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yes.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Yeah, she's a bad ass,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.840
but I'm not sure I'm
supposed to use that word.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.280
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: It's okay.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.810
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I said nice, but,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.270
she's a bounty hunter
named Emika Chen,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.750
and her life gets pretty
complicated when she hacks

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.200
into an immersive video game that's
sweeping, taking over the world.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.170
The book raises some very
thought-provoking questions

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.880
about technology, but it's also
just a really exciting story

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.500 position:56%
about a rainbow-haired heroine that
I think you're really going to love.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.800
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.620
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: And congratulations
on your book.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.160
I'm just going to give you a
little preview of the book.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.400
It's a teaser, not a spoiler.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.920
So it's a bit of a change for
you after The Young Elites.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.530
It's a little more personal, maybe,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.500
and it's back to Science Fiction
a bit after writing fantasy

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.880
in Young Elites, and I just wanted

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.680
to ask what made you decide
to go in that direction?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Sure, yeah, first
of all, thank you so much

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500
for having me here at the festival.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.220
This is my first time at
The National Book Festival.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.120
So I'm really excited to
be here to see you guys.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.420
Thank you.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.980
Thank you for being here.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.280
And I -- so before I became a
full-time writer, I used it to work

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.710
in video games, like you said,
and so I always knew that I wanted

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.150 position:56%
to write something to do with games.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.450
I just didn't know what
that story would be yet.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.520
I started with the Legend
Series, and Legend is a dark,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.480
futuristic story set in Los
Angeles about 100 years from now,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.640
and when I was developing the
Legend world, I made this bit

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.850
of world building that I wanted to
expand on, and in the Legend world,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.590
there is a society
set in Antarctica,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.580
which is now a habitable
place, because, you know,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.220
climate change is real, and
in this futuristic Antarctica,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.790
every part of the society
is completely gamified,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.320
and what that means is you
water a plant, you get a point.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.620
You know, you go to school

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.590
and answer a test question
correctly, you get five points.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.850
You level up in society that
way, and as you level up,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.940
you get perks in life or, you
know, better access to stuff,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.640
and that was how the society
worked, and I was only able

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.330
to use a very tiny part of that
when I wrote Legend's but I wanted

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.190 position:56%
to do something more with that idea.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.800
So I kind of kept that idea
in the back of my head.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.850 position:56%
It was like this little thing on the
shelf that I wanted to get back to.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.010
So then I wrote the Young
Elite Series which is,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.470
you know, very dark fantasy.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.680
It's about a girl who
essentially the teen girl version

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.880
of Darth Vader, and her
downfall to the dark side.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.050
So I was writing The Young
Elites feeling very emo

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.650
and depressed all this time,
because I kind of did not think

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.620
through the idea of,
oh, it'll be fun to be

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.770
in a villain's head,
but for four years.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.130
So I was about half way through
writing The Young Elites,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.290
and I love that series so much.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.340
It means a lot to me, but it was so
heavy, so heavy and hard to write

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.230 position:56%
that I had to have a palate cleanser
at the end of every workday.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.270
So I started writing this
book called Warcross.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.270
At the end of every workday
when I was like, ugh,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.220
I can't be in The Young
Elites world anymore.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.520
I need something fun.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.100
I need something happy.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.000
I would start world building
out of that little bit

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of world and the idea in Legend.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.960
So I started expanding
on this idea of this game

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.900
that would just sweep the world,
that everybody would love to play,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.790
that was based on virtual
reality and augmented reality

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.360
and all this new technology
that's coming out,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.970
and I would do a little bit of
that every night, and it would kind

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.590
of cheer me up again
and get be ready

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.490
to go again the next
day at The Young Elites.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.570
So that's what I did, and as I
did that, Emika Chen came to me,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.170
and she came very fully formed.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.040
She always had her rainbow hair.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.470 position:56%
For anyone who's ever read my books,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.450
you know I have an
obsession with hair.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.090
Everyone I like in my
books has nice hair.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.530
So Emika has the best hair.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.830
She has like every
color you can think

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.250
of in her hair, and she's a hacker.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.550
She's a tech girl.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.640
She's a gamer girl, and she's
struggling to get by and trying to,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.070
you know, do the right thing, and
her personality and heart kind

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.950
of melded with the idea of this
game that takes the world by storm,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.110
and from there, you know,
Warcross kind of took off,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.370
and I think it was
probably the most fun thing

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.340
that I've ever gotten to write.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.300
I had a really good time
writing it, which is odd for me.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.910
Usually, I struggle a
lot with my first drafts,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.920
and not to say I didn't
struggle with Warcross,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.640
but it was a more fun struggle.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.640
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So how much
of your experience working

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.810
in the videogame industry
is in the book?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: There's -- yeah,
that's a great question,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.090
because there actually are
a lot of little anecdotes

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.210
that crept into the story.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.040
Sometimes unconsciously.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.510
When I first started working
in games, I hopped into a kind

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.190
of spontaneously I
was supposed to go

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.740
to law school, which didn't happen.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.350
Apparently, my personality
just does not match with that,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.900
and the thing is, I loved my
political science classes.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.240
Love, love, loved them, and a
lot of that still creeps back

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.430
into my writing all the time,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.640
but I didn't have quite the right
personality to be, you know,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.130
at court in trial or going
through trial cases are anything.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.240
So, you know, at the end of the
school year, I was kind of like,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.030
all right, am I really
going to do this?

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.190
And I stumbled across this kiosk
on campus that had a bulletin

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.690
from Disney, Interactive Studios
and I applied and got into that.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.410
So I ended up in games, but I had
the best time that I've ever had

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.130
in a corporate job at Disney.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.710
What it was was it was a
think tank with eight interns,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.340
and they put us all in this
warehouse-like room in the middle

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:22.520 position:56%
of the Disney campus, and they just
told us come up with new game ideas,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.980
and every Tuesday, you'd
pitch your game ideas.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.070
If we like it, we'll greenlight it.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.530
You know, you get to pitch it
to Bob Iger, who is the CEO

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.830
of Disney, and all of that.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.360
So it was an incredibly fun job,
and the first time I was immersed

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.680
with seven other interns who
were also in the creative arts.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.990
So we had a lot of fun, and
a lot of Emika's teammates,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.140
and people that she comes across
in Warcross are very much based

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.900
on people that I was friends

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.940
with that I very much
enjoyed spending time with.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.200
You know, we would -- we worked
together eight hours a day,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.710
but after work ended, we
would still play, you know,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.970
Mario Kart for an hour together.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.140
We had like a fake wrestler
belt and everything.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.110
We had, you know, blue shells
and green shells on it,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.060
and if you won the last round
of the day, you got to hang it

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.360
over your desk the next day.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.500
It was like this big status symbol.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.010
In the company, like
our bosses would come

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.150
and challenge us for it and stuff.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.710
So it was really fun, and
Mario Kart makes its way

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.010
into the book, as well.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.310
That was an anecdote.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.610
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: And one of your dogs.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: And one of my dogs.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.480
Yes, Amber Corgi.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.090
And there is a Corgi who walks
across the stream, the page,

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.440
at one point in the story,
because I was like, you know,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.960
this book has all of my
favorite things in it.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.580
So I'm going to throw
my dog in there too.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.840
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I bet a lot
of people here, who, obviously,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.840
haven't read the book are
still thinking about Adelina,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.500
who is a complicated
and darker character,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.940
and you've called her
kind of Darth Vader.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.500
So I assume you're
a big Star Wars fan.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.390
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, yeah.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I guess, what made you
want to create such a complicated

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.220
and sometimes unlikable character,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.350
especially when you're
writing for a young audience?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.090
It seems like it's kind
of a risk to do that.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.640
So what was your motivation,
and how has that worked out?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.700
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, I
don't know why it is that.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.260
But I've always kind of
gravitated towards dark stories,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.560
ever since I was little.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.950
Like I think I was like 7, and
I would write wanted reports,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.090
like fake wanted reports of fake
criminals, because I saw them

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.090
on corkboards all the
time, and so I made

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.150
up wanted criminals all the time.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.970
You know, Legend is
about a teen criminal,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.340
and it's about a dystopian society.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.830
So The Young Elites is kind
of an extension of that,

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.070
but it is definitely the darkest
story that I've ever written,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.110
and I think it came about
because I really wanted

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.350
to explore the villain's journey.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.490
Because, you know, villains are
still people, and I think a lot

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.540
of times, people have a have
a tendency to label villains

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.160
as monsters, to kind of
distance themselves from humans.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.810
You know, like humans are human.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.040
How can a human possibly
do horrible things?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.650
We call them a monster
instead, but the worst monsters

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.860
in our history have been human.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.170
You know, they are people.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.250
People are capable
of terrible things,

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.920
and how do they get to that point?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.950
And the other path of
it is everyone thinks

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.640
that they're the hero, you know?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.640
Even the villain, from
their point of view,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.940
thinks that they're the hero.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.950
Darth Vader probably thought
he was doing the right thing,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.740
you know, for quite a while.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.780
Magneto thought he was
doing the right thing.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.980
Loki thought he was
doing the right thing.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.900
And in the process,
they become beasts.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.190
You know, they do these terrible,
terrible things in the name

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.280
of what they think is justice.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:44.350
So I wanted to explore the story of
this girl who starts off the story,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.450
you know, kind of in a
neutral ground, and slowly,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.340
through the course of terrible
injustices that happen to her,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.810
falls apart, because what
happens when you don't rise up,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.110
you know, to the occasion?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.600
What happens if you've been
beaten down all your life,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.300
and you don't choose, you
know, the better path?

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.100
You know, what happens to you,
and can you come back from that?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.050
You know, can you be redeemed
after doing terrible things?

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.130
So that was a lot of what it went
into the making of The Young Elites

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.640
and the making of Adelina,
and Adelina, you know,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.740
I said that I identify with Emika
the most, but every single one

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.100
of my characters has a piece of
myself in Adelina is no different.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.400
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: You seem so nice.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.700
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: I don't know
what that says about me.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.750 position:56%
You know, I try to draw on those
times when I've been angry or bitter

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.700
about things, or when people have,
you know, maybe not been good to me

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.580
or when I haven't been
good to people,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.330
and all of that went
into making Adelina.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.460
She is like the darker side of me,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.410
and the darker side
of people, I think.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.920
And, you know, it doesn't
mean that she's all dark.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.460
You know, she still
loves her sister.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:57.080
She has things that she
believes in, and she has a drive,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.380
and she has vulnerabilities.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.130
She was -- I love, love,
loved creating her,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.050
even though it was very
hard to be in her headspace.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.830
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I was going to
say, what's it like being there

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.690
and how do you cope with that?

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.990
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: It's rough.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.500
I had to listen to a lot of happy
music and dog pile with my dogs

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.820
at the end of every workday,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.650
and sneak in writing
on Warcross as I went.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.450
So I actually had to --
I had this little habit

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.390
that I would do every morning
when I wrote The Young Elites.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.910
And I have an evil playlist.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.910
It's named The Evil Playlist.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.240
So it's full of really dark,
angry music, and every morning,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.950
before I'd start writing, I would
have to put on like a half hour

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.640
of like everything sucks.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.940
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So what songs are --

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, God, I
think there was some Manson,

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.830
Marilyn Manson, some heavy metal.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.520
Stuff that I don't usually listen
to, but it was on there, and yeah,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.940
has some darker songs, which I --

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.680
you know, that are kind
of scary, and I like them.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.470
A lot of horror soundtracks.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.650 position:56%
Just, you know, stuff where I'm like
-- at the end of the day, I'm like,

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.500
okay, I feel sufficiently evil now.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.010
I can start writing.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.360
And then at the end of it, when
I finished writing every session,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.810
I would have to put on like
happiest music I can think of,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.620
my happy playlist, which I
never use, except at the end

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.260
of the writing day, and that
kind of helped me pull out of it.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.560
But it was rough.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.890
It was rough being in
her head for that long.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.750
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So about
how long does it take you

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.130
to finish one of your novels?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:28.610
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: On average, about a
year to do like to drafts on it.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.960
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: That's a lot of --

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.260
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: It's a lot.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.230
Yeah. It was four years of like
why am I this headspace again?

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.940
But, I mean, it was
definitely worth it.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.240
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Yeah, no, I --

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.200
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: I'm not
sure I'll do it again.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.710
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I know we
have a new character here.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.410
I know you have another.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.180
This is going to be to.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.480
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Two.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.780
It's a duology.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.080
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: A duology.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.270
Will Adelina come back in
another book, or can you say?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.260
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: That is a
really interesting question,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.550
because I did want to scatter a
few, little Easter eggs for my fans

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.130
and past readers of my first
two series into Warcross.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.060
So there's a few, little
things in there, and maybe,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.570
you know, you might catch it.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.870
Little references.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.470
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Okay, all
right, that sounds --

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.860
so, let's talk a little bit about
you sort of touched on villains,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.680
but about strong female characters,
because you've written a number

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.800
of them, and I know
that term is a little --

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Loaded, yeah.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.400
Yeah.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I wanted to talk
to you little bit about how you feel

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.470
about the term strong
female character.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.180
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: I think the term
strong female character exists

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.030
because women are not equal yet.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.360
I think we have to call out, oh,
she's a strong female character,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.960 position:56%
and, you know, early versions of the
strong female character were always

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.040
like she's strong in
a masculine way.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.340
She can kick ass.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.160
She can, you know, do all
the things that a man can do,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.170
but it doesn't really address
the fundamental, you know,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.620
heart of that term which
is women are people.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.230
We make mistakes.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.750
We do bad things.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.050
We can be feminine.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.350
We can weak.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.510
We can be all of these
things just like,

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.200
you know, a male character can.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.550
Nobody ever says strong
male character,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.100
because you don't have
to think about that.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.950
There are so many male
characters that they run the gamut

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.360
of everything you can think of.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.430
So you think of them as like he's a
complicated male character or he's,

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.070
you know, he's a well-rounded
male character

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.040
for three dimensional
male character.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.940
That's what makes a strong
character, and I think, I mean,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.010
that's how I try to approach
my female characters,

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.410
because Adelina is not a good girl.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.390
You know, she kicks ass, but
she's not, you know, a warrior.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.690
She doesn't know how to fight.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:47.990
She loves dresses.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.190
She's not, you know, masculine.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.570
She's not strong because
she's masculine or anything.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.480
She's strong because of her
complexities and her weaknesses.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.730
That's what makes her who
she is, Emika is, hopefully,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.240
complex in a different way,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.590
and they're very different
personalities.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.980
We try to say strong.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.170
I think what we should be
saying is they're real people.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.350
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: That's fair.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.980
So I just want to take
a step back a little bit

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.280
and talk about your process.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.360
You talked about -- the music,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.560
but I know you also
are a wonderful artist.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.250
I've seen your -- I don't
know if you've seen Pintrest.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.810
She has her drawings.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.390
So I just want to know
how do your drawings play

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.390
into the process of your writing?

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.610
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, it's actually
a fundamental part of my process.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.040
Before I ever start
writing the first draft,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.600
I have to draw my characters
out on paper physically,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.150
and I will do little doodles
and maps of environments,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.890
just to help myself get into
the mindset of that new story.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.760
I find that if I don't do that,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.090
I actually have trouble
understanding my characters

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.380
or getting a handle on
their personalities.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.180 position:56%
I have to be able to see them on
the page, and that can mean me doing

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.130
like 50,000 doodles of the
same character before I'm like,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.990
I think that's kind of what
she looks like, and also,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.290
I do it when I procrastinate.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.360
So if I have writers block,
we'll see me uploading art.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.980
So you know exactly when
I have writers block.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.750
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I suspect there
is some budding writers here

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.850 position:56%
in the audience, I just wanted to --

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:34.040 position:56%
if you could just tell us a little
bit about how you went from the room

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.560
where you were trying to
get your video game created

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.280
into doing this whole other thing.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.620
Can you tell us a little
bit about your story?

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.290
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Absolutely.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.750
So I started writing
from a really young age.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.470
I came over to the United States
when I was five from China in 1989,

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.010
and my parents and I
settled in Louisiana,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.540
and one of the first things my mom
gave me to do as an assignment was

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.120
to go to kindergarten every day
and write down five English words

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.760
that I didn't know and look
them up in the dictionary

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.420
and put them into paragraphs.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.350
So that was technically
how I started writing.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.740
And eventually, when I figured out
enough of the language to know what

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.790
to do with that, I realized that
it just really enjoyed the process

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.190
of putting together these
little stories for myself.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.110
So I started stapling together
little booklets and writing,

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.550
you know, pretend novels of my own
when I was like seven or eight.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.590
So I started pretty young.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.390
I didn't know that writing was
a real job that people can do.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.790
I do know that the books that
I was reading came from people.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.520
I don't know where I
thought they came from.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.820
Not from people.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.040
So it wasn't until I was
a teenager, when I was 13

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.180
or 14 that I realized that, and
that was when I thought, okay,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.390
I really want to be
a published writer.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.370
I would love to share my novels.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.550
So I started writing really bad
novels when I was in high school,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.770
and the way that I
found time to write was

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.010
that I would set my alarm
clock for 2 in the morning,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.900
and I would use my bathrobe
to plug the bottom of my door,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.770
so my parents didn't
know I was awake.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.960
And I would write for two hours
in the middle of the night.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.840
I was a very sleepy person
going through high school.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.300
I don't know if I would
recommend that tactic.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.510
But I say that just because,
you know, I was listening

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.150
to the wonderful Sabaa Tahir
talking earlier, and I really,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.870
really firmly believe that the
fact that, you know, would you feel

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.940
that it should, that burn
to write, you find a way.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.950 position:56%
You carve it into your life somehow.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.250
It doesn't have to be a lot.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.850
It could be five words a day.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.210 position:56%
You know, it could just be imagining
something because, you know,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.920
life is hard for a lot of people.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.920
It's hard to find that
time to do this.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.400 position:56%
But you know, if you want to write,
it's in there, and you'll find a way

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.820
to get on the page, and for
budding writers out there,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.840
I think the number one thing

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.090
that I wish I had known
earlier was it's okay

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.370
to write a bad first draft.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.990
This is still something that I
struggle with, because I want

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.140 position:56%
to get the perfect vision of it into
my head onto the page in one go,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.440
and it's just impossible.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.580
And I've learned over the years
that you just can't do that.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.570
It's okay to write
a bad first draft.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.620
The best writers I know
right bad first drafts.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.290
The most important thing
is to finish that draft.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.610 position:56%
Once you have something on the page,
then you can go back and rip it

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.210
up to pieces and edit it and add
things in and take things out

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.040
and all of that, and that's
how you create a book.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.060
I struggled with that
for a long time.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.980
I wrote four novels before
I was able to get published.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.450
None of them were able
to make it anywhere.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.340
You know, I was able to get
an agent with my second novel,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.160
but we submitted it everywhere.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.220
Nobody wanted it, because
it just wasn't good enough,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.550
and then I gave him my third
novel, and my agent hated it.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.840
Then he dropped me as a client.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.610
So I was right back to square
one with no novel and no agent.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.460
So it's hard.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.970
For most writers I know, you know,

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.860
we go through many,
many, many drafts.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.680
Many unfinished manuscripts, many
unpublished books before you get

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.550
to the point where
you are good enough.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.750
But you can't get there
unless you get the bad words

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.050
out of your system.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.450
So, you know, keep writing.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So about how many
drafts do you do of your novels now?

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, it varies
so much from book to book.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:36.620
So Legend had two major
rounds of edits on the draft.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.840
The Young Elites had maybe 20.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.840
So it runs the gamut.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.040
It depends on the book,
and it depends

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:53.280
on how good the first draft is,
I suppose, but at some point,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.130
you eventually reach
the final version of it.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.120
With The Young Elites, I actually
wrote an entire half of a book

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.620
that I had to completely throw
away, because my agent was like,

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.610
this is going in the
right direction.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.540
And she was absolutely right, and I
had to throw it all away and start

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.160
over from scratch, and
it sucks, but, you know,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.390
it's part of the process,
and, you know,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:20.580
you end up finishing
it at some point.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.360
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So like who are your
other favorite writers, either YA,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.560
Science Fiction, or whoever?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.160
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, well, so many.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.740
I'll start with like my
earliest inspirations.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.350
My first introduction to Fantasy

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.880
and Science Fiction was
Brian Jacques Redwall series.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.240
I absolutely love,
love, love that series.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.120
It's one of my favorite
series of all time,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.920
and the first time I read one.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.220
I was obsessed.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.170
It was my gateway into the rest
of fantasy and Science Fiction.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.170
From then on, I read pretty
much every Science Fiction

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.290
or Fantasy I could get my hands on.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.500
Now I read almost exclusively YA.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.800
I love YA.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.120
I think it's just this vast,
rich, lush field of good writing,

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.170
and many of my contemporaries,
you know,

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.960
my fellow writers are
amazing, and I'm fans of them.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.650
Sabaa Tahir, who was just up here.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.200
I'm a huge fan of her work,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.600
and Ember in the Ashes is
an amazing fantasy series.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.250
On the contemporary side,
The Sun is Also a Star

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.990
by Nicola Yoon is just beautiful,
heartbreakingly beautiful.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.930
So is Everything, Everything,
which just came out is a film.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.690
I think she's one of the best
contemporary writers working today.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.970
Leigh Bardugo's Six of Crows is
an incredibly written fantasy.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:43.030
It's so rich and complex, and
Leigh is just a wonderful person

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.200
and a wonderful writer.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.470
So those are some of my
favorites off the top of my head.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:53.160
Lluminae is a Science Fiction
novel that is just fantastic.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.410
It's by Amie Kaufman
and Jay Kristoff.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.960
Their latest comes out
next spring, I think.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.110
Obsidio is the third one.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.580
I could keep going forever.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.020
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: We got 14 minutes.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Okay, and I'll give one
more and then we'll go to questions.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.340
Forest of A Thousand
Lanterns by Julie C. Dao.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.820
It's a debut novel.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.120
You guys have to check it out.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.420
It comes out on October 3rd.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.070
So it's right around the corner.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.670
It's a beautifully
written fantasy novel,

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.970
and I think you guys would love it.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.270
Forest of A Thousand Lanterns.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.440
Yeah, and that was our
15-minute mark, I think.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.270
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Yeah,
so The Legends movie.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.570
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.590
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I hope it -- I
hope is not a sensitive subject,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.160
but as you can see, it's been
a subject of great interest.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.900
Can you tell us anything
about where that stands?

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.070
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, it's always
hard to talk about Hollywood stuff,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.260
because I don't usually
know anything.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.340
But with Legend, there is
something exciting happening.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.680
I can't say anything yet, because
we are still in negotiations.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.580
But hopefully, I can
share something soon.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.880
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Okay.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: That was very cryptic.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.090
I'm sorry.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.980
That was like a nonanswer.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.710
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: So I know you have --
how far are you in the next book,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.080
and this is the worst
question for any writer.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.040
What are you doing next?

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.500
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: I am working
on Warcross II right now,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.320 position:56%
and I am also on the tail end of it.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.910
It's for a Batman, which is coming
out January 2nd of next year.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:28.260
It's a YA novel about 18-year-old
Bruce Wayne and a young villain

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.060
that messes with his head.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.230
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Interesting, so
that's a completely different --

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, thank you.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.420
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: No, go ahead.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.720
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, no, I was like --

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.720
and I guess we can
open up to questions

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.130
from the audience whenever
you're ready.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.430
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: That'll be great.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.730
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.030
But thank you so much.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.330
This was so wonderful.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.630
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Thank you.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.930
[ Whispering Inaudibly ]

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.230
So if you want to line
up at the mics.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, okay.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.370
Well, we can go with one more
question while people are getting

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.670
ready, I guess.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.970
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I was can
ask you about your shoes.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.000
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, thank you.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.350
One of my best friends is Tahir
Amafi and [assumed spelling] who,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.670
if you don't follow
her on Instagram,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.060
she is one of the most
fashionable people I know,

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.780
and she is like the queen of shoes.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.090
So whenever she recommends shoes
for me, I'm like, I'm getting it.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.220
So that's my collection of shoes.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.500
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: I can't see.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.800
We can't really see you.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Well, we'll start on
this side with the striped shirt.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.760
&gt;&gt; My name's Lanelle
Hilling [assumed spelling].

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.820
I'm a middle school librarian
and Marshall, which is a couple

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.580
of counties away, and
I just want to say

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.950
that this book is a gateway
drug for my young students.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.370
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Oh, thank you.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.670
&gt;&gt; It truly is.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.230
I mean, I'm almost teary.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.800
You're just so amazing.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.710
And your work, if I
can get a young man

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.170
to start this book,
he will be a reader.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you very much.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.770
I really appreciate it.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.070
&gt;&gt; They read it through.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.640
They love it, and just the fact you
have it told from his point of view

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.990
and her point of view, it's
just incredible and outstanding.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.290
I'm just so grateful.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.740
They're really, really good.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.040
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.790
&gt;&gt; They are.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.230
[ Applause ]

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.530
I mean, I've seen it.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.830
It's amazing.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.670
The kids who, they don't want
to read, but they'll read it.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.790
So I wanted to ask, in Champion, at
the end, there's always that, oh,

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.060
well, you know, do they get back
together and that kind of thing?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.990
And I've often wondered,
to me, June and Day,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.470
their actions speak much
more than their words.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.150
So is it fair to have
a positive kind

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:33.410
of happy view on the
end of that book?

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.350
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Well, I don't
want to give any spoilers away.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.640
So I don't know.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.850
It depends on how one reads
the ending, I suppose.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.260
But, yeah, I don't know if
I can say much about it.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.140
I don't want to spoil anyone who
hasn't read the ending, but Day

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.670 position:56%
and June are very close to my heart.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.310
They're some of my favorite
characters I've ever written.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.990
So hopefully, you like the ending,
if you get a chance to read it.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.580
Thank you.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.040
And on this side.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.410
&gt;&gt; I love the Legend Series.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.710
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.830
&gt;&gt; I started crying at the end of
Prodigy, but I was just wondering,

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.460
do you miss your characters
after you write them?

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.980
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Do I miss my
characters after I write them?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:20.030
I do. I do, and it's weird,
because at the end of my stories,

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.180
I get this weird feeling like
they don't belong to me anymore.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.870
They belong to the public and
to the readers and to you.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.900
So I miss them in that
they're not in my head anymore.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.690
They kind of wander off
into like the great,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.530
big yonder characters go
to after series finish.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.150
I was a big fan of
fanfiction when I was a kid.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.040
I wrote a ton of fanfiction
of everything

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.440
like Harry Potter fanfiction,
Redwall fanfiction.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.980
So it makes me happy knowing
that there are, you know,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.120
readers out there who will
make their own versions

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.560
of the stories they love.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.950
And so that is a way of keeping
characters alive after, you know,

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.330
the writer finishes
writing about them.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.840
But I do miss them a lot.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.140
Thank you.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:12.740
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Elizabeth Kind, and I
love you so much, and I'm sorry.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.950
I was wondering, Rafael
did say that he loved Enzo.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:24.830
Was that brotherly or was there
something between them possibly?

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yes, he
absolutely loved Enzo

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.210
in a more than brotherly way.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.010
Yes.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.220
[ Laughing ]

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.470
&gt;&gt; Also, you mentioned that
she wrote a couple of stories

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.760 position:56%
about these characters just for fun.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.810
Would you ever consider
releasing those?

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.280
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, I hope so.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.870
There are a couple of like random
chapters that never made it

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.880
into the books, and a
couple of like shorts.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.360
There's one about Margiono that
I would like to put out there

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.260
at some point, but I
need to edit it first.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.970
Because it's not legible
for others yet.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.160
But thank you, I'm so
glad you like the series.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.760
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.060
Yeah?

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I've only read Legend,
but I loved it, I thought it was

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.420
so great, and it's like
my favorite book ever,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.720
but this is a totally
random question.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.020
But you mentioned Star Wars,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.720
and I was wondering do you have
a favorite Star Wars character,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.060
and what you think
of the new movies?

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.560
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Was my
favorite Star Wars character?

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.210
Oh, my God.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.210
I love the new Star Wars movies.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.580 position:56%
I think they're the Star Wars movies
that should have always been around.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.380
And I love Rey.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.780
I think she's great.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.480
I think she's optimistic
and hopeful, and you know,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.660
the lady that we've been
waiting for with Star Wars,

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.770
and I think they're doing a
lot of things right with it.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.840
&gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned
that you were an artist,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.140
and so I was just wondering,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.120
like you have like any say
what happens in your covers?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.650
Because that's what originally
drew me to your book series

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.070
in the first place, because
they're like really cool.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.370
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.980
That is all a testament to my
wonderful publisher, Penguin.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.130
Who has published all of my books.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.100
I do get to give some
feedback on my covers.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.180
Ultimately, the publisher
is the one who comes

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.550
up with the cover concepts,
and they show them to us.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:19.040
But I've been very, very
fortunate to have amazing covers.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.260
I've seen all of the early
drafts of all of my covers.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.950
Warcross, you know, we went through
several different rounds of it,

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.700
and it ended up with a cover
that I absolutely love.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.820
I think it's colorful and
gorgeous, I love all of my covers.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.890
Some so whether you like them.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.350
They are the -- they are
birthed from my publisher.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.950
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.250
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Shasida
[assumed spelling],

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.530
and I know that you touched on
authors that you were inspired by,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.900
but I was wondering if there's
like any book or story characters

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.600
that inspire you, aside
from Star Wars?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.900
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.950
I'm inspired by anything
and everything.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.070
All kinds of creative media.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.320
All of the authors that I
mentioned are a huge inspiration

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.620
to me in many ways.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.440 position:56%
They are both talented, brilliant
writers and also really good people,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.840
and so they inspire me on the page

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.550
and off the page to
be a better person.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.850
I'm also inspired by, you know,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.060
other types of creative
medium outside of books.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.360
You know, I'm a gamer.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.690
So I love games.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.640
I think that videogames can
be an incredible art form,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.290
and is a vast field, just
like young adult fiction is.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.050
There's games like -- if
you've never played some

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.900
of these indie games,
check them out.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.330
Journey is this transcendent,
beautiful work of art.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.030
It's two hours long.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:44.380 position:56%
It's on the PS4, and Monument Valley
is one of my favorite mobile games.

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.290
It's also beautiful.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.360
It's Azure-like geometry
based puzzles.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.720
So a lot of these things
inspire me, as well.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.340
I'm inspired by artists and art
work, by creators of all kinds,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.640
by filmmakers and by musicians.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.880
So they all kind of meld into one
and go into the books in some way.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.480
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.780
&gt;&gt; From a writer's perspective,

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.380
what do you think is the
fundamental difference

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.430
between YA Fantasy
and Adult Fantasy?

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.370
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Well, the fundamental
difference is kind of the same

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.030
as YA is different
from Adult Fiction.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:27.380
It's that Young Adults Fantasy
and Fiction is about young people,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.950
and it centers on young people in
a way that Adult Fiction doesn't.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.030
So even if Adult Fiction is
written about a person who's young,

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:39.240
it's usually an adult looking back
on their life as a young person.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.600
Whereas Young Adult fiction
is about the here and now.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.900
Like I am young.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.350
This is what's happening
to me right now,

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.040
and I love that about Young
Adult fiction and Fantasy,

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.880
and I feel like Fantasy, for, you
know, many old series of Fantasy,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.250 position:56%
if they were published today, would
be qualified as Young Adult fantasy,

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.250
because a lot of main characters
in Fantasy were teenagers.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.890
You know, if they were
published today,

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.450
they would absolutely be
considered Young Adult Fantasy.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:12.370
So I think Fantasy has always
been very heavily Young Adult.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.960
It's just that now we
have a label for it.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.970
So I'm obviously a
huge fan of YA Fantasy.

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:23.230
I think YA Fantasy is hopeful and
optimistic than adult Fantasy is.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.650
I love adult fantasy, but
it's very gritty and very dark

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.920
and sometimes doesn't and happily.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.890
So I think Young Adult, that is the
hallmark of young adult fiction.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.690
There is always that thread
of hope running through it,

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:37.100
because young people in those
books are making decisions

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.900
and changing the world for the
better and fighting against,

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.040
you know, everything horrible
to make a better world,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.580
and I find that very inspirational.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.550
Yes?

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:51.690
&gt;&gt; So you said that you wrote
four novels before it was

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.150
actually published.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.830
What made you keep writing?

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:58.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: What made
me keep writing?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:02.460
It is such a great question,
because there were definitely times

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.900
where I stopped, where
it got too hard.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.820
My first book that I ever
wrote was really horrible.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.120
I hope you guys never read it.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.830
I wrote it when I was 14, and
it was basically a rip-off

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.460
of Lord of The Rings but bad.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:21.370
So I wrote that and submitted it
to agents, and it got rejected

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.090
by everybody, of course,
as it should.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:28.150
And I wrote a second one
that got me my first agent,

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:30.180
who shopped it around,
and nobody wanted it,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.080
and then my third one was the
one that got dropped by him.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.200
So at that point, I was in college,

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.050
and I stopped writing,
because of that.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.640
It was so disheartening.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.070
I don't know why I
thought, you know,

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.180
that this would be an easy journey.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.200
I think, you know, people leap into
things because you believe in it,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.460
and you want to do it, and you
believe that you can do it,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.570 position:56%
but at some point, you know, it gets
hard, and I absolutely sympathize

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.990
and understand with people.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.880
You try to do something, and you
keep failing and failing and,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.060
you know, it can be really hard
to pick yourself back up again.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.050
So when I was in college, I stopped
writing for a good two years or so,

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.420
because one, I thought I
wasn't a good enough writer.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.790
I thought, you know,
this is a personal thing.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.690
I was taking rejections personally,

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.540
which I don't think
anyone should have to do.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.720
The rejections are for the writing
at that point of time in your life

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.370
and not for you as a writer,
as with the soul of a writer.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.320 position:56%
I didn't realize that at that point.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.430
So I stopped writing because
I was like, you know what?

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.730
This is a sign that I'm not meant

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.370
to be a writer, and
maybe I should stop.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.710
And maybe adults don't
write fantasy.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.700
Like that's not a thing
that adults like.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.000
I should be serious.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.300
I should grow up.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.670
I should age out of this and
stop chasing this fantasy.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.070
You know, no pun intended.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.060
So I stopped writing for two
years, and it took me going

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.190
into the videogame
industry, actually,

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:55.710
to convince me to start
writing again.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.360
Because that was the first
time in my life where I was

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.530
with other young people who love
games, who loved the creative arts

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:03.920
and weren't ashamed of it.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.940
You know, love what they were
doing, that was the moment

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.430
where I was like, oh, okay.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.820
It's okay to love these things, and
I'm going to write no matter what.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.500
Because if you're a
writer, you know, whether

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.730
or not you get published, it's
a part of you, it doesn't matter

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:18.100
if you're published or unpublished.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.400
You're a writer.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.700
We're all writers.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.000
If you write, you're a writer.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.250
So with that in mind, I
started writing again,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.550
because I was like, you know what?

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.850
Who cares?

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.150
I'm just having fun.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.450 position:56%
You know, this is what I want to do.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.750
So I'm going to do it.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.120
And I wrote another book
which didn't get published,

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.500
and because of, you know, the
rejections that I had gotten before

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.540
and this new revelation,
I was able to keep going

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.640
after this fourth kept
getting rejected.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.940
I was like, okay, you know what?

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.240
It's fine.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.830
I'll make a fort out of
the rejection letters.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.630 position:56%
And then I wrote this book, and that
was Legend, and it got published.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:54.540 position:56%
So yeah, you keep going because you
never know what's on the other side.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.140
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.440
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.740
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Hi

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.230
&gt;&gt; I admire your persistence, and
I love all of your books so much.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.250
&gt;&gt; So you said you were writing
about a young Bruce Wayne.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.550
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yes.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.850
&gt;&gt; Oh, a young Bruce Wayne.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.150
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: A young Bruce Wayne.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.690
&gt;&gt; So how did you end
up writing about Batman?

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.100
How did that happen?

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.400
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Yeah, Batman.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.610
So what happened was I got
an email from agent one day,

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.520
and she said DC is doing a
partnership with Random House.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.280
They're going to create four YA
novels based on four superheroes.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.580
Are you interested?

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.880
And I was like, yes!

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.510
I would like to write about
Nightwing, and then my agent was

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:36.850
like please read the
rest of the email.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.760
That's not one of the choices.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.100
So I kept reading it, and the
poor choices were wonder woman,

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.910
Batman, Superman, and Catwoman.

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.710
And so a lot of those
four, I was like, oh,

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.430
bat family, Batman, please.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.510
And I've been so lucky
to build work on this.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.830
It's really fun to explore
18-year-old Bruce Wayne, because,

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.120
you know, nobody ever talks
about 18-year-old Bruce Wayne.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.420
What happened to him as a teenager?

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.720
Who knows?

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.300
So that was really fun, and
I hope you guys like it,

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.210 position:56%
I think we can do no more questions.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.420
I'm so sorry, but thank you so much
for asking questions, you guys,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.720
and thank you for having me here.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.020
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: Thank you.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.780
&gt;&gt; Marie Lu: Thank you.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.230
[ Applause ]

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.890
