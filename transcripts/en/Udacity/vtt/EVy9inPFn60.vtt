00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.310
Before we import our first project,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.680
let's take a peek at
what we just downloaded.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.790
You'll see a ton of folders.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.510
Each one contains a LibGDX project
that's either some demo code,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.080
the starting point of an exercise,
or our solution to an exercise.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.890
That's right.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.920
All the answers to the coding exercises
are right here in the course code,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.759
just means we can give you
a tougher problems, right?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.070
Each folder is numbered by
where it goes in the course.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.730
So the demo code for
the first lesson, second level,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.182
which is what we're doing right now,
is in 1.2.

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:33.110
If we open up this folder,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.050
it looks like there's a ton
of different files in here.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.520
But just staring at this file list for

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400
a moment,
the word that pops out is gradle?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.318
Let's see there's build.gradle,
gradle.properties, a gradle folder,

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.260
a bunch of other stuff.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.310
What is this gradle thing?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.035
I thought we were working with LibGDX?
