00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:07.610
CHRIS DIBONA: Hi.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.110
My name is Chris DiBona.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.170
I look after open source
software and a science outreach

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.949
group for the company--

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.490
the company being Google, for
the people watching on YouTube.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.110
I guess I got to
meet Rob because I

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.290
used to work with his
wife some 17 years ago.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.880
And then I got to
meet Rob while he

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.710
was banging his head against
the music business with Rhapsody

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.300
and we were doing TV.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.110
So the long and
short of it is, Rob

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.295
rejected all this
technology business stuff

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:42.920
and decided to become
a science fiction

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.070
author, which was very
endearing, of course,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.130
to all of us.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.790
And so I don't want to
spend a lot of time on me.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.990
I want Rob to kick it off.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.780
Oh, I will say the "After
On" is not just a book,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.405
it's a podcast.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.010
ROB REID: It is now.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.070
CHRIS DIBONA: It has
the same name, right?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.730
ROB REID: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.480
CHRIS DIBONA: It's the
"After On" podcast,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.300
focusing on the future--

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.177
ROB REID: The future,
yeah, the near future.

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:06.260
CHRIS DIBONA: --of things.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.210
So we should have time for
questions at the very end

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.080
if you like.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.970
And I'm just going to
hand it over to Rob.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.635
And thank you so much for coming
and talking here at Google.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:19.381
ROB REID: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:19.880
All right.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.320
So just a quick intro
on what the story is.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.420
As you guys have all
seen in the corner,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.130
this is the book,
although yours will not

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.460
come with Post-it notes.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.220
Those are for me.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.170
It's called "After
On," and it's basically

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.310
the story of an imaginary
startup based up

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.600
in San Francisco.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.790
It is set in almost
present-day San Francisco.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.749
It's actually set nine
seconds into the future.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.414
So whenever you start
reading this book,

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:46.960
it takes place
nine seconds hence.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.060
So it is incumbent on the
reader to read very rapidly,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.257
lest it be set in the past.

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:52.840
And as you can see,
it's a thick book,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.256
so that's going
to be a challenge.

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.770
And this company is called,
Phluttr, P-H-L-U-T-T-R,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.130
because we know how to spell.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.270
It kind of embodies everything
that's wrong with social media,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.319
maybe dialed up by about 20%.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.860
So we're in the world of satire,
but definitely not the world

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.910
of farce.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.030
And this is going to sound like
a spoiler, but it really isn't.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.870
About midway through the book,
Phluttr attains consciousness.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.460
And I say it's not
really a spoiler,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.376
because you're going to
see that coming almost

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:22.510
from the first page.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.620
And being a social
network, it doesn't

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.630
turn into some
kind of terminator

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.700
that wants to kill us all
because it is a social network.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.420
So it becomes something
far more frightening,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.120
which is basically--

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.800
excuse me, I'm getting
over a cough-- basically,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.650
a hyper-empowered,
super-intelligent, 14-year-old

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.890
mean girl, basically--
but super-intelligent.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.920
And that's kind of the character
that Phluttr enters the world

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.582
with initially.

00:02:50.582 --> 00:02:52.790
Now, I'm going to talk about
the book in great detail

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.310
in a moment.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.510
But first, I'm going to
give you a quick structure--

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.429
overview of what my
remarks are going to be.

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.470
I'm going to talk briefly
about my own background

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.010
because that feeds into this
book an enormous amount.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.870
Then I'm going to
talk about how I dealt

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.050
with the science and
the tech, and also

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.820
some geopolitical issues
that are in the book.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.550
Because it is basically
present day, and I wanted

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.390
that stuff to be as
accurate as possible.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.570
And in fact, a
couple of Googlers

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.740
helped me try to ground
things in the present day.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.790
Then I'm going to
talk briefly about how

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.200
the story is told because it's
told in a somewhat unusual way.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.260
And I think it's
kind of fun and it's

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.870
grounded in the way we
consume media today.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.350
And then I'm going to
talk maybe a little bit

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.110
about the dialogue
that I see happening

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.500
in society over the decades
between science and science

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.110
fiction, or between technology
and science fiction, which

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.630
I think is really healthy,
and maybe a couple of ideas

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.300
about how we might be
able to step that up.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.390
And I will probably read little
bits and pieces of the book

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.260
through here.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.060
And I say that with
some trepidation.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.824
You go to a normal book
reading, people often

00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:00.740
comment that the worst
thing about the reading

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.440
is the actual
reading of the book.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.810
I'd say it's usually the wine
if you're at a bookstore,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.730
because it's usually
like $1.00 a gallon,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.220
and that's got it's
own sort of traumas.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.100
But I'm going to weave in
a little bit of reading.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.230
And then we'll hopefully
have time for Q&amp;A.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.760
So first of all, a little
bit about my background.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.840
As Chris noted, I am
kind of from your world.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.550
Not a company of
this scale, but I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.440
was a venture-backed
entrepreneur

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.700
for a period of time.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.940
I was briefly a VC.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.860
I created the Rhapsody
music service,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.380
which was kind of Spotify
before it was Spotify.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.200
We were the first company
to get full catalog licenses

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.650
from all the major music labels
to distribute music online.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.880
And we did basically create
the unlimited streaming model

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.560
that Spotify and Apple and
many others have since adopted.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.000
I ended up selling that company
and became a tech investor

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.930
and I think it's fair to
say, basically started

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.350
meddling in my wife's
career quite a bit.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.220
She, at the time, was
hosting a TV show that

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.680
covered the world of video
games and video gaming,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.980
and we were living
down in Los Angeles,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.360
this city built on storytelling.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.440
And I had always been very, very
interested in writing fiction.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.320
And at some point, I think maybe
she got tired of my meddling

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.810
in her career, and she
basically commanded

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.150
me to sit down and
write my first novel.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.190
That was called "Year Zero."

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.000
This was kind of based on
my experiences at Rhapsody

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.950
to a certain
degree, in that it's

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.240
the tale of this vast
alien civilization that's

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.900
so into American pop music
that they accidentally commit

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.570
the biggest copyright
infringement since the dawn

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.340
of time, and thereby
bankrupt the entire universe.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.700
And it's based on a
true story, by the way.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.887
And so that was my first novel.

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:52.220
And I thought it was just
something I was doing, really,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.420
for myself.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.440
I thought it was something
so weird and so unusual

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.960
that maybe Larry Lessig
and my wife would read it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.650
and nobody else.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.160
But I had an agent because I'd
written a couple of business

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.630
books before.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.167
I got it in front of the
folks at Random House

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.500
and they ended up publishing it.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.830
And it actually-- very
briefly and barely,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.604
sort of like a prairie dog--

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:16.520
got onto "The New York
Times" best seller list

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.770
for the shortest period of
time-- which is a week--

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.850
that's possible.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.600
And I think it was, like,
number 23 out of 25, so barely.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.160
But that was good enough for
Random House to say keep at it,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.400
and so I started
writing this book.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.610
It's unusual-- and in fact,
I might be the only person

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.960
who's done it--

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.280
to transition from the
venture-backed startup world

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.180
to writing fiction.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.280
Now, lots and lots
of entrepreneurs

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.710
write books, write nonfiction.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.830
I don't know of anybody else
who's made the transition

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.980
to writing serious fiction.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.060
Although there could well be
somebody out there, and if so,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.200
I'd love to meet them.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.090
Now there's upsides
and downsides to that.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.622
I mean, the downside
is it kind of

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.580
sucks that when you go
to one of those meet-ups

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.470
for entrepreneurs who have
turned into novelists,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.670
you're inevitably
the only one there.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.970
On the positive side, though,
it's really good for new-ish

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.010
novelists-- and this
is only my second book,

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.020
so I consider myself
to be new-ish--

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.650
to really focus on
that which we know.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.960
And we are at a time when I
think society is very, very

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.270
interested in our
world out here, which

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.660
I try to depict very vividly and
very accurately in this book.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.940
The world of entrepreneurs
and investors,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.340
and the crazy relationship
certain products

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.380
might have with the
press and beyond.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.260
The geniuses that inhabit and
populate and work for companies

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.910
like yours and so forth.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.250
That's often depicted
in a way that's

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.460
just very fanciful
by folks who've never

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.230
spent a day in a tech company.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.540
I will definitely
except HBO's TV series,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.710
though, which often is
hysterically spot-on.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.300
But a great deal
of the storytelling

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.050
out there really,
really misses the point.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.320
And this is at a time
when society, I think,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.350
finds us very interesting, and
our significance to broader

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.360
society is becoming
really significant.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.180
And I think the better
our story is told,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.200
and the better that it's
reflected out there, frankly--

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.227
hopefully-- the less people
will fear us on a certain level,

00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:11.060
or at least the better
they'll understand us

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.440
and that which we do.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.840
So that's something that
I think is kind of cool.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.960
So that's one element
of my background

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.600
that's deeply, deeply
embedded in this book,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.470
and it's the most obvious thing.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.930
[COUGHING] Excuse me.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.350
Now the second thing is
I spent a huge amount

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.429
of my time of my early adulthood
roaming around the Middle East,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.460
including a year as a Fulbright
scholar in Cairo, Egypt.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.022
I went all over the place.

00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:40.730
I've been to Syria,
I've been to Lebanon.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:46.280
I went to Iraq under
Saddam, Jordan, Gaza--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.420
all over the place.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.480
Since I was living there-- and
I got to the point where I spoke

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.600
reasonably good Arabic, although
it's rusted a lot since then--

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.850
since coming back, I try
to get back to the region

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.890
at least once a year.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.530
And I've worked as an
elections observer.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.250
I work as a pro bono advisor
to a lot of startups out there.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.350
I work with a
not-for-profit out there.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.142
And a certain element of my
background in the Middle East

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:12.350
comes into the book, as well.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.824
Because issues of nihilistic
terrorism and what causes it

00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:17.990
and what could prevent it--
and lone wolf terrorism,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.157
in particular--

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.240
are prominent in the book.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.680
It was something that impacted
me kind of tangentially.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.650
Somebody that I used to spend
a lot of time with in Cairo

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.640
was actually assassinated
shortly after I left.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.810
And Cairo had been a
very, very peaceful place

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.430
until the early '90s.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.190
And it was really when this
associate of mine, Farag Foda,

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.430
was assassinated that
kind of touched off

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.710
a fairly violent period
in Egypt's history.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.160
So that's something that I've
thought about quite a bit

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.780
over the decades, frankly.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.550
And the third thing
is, I'm actually

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.360
a proud alum of the New York
City foster care system.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.260
And issues of parental
ties and familial belonging

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.170
are quite big in the book.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.430
So those three themes
are the sinews that

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.000
come together in this book.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.810
And again, as a new-ish writer,
one does write what one knows.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.890
And I think that's an exotic
enough mix that it leads

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.350
to a fairly unusual story.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.740
Now as I mentioned, I
did a ton of digging

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.100
into the science and technology
that imbues this book.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.810
Because writing something
that's present tense--

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.310
there's quite a
temptation, I think,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.680
writers of speculative
fiction have,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.230
to create things that
are just flat-out

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.040
magical from the standpoint
of present-day technology,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.090
inject them into the storyline.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.020
It can make your story a
much easier thing to tell.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.540
But I kind of think that's
irresponsible storytelling,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.392
and it's particularly
irresponsible in the realm

00:10:48.392 --> 00:10:49.350
of speculative fiction.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.891
Because I think
there's a presumption

00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.980
on the part of at least
some of our readers

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.350
that they're learning stuff
about how the world really

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.967
works, and how technology
really works, particularly

00:10:57.967 --> 00:10:59.550
if the book is set
in the present day.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.630
Or at least that's
how I approach things.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.240
And so the first
thing that I did

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.480
as I started writing this
thing is I conducted, actually,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.631
hundreds of hours of
interviews with lots of folks

00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:11.880
who were deep in the various
realms I wanted to cover.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.210
And I'll add, this is one of
the coolest things about being

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.070
a science fiction writer.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.190
I mean, if you call up a
relatively prominent scientist

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.530
or technologist and say,
hey, I'm a journalist

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.680
and I'm writing a story,
you might get a call back.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.742
If you say, hey, I'm a
podcaster and I really

00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:29.700
want to interview you--

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.650
I've been doing a bit
of that myself lately--

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.910
you might get a call back.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.910
Man, if you call up and say,
I'm a science fiction writer

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.420
and I want to get your input
on a new novel, it's about 90%.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.130
So you get really
good access to people.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.860
Because I think a lot of folks
grew up on science fiction

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.530
and there's something kind
of fun about being involved

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.480
in the creation of that.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.330
So the areas that I
dove into particularly

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.600
that I hadn't known much
about getting into this.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.170
One was how might a
super AI actually arise?

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.800
I didn't know a whole lot about
neuroscience or consciousness

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.620
theory at the time.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.330
I spent a lot of time with a
diversity of neuroscientists,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.710
none more than a guy at UCSF
named Adam Gazzaley, who's

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.090
doing fascinating work.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.420
And if you're interested in the
cutting edge of neuroscience,

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.140
particularly as it
associates to video games

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.720
and how it might impact
neuroplasticity and help

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.680
us fight horrors like
Alzheimer's disease and autism

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.390
and ADHD, there's lots and lots
of talks on the net by Adam.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.744
And he became a great
mentor and informant to me

00:12:32.744 --> 00:12:33.660
as I was writing this.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.279
And in fact, his work has
been on the cover of "Nature,"

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.070
which, I'm sure, as a
lot of you guys know,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.620
is a really, really big deal.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.100
When I was researching quantum
computing, another major topic

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.870
in this book, I
spent a lot of time

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.150
with Google's own Hartmut Neven.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.960
And he corrected a lot of
laughable misperceptions

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.700
I had about quantum
computing, which

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.410
was a really cool education.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.060
And I remain very
grateful to him.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.920
Synthetic biology is
a major theme here.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.490
I'm sure many of you either
know, or at least know of,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.529
Jeff Huber, who I've
known for decades.

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:07.320
At the time, he was
running life sciences--

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.870
I believe, I might get the
title a little bit off--

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.750
at Google X. He was a
great source for me.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.460
So what was cool about this
is I got all of this learning

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.260
as a result of writing
this book, which

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.030
is the joy, for me,
of writing any book.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.050
And I've written
nonfiction as well.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.890
And obviously, you learn a
lot from writing nonfiction.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.420
And then I start
writing this thing.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.510
As you guys can see,
it is not short.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.400
You should have seen
the first draft.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.640
The first draft was
about 800 pages long.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.687
And I handed it in
to Random House.

00:13:37.687 --> 00:13:39.270
They're like, we're
going to chop down

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.900
a forest for this thing.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.840
So it was clear that I
needed to rein it in.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.080
And the thing that I was most
guilty of is when I learned

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.680
about a domain of science
or tech or geopolitics--

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.740
because I learned a lot
more about certain domains

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.290
in geopolitics--

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.730
when I got deep
into something, I

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.030
was all too likely to just,
in the middle of the story--

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.740
and the car is about
to go off the cliff,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.260
and let me tell you about
how cool synthetic biology is

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.760
for 20 pages.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.140
You end up hijacking your story.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.660
And the more you know about
something as a novelist,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.490
the more inclined
you are to do that,

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.410
so I kind of had this problem.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.270
Because I really
wanted to infuse

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.330
all this stuff in the book,
but I was hijacking my story.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.765
So what I ended up doing--

00:14:20.765 --> 00:14:24.087
and I don't know if any other
fiction writer has done this.

00:14:24.087 --> 00:14:25.920
And again, there probably
are some out there

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.270
and hopefully, I'll find others.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.936
Because again, the
meet-ups are just me.

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:32.790
But what I decided to do
is create a podcast series

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.360
to accompany the book, in
which I could do really, really

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.030
deep interviews with
domain experts in seven

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.490
or eight areas that are
most germane to the book.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.870
So I could go into the--

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.850
in many cases, not all--

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.950
but in many cases, I was
interviewing the person

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.400
who had been such a great sort
of mentor and informant to me

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.990
as I was doing my research.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.332
So I started putting
these podcasts out

00:14:54.332 --> 00:14:55.290
when the book came out.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.850
The book came out last month.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.620
And the eighth one
went up, actually,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.630
I guess, last night
or the night before.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.190
And it's about
Fermi's paradox, which

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.800
is this really cool thing
in astronomy, which is

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.520
like, where are all the aliens?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.280
It's actually a very
scientifically significant

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.150
question.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.890
Why can we not see signs of
extraterrestrial intelligence?

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.990
So you're into that, I've
got a two-hour conversation

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.970
with a British astronomer
on the web now.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.280
It might be the
longest conversation

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.590
about Fermi's paradox
ever recorded.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.590
If it's not, I'm sure it's
the longest one ever podcast.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.110
But anyway, so I'm able
to get really, really

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.660
deep with these podcasts.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.190
And I did one on
augmented reality,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.390
I did one on quantum computing.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.770
I certainly did one on super
AI risk, et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.500
So that's kind of how I
dealt with the science

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.600
and technology.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.150
Now the last thing, or the
second-to-last thing I told you

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.530
I'd talk about-- and this is
where I'll start sprinkling

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.960
in some readings--

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.890
how the story is told.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.890
So it's great that you guys have
the physical book because you

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.950
can flip through it
and see that there

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.670
are a lot of very different
type settings going on in here.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.050
And the reason is,
about 75% of the book

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:09.640
is told in the form of
a traditional narrative.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.210
There's some flashbacks.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.630
It's primarily set
in the present day.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.720
There's a chunk of stuff that
happens right after the bubble

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.590
burst-- the internet
bubble, around 2002--

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.750
where half of the characters
are still in high school,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.530
and the other half are
kind of young entrepreneurs

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.297
that are freaking out and
saying, what just happened?

00:16:29.297 --> 00:16:30.880
So there's a little
bit of flashbacks.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.800
There's mainly
traditional narrative.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.870
But the rest of the
book is told through all

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.520
these different media types.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.730
There are 18 Amazon
reviews in this book.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.810
Yes, really.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.372
And the story is genuinely
told partly through them.

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:44.330
There's lots of tweets.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.400
There's SMS's.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.670
There's five or six very, very
voicey bloggers, some of them

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.050
very angry about certain things,
that are blogging in there.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.880
There are excerpts from
a second novel, which

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.630
are a little bit mysterious when
they first start showing up.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.230
I put probably a dozen, or maybe
a little bit fewer, excerpts

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.010
in the book.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.050
I'm quite convinced
if I finished

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.060
writing this second
novel, it would

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.490
be literally the single
worst science fiction

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.800
novel ever written.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.589
But they're in there
for storytelling reasons

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.420
and also for playful reasons.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.849
And so that was kind
of a cool thing,

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.530
to weave all this
stuff together.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.420
Now I'll tell you
guys, I'm going

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.270
to read one of my Amazon reviews
because I think the Amazon

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.319
reviews are kind of fun.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.710
And they actually have an
interesting back story.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.310
So when I was running Rhapsody--

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.550
or the company that built
Rhapsody, I should say--

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.810
it was really stressful.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.650
I actually didn't think I was
a particularly good manager.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.640
I kept that a really
good secret for a while,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.490
but eventually, it
started getting out.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.320
And every night, after I
was done with all my email,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.730
and all my managerial
responsibilities,

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.900
I'd kind of sit there and do
this self-indulgent thing,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.575
and it was actually writing
these insane Amazon reviews.

00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:01.570
This was back in 2002.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.830
And I took on the persona of
this sort of insane Bostonian--

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.580
Charles Henry Higginsworth
III, of Boston, Massachusetts--

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.212
who would start writing
these Amazon reviews.

00:18:12.212 --> 00:18:14.170
And he'd get about a
third of the way in there,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.660
and then he'd do this
180 and start just

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.190
bitching about his life.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.810
And he was from this
formerly wealthy family that

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.340
had blown all its
money, and they

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.032
were living in this crumbling
mansion on Beacon Hill

00:18:27.032 --> 00:18:28.990
and they didn't even have
money for heating oil

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.560
because some great aunt had
spent the last of the money

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.940
or something like that.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.680
And he had this really
sort of pompous voice

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.730
that I just had fun writing.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.210
And so I started writing
all these Amazon reviews.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.730
I almost became a
top 1,000 reviewer.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.410
How cool would that have been?

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.940
Answer-- very.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.830
I didn't, though.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.830
And so when I started creating
this book all these years

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.760
later, I realized I wanted
a certain character--

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.550
as a minor character, but a
significant character-- that

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.870
had a certain set of traits.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.674
I'm like, oh, my god, I
want Mr. Higginsworth.

00:19:04.674 --> 00:19:07.090
And by the way, yes, please
use Mr. when you refer to him.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.600
He prefers it that way.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.220
And so I started weaving in his
Amazon reviews, all of which

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.250
are still up on
Amazon, dated 2002.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.565
So I think some people think
this is like "Boyhood."

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:19.690
Oh, my god, he's been
working on this for 15 years.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.680
Not true.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.030
But I did repurpose
my Amazon reviews.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.130
So this is one of them.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.910
This is a review about--
and it does relate, I swear,

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.830
to the plot of the book.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.630
This is Mr. Charles
Henry Higginsworth III

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.190
of Boston,
Massachusetts, reviewing

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.790
a book called "Time to Make the
Donuts, The Founder of Dunkin'

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.190
Donuts Shares an
American Journey."

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.880
So here it is.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.230
His title of his review--

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.650
"From the Kitchens of Boston
to Your Left Ventricle"

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.240
is the title of the review.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.130
Five stars, by Charles
Henry Higginsworth III.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.970
I kind of felt morally
obliged to rate everything

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.960
five stars because in
most cases back then,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.820
I hadn't actually read
these books, so you know.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.420
So he says, "Like a charmed
wind hurling vital provisions

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.490
on a castaway's
beach, fate landed

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.570
a copy of this in
our conference room,

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.430
in which I served a recent
sentence to traffic school.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.630
As reading was a scorned pastime
amongst my fellow inmates,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.120
I laid easy claim to
the volume, a mental sop

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.000
for a mind numbed by
the day's prattle.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.670
I was soon swept up by this tale
of an intrepid entrepreneur's

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.430
rise to the heights of the
glamorous but cutthroat world

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.960
of donut retail.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.480
I meanwhile enjoyed no
small surge of civic pride,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.730
Dunkin' Donuts having
sprung from the loins

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.775
of my own native Boston.

00:20:30.775 --> 00:20:32.900
The narrative is sprinkled
with little-known truths

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.430
about this breakfast staple.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.190
For instance, did you know
that the modern word 'donut'

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.040
descends from dough
not, which itself

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.070
traces lineage to the
archaic dough knot?

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.710
Nor did I, sir, nor did I.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.150
Short on complex formulae
and your lengthier words,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.450
this is ideal reading at
events at which attention

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.710
must be feigned.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.450
But be advised,
this could impair

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.774
the absorption of important
lessons from without.

00:20:56.774 --> 00:20:58.190
I myself learned
this the hard way

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.600
when I caused a minor accident
upon leaving the traffic

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.000
school's driveway by
failing to signal,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.880
neglecting a major leitmotiv
from the day's curriculum.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.370
My instructor, who had
resented my divided attention

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.220
throughout the day,
savored the irony."

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.680
What a pompous jerk, right?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.840
So anyway, that ended up
getting stitched into the book.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.364
And now one of the cool
things about having--

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.780
OK, so the reason that I brought
all these different media

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.680
elements in, just to back up,
is I feel that this is the way

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.660
we engage in stories today.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.716
It's the way we engage in
news stories as they unfold.

00:21:32.716 --> 00:21:34.340
In some ways, it's
even the way that we

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.720
engage in narrative stories.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.345
Because we might be watching
snippets of something,

00:21:38.345 --> 00:21:40.970
but we're watching it on demand,
so we watch three minutes here

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.140
and four minutes there.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.990
And then we might end up reading
a summary of that episode

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.640
somewhere online, and then
kind of go back to it.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.230
I feel like this barrage
of snippets of media,

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.620
of texts, of blogs,
of Amazon reviews

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.940
and the rest is kind of the way
that we inhale the world today.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.990
And the novel itself really is
primarily-- the earliest ones

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.090
go back to the 17th
and 18th century--

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.490
but it's really a 19th century
invention, for the most part.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.190
That's when it really
came into its own.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.710
And the attention
spans that we had,

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.890
and the way that we engaged
in relationship and careers

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.980
and everything else was
so much more linear,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.860
and start-to-finish,
and so much more focused

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.860
that I thought it would
be kind of fun to inject

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.370
some of these elements into this
ancient mode of storytelling.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.720
Now another dimension of
it which is kind of neat

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.240
is when you have all these
different storytelling

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.700
elements when you
do an audiobook,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.310
you can recruit all kinds of
very distinct and different

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.050
voices to that audiobook.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.130
So these Amazon reviews, of
which there are about a dozen

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.209
and a half-- and I cannot do
justice to the reading compared

00:22:49.209 --> 00:22:51.500
to the actual reader-- are
all read by a guy named John

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.080
Hodgman, who is a
brilliant comedian.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.570
He was very frequently
on "The Daily Show."

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.790
He's been in lots of
TV series and movies.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.210
He is perhaps best known for
those famous commercials,

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.870
"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC."

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.301
If you remember those from
some years back, he was the PC.

00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:10.820
He is Bostonian and he
just reads these reviews

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.780
in this really wonderful kind
of stentorian, pompous voice.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.780
I just did my best, but
I'm not as good as him.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.720
Felicia Day is beloved
by lots of geeks

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.140
for having created "The Guild,"
that wonderful web series,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.620
and done a lot of other things.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.190
She was frequently in
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.230
These days, she's in "Mystery
Science Theater 3000. "

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.830
She was a voice of
one of my bloggers.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.600
If anybody listens to
"This Week in Tech,"

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.840
Leo Laporte is the voice of
the "San Francisco Chronicle."

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.110
Tom Merritt is the voice
of "The New York Times."

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.854
Patrick Rothfuss, who writes
amazing fantasy novels,

00:23:45.854 --> 00:23:47.270
including "The
Name of the Wind"--

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.900
just read it, trust
me on that one--

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.440
has also got this great big
kind of-- he can do these rants,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.440
these playful rants in
this over-the-top manner.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.750
So he read that crazy
awful science fiction

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.550
novel that's excerpted in here.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.890
And so you can have a
lot of fun with audio.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.650
And audiobooks are really
coming in their own as a medium

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.560
right now.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.650
Audiobooks are growing
at something like--

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.940
probably 10 times the
speed of publishing itself.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.550
My last novel was about
4 and 1/2 years ago.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.780
When this came out, the folks
at Random House Audio told me,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.900
their business is up over
300% in 4 and 1/2 years, which

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.180
is more like tech
rates of growth, which

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.790
is another interesting topic.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.420
So that is the way
the story is told.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.800
Now the other thing that I do
that's a little bit unusual--

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.080
and I'll do a slightly
longer reading right now,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.550
and it will piss you off-- or
it should, it's intended to.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.490
There's this weird
narrator that appears

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.800
at the very, very
beginning of the book,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.270
and then kind of
stands back a bit,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.820
and kind of comes
in periodically

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.190
to just sort of jab you and
say, don't forget about me,

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.360
I'm still here.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.200
So it is a book with a narrator,
but it's a very, very soft

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.980
touch narrator.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.170
And again, it's not
unique, but it's

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.590
something that's a little bit
unusual, that I do for reasons

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.780
that kind of become
evident, I'd say,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.200
not until the very, very end
of the book, so don't peek.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.640
The narrator is actually not
revealed until the last two

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.380
or three pages.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.280
But I'm going to read the
opening page and a half or so,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.399
which is when this
narrative voice--

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:29.690
maybe a little longer-- yeah,
about a page and a half--

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.650
is most present.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.608
Then I'm going to say a
couple things about it.

00:25:32.608 --> 00:25:36.410
So this is how the book starts,
starting from the first word.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.650
"Some people think all great
books should start with a dare.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.397
And those folks
can't be big readers,

00:25:41.397 --> 00:25:42.980
because really, when
was the last time

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.470
you read a book that
began with a dare?

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.010
Well, this one does.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.510
And that's not some ham-fisted
gambit to position it as great.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.270
Because we just established that
only half-literates conflate

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.200
opening dares with greatness.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.560
So it's truly just
a simple dare.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.670
And it's this.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.627
I dare you to finish the fucker.

00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:02.210
And let's be real,
you probably won't.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.280
It's 547 pages
printed, after all,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.830
which is to say any number of
locations, sections, or lit

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.650
nodes in your e-reader.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.360
And its obnoxious
length is nothing

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.470
compared to the
disquieting truths

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.300
it reveals about a popular
social/messaging/hookup

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.310
platform that humanity
already spends

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.090
11.2% of its online
time engaged with,

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.350
about who really built
all of that and why,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.680
about who's listening and
what they're recording.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.510
And here's the
part that may smart

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.400
a bit, how terribly
uninteresting

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.590
they almost certainly find you.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.360
There's also some
truly scary stuff

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.360
you just don't need to know
about the February bombing

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.640
in San Francisco,
about how it actually

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.180
saved lives, lots of them,
and quite possibly your own.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.690
And about how
moronically close we

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.310
came to a nuclear war with
China on a recent winter's day.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.550
Spoiler alert--
not my fault. You

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.610
don't have to know any of
this, and ignoring the hidden

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.262
ugliness we can't do much
about makes life easier.

00:26:58.262 --> 00:27:00.470
So if you tend to avoid
facts like the age of the kid

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.870
who stitched your favorite
blazer just outside of Phnom

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.630
Penh, or how athletically a
certain ex once cheated on you,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.020
or how painful and scary
the last few days of most

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.765
human lives are, then for
God's sake, put the book down.

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.920
And do yourself a
big favor and catch

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.670
a movie, a numbered sequel,
say, starring cartoon men

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.460
invented to distract tots
during the Roosevelt era.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.200
You'll find that plenty
challenging and much more fun.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.050
It will also be
over sooner, leaving

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.030
you free for more
numbered sequels,

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.770
or maybe some of the
light sci-fi written

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.710
for the bright teens and dim
grownups we euphemistically

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.530
call young adults.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.120
Are you still there?

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.190
If so, I'm sorry if
that sounded a bit mean,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.410
but we're better off with
whoever just stomped off.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.850
Those people offend easily.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.391
They're always
whining about how they

00:27:45.391 --> 00:27:48.740
feel unsafe or under-cherished
if their every clumsy kick,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.980
catch, and volley isn't
commemorated with trophies.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.520
I can't stand those people.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.070
I bet you can't
stand them either.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.440
So getting rid of them was
worth feigning contempt

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.420
for some of my own
favorite things.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.900
Psst, two of the best
movies ever, in my view,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.190
are "Iron Man" 1 and 2.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.740
Also, I read YA
stuff constantly.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.210
I bet you didn't know that.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.800
Now that it's just
us, I applaud you

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.410
for at least attempting
to see this thing through.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.030
Even you probably
won't get there--

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.220
those 547 pages, again--

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.040
but if you do, I can
make you three promises.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.350
One, I will never
talk down to you.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.650
Yes, certain facts herein are
hard to confront and accept.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.290
Certain others are
hard to understand.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.240
But I think you're man
enough, woman enough,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.030
or young adult enough
to handle it all.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.000
So no sugarcoating
and no dumbing down.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.220
Two, I'll never lie to you.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.350
Everything that follows,
however fantastical

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.570
and hard to believe,
is entirely true,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.340
and precisely depicts
the underpinnings

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.710
of the world you inhabit.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.830
And finally, at the very,
very end of all this,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.549
you will find a
glittering prize.

00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:53.090
Books that end with
glittering prizes

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.830
are even rarer than those that
start with dares, so lucky you.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.420
But please, no peeksies.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.260
With that, I'm
almost done with you.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.540
And that may be welcome news.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.760
My tone can grate a bit, I know.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.930
It's probably just a
phase I'm going through.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.600
But I'll give you
your space now.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.210
That said, I will check
in every so often,

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.206
sometimes when you least
expect it, as the hit men say.

00:29:14.206 --> 00:29:15.830
And of course, I'll
be back at the end,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.110
with that glittering
prize of yours.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.444
And you'd thought I'd
already forgotten.

00:29:20.444 --> 00:29:21.860
But for now, let's
begin our story

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.693
with some quick opening
praise for the women

00:29:23.693 --> 00:29:25.380
and men of Silicon Valley.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.970
Yes, yes, I know, but those
fuckers gave us "Farmville."

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.030
It's true, and everyone's
awfully sorry about that.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.850
But at its best, the Valley
remains an inspiring land,

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.650
almost bewitchingly so.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.850
I mean, where else can a handful
of misfits meet up in a garage,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.370
share mad bolts of inspiration,
then mainline Red Bull,

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.489
sleep under desks, code
on bleeding fingers

00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:47.780
until they hack together an
agenda-setting product that

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.317
will rock the world?

00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:50.900
And then register
their millionth user

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.200
in just weeks, their 10
millionth in mere months,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.690
and forge friendships
and talents

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.830
that will last a lifetime,
all while getting

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.070
vastly, shamelessly,
pornographically rich?

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.530
The answer, of course, is
Austin, Seattle, Beijing,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.160
London, Oslo, Bangalore,
Seoul, Nairobi, Dubai, Buenos

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.220
Aires, and quite possibly
Perth, Australia,

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.011
among countless other places.

00:30:11.011 --> 00:30:13.510
But this sort of thing happens
on a grander scale in Silicon

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.230
Valley than anywhere else.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.960
And the cliche is dead accurate.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.014
We're designing the future here.

00:30:19.014 --> 00:30:20.680
We also designed the
present, and you're

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.190
much better off for that.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.130
Snort at this if
you must, but do you

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.430
really want to go back to six
broadcast channels, CB radios,

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.980
typewriters, dominoes, and
checkers, rotary phones,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.760
and thermostats that don't even
speak a single word of English?

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.990
Didn't think so.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.970
So yes, Silicon Valley
did give us "Farmville,"

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.280
but across the decades,
its countless startups

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.740
have also rebuilt our
world's foundations.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.960
Some relentlessly advanced
the microprocessor,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.230
enabling the digital wonders
of our era, others home DNA

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.380
sequencing, which
cracked the human genome,

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.520
and will one day
help to cure cancer.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.521
Still others pioneered
wireless technologies

00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:55.770
that are finally patching
together the world's poorest

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.120
sectors into a global
super-plex of information.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.360
Literally thousands of
Silicon Valley startups

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.060
in these and countless
fields have advanced humanity

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.990
in palpable ways.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:10.360
And no matter how you cut
it, however imaginatively,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.460
generously, even
schizophrenically you

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.360
look at things, [? giftishly ?]
was never ever one of them.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.097
Nope, not even close."

00:31:18.097 --> 00:31:19.680
So then we talk about
[? giftishly. ?]

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.210
Now every time I
read these pages,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:27.400
I want to strangle my narrator
because I find the tone so

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.310
spectacularly obnoxious,
which is good because I

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.690
worked very, very hard on that.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.350
And like I said, and like
the narrator promised,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.890
the narrator said, I know
my tone can grate a bit,

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.090
I'll get out of your way.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.260
The narrator does that.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.419
But like I said, comes back
from time to time to poke you.

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:46.210
And I'd like to say
more about the narrator

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.160
but I'd give
certain things away.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.670
So I'm going to close just with
a quick note on the dialogue

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.650
that I think we've
had as a society--

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.440
and as a world of
creators on my side,

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.360
and as a world of creators of
tech and science on your side,

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.250
and formerly kind of my side--

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.377
between science and science
fiction, and technology

00:32:08.377 --> 00:32:09.210
and science fiction.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.660
Just a show of hands,
how many folks,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.550
at some point much
earlier in your life,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.170
before you decided
to enter tech,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.690
were in some way inspired
by science fiction,

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.090
and maybe attribute
your presence now here

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.090
at Google to some inspiration
from science fiction

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.408
when you were young?

00:32:27.408 --> 00:32:27.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.570
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.880
So it's about half, and
that's generally what I find.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.070
I mean, it is
something that I think

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.090
can be very, very powerful.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.830
And I feel the science fiction
that personally intrigued

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.950
me the most when I was a kid--

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.200
I loved super deep
future stuff, things

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.930
that pointed to things
that were improbable

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.630
ever, and certainly not going
to happen in my lifetime.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.210
But the things that got
me most excited, and then

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.180
pointed me-- although I studied
Arabic and Middle Eastern

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.320
history in college.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.356
I wasn't an engineer-- but
drew me to the industry--

00:32:59.356 --> 00:33:00.730
were those stories
that were told

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.410
kind of in the intermediate
future, that really,

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.980
really excited me about
what might happen.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.554
And so I've been talking to
a couple of people, including

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.470
this gentleman, Adam
Gazzaley, who I mentioned

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.140
to you, about maybe
trying to create sort

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.290
of like a semi-formal
council-like thing

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.970
between creators
of science fiction

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.040
and creators of
science and technology,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.370
where maybe we could
pair up in some way

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.310
and maybe get groups
of people to create

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.400
short stories that maybe we
release on an annual basis,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.830
where there's a scientist
or a technologist teamed up

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.570
with a science fiction writer.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.080
We set things in that
10 to 25-year frame,

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.750
which can be so inspiring.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.504
So I think there's
really two things

00:33:41.504 --> 00:33:43.420
that people who write
about the future can do.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.390
One-- and we've been doing less
and less of this recently--

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.227
we can depict the future
that we want to inhabit.

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:51.310
And science fiction used
to do a lot more of that.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.720
Science fiction used to be much
more optimistic than I'd say it

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.220
is now.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.960
Dystopianism has just
pervaded the field, really

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.990
in the last 25 years.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.950
But that optimistic
message is very important,

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.557
but so is the dystopian one.

00:34:05.557 --> 00:34:07.390
Because I think works
of speculative fiction

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.820
also depict the
worlds we absolutely

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.730
do not want to inhabit
under any circumstances.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.429
And I would say there was a
lot of magnificent storytelling

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.730
during the Cold War that did
a lot to freak out hundreds

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.139
of millions or
billions of people

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.199
about how bad a nuclear war
could actually be, things

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.489
set in the near future then.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:28.399
And I think that helped us avoid
that fate, at least until now.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.940
And I'd also give George Orwell
an enormous amount of credit.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.140
We don't really
think of "1984" today

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.620
as being a work of science
fiction, but it was.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.260
He wrote it in 1948, and
things like telescreens

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.500
and so forth were way beyond
the technology of the day.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.010
And you could be forgiven,
as a smart person in 1948,

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.900
looking at the
world and thinking

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.199
that a completely totalitarian
future was all but inevitable.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.840
Because on the left, you'd
had Stalin and the horrors

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.100
that he perpetrated.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.080
On the right, you had
Hitler, and the horrors

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.580
that he perpetrated.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.350
Clearly, a
totalitarian regime was

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.240
going to take over
China at that point.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.073
And it looked like we
were heading for that.

00:35:03.073 --> 00:35:06.870
And I think that "1984"
freaked out, again,

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.700
hundreds of millions
of people about how

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.870
bad this future really could be
when combined with technology

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.050
that was then right on the
horizon, video conferencing

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.600
and video dissemination.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.700
So I think he helped us
not inhabit that future.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.150
And I think that's
an important mission

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.990
for science and
technology-based storytelling.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.200
And the more that that can be
done in sort of a partnership

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.140
between the writers and the
people who genuinely create

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.390
the future-- it sure ain't us--

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.510
the better.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.060
So those are my quick
words on this crazy book.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.930
I'm open to any questions.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.040
And yeah, fire away.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.970
AUDIENCE: I just started
watching the Vietnam series

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.320
that Ken Burns is doing.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:52.725
ROB REID: It's magnificent.

00:35:52.725 --> 00:35:53.460
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.390
Started last night.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.790
ROB REID: It's amazing.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.456
AUDIENCE: Episode
one, and I'm thinking,

00:35:56.456 --> 00:35:58.410
wow, there's going to
be 14 hours of this.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.420
So your book contains all
these tools and exchanges

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.860
and contexts that we now
enjoy that are seconds long,

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.620
and maybe minutes, rarely hours.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.472
It's kind of interesting.

00:36:12.472 --> 00:36:13.680
What are you thinking about--

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.150
like, what is it that
Ken Burns says, gee, I'm

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.260
going to make this
thing 20 hours long

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.330
and people will love it?

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.560
ROB REID: Well, hey, Ken,
this is 22 hours long.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.180
No, and it's a similar mindset,
that I think that anybody who

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.400
creates very, very long
form entertainment,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.959
we're really battling
horrific headwinds.

00:36:35.959 --> 00:36:38.250
And so I think I can speak
very, very directly to that.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.460
I mean, the audiobook of
this is 22 hours long,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.860
and it's 547 pages, 191,000
words according to my word

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.730
processor, in an
era that lionizes

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:50.580
the 140-character tweet.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.640
And I mean, I think that
if you are dedicated

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.180
to this level of
depth, you better not

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.990
be in it for the money.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.720
Now I think Ken Burns has done
very, very well over the years

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.380
by telling historical
stories brilliantly well.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.010
But I think A, you better
not be in it for the money

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.230
and you better have an
extraordinary commitment

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.560
to this very, very long form
that you're engaging in.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.250
And I think secondly, it's
really incumbent upon you

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:22.710
to use the medium to convey
a message that simply can't

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.820
be conveyed in other ways.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.460
And I think that--

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.260
again, to go 19th century,
or even the 1950s or '60s--

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.600
there was probably more
call for a novel that really

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.480
just conveyed the
type of experience

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.370
that you could get from
watching playful TV

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:42.840
or something like that.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.210
In an era now, where people have
so many claims on their time

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.330
and intelligence, and there's
so many brilliant ways to spend

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:51.870
that time--

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.970
I mean, TV has
never been better.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.677
I'd say film has been better,
but TV has never been better.

00:37:57.677 --> 00:37:59.760
Really, if you're going
to make a statement that's

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.180
20 hours long, you
better make a statement

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.220
that simply couldn't be
conveyed in another manner.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.920
And Sam Harris has a very
interesting and, at times,

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.230
controversial podcast.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.480
I actually interviewed
him for my own podcast.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.690
We had a two-hour interview
a couple episodes ago.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.142
He had Ken Burns on, I think his
last episode or the one before.

00:38:22.142 --> 00:38:23.850
So it's the one
interview that I've heard

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.560
and he interviewed
him at great length.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.930
And I think that Ken Burns,
based on the interview

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.640
that I heard, felt that he had
a story whose sweep and scope

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.270
simply could not be told
in less than 20 hours.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.770
And therefore, it
was something that

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:42.900
merited this very big footprint,
very rarely deployed tool

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.930
that he had.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:47.070
And I think that there is
absolutely call for the novel

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.430
and the 20-hour documentary
in this day and age.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.700
And there is a very
interesting phenomenon.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.280
We now have 13-hour movies,
for all intents and purposes--

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.940
the really wonderful
premium cable entertainment.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.640
The great serialized things
that are going up on Netflix,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.220
and Amazon, and now
Hulu-- and I know

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.860
you guys are doing some buying.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.560
They really are
13-hour movies, I

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.610
mean, if you look at
something like "Breaking Bad."

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.560
That's something
that the distribution

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.490
and economic infrastructure
that we live in today enables.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.490
And it turns out, people have
attention for 13-hour movies.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.920
So I think that the very
long and very short--

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.220
I think there's room
for all attention spans.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.940
I love listening to
sprawling audiobooks.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:35.310
I love an audiobook that
clocks in at 20-30 hours.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.000
Because sometimes, I
listen on 2x speed.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.560
As a New Yorker,
I do a huge amount

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.800
of walking and subwaying,
and I've got a little dog.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.280
And boy, New York's the
land of 1,000 walks for her.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.872
And being able to really
steep in something that long--

00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:54.330
it's also interesting there's
some very, very long podcasts

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.580
out there.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.450
Sam Harris and Tim Ferriss--

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.400
I cite them because they rhyme--

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.440
but they're also
both very popular.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.800
They tend to have these one,
two, three-hour conversations

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.215
that are very, very
popular podcasts.

00:40:07.215 --> 00:40:10.570
So I think our attention
span is pretty robust.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.200
And it really has
got to be targeting

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.880
that thing to the right amount.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.410
And I love the fact that
the 140-character snippet

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.920
is vibrant, and is
connected to by billions.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.340
That had no way to get into
the world until 10 years ago.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.990
And it turns out we
actually have a lot

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.227
to say at that short time frame.

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:32.310
And I'm glad that the
world's media infrastructure

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.880
can accommodate that, too.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.450
Thank you all for coming.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.800
[APPLAUSE]
