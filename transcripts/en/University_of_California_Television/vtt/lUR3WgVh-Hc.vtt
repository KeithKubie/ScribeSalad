00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:05.141
(gentle electronic music)

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.050
- So let me just begin

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.723
What Can Physics Say About Life.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.940
So let me get around to the brass tacks.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.480
I don't wanna disappoint
you, but I was gonna quote

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.290
one of my heroes, Richard Feynman.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.500
He says, everything that
is living can be understood

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.960
in terms of the jigglings
and wiggling of atoms.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.960
Now, that may be true,
but this is a big jump

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
between atoms wiggling and
jiggling and real life.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.580
And to drive that point home,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.050
I'm gonna quote another physicist.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.000
And this was said after he
wrote a very famous equation,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.160
and after he just wrote
that down, he said,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.910
the general theory of quantum mechanics

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.000
is now almost complete.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.080
The underlying physical laws necessary

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.270
for the mathematical theory
of a large part of chemistry

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.890
and the whole, a large part of physics

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.223
and the whole of chemistry are thus known.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.010
The difficulty is only
that the exact application

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.970
of these laws leads to
equations that are much

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.483
too complicated to be soluble.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.630
So therein lies the problem.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.870
When you look at a complicated
system, our fundamental laws

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.610
of physics, quantum
mechanics, can't even begin

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.050
to describe something from
basic fundamental laws.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.170
It becomes much too
complicated much too quickly.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.340
And so keep this in mind,
and I will try to return

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.683
to that at the end of the lecture.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.280
So most of what we know
in chemistry and biology

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310
has been determined by bulk studies.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.270
And if you could look at
things happening one at a time,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.300
molecules, biological reactions
happening one at a time,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.990
could you see something different?

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.510
And to try to perk your imagination,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.910
suppose you were on Mars and
you had a special telescope

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.440
that could measure something
like the average number

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.160
of legs on a organism.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.130
And you happen to be looking
at the zoo, San Francisco Zoo,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.573
and you find that the average is 3.7.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.930
Now this is puzzling because
on Mars, the creatures

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.270
have four legs and six legs and eight legs

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.770
and two legs and some have
no legs, but never 3.7.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.610
Not to worry, because your
theoretical physicist friend

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.480
explains why it's natural to be 3.7.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.420
But if you then looked and
could look at individual animals

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.330
then you'd realize a very different thing.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.420
And there is a supposition
in our own brains

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.150
that if we look at simple
systems like individual atoms

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.810
or molecules, they're all
the same, they're identical,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.790
and they should behave
in very similar ways.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.240
And so the average becomes
really what is happening.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.870
And quite often the
average has nothing to do

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.660
with what is happening.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.320
So my tack on this is again,
as not a deep theoretical

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.480
physicist, but as an experimentalist.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.736
I wanna quote the great
American philosopher

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:24.930
of the 20th century, Yogi Berra,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.773
who said you can see a lot by watching.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.270
And so if you have new instrumentation

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.240
and new ways of looking at things,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.990
maybe you can stumble on something.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.780
Okay, what's the new way?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.360
Well, when I was at Bell
Laboratories, we developed methods

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.220
to manipulate atoms and
also microscopic particles.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.720
And when I came to Stanford,
shortly after I came

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.990
to Stanford, I set about
saying, well, if we can hold on

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.350
to micron-sized spheres and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.690
things on the scale of
an atom with laser light,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.300
why not try to hold on
to individual molecules?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.980
And so I worked with a an MD PhD student

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.830
who taught me a little molecular biology

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.850
so I could start gluing
polystyrene spheres onto DNA.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.673
I worked with other colleagues.

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:20.330
Jim Spudich in the Medical
School, Bob Simmons,

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.887
a biophysicists from King's College London

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:28.887
to do some force experiments
on watching a single molecule

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.990
of myosin pull on a single actin filament.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.370
And so at least from my
point of view, this said,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.183
okay, it looks like it's
going to be a lot of fun.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.310
So I'm gonna tell you
now about two things,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.470
little short stories that
have come out of my lab.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.170
One is the cleavage, that
cleavage is a word that means

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.170
cut RNA by a particular enzyme
called a hairpin ribozyme.

00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:58.600
Ribozyme, now, to my physicist friends,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.650
don't be too scared of these words.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.070
They are just invented to keep
physicists in their place.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.895
(audience laughing)

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:09.473
So I will try to explain the words to you,

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.630
and I tried to cull out most of them.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.530
But ribozyme means it's
an RNA, a piece of RNA

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.090
that acts as an enzyme.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.030
What's an enzyme, an enzyme
is like a chemical catalyst.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.840
It makes a biological reaction occur

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.860
at roughly a billion,
10 billion times faster

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.580
than it normally would occur.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.200
So enzymes are very important.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200
Without enzymes, biological
reactions, meaning biological

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.130
or most biological reactions
would simply not happen.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.130
And proteins are enzymes, many
proteins serve as enzymes,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.760
and in 1980, it was discovered that RNA

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.520
could also serve as an enzyme.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.250
And that has made big
news, and they're looking

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.220
more and more important as time goes by.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.010
So I'm gonna describe an RNA enzyme,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.220
and I'm gonna describe
something that I'm sure

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.240
many of you have heard of,
and that is the machine

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.240
that actually makes the proteins
by reading messenger RNA.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.380
All right, so this is a
schematic of this simple enzyme.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.100
It's in green and blue, and
these letters are the bases.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.700
So it's RNA, it's like DNA,
very similar structure,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.870
there's bases and there's a backbone.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.760
And the AAUAG are simply the bases,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.610
and the enzyme itself is actually
the green and blue parts,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.810
and this particular thing,
it's only 50 bases long.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.050
It's a teeny little enzyme.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.813
And what it does is it attaches
to another piece of RNA

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.150
very specifically, so it
notices there's a specific

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.270
base pair sequence, and
it attaches to this,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.490
and it cuts it, and that's all it does.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.690
In fact, but that's an important process

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.409
because RNA enzymes now we
know do a lot of splicing

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:51.010
and dicing of messenger RNA
after it's been transcribed.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.220
Now because it actually is specific,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.087
it can identify a very
specific piece of RNA,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.060
people are beginning to
think maybe you can engineer

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.070
an enzyme like this to recognize
a particularly destructive

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.920
piece of RNA that you wanna
get to denature in some way.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.720
And so people are thinking
about designing these things

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.960
to cut HIV viruses.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.770
But let me just tell you
the basic idea of this.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.100
This structure of this part and this part,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.007
these are little short
stubs of double helices,

00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:26.850
and this bubble over here
means that the the bases

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.770
aren't making bonafide
Watson-Crick base pairs,

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.890
and so they're kinda dangling about.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.180
This thing folds into
itself, and this is a cartoon

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.360
of these helices folding into
itself, and when it does that,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.730
there's a chemical reaction
occurs when these backbones

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.960
are in close proximity, and
there's a cut made here.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.570
I don't want to describe the chemistry

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.560
mostly because I don't know it that well.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.330
But just to say this is
understood, when you put

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.625
the backbones close together,
this enzyme could either

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.660
cut the backbone of the RNA,
or it can join it together.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.570
It's completely reversible.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.230
If you have two pieces
that are broken and born,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.280
but yeah, they can join it.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.290
Otherwise, it can cut it.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.030
Okay, now

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.960
this experiment was actually
done in our early days

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.890
when we were actually trying to do a proof

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.100
of principle experiments,
and a biologist, Nils Walter

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.220
from Michigan had heard me give a talk,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.170
and he approached me and
said, well, the techniques

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.620
you're developing, maybe you
can help with my problem.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.760
And his problem is to understand
how this little enzyme

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.573
cuts this piece of RNA.

00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:31.890
And so we looked at it, and I said, sure,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.210
we can measure these rates.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.870
And these are some of the questions

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.903
that we were thinking we could measure.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.200
All right, so it's very simple.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.370
What we did is we're
gonna use the technique,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.390
it's actually an old
technique invented in 19,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.170
well, actually applied to biology in 1967,

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.660
invented in the '40s by a physicist.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.940
And that is, you have a
dye molecule over here,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.970
and you excited with let's say blue light.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.070
And normally this molecule
emits in the green.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.780
But if you put this molecule
next to another molecule

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.060
that normally absorbs in the
green but emits in the red,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.510
what you can have is what
we call energy transfer,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.800
namely the energy of the
light goes into this molecule,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.000
the energy in this
molecule gets transferred

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.880
to this molecule, and
then you see red light

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.590
if the two molecules are
sufficiently close together.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.870
So by looking at the ratio
of red to green light,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.750
you can find out how close these molecules

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.610
are to each other at a molecular scale.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.100
And it turns out that
there's a very steep falloff,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.220
so when they're very close,
you see mostly red light.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.730
When they're very far
away, so their red molecule

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.140
has no effect, you see mostly green light.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.550
And in this middle over
here at a distance scale

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.600
of five nanometers, you
can see some mixture

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.433
of red and green.

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:50.430
And in fact, by looking in
the change in relative color

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.170
between red and green, you
can actually measure distances

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.970
less than 10 angstroms.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.860
So this can be a spectroscopic ruler

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.340
by just looking at the ratio of colors.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.640
Okay, so this is a wonderful technique,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.780
and so we thought why not try it.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.810
It's very simple, you put
a red and green molecule

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.490
on this thing, and so when
this enzyme is standing

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.317
up straight, you excite mostly green light

00:10:15.317 --> 00:10:17.210
and you see mostly green light.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.230
When it's in this so-called dock position,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.710
you excite the green molecule,
but you see mostly red light.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.280
And when the piece of, the
other piece of RNA falls off,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.770
this becomes very flexible
so that on average,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.850
its average distance is dictated
by this stiff double helix.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.183
And so you see intermediate red and green.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.480
The idea is very simple.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.250
We just put a lot of these
molecules on a microscope slide,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.150
we come in in a with a laser
and excite it with green light.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.440
Then we simply look with
an optical microscope.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.670
There's some very simple
optics that divides

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.910
the image into a green
image and a red image,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.320
and we just project the two images

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.160
onto a very sensitive camera.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.320
So it's very low-tech, it's
just in an optical microscope,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.410
a pretty expensive camera,
and the only other thing

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.250
you'll have to worry
about is that it has to be

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.430
fairly clean and you can't get a lot of,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.272
get rid of all the stuff that fluoresces.

00:11:10.272 --> 00:11:14.180
Okay, one other thing we
added at the time that was new

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.180
is that we wanted to put
reagents into the molecules.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.230
And so we wanted to pin the
molecules onto the surface.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.120
So once the molecules were
loosely pinned to the surface,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.410
we can flow reagents across the molecules,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.373
and we can expose our
molecules to different things.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.090
So in this case, what do we see?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.620
We see that this molecule
is flipping back and forth.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.840
And so this is an actual
raw data of the intensity

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.550
of the green and red light
from a single enzyme.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.620
And so what's happening
is when the green is high,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.970
it's standing up straight,
and when the red is high,

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.760
it's folded into this
position where you get

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.500
a lot of energy transfer.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.520
And so you see that it's very good signals

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.602
of it flopping back and
forth between red high

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:01.529
and green high, and
this is real-time data,

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:03.373
and just flopping around.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.060
But you notice something.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.260
This one molecule here
spends very little time

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.940
in the red high state,

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.230
another very short time in
the red high state, and so on.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.000
This one spends some intermediate time

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.260
in the red high state, this
one is spending a lot of time

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.150
in the docked state, the red high state.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.380
Occasionally you see
transitions between the two.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.330
But for the most part,
they seem to remember

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.470
what they did last.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.610
So if they spent a lot of
time the docked stated,

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.040
it undocks, and comes back.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.220
And it turns out if you
plot out, you make a graph

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.220
of all the times it
spends in these states,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.530
what you find is the time it
takes this upright molecule

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.400
to fold into one of these
dock states is a constant,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.750
it's well-described by a
single exponential, the k.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.800
No surprises here.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.010
But once it's in the dock
state, there appear to be

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.760
very distinct classes of
times which it would take to

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.610
stand up straight again.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.040
And you can see this clear
because they're different colors.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.740
But really they were
well-separated and roughly

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.980
an order of magnitude
difference in the rate, okay?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.920
So this was very peculiar, because first,

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.310
why do they have different states?

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.980
Well, that was an easy thing.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.810
It turned out that as the
thing came and docked,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.880
it would form a different
number of hydrogen bonds,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.350
and we could show this by
actually making point mutations

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.830
on this molecule and
defeat some of the bases,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.170
the hydrogen bonds that
the bases would make.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.617
And then we would change everything,

00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:35.020
and it seemed to scale right.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.750
So we said, okay, not so surprising.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.350
It's making different hydrogen bonds.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.980
But it was remembering what it was doing.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.650
So here is one of the simplest RNA enzymes

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.290
there is around, and it has
a reasonably good memory.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.150
It would remember for about an hour

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.573
before it would lose memory.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.123
This was quite a surprise.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.850
I should say that we're
not completely sure

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.623
what the cause of the memory is,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.245
but I'm using the word
memory because it really is

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:08.240
non-Markovian, it really remembered,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.650
if it spends a long time here,
the next time it comes down,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.090
it's gonna spend a long time there.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.120
And that's what we call memory.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.270
And it must be that there's
some other thing flipping around

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.970
in perhaps a stochastic
way, but it's much slower

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.720
than the time it takes
to dock and undock, okay?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.280
So I wanna take some of
the mystery out of it.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.810
But it was a surprise.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.440
And this is something that
people did not expect to see.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040
There is a lot of things
going on in biology

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.463
that have seemed to have some hysteresis.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.000
But I wanna point out something else.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.550
Here you have one piece of RNA,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.670
and this enzyme cuts it
into two pieces, all right?

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.530
Now this is a covalent bond.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.720
And so you need to supply some net energy

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.960
to cut this covalent bond.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.600
And so what we found when
we measured the rates

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.650
of this enzymatic
reaction, that yes indeed

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.210
it does take net energy.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.280
In order to cut this in half,
you have to supply energy.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.300
That means the cut piece of
RNA, you've got your intact RNA,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.100
you've gotta go up over some
hump maybe, but in the end,

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.163
the equilibrium position is
that you have to supply energy.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.583
But this enzyme doesn't burn
any fuel to cut it, okay?

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:29.800
And the reason is this
enzyme has gone to school

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.040
and knows about statistical
mechanics and thermodynamics.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.530
And it knows that it's not the
energy, like the heat energy

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.470
that you normally think
of, but it's what's called

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.930
a free energy, which is the heat energy,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.530
the enthalpic energy, minus
something that has to do with S,

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.503
the entropy, the amount of disorder.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.300
And so what happens is normally systems,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.900
if they're naturally gonna relax,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.873
they go to states of lower energy.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.820
Balls rolling down hills,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.160
that's the natural state of affairs.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.920
You don't need to burn
energy to have a ball

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.260
roll down a hill.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.330
And if you're not burning
the energy, that means

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.290
you must be going downhill in free energy.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.380
And what is happening
fundamentally is that two pieces

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.190
of RNA in solution have more
entropy, considerably more

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.420
entropy than one piece, and
that increase in entropy

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.027
is actually more than
the net energy you need

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:27.140
to break the hydrogen bond.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.280
So this enzyme says I
don't need to use fuel.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.340
I can break this covalent
bond because you're gonna gain

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.820
so much in entropy, you'll be all right.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.840
All right?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.390
Now if you pose that as a design problem

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.410
to an engineer and said, I
don't wanna burn any energy

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.300
because the free energy
is higher for two pieces,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.890
how would you do it?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.243
Now let's go back and look.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.410
What is it doing?

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.580
It comes and binds, this
piece of RNA comes and binds,

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.920
and it goes into this dock position.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.790
And what we found from
our measurements is once

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.890
it's in its dock position,
it's twice as likely

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.420
to join the two pieces

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.010
than to break 'em, okay?

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.960
That means you need
net energy to break it.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.940
And what is it doing?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.100
If it happens to break
this piece and it undocks,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.810
well, they originally were
joined by 10 base pairs.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.810
When it undocks, there's
one piece joined by six,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.550
one piece joined by four.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.070
At the thermal temperatures
this thing operates at,

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.690
body temperature, and the time it stays

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.960
in the undocked position, those
two little pieces fly off.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.960
They're not bound as well,
and they just fly off.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.490
The enzymatic reaction is done.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.220
If it didn't happen and
there's still one piece,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.060
it goes back and tries again.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.140
And each time there's a probability of 1/3

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.670
that they will cut it, it goes up.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.230
So you take 2/3, raise it to the n power,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.810
and you find that you've
done your reaction.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.020
So the reason it's flopping
back and forth like that,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.020
in fact, the times that it
takes to flop back and forth

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.270
look very nice because
in a few cycles of this,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.370
it's done its thing, it
hasn't burned any energy.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.640
Everything is reversible, but
it's taking full advantage

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.453
of this disorder, the entropy.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.700
Okay, so you look back at
this little simple enzyme,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.973
and the moral here is
this is pretty smart.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.820
Now we see why it's flopping around,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.750
and you can actually begin
to understand the rates.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.050
All right, so emboldened,
we decided to go ahead

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.773
and look at even crazier problems.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.608
And so I wanna remind you of
the central dogma of biology

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:42.183
in very important calligraphy.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.120
So here we have the DNA,
and this as you all know,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.010
the base pair sequence
contains all the information

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.100
about your genetic makeup.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.560
And there is an enzyme that transcribes,

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.800
if you want to make a particular protein,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.210
there's an enzyme that goes to this DNA

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.110
and unravels a little bit of
it and makes a mirror copy

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.250
of one strand of the DNA called RNA.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.130
That's a wonderful enzyme
called RNA polymerase.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.190
There's huge amounts of
study of how this thing

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.190
actually works, what
tells it when to start

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.150
and stop and things like that.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.500
But then this message, the messenger RNA,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.670
then goes into another
machine and makes proteins.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.130
And this machine reads
this message, so for every

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.623
three bases, it looks around, say,

00:19:33.814 --> 00:19:36.470
UUA, some base sequence.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.350
So what's the amino acid
that corresponds to UUA?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.370
Oh, there it is, pop it in.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.450
What's the next message,
there it is, pops it in.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.080
And so it translates the base pair message

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.170
into a string of amino acids.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.590
The string of amino acids
fold into a protein.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.240
And these are, for the most part,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.353
the magical enzymes that make life happen.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.680
So I wanna study how this
machine actually works.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.540
So here's a picture, five
angstrom picture of this machine.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.550
So these purple things
and these dark blue things

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.700
are proteins, the light
blue and the gray things

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.947
are pieces of RNA.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.023
These red things in here are transfer RNA.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.350
This little squiggle in
here is the messenger RNA.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.940
This is a five angstrom structure of this.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.440
Now we're gonna peel back
and look at this object

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.550
without the RNA.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.010
And it's very nice because
you see right here,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.610
the tips over here,
that's the transfer RNA

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.243
are holding the amino acids.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.180
So they're looking, this transfer RNA,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.220
for every amino acid,
there is a unique base

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.170
corresponding to that amino acid.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.010
And the toe of this RNA is playing footsie

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.780
with this messenger RNA.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.650
And if there's a match
here, then this enzyme says,

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.290
okay, that's the right amino acid.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.620
Put that into this growing
chain of amino acids.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.780
One of the things I should point out

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.000
is there's no proteins around in the core

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.280
where these amino acids are being joined.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.090
So in this sense, this
enzyme is also an RNA enzyme,

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.080
one of these most
essential features, namely,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.680
linking the amino acids together

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.063
is done by RNA.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.723
Okay, so we want to understand
how this thing really works.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.770
Okay, so the overall
scheme of the transfer RNA

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.240
is going in and linking amino acids,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.163
was developed 40 years ago.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.570
But the mechanism has remained a mystery.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.710
There have been a new genetic biochemical

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.980
and kinetic experiments,
and you'll be hearing

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.720
now today about some new
single molecule experiments

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.920
that we have been doing.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.090
So I need to tell you a
little bit of background.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.760
RNA, the amino acids enter in what we call

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.900
a ternary complex, this
fancy word means three parts.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.230
What's the first part,
it's the transfer RNA.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.090
And this is the thing
that's gonna play footsie

00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.980
with the messenger RNA.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.920
So these dashes here are the
bases to see if it's a match.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.270
There's this blue thing
here, that's a protein.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.290
That has a fancy name,
elongation factor Tu.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.130
And it's a catalyst, it's an enzyme.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.630
And it makes the insertion
of the right amino acid

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.930
occur much faster, and
we'll see a little bit later

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.370
how that occurs.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.030
And of course the most
important thing, the amino acid,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.650
and that you can't see in this picture.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.423
It's behind this blue thing.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.900
All right, so what happens?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.040
This is now an atomic structure.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.170
It's a fake thing you can
get actually off the web.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.810
You can get the coordinates
and there are programs,

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.020
and you can actually make
these pretty pictures.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.980
But this is the ribosome.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.540
This dash thing is where
the messenger RNA is.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.270
And here's a transfer RNA
and here's another one.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:54.270
And suppose you want to
make a protein chain.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.830
Well, this thing comes along
and this protein over here

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.490
sticks to another protein on the ribosome,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.090
and all the amino acids carrying,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.060
all the ternary complexes will stick.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.870
And so it's a general sort
of faintly sticky thing

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.610
and then it checks, am I the right one,

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.910
by checking the base pairs, right?

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.610
And if it is right, then what happens

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.180
through a sequence of steps,
this thing incorporates in

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.090
and a peptide is form, a
peptide bond is formed,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.720
two amino acids are linked together.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.320
After that, they kind of
start to straddle over.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.440
Another mystery step occurs
where another object,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.750
another protein comes along and nudges it,

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.910
so this is in a so-called P site

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.660
and this is in the E or exit site,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.830
and then this thing
flies off and it's reset,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.230
and it's ready to accept another one.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.840
So what happens in this
process is you start this,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.970
initiate it, and every time
the a ternary complex goes in,

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.700
is it the right one, if not, it rejects.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.530
If it's the right one, it says okay,

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.430
make the amino acid link go through here.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.470
You're burning units of
fuel, two units of fuel.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.410
And it goes round and round again, resets,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.590
and goes round around until
it finally gets to a message

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.160
where it doesn't code for an amino acid,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.115
and it says time to stop, and there it is.

00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:16.116
So this is how you make proteins.

00:24:16.116 --> 00:24:19.960
This work was done in
collaboration with Jody Puglisi,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.870
the structural biology
department at Stanford.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.140
And it started with Scott
Blanchard and Harold Kim,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.640
two graduate students, later
joined by Ruben Gonzalez,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.350
who is a graduate student here.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.490
And Scott finally graduated and is now

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.973
a postdoc in my group.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.760
And okay, so now I'm gonna
focus on just one question.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.110
How does it actually pick
the right amino acid?

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.040
Well, it does it very well.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.070
It's error rate is only
one part in a thousand

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.240
to one part in 10,000.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.270
Now if you look at this,
and the way I was taught

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.700
in high school biology, you say, well,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.520
it's because of the bases.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.110
If the bases are a
complement to each other

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.770
and if it's a right match,
that's a good chemical bond,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.500
and so it sticks around
longer, and so it'll accept it.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.720
If it's one of the bases doesn't match,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.120
you don't have as many chemical
bonds, it will fly off.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.810
So that's good, so let's
examine that in some detail.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.350
There's some series of
spectacular experiments

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.760
that were done by Wolfgang
Wintermeyer and his colleagues

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.110
and what they found, and
their basic experiment is

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:28.330
they would put a dye
molecule on the transfer RNA,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.760
and as the transfer RNA
goes into the ribosome,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.440
there's a little bit of
flexing of the transfer RNA.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.110
And for whatever reason
that's not understood,

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.850
the amount of light this dye
molecule emits is changed.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.420
Not by much, five or 10%.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.160
But if you look at a whole bunch of them,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.180
what you can find is that it
goes into different states,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.000
and they look at the time
dependence of how the light,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.090
the amount of light is changing.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.500
And from that and other
techniques, they were able

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.130
to actually build together a model for how

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.800
this is really making
its decision process.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.930
And that plus other experiments
that others have done.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.550
And what they found was
here's our ribosome,

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.500
this yellow thing is that
protein, so it sticks

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.360
to the ribosome, it checks,
am I the right one or not.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.280
If I am the right one,
it goes forward and goes

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.830
into another state signaled by a change

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.610
in the amount of light.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:25.050
And if it's the right one, it goes forward

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.640
at a rate of 500 per second.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.260
If it's the wrong one, it
goes forward 10 times slower.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.520
The good news is if it's the wrong one,

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.200
there's a one base mismatch,
so if two of the bases match,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.110
but the first one didn't match,

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.510
it rejects a hundred times faster

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.530
than if it's the right message.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.150
So this is perfectly what you want.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.310
This is doing the right thing.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.880
The blue guys are the wrong one,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.070
the red guys are the right
ones, it's going fast.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.240
However, the next step occurred so fast

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.810
that it didn't matter.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.550
If whether it's the right
one of the wrong one,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.810
it was so fast compared
to the rejection rates

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.370
that no matter what was incorporated,

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.150
his measurements told
him it was happening,

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.873
and the ratio was only 1.07
to one right to wrong, okay?

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.510
Then afterwards he found
that the only real selection

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.030
was done later, much
later, where he was getting

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.940
a selection of about 1%.

00:27:19.782 --> 00:27:22.940
And he could measure when
the peptide bond was formed.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.910
Now to be fair, he realized
that this was contrary

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.730
to what was measured in E. coli

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.740
by a bunch of orders of magnitude.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.900
But he said, well, we know something.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.190
I had to do my experiments
at high concentration

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.780
of magnesium, and we know that if we put

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.450
E. coli in high
concentrations of manganese,

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.670
they make many more mistakes.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.040
An order of magnitude more
when you go by only a factor

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.800
two in magnesium concentration.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.750
And he was up by that factor
of two, so he said, well,

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.910
at least an order of
magnitude was due to that,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.853
and maybe that's why we didn't
see the first selection.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.650
Okay, so we decided we wanted to play,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.390
and so here's our ribosome,
here's our transfer RNA

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.200
with our little green dye on the elbow.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.650
And we put in another transfer
RNA with a little red dye

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.990
on an elbow of the RNA.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.840
So the amino acid is up here
at the tip of my finger,

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.890
the feet that's gonna check
the bases are down here

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.833
by my thumb, and the dye is
right there on my knuckle.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.170
And if this thing incorporates into this

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.790
machine, you're gonna see some color.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.850
So let me show you the raw data
to give you an appreciation.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.760
So here are these spots.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.330
Each spot for the most
part, besides from dirt,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.960
is a single dye molecule
attached on to the tRNA

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.780
on a ribosome, so one dot of light

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.950
is one ribosome on our surface.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.840
And in this field of
view, this is seen through

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.040
a green filter, and this
field of view is seen

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.070
through a red filter.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:54.680
The same field of view,
but the red filter.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.350
And so we start the clock,
and we start throwing in

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.100
transfer RNA with the red
dye, and this fuzz around here

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.220
is the dye weakly being
excited by our green laser.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.450
But occasionally you see what's
happening, there's beginning

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.120
to appear more and more
of these spots of light.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.780
And when these spots of light,
this one would correspond

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.010
to this one over here, you find
that the ratio of the colors

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.790
red and green are changing, okay?

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.280
So what we did is we float
in some transfer RNA.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.930
Here's our message on our messenger RNA.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.720
When we float is some
transfer RNA that was

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.450
the right match, it was
absolutely the right thing,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.140
and we wanted to compare
that to a near match

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.030
where we kept the same transfer RNA,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.190
but we changed the message.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.550
So instead of the first
one being a U, it's a C.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.190
And so you would make
two things over here,

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.670
and this one you would
only make, it's a weak one.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.332
So this one has two bonds,
two bonds plus a weak,

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:55.140
what's called a wobble pair,
so it's effectively like one.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.680
This is effectively two,
four, six, six hydrogen bonds.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.810
And this is two plus
one, three, four, okay.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.660
It's a little different but not much.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.070
But the difference is spectacular.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.230
This is a single time trace
looking now at the rate applied

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.020
on the y-axis is a ratio of
red light to total light.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.560
And here's one pops in, and
you immediately begin to see

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.760
more and more here it's all green light.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.680
Here you begin to see
more and more red light.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.907
It might pause a little bit here.

00:30:21.907 --> 00:30:24.550
And it goes up into the
state wobbling around.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.330
And we showed in other experiments
that once it's up here,

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.040
it's actually formed the peptide bond.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.770
I don't wanna tell you that detail.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.719
This thing here is a technical
flaw in our experiment.

00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:37.307
One of the molecules,
it's a single molecule,

00:30:37.307 --> 00:30:39.810
and they sometimes blink
off, they go to sleep

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.750
for a little while and they pop back up.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.313
And we don't know why it
is, we wish it'd go away.

00:30:45.364 --> 00:30:50.360
But we're gonna focus on here in the first

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.320
few hundred milliseconds, and
so this type of stuff is okay.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.320
So this is when we put in the right tRNA

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.470
with the right message.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.330
This is one where we put in the same tRNA

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.330
but the wrong message, and
we see blip, blip, blip.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.900
These are separate
events, because remember,

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.000
there's all this transfer RNA
flowing around the solution.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.100
If we wash that out, these blips go away.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.770
So we think each blip is a
let's play footsie, check, nope,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.770
you're not the one I should
be dating, you're out, okay?

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.830
Now you put hundreds of
these onto a timescale,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.020
and what you see is here
you float in the things

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.200
so the baseline changes.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.380
And then this scattered thing
here is these little blips.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.850
But if you put in the right
thing, it looks pretty good.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.100
But this is the absolute wrong way

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.450
you wanna analyze the data.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.040
Because what you wanna do
is for each time trace,

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.480
once it passes a certain
threshold, you say,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.610
let's start the clock then.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.930
You don't wanna start the clock

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.310
when you threw in the solution.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.500
You wanna do that when you're working with

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.830
a billion molecules all at once,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.610
but we're working with one at a time.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.210
So the point here is that
because you have the time record

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.360
of each individual molecule,
you can synchronize

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.330
at any point you want.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.830
And when you do that, you
get this pretty picture.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.740
So once you're above threshold
for the one base mismatch,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.950
you see that most of them
just dump immediately.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.340
Some of 'em straggle up a little higher.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.430
For the correct tRNA, you
see that instead of dumping,

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:21.630
they go maybe into some other state.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.260
Don't know on this one.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.710
And then it goes up in this high state,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.560
which we showed in earlier
experiments, that yes,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.840
we've actually formed that peptide bond.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.840
And this stuff here is
an onset of this blinking

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.030
that we wish would go away.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.760
So we're gonna now explore
what's happening here

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.120
and compare it to what's happening here.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.540
So for the first thing you can do, oh,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.650
just looking at this raw data,

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.380
you said yes, this is selecting something.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.030
And in the first stage
of selection, we found

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:52.890
that it's in fact there was some selection

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.140
in this first stage,
it's about seven to one.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.210
We were at slightly higher
magnesium concentration

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.403
than Wolfgang Wintermeyer,
a factor of two even higher.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.550
The reason why we see selection
they don't, we believe,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:12.440
is because their probe
confused two different states

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.920
with a single state.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.750
And then what they do is they do a mass

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.650
rate equation fit to that.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.810
And so they were, since their
probe didn't actually see

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:22.130
two different states, they missed it,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.770
so they were doing best that they could.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.610
And so it's really two states.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.630
In fact, this is crucial for interpreting

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.780
really what's going on.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.360
Okay, now let's look in more
detail at what's going on.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.950
We can put in the right
transfer RNA into the ribosome

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.460
with an antibiotic called tetracycline.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.050
Now you all know about antibiotics.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.720
In fact, many of you
have had tetracycline.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.930
It turns out there are
over 200 antibiotics

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:53.473
that are used to kill E.
coli and other bacteria,

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.510
mostly other bacteria.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.120
You don't really wanna kill your E. coli,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.420
but other bacteria, and
they attack the ribosome.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.300
These 200 antibiotics attacked the machine

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.220
because it's such a vital part
of the life of a bacteria.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.600
If you make this machine
not work, the bacteria die.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.900
What does tetracycline do?

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.870
Well, we found out what it
does is it stops the advance

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.640
of this transfer RNA into the ribosome

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.813
at the very first step.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.290
And at this point, even
if it's the right message,

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.580
they dump, okay, whether
it's the near miss

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.160
or they're hit, it dumps.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.503
And so that first step is
really a bonafide state, okay?

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.620
Well, there's also
another part of this thing

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.020
when the transfer RNA comes in.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.821
There's a unit of fuel in this.

00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:43.730
You're gonna break a phosphate bond.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.850
In biology, the coin of the
realm in terms of energy

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.080
is phosphate bonds, you
break a phosphate bond,

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.290
you release some chemical energy,

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.090
use that to do something.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.310
And in the accommodation process,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.960
you're breaking a phosphate bond.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.180
So what we can do is we can
put in the transfer RNA,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.170
the ternary complex, but with
a pre-burned unit of fuel.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.060
Instead of GTP with three
phosphates, triphosphate,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.850
we're gonna put in GDP, diphosphate, NP.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.470
And so the bond's already broken.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.870
But by and large, it looks
essentially the same.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.410
Very different.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.020
It goes from that initial 0.35 state

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.613
and it stalls here at 0.5.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.020
Okay, so you haven't gotten to the point

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.140
where you burned anything yet, and you see

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.660
that this thing was a bonafide
state, this 0.5 state.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.943
The 0.5 is half of it
red, half of it green.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.410
And once it's in this 0.5
state, it lingers there

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.550
for a very long period of time.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.490
In fact, about a factor
of 30 longer than before.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.453
So what's the mechanism for selection?

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.090
Now you need to know some
facts, some structural facts.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.240
And so this came out.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.240
There was a hint of it
in 1999 by Jody Puglisi

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.470
in our work, but it came
out in glorious detail

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.060
in 2001 with Ramakrishnan.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.430
And what he did is he looked
at the atomic structure

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.980
of the bottom part of the ribosome

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.280
that's accepting the tRNA.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.790
And he looked at that structure
and he found the structure

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.150
of the bottom part with the tRNA in it.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:19.370
And what he found was
that this thing closed in

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.170
around the base of the tRNA.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.130
So in addition to having
a base pair match,

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.590
this thing reacted by
closing in a little tighter

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.130
and gripped it a little bit.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.840
So there were additional
chemical contacts, okay.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.400
Another thing which you
just saw in our data,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.310
once it's, if it's a right
message, and once it goes

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.470
into this other state before
its burned a unit of fuel,

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.900
it's now stable, it's gonna linger around

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.920
for a long period of time,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.840
so the selection process must be over.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.760
Okay, so we, and one other
fact, another structural fact

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.760
that came out 2002 was
after it's stabilized,

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.160
it turns out the transfer RNA
is being held at the bottom

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.610
where the bases are, and
it's being held up here

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.220
with another loop on the ribosome,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.440
and there's a chemical
contact of one loop of RNA

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.800
on the ribosome to this
thing, this protein.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.480
So there's a little loop
called a sarcin-ricin loop

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.570
that's now thrown itself
on this little protein

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.280
and it's made a chemical contact.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.680
So this thing is bound
here and bound here.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.480
And it's bound there after
GTP hydrolysis, okay.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.110
So now we're gonna make a little leap.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.323
It's not much of a leap.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.830
This thing comes in and plays footsie.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.150
And because it's playing
footsie, if it's the right match,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.560
we know from structural
data that it closes in.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.090
Well, if it's gonna
close in, what do we see?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:51.090
We see that when it goes from 0.35 to 0.5,

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.200
it's actually moving closer
in to where it should be.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.523
That's from our FRET data.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.810
And so it's actually rotating.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.750
Remember, a dye molecule is on this elbow,

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.560
and it's rotating this dye molecule closer

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.450
to another dye molecule
located about here.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.010
Okay, so it goes from
this point to this point

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.640
just based on the fact
that the bottom part

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.130
has now wrapped itself around the bottom.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.430
And we know from our FRET
data it's rotating closer.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.900
Now it actually doesn't
smash it up against

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.490
this loop of RNA, this
sarcin-ricin loop immediately.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.510
How do we know this, because
it takes 50 milliseconds

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.970
to complete this reaction, okay?

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.160
So it's held there, it's a little closer,

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.630
but it still needs a big
thermal fluctuation to attach.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.990
Now as a physicist, you'd look at this

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.490
and say that makes great
sense, because what it's done

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:44.410
is the minuscule or no chemical
reaction difference here

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.830
is amplified by the
reaction of the bottom part.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.240
So you make additional
contacts if the shape is right.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.240
But it does something
even better than that.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.750
It's gonna magnify that a little more

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.950
because if the shape
is right it torques it,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.640
but it torques it not all the
way because it still needs

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.620
a gigantic thermal fluctuation to link it,

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.930
50 milliseconds worth of
a gigantic fluctuation.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.690
That makes it highly improbable.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.993
That puts the probability
up in the exponent.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.020
So if it's not the right shape,

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.730
it doesn't quite torque it enough.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.570
So you've now had a
compounding of probabilities

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.113
all put in the exponent.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.090
This, we believe, is the
first stage of selection.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.660
And it also very clearly seems to suggest

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.510
what was before a very
big mystery to this.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.470
This molecule, the ribosome's big.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.540
It's 200 angstroms in size.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.523
The transfer RNA is 90
angstroms in length.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.270
So the biologists said, how could this be?

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.210
Something's happening
down here at the foot,

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.560
and then you're making an additional cut,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.560
and we know GTP hydrolysis
is occurring here

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.400
some 60 angstroms away.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.790
How is this knowledge
communicated up here?

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.610
Is this some mysterious
way through the body

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.190
of the ribosome, or is it
through the transfer RNA?

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.520
And we now know from our FRET measurement

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.470
that it's just rotating closer together,

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.040
that it just simply getting it more likely

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.203
to touch the sarcin-ricin loop.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.700
So that's what we call, or
what the biologists call

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.550
an allosteric reaction, seems
to be an action in a distance.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.540
So what's the real mechanism?

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.800
Well, what happens after GTP hydrolysis?

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.830
Well, what we know, again from structure,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:30.650
is after GTP hydrolysis,
which is by the way occurring

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.413
right here on this, right at that point,

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.853
this protein falls away.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.650
Now we don't know, but it's
likely that if that protein

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.940
falls away, this contact
is greatly weakened,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.170
and maybe it snaps back
into that rotated position.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.440
That's if it's the right fit.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.210
If it's the wrong fit it actually
rotates even further away.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.270
And so what appears to be happening

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:59.070
is that after GTP hydrolysis
and this thing is released,

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.940
Hopfield was dead-on right.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.540
You're testing the bottom
reaction again, okay?

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.210
He was invoking GTP hydrolysis, remember,

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.900
to make it irreversible,
and he suggested maybe

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.580
you tested it once on the
way in, after GTP hydrolysis,

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.500
you test it again, and if it works,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.850
then you fully accommodate.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.060
So we think he's right.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.850
He was being tested again.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:23.550
It's mostly shape though, it
wasn't energy, bond energy.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.360
But there's something even
better, and the last thing,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.820
again, a structural piece of information

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.563
from the atomic resolution data.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.680
When the tRNA is really in
there and it's about to make

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.140
the peptide bond form, it's
bound here at the base.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.600
It's also bound right near the amino acid,

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.280
right just before that, and a little loop,

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.980
another loop of RNA on the
ribosome called the A-loop.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:51.100
And by looking at the atomic
resolution of the upper part

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.660
of the ribosome, remember, you can't get

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.610
atomic resolution of the whole thing.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.400
The atomic resolution in
the upper part, you find

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.220
that when tRNA is bound to it,
this A-loop is sticking out

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.220
and making contacts with this tRNA.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.803
So it's changing shape
in order to make contact.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.223
So you might think, well, isn't that cozy.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.990
Before this tRNA can actually go in fully,

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.620
something's gotta happen over here.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.680
It's gotta change shape
to allow final binding

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.763
to stabilize the tRNA,
otherwise it's held down here.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.180
So you might think is the energy released.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.330
In GTP hydrolysis, you have
some energy you can burn.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.800
Maybe you can make some mechanical motion

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.093
to change that A-loop.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.090
So we looked at the following,
we took our ribosome,

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.210
there's a chemical you
can use that actually cuts

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.830
that sarcin-ricin loop
at a very specific spot,

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.880
and so we exposed this
reagent to our ribosomes,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.710
and now the sarcin-ricin loop is cut.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:49.140
We throw in the right tRNA,
it goes from the initial state

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.770
up to the 0.5, but it
never makes it to 0.75.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.890
And as you see, this little haze up here,

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.190
which I'm not sure shows up,
but you see futile attempts

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.640
of it going in, it stays
momentarily, but it backs out.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.170
Goes in and backs out.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.510
And so with the sarcin-ricin
loop cut, what we're seeing is

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.610
the door isn't fully opened,
it can't really finally

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.200
stabilize in the right thing.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.720
And if you compare this to the intact one,

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.983
it goes 0.35, 0.5, 0.75,
peptide bond forms.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.613
So we're conjecturing, and
this is wild speculation,

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.950
and that's why it's
suitably colored in brown,

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.363
that brown is the color of speculation.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:37.230
That maybe the energy of
hydrolysis is actually used

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.460
to supply the conformational
change for the A-loop

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.950
that finally opens the
door and lets it go in.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.390
So here we have a really
cute little setup now.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:49.150
We have first it goes, it checks.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.530
Am I the right one or am I the wrong one?

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.290
If it's the right one, fine, it goes in.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.720
You have GTP hydrolysis.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.180
That makes this series of
steps different from that one,

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.700
but this is now a series of steps,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.900
where each step is now
magnifying the probability

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.150
of picking the right one.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.940
And once you've passed it
through here, you can still

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.820
get the wrong people in,
and so after GTP hydrolysis,

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:19.820
it breaks the link of the tRNA
to this sarcin-ricin loop,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.210
so you're testing it
again, but in the meantime,

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.900
you're finally opening
the door to let the tRNA

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.620
go in for real, permanently.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.921
Before that, the door was only ajar.

00:44:30.921 --> 00:44:33.350
And that we see from our FRET data.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.510
So this is the second test.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.940
It's now hanging over here,
but can finally stabilize

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.670
over here, it couldn't
even go in here before,

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.093
or it can fly away, so
you get to test it again.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.330
The overall fidelity rate at
this magnesium concentration

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.050
is a little bit better,
six times 10 minus three.

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.540
But remember, we're at 15
millimolar concentration,

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.700
a factor of three higher
than what is in E. coli.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.910
We will try to repeat these experiments

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.230
at lower concentration,
there are technical reasons,

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.810
but we have a faster camera,
we think we can get closer

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:07.930
to physiological solutions.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.570
But it seems to all be there.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.003
Okay, so what have you heard about?

00:45:16.445 --> 00:45:19.610
There are two steps,
selection and proofreading.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.750
It starts with the bond
formation, but it's mostly shape,

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.980
but it's not only shape,
it's shape magnified

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.490
by the reaction of the
bottom part of the ribosome

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.310
that then induces this to move to make it

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:36.173
another probability of linking,
right, to the correct thing.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.560
Now you see all those steps are not only

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.963
necessary, they're minimal.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.610
You needed GTP hydrolysis,
separates selection

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:49.100
from proofreading, but you're
seeing that GTP hydrolysis

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.980
and gaining a stable, saying this step

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.520
for the next step simultaneously,
the hydrolysis was needed

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.940
to make the two separate,
but it is also finally

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.380
opening the door so it can finally go in.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.760
So it's beginning to look
like a minimal number

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.203
of steps, very efficient.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.560
Okay, so at this level, I'm
hoping I'm convincing you

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.700
that it's beginning look
like chemistry and biology.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.060
Biology is beginning to look
like chemistry and physics.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.350
It's becoming to look very mechanistic.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.840
Okay, because we have these
beautiful high-resolution

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.730
structural pictures and a
little bit of motion picture,

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.690
and we then link these things together.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.280
So let me come back to what's going on.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.360
Can physics be described by life,

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.583
or can life be described by physics?

00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:35.266
(audience laughing)

00:46:35.266 --> 00:46:37.820
Yes, some graduate students
think there's no life.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:42.820
And so will we be able to, okay
what is physics really like?

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.130
We like universal laws that apply

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.470
to all biological organisms.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.930
And you haven't heard
about any universal laws.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.120
Let's talk about what we
mean by universal law.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.110
I would call Kepler's Laws,
let's say the planets go around

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.360
the sun in ellipses, as
a phenomenological law.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.000
It's just, you know, that
happens to be they go around

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.533
in ellipses, they sweep out
equal areas in equal times.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.270
But universal laws,
let's say Newton's Laws

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.130
of Motion and Gravity, because
they apply to all bodies,

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.270
to planets, to galaxies,
to apples falling down.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.210
And that's more a universal law,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.200
and you can calculate all sorts of stuff.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.900
So we would ideally like
to have a Newton's Law.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.923
We don't have Kepler's Laws yet either.

00:47:29.954 --> 00:47:33.090
Okay, now here are some
common sense things.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.510
By burning energy, you
can do rapid proofreading,

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.620
and you can also transport molecules

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.510
better than diffusion that way.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.563
And so this you could've guessed,

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.910
but we don't understand
these things, we don't,

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.320
if you really think you understand it,

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.930
you could say at what point
does a biological organism

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:54.860
choose to burn energy
to transport a molecule

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.550
or set of molecules from
one position to another

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.343
versus letting diffusion take its course.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.770
Proofreading mechanisms.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.760
Here's one that's determined by shape,

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.380
not by the strength of chemical bonds.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.070
And it's the shape
discrimination amplified

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.963
by these conformational
changes that occur.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:18.460
Well, it turns out that
probably a lot of proof-making

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.650
mechanisms are by shape.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.920
These are some molecular
structures of another enzyme

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.070
that can't make mistakes.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.343
This one duplicates DNA.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.080
So here you have your family jewels,

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.910
and you want to make a copy of it.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.680
And so you unwind it, and
then on each separate strand,

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.350
you wanna put in the complementary bases

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.980
so you have an intact piece of DNA

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.120
that you can pass down to your children.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.500
And DNA polymerase is
the name of this machine

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.460
that makes this, they come
in all shapes and sizes,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.953
but they have roughly the same structure.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.390
And it's a curious little
thing because this thing

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.220
has got something that looks like a hand,

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.340
a thumb, a finger and something.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.570
And here's the DNA,
and here it's in a mode

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:06.540
where it's looking at the open base

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.150
and it reaches in solution
puts in the right one,

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:11.130
and then marches again
and puts in the right one,

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.310
so it's replicating.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.600
But it's actually pretty smart,
because it's can sometimes

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.120
say no, wrong one put in
there, and it actually

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.670
flips into another mode
and says you're not really

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.943
supposed to be there, out
you go, and try it again.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.113
So what's it doing?

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:31.730
Well, it's probably looking at the shape.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.813
So put it in, touch it.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.750
Is this, yeah, good fit,
go on to the next one.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.030
And so this is perfect for FRET.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:41.870
You can put a little thing
here, a little thing here.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:43.300
Is it really touching or something.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.621
So we'll have a look at this guy.

00:49:45.621 --> 00:49:47.607
But looking at the
structures of other things,

00:49:47.607 --> 00:49:50.500
RNA polymerase, it's looking like...

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.780
It was funny, I was in a
seminar by a graduate student.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.560
He was giving this thing
about what he's found

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.483
in the structure of RNA polymerase.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:00.920
And he was saying, and
here's the structure,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.730
and here's the DNA, and
it seems to be all okay,

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.450
but there's nothing in this
machine that's looking at

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:08.840
whether the bases are
doing the right thing.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.030
It too has to make a decision
and put the right base in.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:14.970
And it only seems to
care about the outside,

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.260
and someone the audience said, no,

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.470
that doesn't make any intuitive sense,

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.290
there's gotta be something it's checking.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.620
And I was sitting there
chuckling and saying,

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.893
no, it looks like it's
pretty good, it's the shape.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.230
So maybe it's the shape, who knows.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:33.230
Okay, so I want to end by saying
that physics is very young,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.970
it's actually only 400 years old.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.320
I would say people like
Galileo were the first

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.800
to really combine, experiment
in mathematical models

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.880
and really test what's going on.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.580
And so let's talk about
400 years, and let's put it

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.070
on a timescale that we can understand.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.730
This is something I took
from a Rich Muller website.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:58.290
It's actually the temperature of the Earth

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.480
looking back 12,000 years.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.420
Here's the temperature of
the Earth as measured by,

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.800
let's say, the ratio of
oxygen 16 to oxygen 18,

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.530
and the warm parts over
here were good things,

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.050
you know, building of
cathedrals and things like that.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:16.310
The bad parts down here were
bad things like black plague

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.540
and things like, but could
have been a coincidence.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.410
And then over here there's a little burp

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.570
and then finally it go plunge
down, this was an ice age,

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.173
and over here is global warming.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.640
I don't wanna be facetious, there is,

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.540
I actually believe
there is global warming.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.370
I'll be glad to take questions on that.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.200
I just want to say that
you notice it's very stable

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.930
over here, if you look
back a half million years,

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.350
it's wobbling up and down,
it's going from ice age

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.800
to warm spots to ice age to warm spots.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.780
But over here you have a very
stable part of the history,

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.180
it's really a big stable
part, and right here

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.330
is when agriculture started,
maybe also coincidental

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.493
that agriculture starts
when the climate stabilizes.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.283
That's where science is, okay,

00:52:01.062 --> 00:52:02.970
and this is where maybe
civilization starts.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.070
You have agriculture, you
can have enough free time

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.763
to think about other things.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.320
So it's very young and a lot's happened

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.480
in the last 400 years.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.010
In fact, a lot's happened
in the last 50 years.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.300
And so you can say, well, what will happen

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.520
in the next 40 years?

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.480
Well, I'm not gonna live that long,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.340
and mostly people are interested
in what's gonna happen

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.943
in the next granting period.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.430
Next three or four years.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.963
But I think you should keep that in mind.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.550
I think there is some clue as to first

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.430
the elegance of some of
these biological machines.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.743
I just described two.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.863
But how really elegant they are.

00:52:45.556 --> 00:52:48.560
And despite the fact that
you have this huge memory

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.510
of evolution that may
not get you, you know,

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.850
but you also have
billions of years of time

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.983
to refine your mistakes,

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.710
now it's also true that
maybe not everything

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.740
is the absolute best, it can be optimized

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.190
just as the structure
of a city is determined

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.060
by its history and not
by some design engineer

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.950
with a blank piece of paper.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:16.250
But in some instances, I
think like the ribosome

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.730
at least in this combination process,

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.360
it's looking pretty elegant.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.550
Now you can ask even
bolder, crazier questions,

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.120
like why is the transfer RNA so big.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.243
The amino acid is a
little thing that's like

00:53:27.243 --> 00:53:30.760
the tip of my fingernail,
and there's this big thing

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.540
that's bringing it in.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.680
Is it because of history,
biological evolution,

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:38.200
or is there something about
the timescale of the dynamics

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.460
that you want it big to make it slow,

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.910
because if you want it, because
you need decision-making

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:47.558
time to reject or
accept, and if it's small

00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:52.230
and rattling about very rapidly,
then it might be too hard

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:55.810
to design something
that's 10 e-folds away,

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:57.790
it may be easier to design
something that's three

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.040
or four e-folds away, but
bigger and just slower to move

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.420
so the temp frequency's there.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.083
Who knows, that's wild
speculation, doubly brown.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.850
But why not, we can think about it.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.990
And so in the end, I think,

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:15.350
yes, it's wigglings
and jigglings of atoms,

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.560
but as we have these new
probes to look at things

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.470
at this molecular point
of view in real time,

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.750
I think I'm very hopeful
that we can actually reduce

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.030
this stuff to something
that really makes sense.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.690
There is no mystery step anymore.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.000
At least at simple things
like how do we make proteins

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.440
or how do we decide what proteins to make

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.313
and transcription factors.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.520
Whether we can understand
more complicated things

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.423
like how brains work is a different story.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.650
I mean, there's another
project we have in our lab

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:50.530
where we're trying to
understand how neurons

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:53.780
talk to other neurons, but
the detailed molecular thing

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.393
of how they really talk
at this mechanistic level.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.210
And from there, if you
can then make things

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:06.250
that so you can bring this,
it's admittedly a big jump

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.200
from understanding the
C word, consciousness,

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.280
and things like that.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.180
But maybe memory is not so bad.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.770
That I think is within our
realm of our understanding.

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.073
But we'll see, so just
wait 40 or 400 years,

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:22.930
and I'll report back to
you if I can, thank you.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:26.097
(audience applauding)

00:55:27.869 --> 00:55:31.369
(gentle electronic music)
