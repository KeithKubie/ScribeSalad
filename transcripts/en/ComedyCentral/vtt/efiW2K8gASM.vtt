TO STAY OFF THE STREET
TONIGHT

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.678
BECAUSE OF MENACING,
LIFE-ROBBING BLACK, BLACK ICE.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.680
- ISAAC.

- DARREN, ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT BLACK ICE?

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.205
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.739
- OOH, JEEZ,
IT'S FRIGHTENING

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.275
JUST TO EVEN SAY
"BLACK ICE."

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:19.178
- IT'S SCARY, TRICKY,
RUTHLESS STUFF, THAT BLACK ICE.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:22.482
A PERFECTLY SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD
CAN BE SUDDENLY TERRORIZED

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.283
BY THE APPEARANCE
OF BLACK ICE.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.787
- WELL, ONE MUST
KEEP IN MIND THAT,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.623
JUST BECAUSE BLACK ICE
LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN WHITE ICE,

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.792
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY MORE DANGEROUS.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.427
ALSO, ONE MUST REMEMBER

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.864
HOW HARD IT IS
FOR BLACK ICE TO SURVIVE,

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.366
WHAT WITH THE AUTHORITIES
TRYING TO DESTROY IT

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.502
WITH THE SNOW PLOWS
AND SALT TRUCKS,

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.204
BUT BLACK ICE PERSEVERES.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.639
- UH-HUH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.541
AND AS YOU CAN SEE
RIGHT NOW,

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:49.642
THE CITY
IS BEING CONTROLLED

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.345
BY LOTS
OF OPPRESSIVE WHITE SNOW,

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.581
MAKING IT HARD
FOR ALL PEOPLE TO ADVANCE.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.417
AND WE DON'T HEAR
MUCH "NEWS" ABOUT THAT,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.418
NOW, DO WE?

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:00.386
- NO, WE DO NOT!

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.623
- WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
BROTHER DARREN.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.193
- BUT LET'S BE HONEST--
BLACK ICE IS THE REAL MENACE.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.396
LAST NIGHT I WAS IN
A PERFECTLY SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.266
WALKING AWAY
FROM AN A.T.M. MACHINE,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.334
WHEN BLACK ICE
JUST SNUCK UP ON ME

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.937
AND PRACTICALLY ROBBED ME
OF MY BALANCE.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.307
- OUCH. THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE
SOMETHING BLACK ICE WOULD DO.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.778
- WELL, I JUST HOPE THAT FOLKS
WATCH OUT SO THE WHITE SNOW

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.214
DOESN'T BLIND THEM
AND KEEP THEM FROM SEEING

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.749
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.250
- ALL I'M SAYING
IS I CAN'T THINK

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.586
OF A SINGLE CHRISTMAS SONG
ABOUT BLACK ICE.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.756
LOTS OF CHEERFUL, UPLIFTING
SONGS ABOUT SNOW, SO...

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.758
- [laughs]
WELL...

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:42.728
FOR THE RECORD, BLACK ICE
NEVER ASKED TO BE OUT HERE.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.397
- NO, IT DID NOT!

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.567
- IT'S A PRODUCT
OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.735
- OOH, HALLELUJAH!

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.772
- IN FACT, BLACK ICE
DIDN'T LAND ON THE ROAD.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.974
THE ROAD
LANDED ON BLACK ICE!

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.211
- WHOO! AMEN!

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.680
- OKAY.

BEING RUINED BY BLACK PEOPLE?
