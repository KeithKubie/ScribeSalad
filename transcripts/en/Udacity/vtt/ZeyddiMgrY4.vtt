Congratulations on finishing unit 4!

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.798
We've done a lot in this unit, so well done for getting through this.

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:10.753
Now we're going to talk to Ian Buck from NVIDIA about CUDA's past, present, and future,

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:15.482
and then in the assignment, what we're going to do is learn how to remove red eyes from photographs,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:19.000
so that your photographs can look just a little bit better.
