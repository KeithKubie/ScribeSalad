00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:05.580
Lovers who’ve been together awhile tend
almost universally to get maddened by what

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.349
look (on the surface) like certain absurdly
small matters. An otherwise quite reasonable

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.330
and decent person might admit to a range of
acute sensitivities around some of their partner’s

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.590
rather minor habits – and a tendency swiftly
to lose their temper on encountering them:

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.730
they press far too hard on the chopping board;
they don’t put their seat belt on until

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.250
after the car is started; in their handwriting
‘b’ and ‘h’ are practically indistinguishable;

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.989
they squeeze the toothpaste tube the wrong
way (pressing at the neck rather than the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.700
bottom); they use the word the word ‘tragic’
to mean ‘sad’; they leave drawers fractionally

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.199
open; when they drink a glass of water they
never drink it right down to the end but always

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.629
tip out the last few drops into the kitchen
sink. Our reactions to such things can seem

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.480
wildly out of proportion. We may get extremely
worked up – and then feel mean and possibly

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.280
insane. In quieter moments, we may wonder
how we could ever let such insignificant matters

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.430
get to us so much. Rather than tell ourselves
we are simply idiotic (though of course we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.160
are all idiots at heart), we should lavish
thought and time on the logic of our tiny

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.420
points of ire. The little thing – the small
irritant – is always a symbol of a large

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.560
and in truth very important issue operating
in the background of a relationship, though

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.720
unfortunately it’s not always easy for us
to put our finger on what the real issue is

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.740
and therefore to give a calm and accurate
account of what is, in fact, probably a genuine

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.080
cause for concern. Ironically, we’re very
generous about symbols when they turn up outside

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.920
our own lives, particularly in art: at college
we might write a thoughtful essay on what

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.960
sunflowers meant to Van Gogh or why the colour
blue was so important to Picasso. With these

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.400
artists, we are generous. We don’t think
they were idiotic to get so obsessed with

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.600
little things. We expend our imaginative effort
to trying to work out what the details meant.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.220
We should take a lesson from this patient
and investigative approach and do for the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.181
important little details of our own emotional
lives some of what art historians did for

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:25.520
the details of their canvases. For the vigorous
pressing on the chopping board, it’s not

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.090
the potential damage to the wood that’s
in essence important. We could probably meet

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.990
the expense of replacing the board once a
year or so. But our partner’s overeager

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.010
effort (as we see it) is a tiny moment in
which we catch sight of a much more troubling

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.410
and larger quality in them: a sense of indelicacy,
roughness and lack of restraint. And we fear

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.260
this side of them not so much in their life
in general, but in relation to ourselves:

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.550
the real fear is that they won’t realise
when they are hurting us. Our worry isn’t

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.860
for the board, but for ourselves. With the
seat belt, the real point at issue might be

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.550
around authority. We were always taught to
put the belt on before starting the engine.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.630
We obeyed. We have learned to do the ‘right
thing’. Why then do they feel they can get

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.630
away with breaking the rules? What is this
slightly arrogant, entitled sense of being

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.300
different? The absurdly tiny detail of precisely
when the seatbelt is fastened becomes the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.790
carrier of a grand and in its way properly
legitimate concern: will my partner ever understand

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.350
the fear of ‘doing the wrong thing’ and
sympathise generously with it; will they stop

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.140
feeling they are above the rules? Equally
important issues are – behind the scenes

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.040
– evident everywhere. The few drops of water
the partner empties casually from the glass

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.140
are not about wastage (in a lifetime it might
add up to one bathful only) but the fear that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.670
they might treat us in a similar fashion and
(without a second thought, after they have

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.459
drunk the best of our years) throw us away.
Around the handwriting: their cheery Post-it

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.680
note on the kitchen table on Saturday morning
‘gone to buy bread’ (which could be pedantically

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.819
deciphered as ‘gone to buy head’) doesn’t
genuinely confuse us. Rather, we resent their

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.930
lack of worry about being misunderstood. We
resent the implication (embodied in this tiny

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.590
detail) that they don’t have to take special
care to make themselves clear to us. We see

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.000
in the note a lifetime of misunderstanding
and loneliness. So we are right to worry.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.710
The problem is the way we handle our anxieties.
Ideally, we wouldn’t simply curse and get

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.050
irritable. We would patiently transfer our
attention and concern away from the minor

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.550
instance, the symbol, towards the real nucleus
of our complaint, which we would lay out with

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.180
care, sympathy and a touch of humour. Once
the real issues in our relationships are raised,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.870
the annoying details may be less difficult
to live with, because, most probably, our

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.020
partner won’t be indifferent to our articulated
worries. With the riskiest symbols decoded,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.360
love stands a chance of becoming ever more
mutual, peaceable

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.980
and secure.
