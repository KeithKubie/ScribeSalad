HAOHSIANG LIAO: We
always tell our students

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.620
to trust their ears,
not their eyes.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.200
That basically means that
we want them to work more

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.280
with the audio files.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.510
So interact with the
audio files for DVDS.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.690
Work with them.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.530
Work with the sounds.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.677
And I always ask my students,
when you interact with people,

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:27.760
what are you dealing with?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.420
You deal with sounds, not texts.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.910
So that's what we mean by
trust your ears, not your eyes

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.600
because students,
when they're out

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.840
of time, the first thing
they do for preparation

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.260
is to read the dialogue.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.620
It's reading.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.230
They read the dialogue and
thought that they know.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.170
However, they're not
familiar with the sounds.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.280
And in class, what
we do a lot in class

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.230
is interactions by
speaking and listening.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.360
So they will feel
totally disoriented

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.990
if they just focus on reading
or talking about the text

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.930
or romanizations of a language.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.490
So that's always the first
challenge for our students,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.500
how to give up
yourself to your ears.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.500
And we know that this also
increases students' anxieties

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
from time to time.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.390
But this is always a reminder we
have to our students every day

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.750
that work more.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.050
When you have time, work with
the audio files, not just

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.550
reading the romanizations.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.370
If your preparation
lies mostly in reading,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.230
that will not get you too
far in your Chinese studies.
