Everyone knows dry ice is super cold,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.340
and our Mega Solar Scorcher is super hot.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.360
So what happens if they go up
against each other in a battle?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.340

[Music]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.220
[Music]

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.000
Guys, we've had literally hundreds,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.400
possibly thousands of
comments asking to see

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.420
what happens if we pit dry ice
against our Mega Solar Scorcher.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.480
So today, that is what we're doing.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.011
We will take the Solar Scorcher

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:30.000
and we'll focus it right
on the surface of the dry ice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.830
After that, we'll try taking some dry ice,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.620
breaking it up into a powder,
and focusing the solar scorcher on that.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.149
We will then try
focusing it on lead, on pennies,

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.890
and on a steel plate
sitting on top of the dry ice

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.530
to see which one wins,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.380
the extreme cold of the dry ice,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.079
or the extreme heat of the Mega Solar Scorcher.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.800
I have a good setup on our Solar Scorcher,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.520
so we should be able to set
things down right where we want them.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.540
And focus the beam right where we want it,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.379
without having to hold on to it too long.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.680
I've got some welding glasses

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.309
so I can look carefully and focus the point

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.710
right where I want it for maximum heat.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.820
I think at this point,
we just have to try it.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.160
Our old Solar Scorcher frame
had started to break down

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.560
and the lens had gotten cloudy.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.100
So this is our new frame and our new lens,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.980
the all new Mega Solar Scorcher 2.0.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.000
We're going to try and break
this block of dry ice in half,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.060
and we'll put half of it under the beam,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.240
and we'll put half of it
off to the side as a control,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.920
so we can see the difference
of having the light focused on it,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.280
or not focused on it.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.940
Just like with the mini solar scorcher,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.160
this bolt works as a marker
to show us when it's focused.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.140
It's perfectly perpendicular to our screen,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
so once we get the shadow
to disappear completely,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.500
we know that we've got
our lens pointed right at the sun.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.009
Dry ice reflects a lot of light.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.140
It's very white.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.240
So it may not retain the heat very well.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.740
That's why this is an experiment.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.220
Let's find out what happens.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.890
Got my welding goggles,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.920
normal sunglasses.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.360
Don't cut it.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.900
Here it goes.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.200
We have a dot focused right
on the surface of that dry ice.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.400
It definitely looks like there's
more vapors coming off of the brick

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.360
that has the sunlight focused on it.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.420
Just as a quick test
to show that this is hot,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.600
I'm gonna stick a stick
right in that focal point.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.800
[Music]

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.780
And the stick is burning and it's on fire.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.600
Well there you go.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
About 2 seconds in
the sunlight to light on fire.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.860
Very nice and hot.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.540
Standing behind it here,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.880
I'm gonna put my regular sunglasses on
because I'm not looking right at point,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.820
but just that whole brick
of dry ice is just glowing.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.760
A lot of the light is
shining right down through it.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.980
Just getting near.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.900
It's so warm.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.620
Over here, not so much.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.060
Here's the block of dry ice that was sitting 
in the focal point of our solar death ray.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.160
And here's the block of ice that was
just sitting off to the side as a control,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.140
and they look the same.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.140
The one that was in the focal
point really hasn't changed much.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520
It didn't seem to sublimate
any noticeable amount faster.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.420
For the most part,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.060
I'm gonna say that the heat
from the Solar Scorcher didn't do much,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.420
and it was sitting in that
focal point for about 20 minutes.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.900
I think the solid white nature
of this hard Carbon Dioxide

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.200
just isn't much affected
by the heat from our Solar Scorcher.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.900
Let's try taking a piece of the dry ice,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.990
crushing it into powder,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.160
and seeing that does anything
when focused under the lens.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.200
[Music]

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.220
That looks like a pretty
good pile of dry ice powder.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.840
Let's focus our death ray on it,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.280
and see if it does anything.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.300
There we go.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.360
Beautifully in the focal point.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.700
Wood, lights almost instantly.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.260
Dry ice, lights less.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.300
[Music]

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.920
After 15 minutes of our dry ice powder
sitting under the solar scorcher, it's...

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.960
It's just powder.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.300
Nothing's really happens to it.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.580
It may have sublimated a
little bit faster than normal,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.920
but now we know that for the most part,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.960
a solar scorcher focused on some
dry ice powder won't do too much to it.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.240
Next up, there are three types of metal.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.180
We're gonna test
as a control without dry ice.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.600
This is a plate of steel,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.800
these are some lead fishing sinkers,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.020
and this is a penny.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.100
This penny is from 2011,
which means it's mostly made of zinc,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.760
with a thin copper coating.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.120
All right, ready?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.500
There we go.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.000
Penny in the focal point.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.660
And it's destroyed.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.900
That took all of about
three seconds to be completely ruined.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.440
Oh.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.800
Oh! And now, it's doing something else,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.640
I think the Zinc is actually burning
from the heat of the solar scorcher.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.940
I don't want to breathe that in.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.380
Oh, I can't really push it any more
because this penny is actually liquid.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.300
Sweet. Love it.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.180
Alright, this time, I have a stack of pennies,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.700
and I'm just gonna slide
those right into the focal point.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.140
The height makes it so
it's not quite as focused.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.820
But that top penny has
still already been destroyed.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.100
[Music]

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.060
This is now a barely
contained pile of molten metal.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.100
I'm just gonna smoosh it. Smoosh.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.060
The pennies melted very easily.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.500
And now, we're going to try lead,
which actually has a much lower melting point,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.360
so I suspect this is
gonna go almost instantly.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.800
It is bubbling, and it is melted.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000
Yep, took just a couple of seconds,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.220
and that thing is
just liquid, liquid, liquid,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.880
runny silver metal.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.240
Well pennies and lead
just liquefied in seconds.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.720
Let's try something
a little bit more resistant,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.340
a plate of steel.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.660
Now, the Solar scorcher does
not get hot enough to liquefy this.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.920
But I'm betting we see
a little bit of deformation,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.720
maybe some discoloration.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.220
And overall, it is going to get hot.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.180
[Music]

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.960
Well there's the
discoloration I was talking about.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.000
[Music]

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.220
Steel plate is nice and hot.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.140
Let's drip some water on it
and watch what happens.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.400
[Music]

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.320
Just immediately, skitters right off,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.840
Leidenfrost full in effect.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.600
[Music]

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.000
Boiling instantly.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.320
Let's take that plate off
and see what it looks like.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.080
We did get deformation.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.400
That plate is not flat anymore.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.220
It's not terribly warped,
but it's changed shape a bit.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.560
We've now seen what happens,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.640
focusing the full power
of our solar scorcher on pennies,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.680
on some lead sinkers,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.320
and on a steel plate.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.220
Let's see what happens if we place
each of those on top of dry ice,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.930
and then focus our death ray on it.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.640
Our penny has lined up nicely
with where the focal point will be.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.420
It's sitting on the dry ice.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.960
And at this point, it is extremely cold.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.700
Let's learn what happens
if we add a little bit of heat.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.400
And by a little bit,
I mean a lot, a whole big lot.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.040
[Music]

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.200
Penny is in the death ray.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.520
At least very close to the death ray.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.040
Now, it's in the death ray.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.220
Oh it's spinning.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.900
I didn't see that coming.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.160
It's getting destroyed.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.300
The surface of the
penny is bubbling and burning

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.460
the same way it did on the paver stone.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.240
And now the penny,
because it got so hot,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.810
is tunneling through the dry ice.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.620
That is crazy.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.120
Let's poke it with a stick, for Science.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.720
That was amazing.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.620
Let's try it with a stack of pennies.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.520
[Music]

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.980
As the molten pennies
tunnel through the dry ice,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.800
of course they somewhat leave
the focal point of the solar scorcher.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.400
Interestingly, I think
a single penny tunneled a bigger hole

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.180
than a stack of five pennies.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.480
All right, we are focused on the lead.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.760
That is some bubbly warm metal.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.300
Very very liquid.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.560
As it's tunneling down through the dry ice,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.540
some little bits of lead
are becoming separated from the rest.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.360
And those parts are
solidifying again quite easily.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.840
The lead melted super easily.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.300
And once it was molten metal,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.580
it tunneled down through
the dry ice pretty quickly.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.080
We've got some great cavities,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.560
both from where the pennies were,
and from where the molten lead was.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.080
Pouring some water down onto our plate,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.180
it has cooled off to the point
that it no longer is evaporating quickly.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.580
I kinda want to just leave
it here for a second longer

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.020
until it gets so cold again,
that all of that water freezes.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:56.100
[Music]

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.200
The ice on our steel plate
has now frozen all the way through.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.381
And I'm just gonna refocus
the solar scorcher on it

00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.120
and see how long that ice stays solid.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.540
Oh, I hear sizzling.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.460
I think that ice is not
gonna stay ice for long.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.320
It's gone.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.560
So there's our steel plate being
hit with the full force of our solar scorcher,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.180
sitting on top of a block of dry ice.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.700
Which do you think is gonna win?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.120
Do you think the plate will get hot?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.040
Or do you think it's gonna stay cold?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.700
[Music]

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.640
A steel plate, that just a minute ago was so 
cold that water froze in a matter of seconds,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.940
now just boils that water almost instantly.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.279
In a direct fight,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.260
the solar scorcher versus the dry ice,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.860
the Solar Scorcher didn't
seem to have much power at all.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.620
But when you had an intermediary, of a metal,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.200
it really seemed to kick the dry ice's [inaudible].

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.160
What do you guys think?

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.650
Do you think the dry ice won?

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.080
Or the solar scorcher won?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.740
Guys, that's not all we've got for you.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.410
This little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.780
You should go check that out.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.200
And the box at the bottom will show you

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.200
what YouTube thinks
you should be watching next.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.240
Not to mention that
this bomb here in the center

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.940
will subscribe you to our channel,
so you never miss out on a video again.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.000
Don't forget to ring that bell.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.060
And we'll see you in the next one.
