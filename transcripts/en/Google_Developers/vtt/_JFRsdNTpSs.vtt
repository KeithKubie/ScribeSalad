MARK DUBOIS: Hi.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.840
My name is Mark Dubois.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.750
I'm the founder of Upande Ltd.,
a local-based company

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.400
here in Nairobi, Kenya.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.460
We do lots of application
development for various

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.210
clients, including some of our
own products, and using a lot

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.210
of Google Map API for that.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.300
And I'd like to show
you some of those.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.376
So welcome.

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:29.560

BERNADETTE NDEGE: Hi.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.430
My name is Bernadette Ndege.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.290
I work for Upande Ltd.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.800
as a JS consultant.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.660
I mainly work with different
data formats.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.710
And for this particular project
that is Virtual Kenya,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.895
I was working with conversion
from the normal ordinary

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:47.190
shapefiles into a format
that people can

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.267
interact with easily.

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.140
And that is Google Earth.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.450
So they're converted to KMLs.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.410
This is an example of one file,
average annual rainfall

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.480
for February.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.730
And before they use a download,
they have the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
privilege of previewing what
they are about to download in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.095
this Google app plug-in.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:09.320
So after download, then they can
further interact with it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.310
on Google app and their
own machine.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
And as you can see, it's
interactive and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.940
very easy to use.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.980
You don't need any technical
knowledge.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.690
One of the other things we did
is we combined some of these

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.070
lays and we put it into a story,
very exciting, very

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.110
easy to use, and into
a Google app tool.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.064
So this is an example.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:33.525
[VOICEOVER ON APPLICATION]

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.300
The location of various
resources on the earth, their

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.140
relationships with each other,
the analysis of location of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.260
places, and their spatial
distribution.

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:47.956
BERNADETTE NDEGE: What I like
about working with Google Maps

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:49.604
API is its flexibility.

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:55.038
It allows you to build upon an
already-provided free base

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:57.755
map, but at the same time,
giving you the flexibility of

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:02.760
customizing your own
applications and using it in

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.010
very many different ways.
