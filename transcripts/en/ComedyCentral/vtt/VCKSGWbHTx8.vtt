00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.235
  - [Voiceover] This episode
  of CC: Social Scene

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:05.538
 is based on your suggestion
 for odd couples on a date.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.508
- Let's face it,
online dating is tough.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.810
 Today's dating apps
 use an algorithm

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:13.413
 that sets you up with people
 you're compatible with,

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.547
 or most alike.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.715
Dating yourself?

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.284
 There's no fun in
 that, I've done it.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:20.520
That's why we've
launched OppSit.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.322
 The app that works off
 of a simple premise.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.124
  Opposites attract.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:26.592
OppSit sets you up with someone

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.828
 you don't think
 you'll get along with.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.296
  Skeptical?

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.465
 I'll let the results
 speak for themselves.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.435
- As an environmentalist
and eco activist,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.704
 I never thought I'd
 be set up with Dale.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.938
 - You know,

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.774
I never thought I'd fall for
some tree-hugging earthy chick,

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:46.179
 but, after one date,
 I struck oil (laughs).

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.715
- I'm a burglar,

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.318
 but when it came to love, I
 just couldn't crack that safe.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.853
 Who'da thought the
 most compatible people

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.721
  would be so incompatible?

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.590
- That's why OppSit's so great.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.358
 He's my prime suspect

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.226
  for love.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.829
  (giggles)

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.297
 - I'm busted.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.598
- A butcher and a vegan.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.700
 A dog person and a cat person.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.369
 A lawyer and virtually
 anybody else.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:12.638
  Even a hipster and gluten.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.474
OppSit will set you up.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.109
  Who knows?

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.512
  Your greatest nemesis may
  be the love of your life.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.450
 (whale song)

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.253
There she blows.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.454
OppSit.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:30.223
  'Cause you just
  might find romance

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.258
  where you least expect it.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.659
 - Ow.

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.761
 - [Voiceover] Join
 the conversation now
 with #CCSocialScene.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:38.464
  Tell us what can go wrong
  on a hike without GPS

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.533
 and we might write it
 into our next sketch.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.268
 Presented by Redd's Apple Ale.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.034
 Crisp like an apple,
 brewed like a beer.
