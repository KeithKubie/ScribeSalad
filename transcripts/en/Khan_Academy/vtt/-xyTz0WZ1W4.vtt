00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.930
It's always good to see the
same problem done more than one

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.430
way, and it's especially true
with these ratio problems

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.360
because they, in general, can
be done in many, many different

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.810
ways, and different types of
ways gel with different people.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.900
So I just did a video on
this where I said that the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.720
ratio of apples to oranges
starts off at 5 to 8.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.580
And we take away 15.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.870
We take away 15 apples, and
the ratio becomes 1 to 4.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.220
And then the question that we
have to answer is how much

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.060
total fruit do we have after
taking away the 15 apples?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.860
And we figured it out.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.990
We figured out that it's
50 pieces of fruit.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.490
But let's see if we can
do it a different way.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.960
The last time I kind of
talked through it and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.790
used a lot of words.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.620
Let see if we can do it a
little bit more algebraically.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:54.890
So let a is equal to the number
of apples we are starting with,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.390
and let o equal the
number of oranges.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.360
That doesn't change throughout
the whole problem.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.190
So we're starting off with
a apples and o oranges.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.470
So the ratio of a to
o is equal to what?

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.160
The ratio of a-- let me
actually-- well, instead of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.100
trying to fit this whole
problem into this part of the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.650
screen, let me just copy and
paste this part, and do it at

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.730
the bottom part of the screen.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.710
Let me copy it, and then let me
scroll down here where I have

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.380
some extra real estate because
I think I'm going to need more

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.020
than that little pocket
of area right there.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.483
So I copied and pasted
just like that.

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:38.920
OK, so there we have it.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.370
a is the number of apples
to start with, and o is

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.490
the number of oranges.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.930
So we could write-- let
me do it in a color that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.900
I haven't used before.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.420
I actually haven't used white.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960
So we can say that the
ratio of apples to oranges

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.180
is equal to 5 to 8.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.680
That's what they tell us, that
the number of apples we start

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.370
with divided by the number of
oranges, or the ratio of them--

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.260
i have to be a little bit
more particular-- is 5 to 8.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.400
Then we removed 15 apples.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.890
So if we remove 15 apples,
how many apples do we have?

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.290
We have a minus 15 apples.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.530
And they tell us that the
ratio-- then the ratio of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.620
apples to oranges
becomes 1 to 4.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.540
So a minus 15, which is the
number of apples we start with

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.680
minus 15, the ratio of that to
oranges is equal to 1 over 4.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.970
And let's see if we can
solve these two equations.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.050
I have two equations here,
and I have two unknowns.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.130
Let's see what we can do here.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.880
And I should probably shouldn't
have labeled-- there's a reason

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.370
why o isn't used in algebra a
lot, because it looks just

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730
like a zero, but I'll
try to be careful.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.450
So this first-- let
me write down my two

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.500
equations over here.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.760
It never hurts to rewrite it.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.250
The original apples to
oranges ratio is 5 to 8.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.730
Then when we remove 15 apples,
the ratio of our new number of

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.970
apples to oranges is
equal to 1 over 4.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.070
This is just an algebraic
way of stating our problem.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.620
Let's see if we can solve this.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.230
If we cross-multiply both
sides of this equation,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.610
we get 8a is equal to 5o.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.670
That's not a zero.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.420
It's equal to 5o.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.480
Or if we subtract 5o
from both sides, get 8a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.600
minus 5o is equal to 0.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.590
So this is just a linear
equation with two unknowns.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.295
Now, what do we get on
this right-hand side?

00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:35.500
If we cross-multiply,
we get 4a minus 60.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.710
I'm just multiplying
4 times a minus 15.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.990
That is equal to 1 times o,
or we could just write--

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.600
well, I'll write 1o.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.320
That's not a 10.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.990
That's 1o, or 1 orange.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.120
And if we rearrange this, if
we subtract the 1o from both

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.470
sides, we get 4a minus 1o
minus 60 is equal to 0.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.570
Or if we add 60 to both
sides, we get 4a minus

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.320
1o is equal to 60.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.570
And here, you might recognize
that these are just two

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.880
linear equations right here.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.830
That's one of them, and
that's the second of them.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.250
And I have two unknowns.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.620
I have a and o.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.299
I probably should have called
them x and y to prevent this o

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.540
from looking so confusing
because that's a zero

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.260
and that's an o.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.890
But I think you get
what I'm saying.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.600
So how do we solve this?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.390
Well, what we can do is we can
multiply one of these times a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.520
convenient factor, and then
add them or subtract them to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.400
get rid of one of the two
variables, so let's do that.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.030
Let's multiply this equation
times minus 2, so it becomes

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.520
minus 8a plus 2o is
equal to minus 120.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.002
I just multiplied this equation
right here times minus 2.

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:53.215
If I do that and then if I add
it to this equation right here,

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:59.920
this equation is 8a minus 5o
is equal to 0, what do I get?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.300
Let's just add these
two equations.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.130
This becomes 0a.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.530
Minus 5 plus 2 is minus 3o is
equal to minus 120, or o is

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.040
equal to-- you divide both
sides-- you can ignore this.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.200
You divide both sides by minus
3, you get o is equal to 40.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.900
So let's see.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.110
So the oranges is equal to 40.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.570
And that's before and after.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.960
The o never changes.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.000
o is equal to 40.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.860
So what are our
apples equal to?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.385
We could go to either
of these equations.

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.150
We could go to any of
these that we have.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.260
Maybe we can go to this one.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.280
So we have 8 times our number
of apples is equal to 5 times

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.550
the number of oranges,
or 5 times 40.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.440
8 times the number of apples is
equal to 200, or the apples is

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.800
equal to 200 over 8, which
is equal to 100 over 4,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.390
which is equal to 25.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.990
So remember what a and o are.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.320
O is the number of oranges we
have throughout the problem.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.930
a is the number of
apples we start with.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.190
That's what we start with.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.790
So you can say that we start
with 25 apples, 40 oranges,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.375
or we start with 65
pieces of fruit.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.480
Then if you remove 15 fruit,
you'll end up with 50 fruit,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.750
which is the exact same answer
we got the other way of doing

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.415
this problem, and it's nice
to see it done two ways.

00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:40.700
If you want to know the number
of apples we end up with,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.000
we started with 25 apples.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.040
If you were to take 15 away
from them, you're going

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.330
to get 10 apples.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.070
So you start with 25 apples,
40 oranges, 65 fruit.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.250
You end with 10 apples,
40 oranges, or 50 fruit.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.990
Either way.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.730
Hopefully, it was reasonably
useful to see this

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.830
done another way.
