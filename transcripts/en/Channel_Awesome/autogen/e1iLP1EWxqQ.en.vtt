absolute oh my god uh moment but it I
 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.650 align:start position:0%

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 align:start position:0%
know you do have a little bit of a
 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
know you do have a little bit of a

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:00.389 align:start position:0%
really good filler but you could argue
 

00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
really good filler but you could argue

00:18:01.399 --> 00:18:01.409 align:start position:0%
could have found a way to maybe
 

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:03.700 align:start position:0%
