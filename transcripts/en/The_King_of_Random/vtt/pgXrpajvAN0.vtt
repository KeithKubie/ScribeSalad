00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
In today's video,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.200
we are trying out 4 new methods
to stress test batteries,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.100
push them to their limits, and
see what will happen to them.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.920
[Music]

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.998
You may recall a previous video

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:16.400
where we took
a bunch of batteries,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.720
and we tested them,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.760
damaging them in ways that
you're really not supposed to.

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.277
We drove nails through them,
we cut them in half, smash them,

00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:23.899
and we just hit them
with a blow torch.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:24.900
That was really fun.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.552
I like seeing what happened,

00:00:26.552 --> 00:00:28.500
but we can take
it a step further.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.464
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.772
We've got a bunch of alkaline
and lithium batteries.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.900
We're going to see what
happens if we deep fry them,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.700
weld them, freeze them,
and chop them with an ax.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.200
We've got a bunch
of our alkaline batteries.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.900
We've got some
of our lithium batteries,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.245
and we've got four new tests,

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:44.009
four new ways to
destroy batteries,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.551
things that you are definitely
not supposed to do,

00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:47.900
and we're going to try it.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.620
[Music]

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.120
Alright, so we've got
our voltmeter here.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.600
Before we put our batteries
into the liquid nitrogen,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.790
we are going to see what sort

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.000
of output reading we get
from the batteries.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.960
This Energizer Ultimate
lithium battery is giving us

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.380
1.806 volts of DC,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.940
and our Duracell alkaline battery
is giving us 1.613 volts DC.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.300
All right, starting
with the Duracell.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.260
Here it goes.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.460
[Music]

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.900
That's only been in
for a couple seconds,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.820
but just to see

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.180
if there's any change, I'm just
gonna give it another test.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.180
This was 1.613, I think.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.320
Now, it's given us 1.5,
but it's climbing.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.220
As the battery-- Okay.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.020
1.553 is what we're getting now.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.650
So that's down a little bit.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.670
Let's throw it back in,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.180
and let's just let
it go until it--

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.800
Until it stops bubbling,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.170
and then a couple more minutes
after that to really get it cold.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.647
Our Duracell alkaline battery
has now been our liquid nitrogen

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:57.700
for about five minutes,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.300
and the liquid nitrogen has
mostly stop bubbling around it.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.865
There's still some
bubbles coming off,

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:05.340
it's just not as violent
as it was before.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.500
But I think we're ready
to test it again.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
So we are at 38 millivolts.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.100
So that's like 0.03, I think.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.280
That is very very little power.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.000
This is how we find out just
how good my hammer aim is.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.220
[Music]

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.460
What have I done?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.670
I think it split open.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.860
It did.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.400
Freeze your hand pretty quick.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.600
Yeah, it's very cold.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.880
But look at that!

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.600
[Music]

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.110
You can use
a little more finesse,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.300
and a little less power.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.260
[Music]

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.280
That's awesome.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.240
[Music]

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480
That is, I'd say
the entire contents

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.520
of an alkaline battery.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.500
Now, if you remember
from our last video,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.970
all of this right here,
this was paste.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.400
This black stuff here.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:16.280
[Music]

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.780
All right.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.300
Let's test the voltage
on this bad boy.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.140
We are at an
astonishing 301 mil--

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.300
It's bottoming out basically.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.060
It's--

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.460
&gt;&gt; Oh, now it's up to 30 millivolts.
&gt;&gt; Negative.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.920
No, no.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.000
There was a negative
there for a second.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.405
This is just jumping
all over the place.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:36.700
It can't handle this.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.900
Oh, now we're up to 1.7 volts.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.350
It like got its voltage back.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.112
That was quick.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.980
I don't think the alkaline
battery did that.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.460
Nope.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.100
Not the same.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.967
Probably because it
has this paste

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:48.850
that was no longer paste,
and not doing its thing.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.500
All right.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.280
[Music]

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.900
Hmm.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.120
[Music]

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040
Oh, I also broke one.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.700
Oh, I can smell that though.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.480
Yep.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.560
Oh.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.280
[Music]

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.380
Interesting.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.100
So this one, I am curious about.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.600
I kind of suspect as it warms
up, it might just ignite,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
because we've now
probably made the layers

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.420
of the inside metal touch.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.131
But I don't know
how warm it will have to get

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.100
before it does that.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.400
Okay, we've got
our two batteries.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.130
I'm a little nervous about what
the lithium one's going to do,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.190
because these do have
a tendency to light on fire

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.190
if they get too hot.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.000
I don't know if oil
will get it there,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.800
but it like might
make it expand,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.438
and then the metal
inside could touch,

00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:36.900
and then that could
make it light.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.600
Batteries into the deep fryer.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.780
One alkaline.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.620
One lithium.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.360
If we conclude

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.700
that it's finished doing
whatever it's going to do,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.040
then we're just going
to unplug the machine,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.400
wait for a few minutes,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400
and then try
and carefully come out,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400
and lift things off.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.500
We'll see what we can do.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000
Oh, I think the wrapper

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.600
around the Duracell
battery has come off.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.760
I can't actually see
the Energizer battery.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.968
I really really thought
it was gonna have a more

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.500
explosive reaction this.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.240
Oh, wait, spoke too soon.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.581
Looks like the alkaline battery
just started sort

00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.600
of spurting out the negative.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.360
Yes.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.140
Something pop.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.400
I think the alkaline battery
was doing something,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.336
and then the Energizer lithium
battery also did something

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:20.186
at the same time.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:20.840
No, nope.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.732
Here goes the alkaline.

00:05:21.732 --> 00:05:23.600
The alkaline has now
started freaking out.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.400
Now, okay.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.000
So instead of popping
like the lithium did,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.780
this one just fizzled out.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.800
That lithium one,
it just sort of popped,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.373
and it launched itself up

00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:35.900
out of the fryer, splashing
oil all over our canvas tarp,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.460
and then it landed
a few feet away.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.390
The alkaline one still seems
to be bubbling rather furiously.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.790
Fizzling, fizzling, popping.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.400
I don't think we can use
this fry oil for anything else.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.600
So this is warm to the touch.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.800
We're going to leave it alone
for a minute here,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.900
because you can see
that it obviously expanded.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.782
But I can't see

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:55.290
where that leak was
that made it just freaked out,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.111
and explode out
of the deep fryer.

00:05:57.111 --> 00:05:59.747
When we've heated up
the lithium batteries before,

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:02.100
there's sort of a top
cap attached to it,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.580
and that has popped off.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.520
This one, I mean
the top cap is still there,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.000
but it may have loosened.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.000
So one leaked slowly
for a long time,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.600
and one leaked to very quickly
for a short amount of time.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.500
[Music]

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.740
Well, it really looks pretty.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.900
Oh, it overheated.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:30.420
[Music]

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.160
Probably a good
burning acid smell.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.680
So our battery here
overheated very quickly,

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:37.920
started leaking.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.200
We got spot.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.818
It looks like it
leaked at the side,

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:42.900
or maybe I managed to weld
a little bit there.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.520
We kind of lost our connection.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.000
The battery of course

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.100
has to have a connection for it
to actually weld anything.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.400
The electricity has
to flow through...

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.280
So I can weld on anything
that this is connected to.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.700
But our battery, while it did
get somewhere at first...

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.820
I don't know.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.800
I want to try that again,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.460
but I'm gonna peel
the coating off

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.780
so the whole battery is metal,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.700
and I don't have the plastic
getting in the way.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.380
This one, I think has potential
to be even more exciting.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.840
Because that one
kept moving so much.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.380
I'm gonna try and get

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.380
this be held even more
sturdily by our magnet.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.300
[Music]

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.260
Oh, that's awesome.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:52.020
[Music]

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.180
It's lit.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.040
And it will probably light
even more violently still.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.720
Beautiful.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.900
Very nice bright pink color.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:02.657
Can you see the glow?

00:08:02.657 --> 00:08:03.400
Oh, yeah.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.300
Wow.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.240
So this time,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.500
I've scraped off some of the
outside coating on the battery,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.300
and I'm going to see
what happens if I weld straight

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.300
into the side of it.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.660
Whoa.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:34.600
[Music]

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.100
All right.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.960
I'm going to back up.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.780
I want to be clear
that I'm not backing up

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.200
because I'm worried
about the battery.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.900
I'm backing up

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.180
because Nate is a terrible shot
when it comes to using an axe.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.760
Hey.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.840
[Music]

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.940
Well, you hit it.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.720
I did.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.150
Oh, that looks awesome.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.500
It's actually a decent hit.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:58.732
Yeah.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.960
It wasn't a perfect hit,
but it was a decent hit.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:10.840
[Music]

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.580
Oh my god!

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.220
Yeah.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.080
I take it back.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.160
&gt;&gt; I take back everything I said.
&gt;&gt; Severed!

00:09:18.582 --> 00:09:20.197
Severed that battery.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.020
It's a perfect hit.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.200
All right.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.230
Other than being chopped
in half though,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.688
it hasn't really done anything.

00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:28.900
Let's see if the lithium ones
are more exciting.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.740
Just hit it.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:40.580
[Music]

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.560
What?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.600
You did it, first try.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:52.160
[Music]

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.260
I kinda thought that would--
Oh, it's fizzing.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.810
Okay.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.230
Well, maybe don't be holding it.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.926
Let it sit there

00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:58.900
in case it fizzes
into something more exciting.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.800
[Music]

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.480
Wow.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.340
You got it.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.320
We only have one left.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.640
Go for it.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.240
I am probably not a good
enough shot for this one.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.380
[Music]

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.300
You smooshed it,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.800
and I didn't actually chop it,
it just smooshed it.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.388
Hit the side.

00:10:20.388 --> 00:10:22.200
It wasn't a bull's
eye right on the side.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.900
I was off by quarter
of a millimeter this time,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.700
and the blade just like
smooshed it sideways.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.180
[Music]

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.100
Battery Destruction Part
2, a success.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.135
Guys, that's it for today,

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:39.769
but we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.950
That box up at the top is going
to take you to our last video.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.100
You should go check that out.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.330
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.100
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.865
And this bomb here
in the middle, you hit that,

00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:48.659
you'll be subscribed,

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:49.939
and you never miss
out on a video.

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:51.082
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:51.082 --> 00:10:52.373
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:53.000
Talk to you then.
