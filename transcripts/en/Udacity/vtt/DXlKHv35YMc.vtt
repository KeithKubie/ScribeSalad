00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.370
Since the end point, 2,
is part of the solutions set,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.620
this time we will use a solid dot or
circle on the number line at 2.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.145
Whenever you have a less than or
equal to sign or a greater than or

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:16.755
equal to sign, you will use
a solid dot on the number line to

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:21.695
indicate that that number, the end
point, is part of the solution set.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:23.555
If you have a regular less than or

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:26.197
greater than sign
you'll use an open dot.

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:29.357
Because that endpoint is not
part of the solution set.

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.287
So we've established our endpoint.

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:33.447
Now which way should the arrow point?

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:37.677
For x is less than or equal to 2,
should the arrow point right or left?
