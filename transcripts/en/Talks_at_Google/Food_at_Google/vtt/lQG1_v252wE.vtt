00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Hi everyone, my name is Aiba from D&amp; DEPARTMENT.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.000
I'd like to give a brief introduction of myself. I was born in Shiga prefecture and grew up in Osaka

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.000
There was also a S&amp;DEPARTMENT store in Osaka

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.000
But it closed this year

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.000
After this store, I came to Tokyo to be in charge of the company.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.000
We create carious stores in different areas including Tokyo

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.000
Is there anyone who has been there?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Oh, actually about half of the people here have been there.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.000
Well today, as I think just by going to the stores

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.000
it is hard to tell what happens at the backend

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.000
So I would like to talk about what goes on that could easily be understood by everyone

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.000
Today, I would like to talk about 3 main things

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:26.000
The first is, since about 20 years ago, we have searched for design that lasts a long time around Japan

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
We would bring this and showcase it from our stores

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
We would try to tell the story behind the craftsmanship

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.000
We had set up places to sell in each location, and I'd like to get into some of the activities that we've gotten into

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.000
At the same time as having these places to sell, we also look into the characteristics and appeal of each prefecture

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
We actually also worked the designs of a tourism guidebook

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.000
I'd also like to talk more about this also.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.000
But another one is, as mentioned earlier is in the 8th floor of the Hikarie building

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.000
We have created a museum for products in 47 prefectures

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
I'd like to get more into this.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.000
All of these 3 are connected, and we have also progressed with these projects by doing some field work

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.000
We would have realizations like "this is the kind of society we've become"  or "we need this kind of perspective" 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.000
while we progress through the project, and it would be nice if we can get into these things too

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.000
In 2000, we started our main store in Tokyo

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.000
Back then, there were a lot of hype on new design

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.000
New designs were being sought after, and they were thought to be very fun and exciting

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.000
In this kind of era, we had suddenly come in and start a store with about 661 sqm in size

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.000
We had it in Okusawa in Tokyo, and it was store filled with only second hand items

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
We had collected items from different recycle shops around Japan

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.000
There would be items that were being sold for 50 Yen in the recycle shops that were actually worth 5,000 Yen

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.000
This is something we can talk about if we get into the cost rate

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.000
But, the value of items is that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.000
Just because something is new, it does not mean that it has quality

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.000
There can be your own judgement whether something is good

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.000
I think that the way of choosing is important when building up a store

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.000
In the store there is the shop area and the cafe area

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.000
On a daily basis, we have them use the things in the cafe

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.000
And these are the things that we choose

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.000
It does look normal when you look at it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.000
But for example, within typical looking items in Japan and around the world

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.000
I think that good design exists in normal things

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:06.000
We also find that there are good products made through traditional industry

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.000
Also, in the actual operation, even in products where the design

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.000
is made from someone anonymous, there are many that can be used for a long time

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.000
There are also great recycled or second hand products

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.000
While we select the products we sell

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.000
We consider longevity as one of our standard when choosing a product

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.000
So, how do we actually decide which products have a design that allows it to be used for a long time

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.000
We've created criterias in choosing every product

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.000
There are 5 criteria, and let's take a look at each one of them

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.000
We only deal with items that we've witness all its production process

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.000
One thing is that we want to see its background

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.000
But we also what the producers to know what we are trying to do

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.000
There are these two reasons, and because we create a relationship, I think this is where we are able to send a message

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.000
I believe a lot of you also go to interior shops

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.000
Usually, they change products by the next year

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.000
With all the products that they handle, I doubt that the staff use most of the products

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.000
On the other hand, we have chosen to sell products for decades making sure that we actually use them

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.000
We only choose items that we think we can sell for 10 years 20 years

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.000
Most of the products we sell are being used by our staff

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.000
And we only select items that are really good

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.000
We would sometimes meet with the president of a manufacturer

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.000
and persistently ask them if they really have the intention to continue and produce the item

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.000
Of course, it has to be robust and also easy to fix

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.000
So, for example, our stores have very few electronic products

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.000
These items have model changes, and they continue to be improved

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.000
There are many that we cannot know how many years they will be used

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:22.000
There are also many manufacturers that do not have a proper warranty system

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.000
This is why we consider if the design is structures so that it is easy to fix or repair
72
00:06:24,100 --&gt; 00:06:24,000
We put great importance on this

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.000
Also, we also look for items that can be passed on to one person to another that may need it more

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.000
One criteria is also whether we can take the item back and resell it again

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.000
For this reason, if the items are no longer needed, we take back most of them

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.000
We also repair and resell the items again

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:56.000
The products displayed have black circles with number in them

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.000
What is this

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:07.000
This is how many years has passed since the design was born

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.000
It is the age of the item. This stove that many of you may know is already 80 years old.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:22.000
Even after 80 years, there are those who think that it is new or is a good item.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.000
To rephrase this, there are people who use this since 80 years ago.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:35.000
We believe that there are really good design in long living products that is proven by time

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.000
This is our belief in long life design

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.000
So, how many years it has been around is an important factor

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.000
But, it doesn't mean that it is bad if it has only been around for a year or two

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.000
For items that are a year or two, we hope choose them with the hope for them to continue for decades in the future

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.000
This is the kind of things we do

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:59.000
When you see time tested designs, they all have some things in common.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.000
We would filter out these commonalities and created 10 rules

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.000
We had come up with 10 things that we think the story behind a long life design

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:19.000
Let's look at each one of them, one is being able to repair it as we mentioned earlier.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:27.000
Another is that when selling, it must be sold by people who will sell it in their store forever, or else it will not last long

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:33.000
Also, the creators must have love for what they make, there is also the usability and functionality

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.000
There is also the safety and whether it uses dangerous chemicals

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.000
Production planning is very important

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.000
When a product becomes popular

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.000
And production quantity increases, but if it doesn't sell

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.000
Production stops. This is how products disappear

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.000
Regardless of how much it sells for a certain period

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.000
The manufacturer's attitude that allows continuous production of a certain period os very important

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:03.000
If these elements do not exists, many will only deteriorate after it becomes popular

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:10.000
Ant the 8th is the user. The consumer that will use it must have the intention to use it

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.000
Of course, considering the environment is also key

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.000
The 10th is design. It must be beautiful.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:23.000
Often we are ask how we choose a long life design

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.000
We choose using the 5 criteria we saw earlier

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.000
But many ask what it is in a form

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.000
And our conclusion is that it not just the shape or form

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.000
The form is only one element of many that we look into when choosing

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.000
We think that elements aside from the form of it is very important

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:49.000
There are elements that cannot be fit in the criteria that were mentioned

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.000
There are the selling and the users that we talked about earlier

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:59.000
The users and where it will be sold are important elements to make something long lasting

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.000
Thinking of how the places the items are sold

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.000
How can it be sold that it will sell for a long time

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.000
To think about these things, is why we started stores

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.000
There are also 47 prefectures

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.000
I think that it is necessary to have 1 in each prefecture

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.000
It is our activity to convey this way of thinking

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:30.000
Since we thought we would not be able to do this without setting up a lot of shops

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.000
Little by little we have been building shops in different areas

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:40.000
Both abroad and locally, we have about 11, 10, since we do not have it in Osaka anymore we have 10.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:47.000
From Hokkaido to Okinawa in the South, and we have 1 in Seoul abroad.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.000
One of the most famous shop is in Sapporo.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.000
Here is says Hokkaido x Design company 3KG

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:03.000
What this is is that it is similar to a franchise

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.000
But we don't really feel like it is a franchise in that

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.000
It is an activity where we look for local partners

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:17.000
The reason is that, if it isn't ran by a person who feels strongly about the place

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.000
We don't think the business will last a very long time

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:29.000
If we go outside of Tokyo

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.000
To start a store

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.000
When the business doesn't go well, then we will close it down

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.000
But we keep on operating in this mindset, the stores will not last long

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.000
Of course, the message will not successfully be conveyed to the locals

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.000
And we wanted to have locals operate it as much as possible

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.000
We started the project with the concept where the local companies would be involved

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.000
And, many different people do this

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.000
In Hokkaido, a design company handles the store

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.000
In Toyama prefecture, the prefectural office get together to operate it

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:04.000
In Yamanashi, the broadcasting company YBS is the owner and the staff also involved in the store

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.000
In Kyoto, it is a university

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.000
The Kyoto University of Art and Design runs it

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.000
This store targets students

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.000
While they also created a curriculum for its students that seeks out what long life design is

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.000
We would also have student presentations inside the store

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:27.000
As you can see, the store theme also changes depending on the owner

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.000
We also have a store that is by a temple

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.000
We try to choose a location that will fit in to the atmosphere of the land

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.000
In Kagoshima, we are inside a department store

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.000
In each store

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.000
We try to find out ways on how to transcend our message to our customer

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.000
I would like to mention 3 things

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:55.000
First of all, we want them to learn about the producers, so we really conduct workshops

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.000
This is called Chuusen, and it is a way of dyeing clothes

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.000
We would have workshops of this

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:10.000
This is wax tree material, we also made candles using the wax tree material

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.000
By this, when the customers try to create with their own hands

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:20.000
Not only do they enjoy the products, but they become fans of the producers

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.000
One should really have the love in something to be able to continue using it

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.000
We really work on creating this feeling

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:36.000
Of course each store has things of other prefectures

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.000
For the people in the region, thanks to having D&amp;Department in each region

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.000
There are also efforts made when other regions would work on together on similarities

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:55.000
Since there is a cafe, most of the food prepared here are chosen by us in person
167
00:13:55,100 --&gt; 00:13:55,000
We try to use and prepare ingredients that are usually hand picked

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.000
There are also interactions made between producers that has also become some kind of market in the store

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.000
When you go to each region, it isn't only materials and things that last long

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.000
But also festivals and other cultural aspects

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.000
This is a festival called Yamakasa in Fukuoka

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:19.000
Our store there is in the area where the Yamakasa is held, we are required to participate

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.000
As part of the tradition, we had to sacrifice we let one of our staff participate

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.000
Wearing a fundoshi and participating in the festival

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.000
We participate in these things and in each region

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.000
As our part in promoting something that has been around for a long time, we must adapt

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.000
We also do this inside the stores

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:47.000
The fact that we sell things that are made, we also have the responsibility

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.000
to have these products used for a long time

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:57.000
On the next event we have works on how to sharpen a knife and how to maintain them

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.000
There are also workshops on how to reupholster a chair

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.000
It is inevitable that our products get damaged

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.000
after 5 to 10 years

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.000
These things can be recycled again

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.000
We also make efforts in recycle and reuse

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.000
As mentioned earlier, we started as a recycle shop

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.000
We picked items that we thought had value from around the country and resell them

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.000
All the shopping bags we use in the stores are from recycled material

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.000
What this is is that the customers will always have excess shopping bags at home

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.000
Customers bring it in a bulk to us

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.000
We would put a tape around it and reuse it

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.000
We also change the top board of school desk from elementary schools

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.000
The reutilization is also something we work on

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.000
We visit different local cloths

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.000
Usually clothes are made to order

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.000
There will always be some excess

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.000
It is hard to sell them since they are ordered

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.000
by companies

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.000
So when their licenses expire what we do is

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.000
Since we get excess of half measures

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.000
When we go to the manufacturer there are a lot of left overs

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.000
We needed to do something

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.000
We turn them to toto bags to reuse

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:35.000
We would also have wool together

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.000
And put it together like this

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.000
Turn it into rugs, and reuse it in this way

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.000
Other than that, we also publish books and sell them

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.000
When it comes to the distribution ofbooks,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.000
Maybe a lot of you are familiar with this

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.000
When it comes to the distribution of books, book stores work with no risk

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.000
What this is that if they aren't able to sell it they can return in to the publisher

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.000
They can give it back for free

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.000
There is a continuous flow of items going back

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.000
When this happens often

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.000
The books often get damaged in the process

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.000
What this is is that the books created by publishers with a lot love

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.000
becomes damages and loses its value, and as people who create

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:27.000
This is something we want to avoid. When we have damaged products

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.000
We put the recycle mark in it

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.000
And we sell it at the same price

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.000
The inside isn't damaged
222
00:17:40,100 --&gt; 00:17:40,000
The information hasn't aged yet

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:48.000
These are the sort of efforts we work on in re-distributing

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.000
There are many buyers that want to buy this over others even at the same price

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.000
With this, when there are shops in the region

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.000
There are many buyers who would choose to buy there

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.000
We are in an era where you can immediately purchase almost anything

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.000
What the background behind an item is something

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.000
an increasing number of people want to know about

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.000
This is something we observe while running the stores

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.000
To think of what the charm or uniqueness of land is

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.000
We create sightseeing guidebooks

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.000
We publish one for each prefecture. We now have 21

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:39.000
And we have conditions for selecting. The land must have a unique charm to it

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.000
The important message of the land must be conveyed

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.000
If the locals of the land are involved

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.000
With these critera

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.000
We pickup places based on these

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.000
Since the locals are the best sources

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.000
We have workshops with locals

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.000
All the content that was brought in there

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:11.000
We have the editors live in the area for 2 months to conduct interviews

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.000
Why is it for 2 months

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.000
If not live there and do field work for 2 months

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.000
We will not be able to see the real side of the land

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.000
We can do search on it

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.000
We are not able to see the beauty of living the land

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.000
So, we personally go and explore the area

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.000
To give more examples

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.000
There is a wine cafe that plans out to promote wine tourism in Yamanashi

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:46.000
Also efforts to rejuvenate traditional handcrafts

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.000
When we find these stores

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:55.000
There are shops that serve hunting cuisine with traditional chinas but in a new and refreshing way

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.000
Through telling the story of the land, we might introduce places that have accommodation

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.000
Even if we choose one place at time around Japan

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.000
We meet key persons that are active in each area

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.000
These people would make recommendations, and continue to ask on

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.000
It is the same information

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:21.000
But the way it was shared, by learning through empathizing with each other

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.000
This is a process that takes by staying in the area for 2 months

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.000
With typical tourist magazines, places that will be featured are preset

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.000
Through searching on the Internet

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.000
They decide where to go beforehand and then go into field work

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.000
I think that there are a lot of things that they cannot do

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.000
That is where I think we put importance

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:52.000
In a few categories, we only pick the places that were great and share them

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.000
When the book is done, we have a publishing party

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.000
Since we lived in the place for 2 months

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.000
We establish deeper friendships with the people we meet

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:12.000
The parties become very lively, and people who meet create lasting relationships

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.000
When we bring these books around the area

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.000
When people find out people know the book it we create great connections

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.000
At times we end up collaborating

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:26.000
And we think that it is becomes we created these that these things happen

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.000
It is something that we find very interesting

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:37.000
Through creating the book, we really got to see a lot of beautiful places

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.000
I think that a lot of you have been to many different places

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.000
But in all the places there is always a unique charm to the place

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:51.000
I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a place where you can see all these charms that the different places have

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.000
We wanted to plan according to this and decided to build a museum

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.000
This is a museum where you can see all 47 prefectures

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.000
It will be starting

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.000
But before this, in our D&amp;DEPARMTMENT stores

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.000
we had a small exhibition for all 47 prefectures

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.000
We did this in the exhibition NIPPON VISION

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:26.000
While we collect the items from each local area, we used a part of the shop to put a big table with all 47 prefectures

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.000
An executive from Matsuya Ginza saw this

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.000
And had offered if we wanted to do this at their venue

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:41.000
When we reintroduced the exhibition dedicating 1 table to 1 prefecture

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.000
We felt that we were able to create 1 whole format

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.000
We wanted to find a place where we can permanently place this setup

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.000
We've created something like this in Shibuya Hikarie's 8th floor

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.000
This is the current museum that we have

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.000
This is the picture of the current exhibition

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.000
We go to the locals and borrow actual items from people we know

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.000
They really help us out in unimaginable ways

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.000
There was an Izakaya restaurant that lent their shop curtains

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.000
We would wonder what they use while they lend it to us

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.000
They probably came up with something

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.000
We think that we were able to borrow something this precious because of the relationship we established

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.000
This is an example of the things we do

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.000
Since the opening there has been 47 tables

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.000
We also do events for each region with different keywords

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.000
There is an exhibit for 47 young craft artists

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.000
There is also the exhibit for the craft brewery of 47 prefectures

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.000
Other than that, there are also events we organize with outside creators

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.000
This is a local supermarket

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.000
There are also supermarkets unique to the area

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.000
We made it so that you can experience this

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.000
I think many know what Good Design Show is

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.000
If we divided something like this into 47 prefectures, we can experiment on how it will be seen as

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.000
This is something we continue to do

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:15.000
We also do other events and create illustration book together

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.000
This is the graphic designers

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.000
There would be accessories

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.000
We see all 47 prefectures through different themes

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.000
This is our P to P store

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.000
We have a video here, so why don't we look at it

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.000
In terms of shopping, I think there are a lot of interest on the social contribution it creates

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.000
P to P store means problem to product

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.000
We collect products that were born from regional issues in the 47 prefectures

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.000
The buyers would buy the product together with these issues

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.000
For example, Yamagata prefecture is over 70% in proportion in forested land

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.000
Due to the demand in wood decreasing, there aren't many workers in the field

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.000
Which puts the mountains in a bad state

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.000
We would have tours in the mountains and use thinned wood to create products

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:38.000
By bringing in a design perspective, we turn something negative to positive and bring new value

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.000
Regional issues are actually very hard

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:49.000
How much we feel it close to us is the challenge

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.000
By bringing it to your homes, we hope that consumers can be connected to these issues for a long time

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.000
We want consumers to find a product they like and experience the charm of each item

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:19.000
We open exhibitions where we try to convey different messages of "long lasting" in each event

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:29.000
We also have an event where we investigate what would happen if we created a convenience store with products from all 47 prefectures

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.000
We created an actual convenience store inside the gallery

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.000
We also run a shop next to the museum

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.000
This is a tour we setup that we collaborated with people we met during the creation of D Design Travel

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.000
Since we've established a relationship where we lend each other various things

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.000
A lot of weird things are put here

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.000
A lot of things that tell the story of that land

00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.000
Not only the products, but a lot of items that tell the background of the item

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.000
There are many things that visitors will find interesting

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.000
The staff also tell story behind them

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.000
And explain their background

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.000
A lot of people we've met would also visit

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.000
We also still continue to do workshops

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:29.000
Next to it is a cafeteria, it is a cafeteria for all 47 prefectures

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:36.000
We would personally go through the areas, and order each ingredient to make into a set menu

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.000
We really actually go ourselves

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:44.000
I have gone on a boat and saw the actual fish that would be sent to the cafeteria

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.000
It could be the vegetables or the seafood, and even the meat we use

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.000
We would also ask local mothers to teach us how to make local dishes

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.000
What really is happening to local dishes is that

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.000
It is slowly disappearing

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.000
In reality it has been diminishing

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:09.000
Even looking at local dishes sold, there are a lot of those with additives and chemical seasoning

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.000
We try to make a recipe that excludes these things

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.000
By replacing it with the original recipe

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:24.000
There are many in different techniques and tradition of regions that remains in food

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.000
We try to express this through the menu that we prepare in the store

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.000
This is also the set menu that is on the magazine

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.000
In the book, there is a page for the set dishes

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:42.000
We provide this experience of tasting the set dishes of each prefecture

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.000
There are also various other set meals

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.000
If you can see, the one on the bottom left, there is the Shizuoka set meal

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.000
This is the menu we have in Hikarie at Shibuya

00:28:54.100 --> 00:29:00.000
We would always have a get together with the participants in the 47 prefectures

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.000
When we have these, from being a simple supplier and merchant relationship

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.000
The producers gains its network

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.000
The 47 prefectures unite with one theme, and their network expands

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.000
From this, a new business can also be born

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.000
I also thought that these are interesting things

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.000
when we conduct these activities

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:26.000
We currently have the Shizuoka exhibition until July 30th

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.000
If you have the time, we would love for you to visit

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.000
That is all, Thank you
