sustainability report combining those
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.079
sustainability report combining those
into a single report to show the

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089
into a single report to show the
 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.849

relationship between financial and
 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.950
relationship between financial and
non-financial performance which I would

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960
non-financial performance which I would
 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.659
non-financial performance which I would
define an environmental social and

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669
define an environmental social and

governance terms it involves providing
 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.310
governance terms it involves providing
more integrated information on the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320
more integrated information on the
 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.470
more integrated information on the
company's website so it's not simply

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480
company's website so it's not simply
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.780
company's website so it's not simply
about a paper document and it also

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790
about a paper document and it also
 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.110
about a paper document and it also
involves leveraging a company's website

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
involves leveraging a company's website
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.060
involves leveraging a company's website
to provide more detailed information of

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070
to provide more detailed information of
 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.830
to provide more detailed information of
interest to particular stakeholders as

for them to provide a more coherent and
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.020
for them to provide a more coherent and
specific explanation for why that's the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
specific explanation for why that's the
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.039
specific explanation for why that's the
case yet lowers reputational risk it

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049
case yet lowers reputational risk it
 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.280

the first time and I was reading through
 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.640
the first time and I was reading through
the discussion about what they're doing

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
the discussion about what they're doing
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.140
the discussion about what they're doing
and I laughed I mean it was like these

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
and I laughed I mean it was like these

clearly started working on this at least

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
clearly started working on this at least
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.020
clearly started working on this at least
a year ago and my book only came out a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
a year ago and my book only came out a
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.660
a year ago and my book only came out a
month ago but the language was eerily

the same and so again I think it's just

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129
the same and so again I think it's just
 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.649
the same and so again I think it's just
you know one more piece of evidence that

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659
you know one more piece of evidence that
 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.619
you know one more piece of evidence that
integrated reporting is is one of those

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
integrated reporting is is one of those

ideas whose time has come when I talked

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
ideas whose time has come when I talked
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.949
ideas whose time has come when I talked
to people about it my colleagues they'll

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
to people about it my colleagues they'll
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.949
to people about it my colleagues they'll
say what an obvious idea it's a simple

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
say what an obvious idea it's a simple
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.890
say what an obvious idea it's a simple
idea and I laugh when I say it it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
idea and I laugh when I say it it
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.490
idea and I laugh when I say it it
certainly is but it's only happened now

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
certainly is but it's only happened now
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.240
certainly is but it's only happened now
and I think it's that way with with big

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
and I think it's that way with with big
 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550

ideas they they seem obvious once
they've been stated and and I think I'm

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659
they've been stated and and I think I'm
 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.349
they've been stated and and I think I'm
fortunate to just have for a variety of

the adoption of integrated reporting
 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.220
the adoption of integrated reporting
