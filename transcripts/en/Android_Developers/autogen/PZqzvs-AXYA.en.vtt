00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
 I think the importance of the thing lies in the need of people, 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.580
 How much they liked it, and their desire to continue using it. 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 We are developers of Fril, an app selling cheap goods. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.840
 We discovered that a lot of women 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.760
 They put clothes on their blogs for sale. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 So we thought about creating an app that makes it easy to sell and buy clothes 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920
 As a good business opportunity. 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.600
 Most of our users are young, as university students and housewives. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260
 Before launching the application, we interviewed more than 100 women 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.000
 To test our service. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.160
 We have reached the current design in collaboration with users. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 As we developed it, we asked users to experiment with a prototype. 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.980
 We then tested it to ensure that users get the service we want. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 We have also benefited from many interviews and surveys on the visual design of the application 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.340
 So we get to design the users admire. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.960
 We have been using this approach since our establishment, 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.800
 To help instill an institutional culture based on user collaboration in service milestones. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 We used the new "multidimensional design" concept 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.700
 During application development 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.960
 In a way that does not affect the experience of existing users, 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.180
 We then launched a 70% version of the multidimensional design. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 The result was impressive; 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 With the retention rate of new users rising by 7%. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.420
 Users' time spent on the app also increased by a staggering 200%. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.320
 We employ our customer support team from our user base, 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.920
 And then they are all users of the application. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.220
 We use search groups and tests by users 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.380
 When we decide to add new features and test new designs. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.600
 Even the implementation of the modification in the designs is done 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.880
 Using Android Studio. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.840
 It allows you to test using different devices while adjusting the design, 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.900
 It also features features like code completion, making it easier for designers to use as well. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.400
 Because our application is used for buying and selling among individuals, 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.140
 We can withdraw funds through it, 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.740
 For example, exposure to errors can cause a major problem. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 Contains the Android Application Developer Console 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.680
 A feature that allows you to cast in stages, 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.520
 And then you can launch an update of 5% or 20% each time, 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.720
 This allows you to troubleshoot before they appear. 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 It's very easy. 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.800
 Since we've introduced a design that complies with Google's multidimensional design, 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280
 User retention increased by 20% 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.620
 The contribution rate increased by 30%. 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.440
 It is important to ask yourself whether the product you offer 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.920
 Meets the need of users and whether the service is sufficient to maintain them as customers. 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.860
 We chose the Fablic name of our company 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.036
 It is a word combining the word holic 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.340
 In the sense of "addiction" and the word fab in the sense of "magnificence". 

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:42.723
 We aim to achieve the meaning of this name 

00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:46.120
 By providing a service that users will add.
