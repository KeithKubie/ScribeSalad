00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.173
Where does all this stuff come from?

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:10.267
This rock?

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.327
That cow?

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.482
Your heart?

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.602
Not the things themselves, mind you,
but what they're made of:

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.555
the atoms that are 
the fabric of all things.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:22.893
To answer that question, we look to
the law of conservation of mass.

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:25.757
This law says take an isolated system

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:29.969
defined by a boundary that matter
and energy cannot cross.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.248
Inside this system, mass, 
a.k.a. matter and energy,

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:37.068
can neither be created nor destroyed.

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.775
The universe, to the best 
of our knowledge,

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:41.828
is an isolated system.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:45.931
But before we get to that, let's look
at a much smaller and simpler one.

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:49.118
Here we have six carbon atoms, 
12 hydrogen atoms,

00:00:49.118 --> 00:00:51.912
and 18 oxygen atoms.

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:55.605
With a little energy, 
our molecules can really get moving.

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.692
These atoms can bond together
to form familiar molecules.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:00:59.946
Here's water,

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:01.743
and here's carbon dioxide.

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:04.157
We can't create or destroy mass.

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:07.811
We're stuck with what we've got,
so what can we do?

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:09.768
Ah, they have a mind of their own.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:14.341
Let's see. They've formed more 
carbon dioxide and water, six of each.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.185
Add a little energy, and we can get them
to reshuffle themselves to a simple sugar,

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:21.183
and some oxygen gas.

00:01:21.183 --> 00:01:26.997
Our atoms are all accounted for:
6 carbon, 12 hydrogen, and 18 oxygen.

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:31.170
The energy we applied is now stored
in the bonds between atoms.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.321
We can rerelease that energy

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:36.887
by breaking that sugar back 
into water and carbon dioxide,

00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:39.556
and still, same atoms.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:44.149
Let's put a few of our atoms aside
and try something a little more explosive.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.588
This here is methane, most commonly 
associated with cow flatulence,

00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:51.132
but also used for rocket fuel.

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:53.786
If we add some oxygen
and a little bit of energy,

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.616
like you might get from a lit match,

00:01:55.616 --> 00:02:00.661
it combusts into carbon dioxide, 
water and even more energy.

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.775
Notice our methane started 
with four hydrogen,

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:08.666
and at the end we still have four hydrogen
captured in two water molecules.

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:13.573
For a grand finale, here's propane,
another combustible gas.

00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:16.731
We add oxygen, light it up,
and boom.

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.885
More water and carbon dioxide.

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:20.784
This time we get three CO2s

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:24.443
because the propane molecule 
started with three carbon atoms,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.590
and they have nowhere else to go.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.451
There are many other reactions
we can model with this small set of atoms,

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.764
and the law of conservation of mass
always holds true.

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:36.748
Whatever matter and energy 
go into a chemical reaction

00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:40.216
are present and accounted 
for when it's complete.

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.673
So if mass can't be created or destroyed,

00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:45.957
where did these atoms 
come from in the first place?

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:49.397
Let's turn back the clock and see.

00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:53.573
Further, further, further, too far.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.892
Okay, there it is.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:56.378
The Big Bang.

00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:59.908
Our hydrogen formed from 
a high-energy soup of particles

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:03.979
in the three minutes that followed
the birth of our universe.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.846
Eventually, clusters of atoms accumulated
and formed stars.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:12.085
Within these stars, nuclear reactions 
fused light elements,

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:13.980
such as hydrogen and helium,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.706
to form heavier elements,
such as carbon and oxygen.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:21.310
At first glance, these reactions 
may look like they're breaking the law

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.847
because they release 
an astounding amount of energy,

00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:25.747
seemingly out of nowhere.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.952
However, thanks to 
Einstein's famous equation,

00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:32.108
we know that energy is equivalent to mass.

00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:34.871
It turns out that the total mass 
of the starting atoms

00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.982
is very slightly more 
than the mass of the products,

00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:43.937
and that loss of mass perfectly 
corresponds to the gain in energy,

00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:49.587
which radiates out from the star as light,
heat and energetic particles.

00:03:49.587 --> 00:03:52.103
Eventually, this star went supernova

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:54.586
and scattered its elements across space.

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:58.380
Long story short, they found each other
and atoms from other supernovas,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.889
formed the Earth,

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.003
and 4.6 billion years later
got scooped up to play their parts

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.892
in our little isolated system.

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:11.619
But they're not nearly as interesting as
the atoms that came together to form you,

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:12.941
or that cow,

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.190
or this rock.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.211
And that is why, 
as Carl Sagan famously told us,

00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.970
we are all made of star stuff.
