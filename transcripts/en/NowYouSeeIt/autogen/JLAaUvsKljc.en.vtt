00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.530
 Breaking the fourth wall is one of the most unique and thematic tools that a filmmaker has 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 can use. Most cinematic techniques are used to draw us into the story 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160
 and to forget that we are watching a movie. The breaking of the fourth wall does the opposite. It remembers 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.020
 us that we are a viewer watching what is happening on the screen. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.720
 The technology can contribute to 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 visual telling the story in different ways, depending on how it is used. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.610
 To truly understand the power of the fourth wall fracture, we must look at its origin, 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 in the theatre. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.259
 An appropriate definition for breaking the fourth wall 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.759
 is' ​​a dramatic technique in a fiction story where the characters show that they are aware 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.800
 of their existence in the story. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.580
 This technique goes as far back as ancient Greece, continued into Shakespeare's time and further into postmodern theater, particularly in musicals. 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.289
 The term originated with the emergence of the 'box decor' that became popular in the early 19th century. Decors 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.759
 were made with three walls, with the fourth imaginary wall located between the stage and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 the public. So when a character acknowledged the existence of the public, 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.379
 then the fourth wall was broken. 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.900
 The technique has been used since the stupid era, 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.450
 and Charlie Chapin played a lot with technology in his own films. 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.980
 With the advent of sound and the popularity of the musical genre, fourth-wall breaks were 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.290
 more ordinary and actively contributed to the screening of the film. In the next 70 years, 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.069
 fourth-wall breaks would find their way into different film genres with different results. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.780
 This technique is best known in comedy, 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.440
 and the comedy is known for possessing some of the most unforgettable punch lines in film history. 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.040
 There is something very special and comical about remembering that 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.790
 we are in the middle of a movie. No matter how often I watch a movie breaking the fourth wall, 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.360
 the joke can still surprise me. 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.540
 The joke must leave the movie to deliver the punch line, and no other joke can do that. 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.019
 Every other joke is caught in the imaginary world of the story. To step out of that world, 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.259
 is what makes the fourth wall fracture so fun and creative. 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.239
 This does not mean that breaking the fourth wall automatically makes you a comedy genius. 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.120
 The design and delivery of a fourth wall fracture must be surprising in some way, 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.420
 otherwise the joke will not come across. 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.480
 You can't talk about breaking the fourth wall without the mention of Mel Brooks. 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.240
 He broke the fourth wall in the most extreme ways. 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.800
 His films even go so far that the characters view themselves in the film. 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.100
 While his films are funny because of their absurdity, 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.700
 there is certainly some logic in it. 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.740
 I love the way Blazing Saddles uses the fourth wall to ridicule the 'Western' genre. 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.590
 It shows very well how unrealistic the Hollywood films were in their portrayal of life in the West. 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.759
 In reality, Western films were nothing but actors in a studio, playing in fake towns, 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.180
 who eventually drove home with their car. Blazing Saddles is a not so subtle one 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.780
 reminder that film also has its own limitations in imagining reality. 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.600
 Mel Brooks made a statement by pointing out the lack of reality in the Western film. 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.599
 Western films from the 40s, 50s and 60s completely ignored racism, xenophobia and other ugly sides of the West, 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.169
 and Blazing Saddles breaks the fourth wall in an extreme way, to remind us 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.429
 that we are watching a dramatized film, not reality. 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.990
 What may make the breaking of the fourth wall so impressive is that it depends on the context, 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.280
 the act of recognizing the public is actually pushing us more into the film, 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.820
 instead of pulling us out. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.480
 There is something intimate about the way a character speaks directly to us. In Road to Morocco, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope make light-hearted jokes 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.370
 straight to the public, and remind us that their adventure will eventually end well. 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.800
 By the relaxing and inviting breaking of the fourth wall, we know that this is a film that is itself 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.419
 Don't take it too seriously, and offer light-hearted, conservative entertainment. The 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.470
 breaking the fourth wall can be a way to invite us into the story, and this technique is certain 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.370
 an indication of a more mild and good-natured film. 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.729
 A fourth wall break can let us be intimate with a character, but also the story. There is nothing 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.789
 stronger than showing the hidden motifs than by the character 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.740
 right to let us look and tell them. 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.900
 It is a great way to show what is happening in the head 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.330
 of a character, and is comparable to an 'aside' in the theater. Frank Underwood who speaks directly to us, 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.420
 is the basis for so much energy in House of Cards. 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.060
 I love the scenes where he says something to one character 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.780
 and then looks at us and tells us what he really wants. 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.820
 The last important effect of the fourth wall fracture is it 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.060
 "make it unpleasant." There is nothing worse than feeling safe while watching a movie 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.120
 until the villain suddenly looks you in the eye. 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.840
 Jakkes. 

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.700
 Comedy, satire, intimacy and fear can all succeed with just one glance into the camera. 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.650
 So don't underestimate the potential of a fourth wall fracture, and thank you for looking
