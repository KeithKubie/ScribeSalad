<i>[country rock music]</i>

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.629
- My name is Trevor Rydell,

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.923
<i>and welcome to my shop.</i>

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.008
<i>First off, my forge.</i>

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.760
<i>Built this myself.</i>

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.512
And, uh, I could
take this whole thing

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.347
and rotate it this way so that

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.308
I could pass a blade down
through it for heat-treating.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.727
My quench tank.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.187
Like to have 9 gallons
with canola oil in it.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.441
Kind of looks like
a stick of dynamite, I guess.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.859
Basically a toaster oven.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.611
This is what
I temper most of my knives in.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.280
You know, as long as
they're not too long.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.449
If they're too long,
I put them in my wife's oven.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.201
And this is, uh, Mr. Squishy.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.872
This is a 25-ton forging press.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.123
Works pretty well.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.291
You know, moves a lot of steel.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.876
It's good for making Damascus.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.919
<i>- Hello, welcome to
beautiful north Idaho.</i>

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.255
This is my shop. Come on in.
I'll show you what I got.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.673
My forge.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.217
My very first hammer from 1993.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.761
All of my hammers have names.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.471
My step-father's
last name on it.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.097
He passed away recently.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:58.516
Pay a little respect.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:01.060
I like to be artistic
in my shop at all times,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.353
have a little art going on.

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:04.439
Lots of, like,
antlers and stuff.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.732
Got a little band saw.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.151
I only paid
maybe $40 for this saw,

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.694
and it works fantastic.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:13.490
You can do incredible work
with the bare minimum.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.242
Here's a really nice example.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.412
There's no power hammer
in that.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.499
- Here's some examples
of the work I've done.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.000
The tomahawk, I made this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.462
maybe like six months
into bladesmithing.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.506
You know, I had just
learned how to do it.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.925
This is my favorite knife
I've made.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.843
80-layer Damascus twist.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.930
Got a brass guard on there
that I actually--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.308
I melted down
10-millimeter casings.

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.935
This was a test knife

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.062
to see what I could do
in three hours.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.648
Um, so just a beater, you know?

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.483
I mean, it looks goofy, but

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.735
I just wanted to see if,
you know, if I could make

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.780
a fairly long blade
in a short amount of time.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.198
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.991
This is my 2x72 grinder.

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.910
I use a treadmill motor.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.870
Good thing about
the treadmill motor is

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.622
it gives me variable speed.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.457
And when I really want to,

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.834
this thing will, uh,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.419
really hog some steel.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.756
And at least it says
I burn calories while I use it.

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.925
- This is my daughter,
Isabella.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.802
I'm not the only one
who's a blacksmith;

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.720
she makes knives
in her own right.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.722
- I made this knife
about a year ago.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.432
It was just my first knife.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.476
Made out of 5160 spring steel

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.062
with a white tail deer antler?

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.605
- White tail deer, yeah.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.233
- I'd really like to be
on the show "Forged in Fire"

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.486
so that I can beat
how well he's been doing.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.113
- What?
