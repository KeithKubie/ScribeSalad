now imagine if the hair and the skin

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310
now imagine if the hair and the skin
 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.890

protein would also dissolve in water so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
protein would also dissolve in water so
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.190
protein would also dissolve in water so
you have to know more than just this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
you have to know more than just this
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219
you have to know more than just this
linear chemical structure and that's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
linear chemical structure and that's
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830
linear chemical structure and that's
what I'm studying how are these linear
