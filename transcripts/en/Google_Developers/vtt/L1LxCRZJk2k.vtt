TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.620
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.036
And today, I'm coming to you
from the Highline in New York

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:06.540
City.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230
This is the TLDR, your update
about the coolest developer

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.510
news from Google
in the last week.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.050
Let's start with another great
article from Daydream Labs.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.110
Seriously, these
folks are on fire.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.250
In this post, linked in
the description below,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.480
the team explores how
creating 3D animation changes

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.340
when you're in VR.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.620
TensorFlow version 0.9 is
now available with improved

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.260
mobile support, including
iOS, Raspberry Pi,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.200
and new compilation options.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.600
The post has links to the
release notes, mobile guide,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.590
and samples.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.330
We recently open sourced our
implementation of Wide and Deep

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.900
Learning as part of
the TF Learn API,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.550
so that you can easily
train a model yourself.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.930
Check out the post for an
explanation, tutorials,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.150
and our research paper.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.050
The 2016 Conference on Computer
Vision and Pattern Recognition

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.210
happened in Las Vegas last week.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.120
And don't worry
if you missed it.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.060
The post has links to all
the papers, talks, tutorials,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.760
and workshops we presented.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.930
You can now create
intelligent context-aware apps

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.180
with the Google Awareness APIs
through Google Play services.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.520
The APIs allow your apps
to request information

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.150
about the user's
current context,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.110
or react to changes
in the user's context,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.700
all with minimal impact
on system resources.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.362
If you enjoy big data and
open source, you're in luck.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.820
In collaboration
with GitHub, we're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.020
releasing the full snapshot
of content of more than 2.8

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.480
million open source
GitHub repositories

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.100
in Google BigQuery.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.540
You'll have access to analyze
the source code of almost 2

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.410
billion files with a simple
or complex SQL query, which

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.880
is totally awesome.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.740
Check out the post
to get started.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.640
The new Google Cast SDK is
available for Android and iOS

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.490
senders.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.500
This new SDK focuses
on making development

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.720
for Cast quicker, more reliable,
and easier to maintain.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.880

samples, tutorials, and more,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.890

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.040
The latest version of the
Google Maps Android API is out,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.080
and it includes several
requested features, including

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.770
the ability to order the
display of markers on the map,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.000
the ability to set the
transparency of your tile

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.210
overlays, and a new
Circle Click listener.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.140
The post has details and code.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.030
AdMob Campaigns are a powerful
way to cross-promote your apps

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.610
and manage direct
sold campaigns.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.110
With them, you
can take advantage

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.410
of innovative formats,
advanced ad serving controls,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.740
and best in class
conversion tracking.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.570
