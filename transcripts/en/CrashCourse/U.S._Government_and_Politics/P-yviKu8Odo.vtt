00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.340
Hi, I'm Craig. And this is Crash Course:
Government and Politics. And today

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.060
we're going to try to wrap up the incredibly fun and
uplifting subject of equal protection and discrimination.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.160
Because if you thought the fourteenth amendment
only protected racial and religious minorities

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400
and maybe women to some degree, then you've underestimated the power of what I call

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.660
the most important amendment to the Constitution.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.600
- Typical leftie nonsense. You haven't even mentioned the second amendment, the one that gives us the real

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.620
power to protect ourselves from government overreach.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.300
If you're a member of a well-regulated
militia, you mean. Right?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.020
Oh! Hey guys. Haven't seen you in a while.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.640
That's because you CAN'T STAY ON TOPIC!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.380
Given that the Supreme Court has decided that the
fourteenth amendment applies mainly to discrete and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.760
insular minorities, it makes sense that various ethnic groups should be protected against discrimination.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.160
After all,  you can't control who your parents are or what country they come from.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.340
If you can, you're a time-traveller.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.340
And you should probably use your time-travelling skills to do better things. Like, end World War II or something.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.000
As long as you are born here, or naturalized,
you are a citizen and entitled to the same treatment

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.980
as other citizens and no one is supposed
to discriminate against you.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.240
That being said, historically there are certain ethnic groups that have been targets of unfair treatment.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.140
Notably, Asians and Latinos. Let's start with Asians, as they've been the victims of actual federal discrimination.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.620
In 1882, Congress created the "Chinese Exclusion Act." One of the first federal laws aimed specifically at immigrants.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.700
It effectively closed the door on immigrants from China.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.680
Later immigration quotas had the effect of discriminating against Southern and Eastern Europeans.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.520
And if you read the newspaper from the time, that was clearly their intent but they didn't single out any

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.860
particular group like the "Chinese Exclusion Act" did.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.400
In fact, it was an Asian-American who helped establish that the 14th Amendment Citizenship Clause applied to people born in the US.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.140
In Wong Kim Ark v. U.S., the Court ruled that American citizenship is based on being born here,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.520
not the citizenship or nationality of one's parents.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.500
This meant that Chinese people who were born in the US were entitled to the rights of anyone born here.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.800
Although in the late 19th Century, when the case was decided, this number was pretty small.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.560
A closely related topic that applies to many ethnic Americans has to do with language.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.260
Whether America should adhere to an English-only standard is controversial and not something that I want to get into right now.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.840
But it is true that people who don't speak English as their primary language, even if they're born and raised here,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.480
can face discrimination. Especially in the political process.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.400
This is why voting guides appear in multiple languages in many states.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.660
Another Supreme Court Case, Lau v. Nihcols

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.080
established that school districts have to provide education for students whose English is limited.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.000
They can't simply teach in English and disenfranchise those kids who could learn if they received instruction in their native language.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
As you can imagine, this is also controversial on a number of levels.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.200
But as in the Brown v. Board of Education case, here we again see how the Court didn't want to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880
create barriers in education, because this would have long-term negative consequences.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.260
So it's pretty clear that the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause applies to anyone born in the U.S.,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.180
but what about immigrants to this country? What legal protections against discrimination do they have?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.940
The answer depends on if you're talking about people who immigrated here legally, or illegally.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.160
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.740
Okay, the terminology surrounding immigrants is complicated and highly politicized,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.520
and I'm not going to get into whether or not we should be calling people "undocumented" or "aliens".

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.840
But I'm gonna draw a line and say that a person, no matter how he or she got here, can't be illegal.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
That just doesn't make sense. Anyway:

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.300
People who emigrate to the US following immigration rules and regulations generally are entitled to the same

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.380
rights and privileges as citizens, except they
are not allowed to vote unless they become citizens.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.420
Those who immigrated here without following the rules,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.700
and thus violated U.S. law, do not have nearly the same protections. Although they do have some.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.920
They're usually eligible for medical and educational services, although not for other social services.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.460
At times, states have tried to limit the privileges of this subset of immigrants. For example:

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.640
California's proposition 187 attempted to take away all social services, exceptfor emergency medical care,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.600
for those who emigrated unlawfully, although
most of its provisions were struck down by the courts.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.640
And sometimes federal immigration policy can lead to more discrimination.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.780
For example: the 1986 Immigration Restriction and Control Act tried to push the cost of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.180
immigration enforcement onto employers by making them responsible for background checks on job applicants' immigration status.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.960
Rather than risking fines, employers just discriminated against all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.580
Maybe you're thinking that we shouldn't care about undocumented immigrants' rights since, almost by

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.800
definition, they aren't citizens and therefore
might not be entitled to protections.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.200
However, when we remember that the basic principle behind equal protection is that the courts

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.740
will step in to protect groups that are unable to defend themselves from the legislative process,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.160
then it makes some sense that the courts would look closely at cases involving immigrants,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.620
who for the most part, can't work to change policies by voting. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.980
There's one more ethnic group in the U.S. that gets special treatment in the Constitution,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.740
and for good reason, Native Americans.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.940
Since they were here long before the framers of the Constitution,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.260
they're the only group mentioned by name in the document.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
Unfortunately, the Constitution itself doesn't actually clarify how they are to be treated,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.340
and their legal status has changed a lot over the past 250 years or so.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.880
Originally Native Americas were not considered citizens of the U.S. but rather of their own sovereign nations,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.340
the territory of which the U.S. kept purchasing... well, often stealing... from them.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.400
Since 1924 Native Americans have been granted citizen's rights,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.940
and so they also get full protection under the 14th Amendment.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.160
But tribes also get special consideration in the territory where they are sovereign.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.380
Which is why, for example, Indians can operate casinos in states that don't allow casino gambling.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.620
Numerically, Native Americans constitute a "discrete and insular minority",

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.040
so it makes sense that the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause would apply to them.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.060
In many cases, they are also a linguistic minority, so the Lau decision applies too.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.540
The laws concerning Native Americans are really, really complicated, and tied up in a pretty shameful history.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.120
We don't have time to go into detail about them here, but it's important that you know that they are one of

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.020
the groups that are discriminated against and can receive special consideration in court decisions.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.500
So far we've looked at how the 14th Amendment protects groups that are

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.420
almost always numerical minorities, except women of course, and usually consist of people who

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.500
share immutable characteristics, although the courts also include religious groups here too.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.180
But there are other groups who are discriminated against, and Congress has stepped in to help them as well.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.000
One such group is people with disabilities.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Even trying to describe this group can be tricky, because some disabilities, like missing a limb,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.860
are pretty much permanent. At least for now. While others are not.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.940
Many people are born with an attribute that much of society considers a disability,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.260
while others develop them as the result of accident or disease or from other factor.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.180
Many people who study disability point out that most of us will become less and less able to function

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.760
in some way over time. It may become harder to walk. Or to see. Or to hear.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.540
And so it's better to think of ourselves as "temporarily abled".

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.800
I thought of the eagle as temporarily tabled.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.220
And even calling someone who is blind disabled implies a societal value judgement that the person in question,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.220
or others like them,  might not share. So disability itself is really, really complicated,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.980
which makes the law about it equally so.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.020
Leaving aside arguments about what constitutes disabled,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.060
about 10% of the American population has some kind of disability.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.440
And just looking at the numbers, it appears that employers do discriminate against them.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.100
About 35% of people with disabilities are employed, while 72% of people without disabilities are.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.980
This has a lot to do with why Congress in 1990 passed the Americans With Disabilities Act,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.600
which did for people with disabilities what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did for other minority groups.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.900
LGBT people have recently been extended some civil rights protections.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.840
Now, there are no federal civil rights laws aimed specifically at them,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.860
but many local ordinances accord them protection against discrimination.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.100
This is especially important because states have attempted to prohibit local governments

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.500
from passing ordinances that prevent discrimination against LGBT people. Think about that for a second.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.680
Local voters wanted to pass laws saying that their community couldn't discriminate,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.480
and the state legislature passed another law prohibiting these anti-discrimination statutes. What?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120
And since LGBT people are not usually in the majority,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.300
and certainly don't make up a majority population in a state, they couldn't do much to protect themselves.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.200
That is, until the Supreme Court stepped in and ruled in Romer v. Evans that states couldn't do this anymore.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.520
More recently the Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas ruled that state morality laws that were applied

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.700
against LGBT people, and not against straight people, were a violation of equal protection.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.960
What this means in practice is that everyone has the same right to privacy in their sexual relations.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.480
Very recently, the Supreme Court decided in the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.940
that state bans on same sex marriage were unconstitutional.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.340
This has the effect of making same sex
marriage legal in all 50 states. Whoo!

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.420
Much like the Brown v. Board of Education decision, some states are making attempts to resist the ruling,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.720
and in many states discrimination against LGBT people is still legal,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.860
but it seems that the arc of civil rights history is pointing towards justice.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.080
So as we can see, civil rights protections coming out of the 14th Amendment

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.760
have been extended to many groups. These groups, which include people with disabilities,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.040
LGBT people, ethnic groups, and women, have two things in common:

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.920
The first is that they have historically been discriminated against, and in many cases the discrimination continues.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.700
The second is that they are numerical minorities - except for women -

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.940
and this means that they will have a hard time defending themselves in the political arena.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.480
Luckily they have the 14th Amendment and all the federal and state anti-discrimination

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.860
legislation on their side, and the courts to back them up.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.640
Thanks for watching, see you next time.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.320
You were supposed to be temporarily tabled!
