00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.280
Let's see if we can figure
out what 30% of 6 is.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.730
So one way of thinking
about 30%-- this

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.740
literally means 30 per 100.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.620
So you could view
this as 30/100 times 6

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.700
is the same thing as 30% of 6.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.320
Or you could view this
as 30 hundredths times 6,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.115
so 0.30 times 6.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:28.490
Now we could solve
both of these,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.500
and you'll see that we'll
get the same answer.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
If you do this multiplication
right over here,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.190
30/100-- and you
could view this times

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.027
6/1-- this is equal to 180/100.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:42.610
And let's see.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.520
We can simplify.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.097
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 10.

00:00:46.097 --> 00:00:48.430
And then we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.220
by 2.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.780
And we will get 9/5, which is
the same thing as 1 and 4/5.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.800
And then if we wanted to write
this as a decimal, 4/5 is 0.8.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.340
And if you want to
verify that, you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.304
could verify that
5 goes into 4--

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:06.720
and there's going
to be a decimal.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570
So let's throw some
decimals in there.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.170
It goes into 4 zero times.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.711
So we don't have to
worry about that.

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.640
It goes into 40 eight times.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.590
8 times 5 is 40.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.270
Subtract.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.090
You have no remainder, and
you just have 0's left here.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.192
So 4/5 is 0.8.

00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:22.150
You've got the 1 there.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.270
This is the same
thing as 1.8, which

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.220
you would have gotten
if you divided 5 into 9.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.900
You would've gotten 1.8.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.030
So 30% of 6 is equal to 1.8.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.290
And we can verify it
doing this way as well.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.880
So if we were to multiply
0.30 times 6-- let's do that.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.680
And I could just write that
literally as 0.3 times 6.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980
Well, 3 times 6 is 18.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.285
I have only one digit
behind the decimal

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.410
amongst both of these
numbers that I'm multiplying.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.410
I only have the 3 to the
right of the decimal.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.910
So I'm only going
to have one number

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.350
to the right of
the decimal here.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.890
So I just count one number.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.700
It's going to be 1.8.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.910
So either way you think about
it or calculate it, 30% of 6

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.280
is 1.8.
