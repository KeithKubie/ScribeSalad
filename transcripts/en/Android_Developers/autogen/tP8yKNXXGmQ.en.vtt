user to do that
then you'd have to be able to record

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000
then you'd have to be able to record
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.639
then you'd have to be able to record
step counts in kind of a way that won't

solve all these problems your step count
 

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.030
solve all these problems your step count
still is probably not going to be

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040

with just one method call so let me just
show you how to do that typically when

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440
show you how to do that typically when
 

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.540
show you how to do that typically when
you want to connect to the Google fit

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
you want to connect to the Google fit
 

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.269
you want to connect to the Google fit
platform you create a Google API client

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279
platform you create a Google API client
 

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.860
platform you create a Google API client
right and normally you create an

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:32.870
right and normally you create an
 

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.110
right and normally you create an
authenticated one where you specify the

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120
authenticated one where you specify the
 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.990
authenticated one where you specify the
account that you want to read data for

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
account that you want to read data for
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.699
account that you want to read data for
so here's how I'd build the client I say

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:39.709
so here's how I'd build the client I say
 

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:41.650
so here's how I'd build the client I say
that I'm interested in reading Fitness

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:41.660
that I'm interested in reading Fitness
 

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.060
that I'm interested in reading Fitness
history data so I add the fitness

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.070
history data so I add the fitness
 

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.100
history data so I add the fitness
history API I add scopes for the

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.110
history API I add scopes for the
 

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.660
history API I add scopes for the
particular types of data I want to read

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:46.670
particular types of data I want to read
 

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.449
particular types of data I want to read
so in this case activity type location

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:49.459
so in this case activity type location
 

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:51.880
so in this case activity type location
and body sensor data like heart rate and

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:51.890
and body sensor data like heart rate and
 

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.949
and body sensor data like heart rate and
then next I add an account so this is

00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959
then next I add an account so this is
 

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:54.850
then next I add an account so this is
the account I want to read the data from

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:54.860
the account I want to read the data from
 

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.189
the account I want to read the data from
and then finally add my callbacks and

00:09:57.189 --> 00:09:57.199
and then finally add my callbacks and
 

00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:58.509
and then finally add my callbacks and
now I have this authenticated client

00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519
now I have this authenticated client
 

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.220
now I have this authenticated client
that I can use to make queries to the

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.230
that I can use to make queries to the
 

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.550
that I can use to make queries to the
fitness platform but wait you're saying

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560
fitness platform but wait you're saying
 

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.850
fitness platform but wait you're saying
Android wear watches don't have accounts

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:05.860
Android wear watches don't have accounts
 

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.600
Android wear watches don't have accounts
and this is true

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:07.610
and this is true
 

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.670
and this is true
Android wear 2.0 will actually add

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680
Android wear 2.0 will actually add
 

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.530
Android wear 2.0 will actually add
account support but for now we don't

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:11.540
account support but for now we don't
 

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.300
account support but for now we don't
have accounts on watches fortunately

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.310
have accounts on watches fortunately
 

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.220
have accounts on watches fortunately
there is a solution now you could sync

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.230
there is a solution now you could sync
 

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.530
there is a solution now you could sync
account information from the phone but

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540
account information from the phone but
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.030
account information from the phone but
this would require your watch face to

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
this would require your watch face to
 

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.040
this would require your watch face to
have a companion phone app which is a

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.050
have a companion phone app which is a
 

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.630
have a companion phone app which is a
lot more complicated so here's an easier

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640
lot more complicated so here's an easier
 

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.670
lot more complicated so here's an easier
way to do it without a phone app you can

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680
way to do it without a phone app you can
 

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.650
way to do it without a phone app you can
create a no account client so you create

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:26.660
create a no account client so you create
 

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.600
create a no account client so you create
a Google API client as before we're

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:28.610
a Google API client as before we're
 

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.550
a Google API client as before we're
going to add the history API and now we

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560
going to add the history API and now we
 

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.960
going to add the history API and now we
just call set default account we don't

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:31.970
just call set default account we don't
 

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.449
just call set default account we don't
specify an account finish building it

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:34.459
specify an account finish building it
 

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:36.100
specify an account finish building it
and now we have a no account client that

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.110
and now we have a no account client that
 

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.689
and now we have a no account client that
we can still use to query step counts

00:10:37.689 --> 00:10:37.699
we can still use to query step counts
 

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:40.389
we can still use to query step counts
and the way you do that is with the read

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399
and the way you do that is with the read
 

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.100
and the way you do that is with the read
daily totals method so you're going to

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.110
daily totals method so you're going to
 

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.949
daily totals method so you're going to
call the history API is read daily total

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959
call the history API is read daily total
 

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.310
call the history API is read daily total
method and this is basically going to

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320
method and this is basically going to
 

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.380
method and this is basically going to
give you a simple way to get step counts

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:50.390
give you a simple way to get step counts
 

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.819
give you a simple way to get step counts
for watchface that's going to be

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:51.829
for watchface that's going to be
 

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:52.960
for watchface that's going to be
consistent with other apps and other

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
consistent with other apps and other
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.540
consistent with other apps and other
watch faces you can set a callback so

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:55.550
watch faces you can set a callback so
 

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.769
watch faces you can set a callback so
that when the result returns you can

00:10:56.769 --> 00:10:56.779
that when the result returns you can
 

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:58.990
that when the result returns you can
process it so here in the on result I'm

00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000
process it so here in the on result I'm
 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.850
process it so here in the on result I'm
basically just extracting out the step

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:00.860
basically just extracting out the step
 

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.040
basically just extracting out the step
count putting it into a steps total

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.050
count putting it into a steps total
 

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.220
count putting it into a steps total
variable and

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
variable and
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.780
variable and
you go it's a pretty simple way to track

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:05.790
you go it's a pretty simple way to track
 

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.260
you go it's a pretty simple way to track
steps with your watch face and it's not

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:09.270
steps with your watch face and it's not
 

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.780
steps with your watch face and it's not
just steps that you can that you can get

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:11.790
just steps that you can that you can get
 

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.220
just steps that you can that you can get
from a google fit platform right you can

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.230
from a google fit platform right you can
 

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.750
from a google fit platform right you can
also read and write other data like

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760
also read and write other data like
 

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.060
also read and write other data like
calories consumed so here's an example

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.070
calories consumed so here's an example
 

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.040
calories consumed so here's an example
of how the life some app displays that

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.050
of how the life some app displays that
 

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.690
of how the life some app displays that
data here I'm looking at the amount of

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700
data here I'm looking at the amount of
 

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.150

calories I have left in my budget for

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160
calories I have left in my budget for
 

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.820
calories I have left in my budget for
the day 911 so I guess I could eat like

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:25.830
the day 911 so I guess I could eat like
 

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.010
the day 911 so I guess I could eat like
two avocados and drink two glasses of

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.020
two avocados and drink two glasses of
 

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.770

complications maybe you've seen some

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820
complications maybe you've seen some
 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.750
complications maybe you've seen some
some of this earlier in the keynote but

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760
some of this earlier in the keynote but
 

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.220
some of this earlier in the keynote but
basically on the right there's a watch

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.230
basically on the right there's a watch
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.810
basically on the right there's a watch
face that has three complications and

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820
face that has three complications and
 

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.550
face that has three complications and
the watch face lets you select which

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560
the watch face lets you select which
 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.410
the watch face lets you select which
complications you want and then any app

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420
complications you want and then any app
 

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.880
complications you want and then any app
can provide data for those complications

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:46.890
can provide data for those complications
 

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.070
can provide data for those complications
so here's an example where life's um is

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.080
so here's an example where life's um is
 

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.440
so here's an example where life's um is

activity data into the google fit

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:48.690
activity data into the google fit
 

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.500
activity data into the google fit
platform and read back our computed

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:51.510
platform and read back our computed
 

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:57.990

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000
 

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.069
cool so let's take a look at how we

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079
cool so let's take a look at how we
 

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.360
cool so let's take a look at how we
might do something like this with the

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.370
might do something like this with the
 

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.490
might do something like this with the
Google fit platform so there's really

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:03.500
Google fit platform so there's really
 

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.889
Google fit platform so there's really
there are two ways of writing data to

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:05.899
there are two ways of writing data to
 

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:07.629
there are two ways of writing data to
the platform you can use the recording

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639
the platform you can use the recording
 

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.030
the platform you can use the recording
API to do live recording and then you

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040
API to do live recording and then you
 

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.309
API to do live recording and then you
can use the history API to insert

00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:12.319
can use the history API to insert
 

00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:13.870
can use the history API to insert
activity history so let's actually start

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880
activity history so let's actually start
 

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.059
activity history so let's actually start
by looking at live recording all we have

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:16.069
by looking at live recording all we have
 

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:18.220
by looking at live recording all we have
to do to start live recording is to

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.230
to do to start live recording is to
 

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.629
to do to start live recording is to
subscribe to the data type we care about

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639
subscribe to the data type we care about
 

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.699
subscribe to the data type we care about
so here I'm calling subscribe and I'm

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:21.709
so here I'm calling subscribe and I'm
 

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:23.139
so here I'm calling subscribe and I'm
saying I'm interested in activity

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:23.149
saying I'm interested in activity
 

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:26.189
saying I'm interested in activity
samples activity type and then I

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199
samples activity type and then I
 

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:28.449
samples activity type and then I
actually at that point I am essentially

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:28.459
actually at that point I am essentially
 

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:30.370
actually at that point I am essentially
done google fit will start storing that

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
done google fit will start storing that
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.749
done google fit will start storing that
data that I care about in the background

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:31.759
data that I care about in the background
 

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.460
data that I care about in the background
so I don't need my own database or my

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:33.470
so I don't need my own database or my
 

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.379
so I don't need my own database or my
back-end to store it there's no listener

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:35.389
back-end to store it there's no listener
 

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:37.360
back-end to store it there's no listener
needed here basically the Google fit

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.370
needed here basically the Google fit
 

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.410
needed here basically the Google fit

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.460
data and syncing it to the cloud in the
background and when I want it later I

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:42.470
background and when I want it later I
 

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.949

can just read it with the history API so

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959
can just read it with the history API so
 

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:47.019
can just read it with the history API so
once I subscribe I'm done all I really

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:47.029
once I subscribe I'm done all I really
 

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:48.519
once I subscribe I'm done all I really
need to do is just check the status code

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:48.529
need to do is just check the status code
 

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:49.960
need to do is just check the status code
in the on result and that's just to make

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:49.970
in the on result and that's just to make
 

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.720
in the on result and that's just to make
sure that the subscription succeeded now

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:52.730
sure that the subscription succeeded now
 

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.920

let's look at another way of getting

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:53.930
let's look at another way of getting
 

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.689
let's look at another way of getting
data into the fitness history suppose

00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:55.699
data into the fitness history suppose
 

00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:57.009
data into the fitness history suppose
I've gotten my data from some external

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:57.019
I've gotten my data from some external
 

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.620
I've gotten my data from some external
source like another device so in the

00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.630
source like another device so in the
 

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.970
source like another device so in the
example of basis right they wanted to

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:00.980
example of basis right they wanted to
 

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.259
example of basis right they wanted to
write in some steps that they had gotten

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:02.269
write in some steps that they had gotten
 

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:04.540
write in some steps that they had gotten
from another device so first you create

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.550
from another device so first you create
 

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.879
from another device so first you create
this data source object and you specify

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:06.889
this data source object and you specify
 

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:08.350
this data source object and you specify
the type of data you want to write here

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360
the type of data you want to write here
 

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.210
the type of data you want to write here
I'm saying I want to write straw step

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:10.220
I'm saying I want to write straw step
 

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.629
I'm saying I want to write straw step
count data and then you create a data

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639
count data and then you create a data
 

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:16.509
count data and then you create a data
set from the data source and you add one

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519
set from the data source and you add one
 

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.490
set from the data source and you add one
or more data points to the data set each

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:18.500
or more data points to the data set each
 

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.870
or more data points to the data set each
of these points has a start and an end

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880
of these points has a start and an end
 

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.199
of these points has a start and an end
time so here I'm adding 950 steps with a

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:23.209
time so here I'm adding 950 steps with a
 

00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:25.540
time so here I'm adding 950 steps with a
start and an end time and then finally

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:25.550
start and an end time and then finally
 

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.240
start and an end time and then finally
you just call insert data to put the

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:28.250
you just call insert data to put the
 

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.620
you just call insert data to put the
data into the fitness history and that's

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:29.630
data into the fitness history and that's
 

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.120
data into the fitness history and that's
about it all you really have to do after

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.130
about it all you really have to do after
 

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.910
about it all you really have to do after
that is just basically verify that the

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920
that is just basically verify that the
 

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.439
that is just basically verify that the
operation succeeded before you start

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:35.449
operation succeeded before you start
 

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:37.090
operation succeeded before you start
querying the data with a history API and

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.100
querying the data with a history API and
 

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.160
querying the data with a history API and
one nice thing is that the fit platform

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.170
one nice thing is that the fit platform
 

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.780
one nice thing is that the fit platform
will actually validate the data that the

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:40.790
will actually validate the data that the
 

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.730
will actually validate the data that the
data points that you insert so for

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:42.740
data points that you insert so for
 

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.319
data points that you insert so for
example if I put in an invalid time

00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:44.329

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:05.420
an intent service that's going to call
 

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.850
an intent service that's going to call
into your app whenever an update to one

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:06.860
into your app whenever an update to one
 

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.370

of these data types occurs what you then

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:09.380
of these data types occurs what you then
 

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.890
of these data types occurs what you then
do is you call you create a data update

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:11.900
do is you call you create a data update
 

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.410
do is you call you create a data update
listener registration request which is a

listener registration request which is a
 

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.090
listener registration request which is a
lot of camelcase but it is a pretty

descriptive name and we're going to pass

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.470
descriptive name and we're going to pass
 

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.970

in this case nutrition we're interested
 

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.640
in this case nutrition we're interested
in meals that are being logged and then

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:27.650
in meals that are being logged and then
 

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.260
in meals that are being logged and then
we pass in that pending intent we

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:29.270
we pass in that pending intent we
 

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.720
we pass in that pending intent we
created and then finally we just call

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:31.730
created and then finally we just call
 

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.250
created and then finally we just call
this register data update listener

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:33.260
this register data update listener
 

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.230

request and then voila

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.130
request and then voila
 

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.530
request and then voila
we'll get an update with the next log

one that we just looked at with the
 

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.000
one that we just looked at with the
history API but here we're going to use

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.010
history API but here we're going to use
 

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.170
history API but here we're going to use
the sessions API because we're

information on that session you can

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.050
information on that session you can
 

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.450
information on that session you can
actually extract it from out of the

workout so whether it was a run or a
 

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.710
workout so whether it was a run or a
bike ride or a weightlifting session and

bike ride or a weightlifting session and
 

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.240
bike ride or a weightlifting session and
I could put that into the notification
