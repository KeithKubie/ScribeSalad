00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.930
And as an aside, we are
currently accepting applications

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.220
for Kluge fellowships,
which is a fellowship

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.520
that today's speaker holds.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.060
We'll be accepting those
applications through July 15th.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.720
Today's program is titled The
Kingdom of Jerusalem and War

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.260
Against the Infidel, sixteenth
century doctrines of just war

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.790
and the origins of
the Spanish Empire.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.480
It features scholar Andrew
Devereux, currently a Kluge fellow

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.780
at the John W Kluge Center.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.300
While at the Library of
Congress, Andrew has been working

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.610 position:56%
on a book project that takes an
expansive view of Spanish rationales

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.400
for empire by analyzing processes
of Mediterranean expansion

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.680
against similar episodes in
early 16th century Americas.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.750
His talk today examines the legal
and moral questions of empire

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.610
on the threshold of the early
modern era by casting light

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.190
on Spain's expansionary ventures in
the Mediterranean in the late 15th

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.370
and early 16th centuries.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.260
Andrew Devereux is
assistant professor of history

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.460
at Loyola Marymount University.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.830
He's a historian of the medieval
and early modern Mediterranean.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.250
He earned his PhD from
the department of history

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.150
at Johns Hopkins University,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.030
where his dissertation examined
Spanish imperial ideologies

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.780
in the context of the
Mediterranean world.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.590
During 2011 and 2012, he was an
Ahmanson-Getty postdoctoral fellow

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.270
at UCLA's William Andrew
Clark Memorial Library.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.090
He has published in the Journal
of Spanish cultural studies.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.330
He has contributed book chapters
to, In and of the Mediterranean,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.770
medieval and early
modern Iberian studies,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.500 position:56%
and to representing imperial rivalry
in the early modern Mediterranean.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.630
His work has been recognized with
grants from the IIE-Fulbright,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.980
the National Endowment for the
Humanities, the Spanish Ministry

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.150
of Culture and Education, and of
course, the Library of Congress.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.140
He is a founding member of
the Spain-North Africa project

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.630
and a member of its
executive committee.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.510
So please join me in
welcoming Andrew Devereux.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.820
[ Applause ]

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.120
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux: Well
thank you so much Jason

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.040
for that very kind introduction
and thanks to all of you

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.350
for being here this afternoon.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.700
I just wanted to start things off
today by expressing my gratitude.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.410 position:56%
First of all, having the opportunity
to spend this academic year

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.570
as a fellow here at the Kluge
Center has been extraordinary.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.500
And when I was growing
up in Charlottesville,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.450
Virginia in the 1980s,
stories circulated

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.030
about the philanthropist
John W Kluge who lived

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.240
on an estate somewhere
outside of town

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.250
in the rolling farmland
near Charlottesville.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.580
And at the time, I had no idea that
I would someday be a beneficiary

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.900
of his largess and I
am profoundly grateful.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.540
I would also like to
extend my deepest gratitude

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.810
to the staff here at
the Kluge Center.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.610
Mary Lou Reker, Travis
Hensley, JoAnne Kitching,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.640
Jason Steinhauer, and Dan Terullo.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.940
All of you share a commitment

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.840
to making this a place
where ideas matter.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.180
It is greatly appreciated.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.660
Moreover, the interim directors
during my tenure here, Bob Gallucci

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.400
and Janice Heinz, have both
cultivated an atmosphere

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.950
of vigorous intellectual exchange.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.250
And of course, all the fellows here

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.610
with whom I've had the tremendous
good fortune to interact this year.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.730
From the talks you've given and
from countless conversations

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.900
in this wonderful setting, I've
learned an extraordinary amount.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.470
So thank you.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.860
My talk today brings
together sections

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.240
of several different
chapters of my book manuscript

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.990 position:56%
that I've been working on this year.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.550
And it gives a sense of the overall
shape of the project and some

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.110
of the major themes that
I'm exploring in the book.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.990
So I'm going to begin
today with an anecdote.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.750
In early January of
1516, the Aragonese King,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.550
Ferdinand the Catholic,
widower of Isabella of Castille,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.150
was in the region of
Extremadura in southwestern Spain,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.740
which you can see highlighted
in yellow here on this map.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.780
The 64-year-old king was ill

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.860
and many feared this
illness would be his last.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.260 position:56%
In anticipation of this possibility,
Ferdinand had recently drawn

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.470
up his last will and testament.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.420
And in Extremadura, he was to meet
with the ambassadors of Charles

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.140
of Ghent, the King's
grandson and appointed heir.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.590
The chronicler and member
of the Royal Council,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.440
Lorenzo Galindez de
Carvajal, upon whose version

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.100
of this narrative I'm drawing here,
relates that while in the town

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.280
of Madrigalejo, royal counselors
informed the king that he stood

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.600
at death's door and
urged him to confess

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600
and to receive the sacraments.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.300
Ferdinand however, turned away
his confessor, Juan de Matienzo,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.380
and suggested that the friar was
more interested in negotiating

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.730
with the king for gifts and
privileges than in helping him

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.060
to unburden his conscience.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.850
Ferdinand insisted
that he was not dying.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.020
Apparently a few weeks earlier
while the king was in Plascencia,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.480
a member of his counsel had
come from the nearby town

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.930
of El Barco de Avila bringing word
from a local Bayata [phonetic],

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.290
a holy woman reputed to
possess powers of prophecy.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.480
This particular Bayata had
been an intermittent presence

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.460 position:56%
of Ferdinand's court for at least
seven years, and our source tells us

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.590
that she had prophesied that
King Ferdinand would not die

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.510
until he had conquered Jerusalem.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.050
Eventually, members of the
royal entourage concerned

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.930
for the salvation of
Ferdinand's soul,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.730
prevailed on the king
to accept last rites.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.650
Ferdinand called back his confessor
who administered the sacraments.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.810
On the afternoon of January 22nd,
Ferdinand received extreme unction,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.650
and on January 23, he died wearing
the habit of the Dominican order.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.060
Galindez de Carvajal
recorded that the cause

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.500
of death was edema
combined with heart disease.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.260
He wrote that some, however,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.160
had a different explanation
for the king's demise.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.620
Citing the fact that Ferdinand's
jaw drooped at the end of his life,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.920
some believed that he had died

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.160
from ingesting a concoction
of harmful herbs.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.950
Galindez de Carvajal asserted

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.840
that nothing certain was
known of this allegation.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.530
But the theory was that Ferdinand
had been given an herbal potion

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.460
designed to arouse his desire
for the Queen, his second wife,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.030
Germaine de Foix, because he
hoped to conceive with her an heir

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.780 position:56%
for his realms of Aragon and Naples.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.610
Now I'd like to pause here to
take stock of a few salient points

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.170
that are conveyed by this anecdote.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.860 position:56%
When we imagine the early modern
Spanish Empire, we reflexively think

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.210
of the establishment of
colonies in the Caribbean

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.270
and on the American mainland.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.010
An empire decidedly
Atlantic in its orientation.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.610
Less noted is the fact that
concurrent with this moment

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.840
of Atlantic expansion, Spain
embarked on an ambitious course

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.870
of Mediterranean conquest.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:47.250
Between 1497 and 1510, the crowns
of Aragon and Castille won control

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.780
of the southern half of the Italian
peninsula and established a string

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.790
of outposts and presidios
along a 2500 mile stretch

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.870
of the North African coastline,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.010
thereby making Spain the dominant
power in the Western Mediterranean.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.950
And this map demonstrates some
of what I'm talking about here.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.720
You can see the arrows
showing the expansion into some

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.080
of the North African cities and
presidios that Spain occupied.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.230
In some cases, for just a few
decades, and in some cases,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.290
for several centuries, or in
the case of Melilla and Ceuta,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.320
right up until the present day.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.020 position:56%
King Ferdinand of Aragon intended to
use his newly acquired territories

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.840
as forward bases from which
to extend his conquests

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.840
into the eastern Mediterranean
and beyond.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.130 position:56%
The monarch and many of his advisers
harbored plans to conquer Egypt,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:43.420
Greece, Anatolia, Palestine,
and a vaguely swath of Asia.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.820
If we are to believe the
chronicler Galindez de Carvajal,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.910
then even in his final days,
Ferdinand remained focused

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.210
on his Mediterranean interests.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.410
Moreover, this anecdote that
I have opened with today,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.160
contests the traditional
teleological interpretation

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.350
of Spanish history that is tended
to present the Union of the crowns

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.350
of Aragon and Castille through the
marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.200
as the starting point
of the inexorable rise

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.030
of the early modern Spanish empire.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.440
In fact, Ferdinand was
attempting, right up to the end,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.880
to produce a male heir who would
inherit his patrimonial lands

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.740
of the Crown of Aragon, which
included Eastern Iberia as well

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.890
as the Italian possessions of
Sardinia, Sicily, and Naples,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.030
but that did not include Castille.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.300
And when I refer to the Crown of
Aragon, it's in green on this map.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.010
So you can see it here in
Eastern Iberia and then stretching

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.760 position:56%
across to the Central
Mediterranean, including the islands

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.000
and the southern Italian peninsula.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.300
Galindez de Carvajal's account
illustrates that the ultimate union

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.770
of Aragon and Castille was in fact
an accident that occurred only

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.810
because the aging king, in spite
of his consumption of aphrodisiacs,

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.670
was unable to produce an heir with
his second wife Germaine de Foix.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.770
Galindez de Carvajal occupied
numerous important positions

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.110
at Ferdinand's court, including
posts on the Council of Castille

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.690
and as official chronicler.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.420 position:56%
In this capacity, he spent a great
deal of time in the king's presence.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.620
A fact that suggests that
he knew Ferdinand's mind or,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.340
at the very least, understood
the capacity of the written word

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.560
to serve as vehicle for the
projection of the sort of image

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.590
that Ferdinand desired
to see propagated.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.020 position:56%
In this light, it is tempting to
read the anecdote about the conquest

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.780
of Jerusalem as the conqueror's
attempt to portray the king

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.880
in as pious a light as possible.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.570
And yet, the Mediterranean
orientation

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.710 position:56%
of Ferdinand's reign was quite real.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.620
As King of Aragon, Ferdinand
inherited a Mediterranean political

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.810
outlook that shaped his priorities.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.000
These Mediterranean interests
entangled the Spanish realms

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.580
of Aragon and Castille in
conflicts with Portugal, France,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.880
the Ottoman Empire, and
sundry North African states.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.810
These Mediterranean wars
required legal justification.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.770
What the eminent historian of
Latin America, Lewis Hanke,

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.730
termed the Spanish Struggle for
Justice in the Conquest of America,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.690
is a well-known historical topic.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.740
One that embroiled the likes
of Bartolom de las Casas,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.900
Juan Gin s de Sepœlveda, and
Francisco de Victoria in debates

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.150
over the possibility for
non-Christian peoples

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.790
to exercise dominium or
to enjoy sovereignty.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.920
Less noted is the fact that
Spanish wars and conquests

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.090
in the Mediterranean,
whether in Catholic Italy

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.920
or in Muslim North Africa,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.500
also demanded legal and
moral justification.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.260
Galindez de Carvajal's
reference to Ferdinand's interest

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.340
in effecting a Christian
recovery of Jerusalem is related

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.780
to these legal arguments.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.870
We will get to these later in
this talk, but in order to arrive

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.820
at the eastern Mediterranean, I
would first like to shift attention

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.230
to the southern Italian
kingdom of Naples.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.550
The protracted struggle
to control this realm

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.530
in the central Mediterranean ties
together a number of the themes

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.600 position:56%
of this talk and of my book project.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.240
During the second half of the 15th
century, the kingdom of Naples,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.350
comprising the southern
half of the boot of Italy,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.470
shown here with the red arrow,
was ruled by a cadet branch

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.710
of the Spanish royal dynasty.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.540 position:56%
In addition to internal instability,
such as repeated baronial revolts,

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.630
external threats added
to the realm's problems.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.840
In particular, Ferdinand of Aragon
held a rival claim to the crown

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.510
as did the [inaudible] of France.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.290
During the final two
decades of the 15th century,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.670
the Kingdom of Naples became the
object of the expansionist designs

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.730 position:56%
of three ascended states that sought

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.540
to become hegemonic powers
in the Mediterranean.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.130
Between 1480 and 1495, Naples
was invaded successively

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.920
by the Ottoman Empire,
by France, and by Spain,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.970
finally being incorporated into the
Spanish Crown of Aragon in 1503.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.610
The way these conflicts played
out and the political vocabulary,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.810
the actors involved chose to
articulate their objectives

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.060 position:56%
and claims, illustrates a great deal

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.130
about the religio-political
understanding of empire

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.100
in the late 15th and early
16th century Mediterranean.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.760
In two discrete episodes
of conflict,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.740
one against the Ottoman Empire
and the other against France,

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.280
the Catholic monarchs
Ferdinand and Isabella,

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.910
along with their diplomats,
articulated their Italian policies

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.210
as a holy war undertaken
in defense of the church

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.710 position:56%
and the body politic of Christendom.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.830
The Spanish crown asserted
its sovereignty

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.110
in the Neapolitan kingdom
through the use of a rhetoric

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.890
that represented Spain as the
guarantor of peace and stability

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.090
within the Christian Commonwealth.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.040 position:56%
Commensurately, Spaniards attempted
to invalidate the claims put forward

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.680
by their French rivals,
depicting the French as a threat

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.080
to the security of Christendom on
a magnitude equal to or greater

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.310
than that posed by
the Ottoman Empire.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.310
So I'll begin here with
the Ottoman Empire.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.260
In July 1480, an Ottoman
fleet laid siege to Rhodes,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.460
off the coast of Anatolia, and
at that time, the headquarters

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.920
of the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.300
The Grand Master of the military
order wrote to Ferdinand pleading

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.170
for assistance in the face
of this threat for the sake

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.730
of what he termed, the
well-being of Christendom.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.800
Ferdinand responded by taking the
military order under his custody

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.610
for the benefit of the body
politic of Christian believers.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.620
Or to use the term that Ferdinand
used, [foreign language],

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.220
which I'm translating roughly to
mean the Christian Commonwealth

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.260
or the body politic of
all Christian believers.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.250
Just days later on August 11th
1480, Ottoman forces invaded

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.690 position:56%
and occupied Otranto on the Adriatic
coast of the kingdom of Naples.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.900
Western Europeans viewed the
Ottoman occupation of Otranto

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.720
as a grave threat to the
stability of the Neapolitan kingdom

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.800
and to the Italian
peninsula as a whole.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.990
In light of Ottoman conquests in
the Balkans during the late 14th

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.860
and early 15th centuries,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.910
concern that Naples might
succumb was not unfounded.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.540
Moreover, should Naples fall,
the kingdom's immediate neighbor

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.470
to the north, the Papal States,
including the city of Rome,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.230
would lie exposed to the forces of
Mehmed who had earned the sobriquet

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:25.540
of conqueror through his capture
of Constantinople in 1453.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.160
Prophecies of a Turkish advance
as far as Rome circulated

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.570
in both Christian and Islamic
lands during the second half

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.770
of the 15th century.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.710
Within Ottoman territories, Rome
was represented as the red apple.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.610 position:56%
The conquest of which, in the wake
of their conquest of Constantinople,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.130 position:56%
would affirm the Ottomans legitimacy
as heirs to the Roman Empire.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.270
In Western Europe of course,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.810
prophecies of an Ottoman
conquest of Rome sparked dread.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.070
So in 1480 when the
Ottomans captured Otranto,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.510
the news quickly spread
throughout Europe.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.310
Peter Schott, a canon
of Strasburg whose study

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.900
of the classics no doubt influenced
his views of Rome, was so concerned

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.590
that the Ottoman advance would not
be stemmed that he traveled to Rome

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.600
to visit the Holy Sea in case
it should fall to the Turks

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.520
and be lost to Christendom forever.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.990 position:56%
Following a pattern established in
his response to the siege of Rhodes,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.920
Ferdinand of Aragon portrayed the
Ottoman presence on Italian soil

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.790
in terms that reflected this sense

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.460 position:56%
of an existential crisis threatening
the entirety of Christendom.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.760
Ferdinand emphasized that
the Turkish occupation

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.040
of Otranto posed a
threat well beyond Naples.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.410
Warning of "the hardship that all
Christendom suffers as a result

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.870
of the Turkish invasion of Italy".

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.430
And positing that Christians
did not resist,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.970
then the Ottomans "would easily
establish dominion over Italy

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.750
and Rome to the great offense of
our Lord God and to the detriment

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.300
of the Christian religion".

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.220
When Neapolitan forces ultimately
recovered Otranto a year later,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.470
Ferdinand celebrated the news
in a letter to the Duke of Milan

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.310
as representing the liberation
of Italy and the restoration

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:12.640
of a significant portion of
the Republic of Christendom.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.590
For years following the
Ottoman withdrawal from Otranto,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.820
Ferdinand continued to use a
Christian universalist discourse

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.900
to frame the external forces
menacing the Italian peninsula.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.530
For example, in June 1482,
he expressed deep concern

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.140
over the Ottoman presence in
Verona, modern [inaudible] Albania,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.920
just 50 miles across the Adriatic
from the Kingdom of Naples.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.080
"Being in Verona so close
to Italy, should the enemy

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.670
of our faith see Italy
divided and weakened by war,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.840
he will launch an attack".

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.780
Such an invasion, suggested
Ferdinand,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.710
would pose a threat not only
to the Neapolitan Kingdom

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.330
and the other Italian states, but
would jeopardize the very survival

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.150
of the Christian religion
by inflicting

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.820
"such great universal harm to
Christendom, as might follow

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.710
from an Ottoman assault,
should the internecine turmoil

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.010
in Italy persist".

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.780
Now it comes as little
surprise that Christian rulers

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.530
in 15th century Europe portrayed
Ottoman westward advances

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.920
as posing a threat to the
survival of Christendom.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.850
King Charles VIII of France,
like Ferdinand of Aragon,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.020
styled himself an exemplary
Christian Prince and champion

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.900
of the Christian Commonwealth.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.310
Intriguingly, King Charles
soon found himself the target

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.840
of precisely the same rhetoric
the Spanish had recently deployed

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.780
to characterize the Ottoman threat.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.930
In September 1494, Charles
VIII led forces across the Alps

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.820
and into Italy, pressing
his own dynastic claim

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.920
to the Kingdom of Naples.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.580
Drawing on centuries-old
crusading associations

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.990
between the southern Italian
lands and the holy land,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.350
the French king indicated
that his incursion

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.800
into Naples would be merely the
first step in a much grander design

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.400
of Mediterranean conquests.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.450
In the context of the 1490s with
the second Rome, Constantinople,

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.660
now the seat of an Islamic empire,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.080
the crusading resonances
Charles invoked took

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.700
on a new sense of urgency.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.420
Looking well beyond the
southern, the southern reaches

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.910
of the Italian peninsula, Charles
depicted his actions as part

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.770
of a strategy to subjugate
the Ottoman Empire

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.580
and as an important first step
toward a Christian recovery

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.410
of the holy land.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.980
The reigning pope, Alexander VI,
even offered crusade indulgences

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.210
to French soldiers who participated
in the invasion of Naples.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.060
As the French forces
marched south through Italy,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.160
Ferdinand of Aragon responded
immediately in a desperate attempt

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.460
to prevent his arch rival

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.750
from attaining a position
of hegemony in Italy.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.910
In October 1494, Ferdinand and
Isabella wrote their ambassadors

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.020
in Rome, counseling them on how

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.690
to represent the Spanish
monarchs protest

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.100
against the French king's
actions before the papal Curia.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.970
And urging them to emphasize
the degree to which Ferdinand

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.460
and Isabella had always worked
for the peace and tranquility

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.710
of the Christian Republic,
and the union

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.460
and concord of Christian princes.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.870
This vocabulary was of a piece
with Ferdinand's response

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.410
to the Ottoman threat during
the occupation of Otranto.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.920
Painting the French as a threat
equal to that posed by the Turks,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.710
Ferdinand and Isabella lamented
that the eruption of war

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.090
in Italy would cause as
much harm to Christians

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.000
as would war against the Turks.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.260 position:56%
The Spanish monarchs went on to warn
that if the French did not desist,

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.940
there would result "universal
harm and great danger

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.240
to the Christian Republic".

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.380
The Spanish response to French
aggression was of course,

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.330
but one side of a dialogue
of competing claims.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.050
The French King appealed to
a similar political ideology,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.620
representing himself
as a crusading king

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.590
and portraying his invasion
as divinely sanctioned.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.910
The King's Italian partisans
appealed to the same imagery.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.160
In Florence, the charismatic
preacher, Savonarola,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.310
painted Charles as
a leader sent by God

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.220
to punish the institutional
church for its sins

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.800
and to purge it of impurities.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.580
When Charles entered the
city of Naples and triumph

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.420
on February 22nd 1495,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.090
he rode through Naples wearing
the imperial cloak and adorned

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.860
with a quadruple crown
representing France, Naples,

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.970
Constantinople, and Jerusalem.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.660
The Regalia of Constantinople
was intended

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.540
to convey Charles' imperial
rank, affirming the French King

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.780
as the long-awaited leader
who would reunite the Eastern

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.150
and Western halves
of the Roman Empire.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.910
In response to such
French claims, however,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.870
the Spanish issued their own,

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.520
suggesting that Charles' crusading
professions amounted to not

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.140
and that his actions were
in fact counterproductive,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.570
insofar as the instability
they wrought

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.230
in Italy could invite a
second Turkish invasion.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.760
Several months after Charles'
triumphal entry into Naples,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.980
agents in the employ of the
Spanish crown issued a broadside

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.850
for circulation outside of Spain.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.230
It read in part, their
majesties Ferdinand

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.670
and Isabella wanted nothing
more than to undertake the holy

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.010
and just war against the
Muslim kings of Africa,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.340
and toward this end, they were
already making preparations

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.830
in Andalucia and in the ports along
the coast, and it is to be assumed

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.810
that their plans would have
succeeded due to the justice

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.500
of their cause and their holy
intentions, but as a result

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.880
of the machinations of the
devil, enemy of Christianity

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.040
and of the church,
the king of France

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.650
at that time took it upon himself
to invade and conquer the Kingdom

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.260 position:56%
of Naples without first adjudicating
his rights to the realm.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.550
And their highnesses, Ferdinand
and Isabella, feared that the war

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.510
of Naples would disrupt
the peace of the church

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.100
and that the Pope would be
grievously harmed by this.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.730
And that from this would
follow an infinite number

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.080
of misfortunes throughout
all Christendom,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.520
as indeed was later
shown to be the case.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.600
In effect, the document portrayed
the French invasion as an act

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.830
of aggression that distracted
from the universal goal of crusade

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.610
against the infidel that
Christian princes ought to share.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.550
In stark contrast to Charles'
triumphal entry into the city

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.240
of Naples as a crusading king,
the text depicted the French king

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.820
in his assertion of his
claim to Naples as an enemy

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.820
of Christendom and of the church.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.680 position:56%
The Spaniard's rhetoric implied that
Ferdinand and Isabella did not act

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.590
as did Charles VIII, they
were defenders of Christendom,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.980 position:56%
not violators of the pax Christiana.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.540
Ultimately, the Spanish monarchs
responded to the French conquest

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.380
of Naples by sending
a military force led

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.890
by the grand captain
Gonzalo Fern ndez de C-rdoba.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.770
After eight years of
intermittent warfare, Ferdinand

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.330
and Isabella finally
incorporated the Neapolitan kingdom

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.900
into the Spanish Crown
of Aragon in 1503.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.240
Aware of the charge that their
counter invasion could be viewed

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.700
as further destabilizing the
Italian peninsula, Ferdinand

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.350
and Isabella made several strategic
choices concerning the portrayal

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.970
of their military response.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.630
The Spanish monarchs and their
counselors could have argued

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.810
that they had a dynastic
obligation to intervene,

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.750
and that the armada was sent

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.620
to assist their cousin,
the Neapolitan king.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.720
Alternatively, in light of rumors

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.920
that the French king was
contemplating an invasion

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.250
of Aragonese Sicily, Ferdinand
could have cast a military response

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.390
as a defensive move to
protect his island kingdom.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.140
Ferdinand and Isabella and
their counselors however,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.690
chose not to employ
a dynastic discourse

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.870
to legitimate their policy.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.700
Instead, drawing on
a similar approach

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.030
to that they had employed 15
years earlier during the Ottoman

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.920
occupation of Otranto, they opted
to depict their military response

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.220
to the French invasion as
a defense of the church

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.060
and of Christendom at large.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.330
At a meeting of the Catalan
Parliament in December 1495,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.200
Ferdinand addressed the assembled
representatives on the matter

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.490
of the French conquest
of Naples in a bid

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.480
to convince the Catalans
to furnish troops.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.970
Ferdinand represented Charles'
actions as constituting an act

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.790
of war against the church

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.550
and as sowing division
throughout Christendom.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.930
As an exemplary Christian Prince,
Ferdinand had avoided declaring war

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.400
against France for as long
as possible, he claimed.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.250
But events had finally forced him
to form a league with the pope,

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:41.420
with the holy Roman Emperor, with
Venice, and with the Duke of Milan

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.720
"for the well-being and
peace of Christendom".

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.590 position:56%
Ferdinand stressed to his Catalan
subjects, and it's worth noting here

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.340
that the Catalans were
traditionally enemies of France.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.610
So in a sense, Ferdinand is
preaching to the choir here,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.380
he stressed that the alliance
that he had formed stood not

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.890
to the detriment of France, but
rather in defense of the church.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.870
Now several particularities
in the struggle for Naples,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.810
may have led the Spanish monarchs
to represent their actions

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.990
as undertaken solely in
defense of the church.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:13.390
In other words, to choose
the rhetorical strategy

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.430
that I've been analyzing here.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.620
I do not have time to go in
to all of them in detail here,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.000
but there are several
that are worth noting.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.570
First, the kingdom of Naples
was a thief of the papacy.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.730
Meaning that an invasion of Naples
could be construed as an act

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.060
of aggression against the pope.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.590
Second, and perhaps more
important, Italy's proximity

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.790
to Ottoman ruled lands
in the Balkan Peninsula

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.270
and the Eastern Mediterranean
served to increase the perception

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:43.000
of an Italy and a Christendom
under siege.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.380
As the diplomatic correspondence
examined thus far demonstrates,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.410
Ferdinand and his counselors
frequently elided the safety

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.980
and security of the
Italian peninsula with that

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.630
of the entirety of Christendom.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.430
The evidence presented here
suggests that the equation

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.400
between the security of Italy and
the security of the body politic

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.050
of Christendom was an intentional
strategy employed in order

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:09.530
to depict Ferdinand's interests and
actions in the Italian peninsula

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.620
as deriving from a devotion to
the defense of Christendom rather

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.950
than a desire to attain
dominion over any part of Italy.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.430
The dynastic dispute over Naples
between the houses of Valois

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:25.520
and Trastamara was transformed
into a referendum on the survival

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.770
of Christendom in the face of
the ascendant Ottoman Empire,

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.200
a fact reflected in the
rhetoric that the French

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.600
and Spanish sides deployed
throughout the conflict.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.070
Thus, what was at root
the continuation

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.900 position:56%
of a centuries-old dynastic struggle
took on the aspect of a holy war

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.610
for the defense of Christendom.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:48.070
The factors elucidated here,
particularly Naples' exposure

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.690 position:56%
to Ottoman attack, raised the stakes
of the Franco-Spanish struggle,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.970
and viewing it with
the aura of a crusade.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.740
The papacy's actions
contributed to this perception.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.970
In July 1496, in reversal of
his proffer of indulgences

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.570 position:56%
to French soldiers two years before,

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.750
Pope Alexander VI granted plenary
indulgences to those who died

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:13.730
in Naples fighting to defend the
church against the French invaders.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.970 position:56%
This perception of the war of Naples

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.840
as a holy war spread well beyond
the Iberian and Italian peninsulas.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.840
Soldiers from Germany and other
northern European lands ventured

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.290 position:56%
to Italy to fight, viewing their
military service as merely one facet

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.070
of a holy pilgrimage of sorts.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.410
This was an outgrowth
of a pattern established

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.780
over a decade earlier
during the war of Granada.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.200
And I'm referring here to the
decade-long war between 1482

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.650
and 1492 that led to the Castilian
conquest of the last Muslim polity

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.030
on the Iberian peninsula,
Nasrid Granada.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.170
Soldiers from northern Europe who
traveled to the Iberian peninsula

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.580
to fight for Castille in the war

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.470
against Muslim Granada frequently
combined their military service

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.770
with religious pilgrimage

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.040
to Santiago de Compostela
in northwestern Spain.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.300
And we know this because surviving
safe conduct passes issued

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.540
by Ferdinand and Isabella
attest to that fact,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.700 position:56%
being issued to Germans returning to
their homeland before and embarking

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.040
on a crusade, on a pilgrimage
to Santiago on their way.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.500
In light of the fact that
Granada was under Islamic rule,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.430
it is not surprising that these
Germans viewed their military

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.760 position:56%
service in southern Iberia and their
pilgrimage to Santiago as two parts

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.870 position:56%
of a whole, a religiously purifying
experience in the Iberian peninsula,

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:37.630
as the war of Granada was
depicted throughout Europe

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.030
as a crusade undertaken for
the whole of Christendom.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.350
The fact that precisely
the same practice developed

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.920
in the Italian wars comes as
a bit more of a surprise given

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.040
that the warring parties
were both Christian kingdoms.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.860
Surviving safe conduct passes that
Ferdinand issued to German soldiers

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.410
who had fought on the Spanish
side in Naples attest to the fact

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.180
that some of these northern
Europeans combined their military

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.270
service in Italy with
pilgrimage to Santiago,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.670
justice had been done during
the war against Nasrid Granada.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.910
The wars of Italy between France
and Spain and the war of Granada

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.510
in which Castille conquered the
last Islamic polity in Iberia,

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.110
were thus rendered
equivalent as holy endeavors

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.220 position:56%
that afforded opportunities for
spiritual salvation through holy war

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.960
and devotional pilgrimage.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.360
German perceptions of the religious
valence of warfare conducted

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.830
in the Italian Mezzogiorno
might be partially attributable

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.900
to political alliances.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.340
Since May of 1493, Spain had been
allied with the Holy Roman Empire

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.580
through a dual marriage alliance.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.130
The alliance was one component
of King Ferdinand's tactic

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:47.450
to encircle France by forming pacts
with all of France's neighbors.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.200
In light of the enmity between the
Emperor Maximilian and the monarchs

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.180
of France, it is likely that the
war in Naples was also portrayed

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.370
in German lands as a
religious obligation.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.970
The pilgrimage destination
of Santiago however,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.340
raises further questions.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.880
Medieval Castilians had developed
an association between Santiago

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.620
and wars against Muslims.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.600
An association that had led to
the transformation of the apostle

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.500
into a medieval Crusader,
Santiago Matamoros

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.620
or St. James the moor-slayer.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.760
And this is a 15th century
painting of Santiago here.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.070
This is from an altarpiece
in the Alcazar in Segovia.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.370 position:56%
And it might not be immediately
apparent here, but this is St. James

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.980
on his white horse, and what
you see underneath his feet,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.710
underneath his horse there
are the four severed heads

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.320
of Muslim enemies.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.510
So this represents really
extraordinary transformation

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.940
of the Christian apostle
into a medieval Crusader.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.670
In this association of Santiago
with war against enemies

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.550
of the faith may explain in part
the decision by German soldiers

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.000
to undertake the lengthy journey

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.220
from southern Italy
to Northwest Spain.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.950
Now we don't know exactly
how they got there.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.030
They could have been returning
by ship, going back to Germany

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.530
around the Iberian Peninsula
and up the West Coast France,

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.270
in which case Santiago would
not be too far out of the way.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.000
But they might have
been going overland.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.390
Nothing in the safe conducts
indicates what the route was.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.910
In any event, the German
soldiers choice

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.620
of pilgrimage destination
likely reflects the perception

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.390
that southern Italy formed a
frontier zone on the front lines

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.810
in a struggle against
the forces of Islam,

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.210
as embodied by the Ottoman Empire.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.130
In some sense, the Spanish crown's
choice of rhetoric through which

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.930
to portray the Italian wars
represented a transposition

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:44.360
of the confessional frontier from
southern Iberia to southern Italy.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.080
In both locales, the Spanish
crown claimed to act as a bulwark

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.050
against the Islamic world.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.350
Those who supported Spain

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.170
in the Italian wars often
represented the French as every bit

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.100
as much a threat to
Christendom as were the Turks.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.230
By 1511, the French crown of the
papacy were increasingly at odds.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.230
Open French hostility to the papacy
determined that Popes too came

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.410
to portray French involvement
in Italy as akin to

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.370
or worse than the Turkish threat.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.180
Following the battle
of Ravenna in 1512

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.740
in which a French army defeated
a joint Spanish papal force,

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.230
a papal Nuncio wrote a letter

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.040
to Pope Julius the second
detailing the carnage

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.280
and describing the actions of the
French victors as worse than those

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.270
of the Turks when they
conquered Constantinople.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.280
And I want to quote
from his letter here,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.430
"they have despoiled monasteries
and churches and have made off

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.080
with chalices and crucifixes,
throwing the Eucharist and relics

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.640
on the ground and stealing
the silver.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.990
Never did the Turks
commit such acts of cruelty

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:47.700
when they conquered
Constantinople and Negroponte".

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.260 position:56%
So in the portrayal of these
episodes of intra-Christian warfare,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:58.290 position:56%
we can see that the Turks are always
present even when they aren't.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.950
There was, however, another
factor that rendered the kingdom

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.960
of Naples particular and that
contributed to the representation

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.290
of the Franco-Spanish conflict
there in terms of a holy war.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.950
Since the 13th century, the
title to the Crusader Kingdom

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:15.790
of Jerusalem had been joined to
the title of the Kingdom of Naples.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:19.650
It is this fact that explains why,
in his triumphal entry into Naples

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.330
in February 1495, Charles VIII

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:26.040
of France wore a quadruple
crown representing Naples

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.670
as well as Jerusalem.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.570
From the moment that Ferdinand
incorporated Naples into the Crown

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.900
of Aragon in 1503, he included
Jerusalem among his lengthy list

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.680
of titles.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.290
What is more, the Aragonese
king gave every indication

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.140
that his imperial projects in Italy
and North Africa were intended

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.260
to lead to a Christian
recovery of the holy land.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.710
Following the Spanish conquest
of Tripoli in North Africa 1510,

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.270
King Ferdinand composed a letter

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.660
to Cardinal Francisco
Jimenez de Cisneros claiming

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.990
that the victory demonstrated
God's clemency.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.030
And that the path, or camino, was
being opened for the completion

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.630
of the holy enterprise,
a term that referred

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.230
to the recovery of Jerusalem.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.020
Ferdinand's use of the
term camino gives a sense

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.230
of the geographical crusading
strategy the King envisioned.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.450
The establishment of Spanish
control over the Maghreb,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.810 position:56%
which could then serve as a locus
through which to move Spanish forces

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.710
and supplies into the
eastern Mediterranean in order

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:31.340
to support a Spanish assault
on Mamluk-ruled Palestine.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.920
This strategy is discernible

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.760
in other diplomatic
correspondence relating

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.890
to the Spanish conquest of Tripoli.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.230
On September 8th 1510, [inaudible],
the master of the Knights

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.000
of St. John of Jerusalem
based at Rhodes,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.250
wrote to Ferdinand congratulating
him on recent Spanish victories

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.580
in the African cities
of Bougie and Tripoli.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.610
The Knights of St. John had
ordered solemn processions

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.820 position:56%
to mark the conquest of Tripoli, he
related, and he expressed confidence

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.980
that the Spanish would
soon reach Egypt

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.100
where [inaudible] military order
would join forces with them

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.290
to liberate the holy land.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.130
"May it please God that all
Christians following your Majesty's

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.470
example, take up arms
against the infidels

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.920
who have afflicted the
Christian nation for so long,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.360
and in their lands may we
raise the banner of the cross

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.180
and recover the holy land, a task
that will not be as difficult

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.770
as many ignorant people believe.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.270
May God Almighty carry out your
majesty's wishes and allow you

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:34.260
to proceed with and complete the
conquest of Africa as far as Egypt,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.430
where we hope to join forces with
your highness' army and serve God

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.930
in this worthy endeavor".

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.980
[inaudible] letter, while ascribing
great importance to the conquest

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.180
of Tripoli, places this
event into a broader strategy

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.580
with Spain's North
African possessions serving

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.850
as stepping stones toward Egypt.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.670
Aside [inaudible] intimates would
be employed as a forward base

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.390
for a Christian assault
on the holy land.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.960
Ferdinand claimed the right to
lead the conquest of Jerusalem due

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.980
to the fact that through
his acquisition of Naples,

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.770
the title to Jerusalem
now belonged to him.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:13.710
Although the territory of
the Kingdom of Jerusalem was

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:18.020
under the control of the Mamluks
of Egypt in the early 16th century,

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.270
Ferdinand's diplomatic
correspondence reveals the way

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.720
in which the possession of
this seemingly symbolic title

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.990
in fact played a critical
part in his articulation

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.690
of Spanish imperial interests in
lands ringing the Mediterranean.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.320
On February 28th 1510,
Ferdinand wrote to his ambassador

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.910
in Rome instructing him to
solicit from Pope Julius II a bull

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:46.000
that would grant Ferdinand the
right to the conquest of the lands

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.740
of the East, a vaguely
defined region stretching

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.200
from North Africa eastward
into Asia.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:57.130
And the Aragonese King wrote, I'm
quoting here, "and in the said bull

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.320
that you are to procure, I desire
that it grant, in general terms,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.050 position:56%
the lands from the eastern border of
the Kingdom of Tlemcen or beginning

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.200
from the Kingdoms of Bougie
and Algiers inclusive,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.040
all the lands from
there toward the east.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.040
Perhaps some might raise concerns
saying that in such generality,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.940
this grant could be understood
to include all of Greece and Asia

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.410
and to this I would respond that,
should God favor us with a conquest

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.250
of these territories, it
would not be unsuitable

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.350
that the apostolic sea
should grant us these lands.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.230
Although it is not necessary
to express it in these terms,

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.480
but rather state your case
according to the generalities

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.670
that I've outlined here".

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.720
Now this is an absolutely
extraordinary request, I mean,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:43.620
incredibly audacious, but it's to
be understood, to be interpreted

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.970
as being part of a series of
papal bulls of donation that had,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.460
going back over the
previous two decades.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.000
And if you think back to 1493
for instance, there's a series

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.110
of five papal bulls that are
issued by Alexander VI that serve

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.580
to grant lands newly discovered in
the Atlantic world, the Americas,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.090
to Spain and then to delimit
boundaries for prospective spheres

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.130
of expansion between Spain
and Portugal in the Atlantic.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.120
A couple years after that in 1495,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.410
Alexander VI issues another
bull donating Africa to Spain.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.540
This is Mediterranean
Africa, it's to be understood

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.040
as being a relatively small
geographical area compared

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.280
to our modern understanding
of Africa,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.470
but still all of Mediterranean
Africa from Morocco all the way

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.830
over to the Nile, to Spain.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:39.370
So what Ferdinand is asking
for here is of a piece

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.400
with those earlier papal donations.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.850
He's asking for a similar
kind of papal donation

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.710
of the lands of the East.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.550
But he emphasized that although
he desired the recognition

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.760
of this right from the papacy, the
right to conduct these conquests

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.800
of the East, that it
was a mere formality.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.870
Citing the Italian jurist, Bartolus
of Saxoferrato, Ferdinand claimed

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.630
that his status as king
of Jerusalem entitled him

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:06.350
to conduct conquests not
only in the holy land proper,

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.120
but more generally
throughout Greece and Anatolia

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:14.040
and in any other lands
ruled by the Turks.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.970
Indeed, Ferdinand expanded
his argument further stating

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.710
that as King of Jerusalem,
he was aggrieved not only

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:25.130
by the infidels occupying the holy
land, but by all other infidels.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.730
This, he claimed, rendered
any military action he took

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.480
against non-Christians a just war.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.670
Now we see here in Ferdinand's
letter the articulation

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:38.580 position:56%
of a doctrine justifying any acts of
aggression that he might instigate

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.130
in non-Christian lands
ringing the Mediterranean.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.150
A right that Ferdinand arrogates
to himself on the grounds

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.220
that he is the titular
king of Jerusalem.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.290
And while Ferdinand's letter does
instruct his ambassador to solicit

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:53.030
from the Pope the recognition
of this right,

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.400
it is a right that Ferdinand
claims on dynastic grounds as King

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.240
of Jerusalem, rather than as
deriving from the Pope's authority

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.780
as dominos munde [phonetic]
as Lord of the world.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.010
So, what does all this mean?

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.010 position:56%
I think there are several
significant points that can be drawn

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.430
from the material that
I've presented here.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.860
First, the rhetoric that Spaniards
employed to describe their response

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.750
to the Ottoman invasion of
Italy in 1480 cast this event

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.590
as an existential threat
for all of Christendom.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:27.590
This proved to be so effective
and so seductively powerful

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.970
that 15 years later, Spaniards
used exactly the same discourse

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.640
to portray the French
invasion of Italy.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.840
The use of this religio-political
vocabulary by Spaniards

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.900
against a fellow Catholic power
productively complicates our sense

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.340
of how religious discourses
were accessed and deployed

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.080
in the early modern Mediterranean.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.630
While the grounds upon which
this rhetoric were deployed here

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.940
ostensibly, this is ostensibly
against the external threat posed

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.360
by the expansionist Ottoman
Empire, the religious discourse

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.140
that permeates the
documents I've drawn

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.090
on was directed primarily toward
an internal threat as embodied

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.420
by the kingdom of France.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.350
In other words, what
I'm suggesting here is

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.710
that while this is a discourse
that is predicated on this notion

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.690
of there being a sharp division
between Christendom and Islam,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.610
in fact this is the kind of
rhetoric or political vocabulary

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.400
which is just as often directed
towards a fellow Catholic power.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.470
So I think we should
rethink our conception

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:27.010
of the Mediterranean being
bifurcated into Islamic

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.640
and Christian halves
during this century.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.670 position:56%
Second, these means of asserting
sovereignty through the claim to act

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:36.200
as defender of the church
developed in the context

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.580
of Mediterranean conflicts, but
were also deployed in other arenas

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.450
of modern, of early
modern imperial expansion.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.770
Namely, Spanish claims
to the Americas.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.720
The legal doctrines justifying war

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.080
against non-Christian
peoples were being worked

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.160
out in the Mediterranean
basin in this crucible

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.190
in which the Ottoman
Empire loomed large

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.140
in the European imaginary
and consciousness.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.660
These doctrines were then adapted
and applied in a somewhat messy

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.650
or awkward fashion to
the entirely novel set

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:08.770
of circumstances the Spanish
encountered in the Americas.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.490
The American angle of
this story has been told.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.390
During my time here at the Kluge
Center, I've worked to shed light

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:17.180
on the Mediterranean
counterpart and to demonstrate

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.820
that these two processes
were intimately linked

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.010
and informed one another
in the development

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.200
of early modern Spanish
political thought

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.310
on conquest, just war, and empire.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.580
Finally, I would like to
conclude with a brief comparison

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:35.290
to a conflict that the eastern and
to the Mediterranean that was more

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:38.380
or less contemporary to the
events I've examined here.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.990
During the Ottoman-Mamluk
struggle for control over Egypt

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:46.450
and the holy cities of
the Levant and Hijaz,

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.710
the Ottoman ruler Selim I employed
a discourse of legitimation

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:53.420
that would've been completely
intelligible to the counselors

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.750
at Ferdinand of Aragon's court.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.890
Scholars of the Ottoman Empire,
including Jamal [inaudible],

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:04.430
[inaudible], and Giancarlo Casale
have noted that during a period

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.790
of rapid expansion, and at times
contested political legitimacy,

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.940
Selim cast himself as a guardian
of religious orthodoxy as a means

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.710
of cementing his authority within
the Islamic world, particularly,

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:21.230
vis-a-vis the ascendant Shia
Safavid empire in Persia.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:25.860 position:56%
Following the Ottoman conquest of
Jerusalem, Medina, and Mecca in 1516

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.230
and 1517, Selim participated in
a triumphal entry into Cairo,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.160
the former Mamluk capital.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.390
In which he proclaimed himself
servant of the two cities,

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.940
Medina and Mecca, and
assumed the title of caliph,

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.940
claiming sovereignty over
all Muslims in an expression

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.050
of sovereignty that Giancarlo
Casale has termed extraterritorial,

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:48.630
meaning that this does not apply

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.900
to a precisely defined
geographical space.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.200
While Spanish monarchs never
asserted claims of sovereignty

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.220
over the Res publica
christiana quite as far-reaching

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.650
as Selim's proclamation, the
similarities between the means

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:06.950
of claiming political legitimacy
through defense of the faithful

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.810
by rulers of the two ascendant
empires at opposite ends

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.490
of the Mediterranean
points to commonalities

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.790
in the way both empires
represented their mission according

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:20.050 position:56%
to a complexly negotiated engagement
with the accreted legacies

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.240
of the Mediterranean world,
including the imperial legacy

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.520
of ancient Rome, as well as
the universalist doctrines

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.100
of both Christianity and Islam.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.900
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.890
And I'm eager to take questions.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.840
So any suggestions, comments,
questions, advice is more

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.470
than welcome, and I understand

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.760
that today we do not
have a roving microphone,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.520
so when you address your
question, I will just repeat it

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.630
or give a brief synopsis of the
question into the microphone

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:03.530
so that it does get
picked up for the podcast.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:04.830
Mike.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:10.320
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you
could talk about the continuity

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:20.070 position:56%
of this discourse that you're
describing [inaudible] being applied

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:30.350
in this, you know, 15th,

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.900
16th century context
[inaudible] much older.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:44.440
And I wondered what was new
about what the Spanish were doing

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:51.130
or if anything was knew about
what the Spanish were doing

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.800
with regards to this.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.040
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux: Just to
give a brief synopsis of that,

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:01.390
Michael Sizer asked about the
continuity of this discourse.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.210
The language that I'm citing
here seems to bear a great deal

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:07.860
of continuity going back
centuries before the time period

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.160
that I'm looking at.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.280
So what is new about the
deployment of the discourse

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.220
in the particular context
that I'm looking at.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:23.930
I think it's an outstanding
question, it's something

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:29.000
that I've wrestled with actually
because it is the sort of discourse

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.810
that you can actually
trace back to Augustine.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.040
I mean, it goes back centuries.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.820
And prior to the period that
I'm looking at, it's been used

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.880
by French monarchs, by
holy Roman emperors,

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.980
and by popes going
back hundreds of years.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.510
But I think that what's
distinct about it here is

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.040
that the Mediterranean world has
become a very different place

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.630
post 1453.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.580
I think the Ottoman Empire
really does change the calculus

00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:59.890
and it changes the
particular resonance

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.530
that this kind of vocabulary
carries.

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:07.170
And it's also unique because
it's being used by Spain in a way

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.220
that I think is actually
an attempt to carve

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.820
out a new political
space in a sense.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.480 position:56%
I think that, you know, the
Spanish monarchs do not have a claim

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.860
to the imperial title,
the Holy Roman Empire,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.970
but what they are trying
to do is they are trying

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.190
to claim a responsibility
as guardians

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.990
of the Res publica christiana.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:38.180
At this moment when the Ottoman
Empire seems to be unstoppable

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:48.130
in the Eastern Mediterranean
and no one appears capable

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.840 position:56%
of checking their progress, here
are Ferdinand and Isabella were able

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.700
to conquer Granada and then to move
into North Africa all in defense

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.000
of the Christian Commonwealth.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.300
And so I think that what they're
doing there is they're to trying

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.780
to sort of assume a mantle, an
imperial mantle in a way that sort

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.080
of gives them a quasi
imperial status

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.380
without actually having a
claim to the imperial title.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.680
So I don't know if that
answers your question,

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.090
but I think that I'm trying to
get some of the context here

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.390
that makes this quite particular.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:03.690
Will.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:04.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; First, I just want to say that I
think, I don't think I've ever heard

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.290
such a clear explanation
of the complex

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:07.590
and intricate diplomatic
[inaudible],

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:08.890
it was just so clearly
explained, I really appreciate it.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.190 position:56%
Following up on that, I wanted to
ask about if you have a kind of view

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.490
of what your discourse is just
kind of being instrumentalized

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:12.790
for these political and
imperial ends [inaudible].

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.590
So in other words, is it,
you know, to what extent.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:31.600
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.900
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux:
Thank you very much.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.710
The question is whether this
discourse is being deployed

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:38.270
in a purely instrumentalist
way, so in other words,

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.730
this is a convenient way to make
an argument against the French

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.780
for instance, or for the French
to make a similar argument

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:47.020
against the Spanish, or whether
there is something more sincere

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.320
operating here as well.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.600
And again, I think it's an
excellent question and something

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.130
that I've wrestled with, I don't
think that it's answerable.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.270
Because I think that in a
sense, that entails something

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.240
of a psychological understanding of
these actors that we can't perform.

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.670
There's no way for us to get inside
the minds of Ferdinand or Julius II

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.290
or King Charles of
France and try to discern

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:13.180
to what extent this is
being sincerely deployed.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:20.460
But I think that what I'm, what
compels me here is not the question

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.840 position:56%
of to what extent this is just being
instrumentalized, but rather the way

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.050
in which this vocabulary
is operating.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.860
Because I think that it's important
to note that they have choices,

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.270
they have rhetorical choices here.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.310 position:56%
You know, the Spanish, for instance,
could represent their engagement

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.100
in the Italian peninsula or
their engagement in North Africa

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.610
for instance, through
a dynastic discourse.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.950
And actually what's sort of
striking about all of this,

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.770
and this is in a separate
chapter of the book manuscript,

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.000
they actually articulate
their claims in Africa

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.770
in a more dynastic discourse
than they do in Italy,

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:57.360
which is fascinating
because it is Islamic.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.810
And, but I think that they
make a deliberate choice here

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.160
to use this kind of discourse,

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.710
this Christian universalist
discourse, because it does work.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.430
Whether or not, I mean any
discourse has the capacity

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:14.420 position:56%
to be used cynically by any actor
deploying discourse for any purpose.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.420
But I think that whether or not
Ferdinand believes it or whether

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.420
or not Julius believes it, what's
interesting about the choice

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.660
to use this kind of discourse
is that the decision to do

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.610
so represents the assumption
among all

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:30.720
of these different parties involved
that this will be effective.

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.070
That this can gain
traction and can operate

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.070
within the political
sphere of that time.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:40.170
So I think in order for it to
have the potential to do that,

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:46.840
somebody at least, if not
Ferdinand, is buying into it.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.340
Yes Juan.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.610
&gt;&gt; Really excellent, thank
you so much for this talk.

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.560
My question has to do with
the action of deployment

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.940
of Spanish [inaudible]
in the face of all

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.800
of this religious universalist
rhetoric.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:11.370
In the Persian Gulf where they were
not embarrassed at all to align

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.230
with those Persian
shiites [inaudible].

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:19.110 position:56%
And do you find any evidence that
they theorize this real [inaudible].

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:27.980
Do they ever talk about, you
know, other than sticking it

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:37.030
to the Ottomans, any theoretical
justification to that alliance?

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:38.330
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux: Yeah.

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.630
This is a wonderful question
that Juan Cole has asked here

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.810
about the slightly later decision
on the part of the Spanish

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:46.230
under Charles V to forge an
alliance with Safavid Persia,

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:49.720
Safavid Iran against the Ottomans.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.770
And this is wonderful
actually because, you know,

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.600
what gets all the press here is the
impious alliance between Francis

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.540
of France and Suleiman
the Magnificent.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.420
And what gets a whole lot less
press is the fact that Charles V,

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:05.510
as the holy Roman Emperor and
successor to King Ferdinand

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.840
in Spain, forges a very similar
kind of alliance with the Safavids.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.900
Now the rationale that's
used there is that,

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.330
the Ottomans are the graver
danger to the Christian republic

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.220 position:56%
and so therefore, this is justified.

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.990
There's also this really wonderful
strain of humanist scholarship

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:25.910 position:56%
about the Safavids viewing them as
being in some way sort of, you know,

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:29.860
quasi Christians who inhabit the
East who might be potentially,

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.150
you know, good allies
against the Ottoman Empire.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:37.800
And so all of this is sort
of a Latin Christian way

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.540
to understand the Shia

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.620
and to rationalize forging
alliances with them.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.350
Margaret [inaudible] had
done wonderful work there

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:48.100
on the [inaudible], she
has a terrific article

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.410
that addresses that.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:54.260
So it is sort of rationalized,
but in realpolitik terms,

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:57.720
the Ottomans are closer and
they pose a graver danger.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.200
Yes.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.500
&gt;&gt; [inaudible speaker]

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:12.810
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux: They, the
Spanish actually supply munitions

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:24.120
to the Mamluks against the Ottomans

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.880
and there's actually a Mamluk
victory over the Ottomans I believe

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.470
in 1508, and the Spanish celebrate

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:34.010
as if it was their own
victory back in Spain.

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:38.430
And, you know, to, again, I
think that this discourse,

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.730
to go back to an earlier question,

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:41.470
I think that this discourse
does have the potential

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:45.060
to be interpreted sincerely
on the part of people

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.730
who are operating within
this sphere.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:53.080
But just to get back to this the
pragmatism or the realpolitik card,

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.720
in a lot of Ferdinand's conquests
of North African Presidios,

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.610
he actually forged
capitulation treaties

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:04.500
with the local Muslim inhabitants
that allowed them to remain or,

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:09.330
if not remain in the city itself,
be subject vassal populations

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.000
on the outskirts of the city.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.720
So in other words, the policies
against the Muslims being enacted

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.720
in Spanish-North Africa
were not nearly as harsh

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.260
as the policies being enacted in
Iberia proper against the Muslims.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.110
So this complicates
our understanding

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.970
of all this, it's pretty messy.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:31.230
Danielle.

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:39.970
&gt;&gt; [inaudible speaker]

00:56:39.970 --> 00:57:01.290
&gt;&gt; Andrew Devereux: There are,
Danielle's question has to do

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:15.040 position:56%
with with visual culture and whether

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:22.230
or not there are visual
representations of these ideals

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.020
of Christian peace or
Christian universalism.

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:29.300
Just to clarify, the image of
Santiago there, those are the heads

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.920
of Muslims who have
been killed in battle.

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.910
And so this notion of a Christian
universal peace is a peace

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:40.370
that includes Christians and
Christians alone, and it has,

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:43.500 position:56%
there's no, I mean, in the minds of
these people living in the late 15th

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.980
and early 16th century, that is
completely reconcilable with acts

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.810 position:56%
of war against enemies of the faith.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:54.920
There is wonderful sculpture in
southern Italy that gets produced

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.450
around this time, 1509 and
in the years just after that,

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:06.000
representing Ferdinand in marble
in the capacity of being a defender

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.730
of Christendom against the Turk.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:11.510 position:56%
And, you know, in Italy I think that
the discourse is really much more

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.130
about the Turks because
they're closer to the Turks.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:17.680 position:56%
Whereas in Iberia proper, the
discourse is much more about Muslims

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.540
in North Africa and
there's a distinction drawn

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.510
between these different
types of Muslims.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:26.820
The Turks are recent
arrivals relatively speaking

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.120
in Mediterranean.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.870
But at any rate, yeah, in Italy,

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:32.530
the way that this is
represented visually is

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:36.970
as Ferdinand protecting Italy
from the Turkish expansion.

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:41.730
And in Iberia proper, again, there
is wonderful imagery of this.

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.430
Ferdinand actually participates
in a number of triumphal entries

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:48.490
into Iberian cities, into
Valladolid, into Seville,

00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:51.550
and there's been some really good
work done analyzing the kinds

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:56.140 position:56%
of visual representations that are
deployed in those triumphal entries.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.820
They have these manufactured
archways

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.230
that are temporary archways.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.250 position:56%
They don't survive, they're made of
cardboard, something like cardboard,

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:05.960
and there would be 12 Roman
archways, for instance,

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.410
used in one of these entries, and
they're adorned and ornamented

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.760
with all kinds of imagery
representing cardinal virtues,

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:18.410
biblical and Spanish heroes,
and so on and so forth,

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:23.370
and trying to equate the ruling
monarch with some of those heroes.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:24.800
Thank you.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.610
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I think
we'll have to stop it there.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:30.040
But Andrew can stick
around for a few minutes

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.510
to take additional questions,
so please join me in thanking.

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:48.080
[ Applause ]

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.380
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Like
I said, Andrew can stick

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.260
around for a few minutes to
take additional questions.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.360
For the Kluge Center, we are not
back here again for a program

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.060
until the middle of July actually.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.180
July 14th, Bastille
Day, we have a lecture

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.360
by Michael Sizer [assumed spelling]
about populist politics in Paris.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.580
And then towards the end of July,
we have three additional lectures

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.450
by Kluge fellows and residents,
so please do sign our list

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.690
to stay informed about those.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.710
And thank so much [inaudible]
and thank you to Andrew

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:18.690
for a brilliant talk [applause].

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.330
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library Of Congress.
