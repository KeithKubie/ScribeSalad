new technology and what would it be to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
new technology and what would it be to
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.590
new technology and what would it be to
be true to this new relatively unknown

be true to this new relatively unknown
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.470
be true to this new relatively unknown
territory of virtual reality maybe you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
territory of virtual reality maybe you
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.840
territory of virtual reality maybe you
can tell us a little bit about your new

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850
can tell us a little bit about your new
 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.310
can tell us a little bit about your new
experiment after our previous speaker

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
experiment after our previous speaker
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.400

it's hard to reflect on the relative

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410
it's hard to reflect on the relative
 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.090
it's hard to reflect on the relative
frivolous frivolity of such questions

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
frivolous frivolity of such questions
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.690
frivolous frivolity of such questions
however they do all go to the same

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700
however they do all go to the same
 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.270
however they do all go to the same
fundamental questions about how we

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
fundamental questions about how we
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.780
fundamental questions about how we
perceive our world the virtual virtual

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
perceive our world the virtual virtual
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.590
perceive our world the virtual virtual
reality is rather interesting at one

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
reality is rather interesting at one
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.760
reality is rather interesting at one
level virtual we can do we have a sense

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
level virtual we can do we have a sense
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.609
level virtual we can do we have a sense
of what that might means reality is more

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
of what that might means reality is more
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.789
of what that might means reality is more
complicated so working with new

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
complicated so working with new
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.380
complicated so working with new
technology throws one immediately into

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
technology throws one immediately into
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.550
technology throws one immediately into
this question what I've discovered is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
this question what I've discovered is
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.480
this question what I've discovered is
that it's sophisticated but not

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
that it's sophisticated but not
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.039
that it's sophisticated but not
sophisticated enough that to make

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
sophisticated enough that to make
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469
sophisticated enough that to make
reality it's full of such immense

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
reality it's full of such immense
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.130
reality it's full of such immense
subtlety that one has struggles to hold

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
subtlety that one has struggles to hold
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:58.910
subtlety that one has struggles to hold
it's its myriad forms let's say we can

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
it's its myriad forms let's say we can
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
it's its myriad forms let's say we can
all get a glimpse of the piece outside I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
all get a glimpse of the piece outside I
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.700
all get a glimpse of the piece outside I
did already

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
did already
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560
did already
yeah maybe you can just tell us what it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
yeah maybe you can just tell us what it
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.770
yeah maybe you can just tell us what it
is journey well yeah so we started a god

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
is journey well yeah so we started a god
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.440
is journey well yeah so we started a god
of a kind and then of course things have

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
of a kind and then of course things have
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.420
of a kind and then of course things have
things like this this image here

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
things like this this image here
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.899
things like this this image here
and one kind of falls through one of the

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909
and one kind of falls through one of the
 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.670
and one kind of falls through one of the
things I've discovered about this medium

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
things I've discovered about this medium
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.199
things I've discovered about this medium
is that it's very good at vertigo so the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
is that it's very good at vertigo so the
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.140
is that it's very good at vertigo so the
propensity to fall is is immense and of

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
propensity to fall is is immense and of
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.960
propensity to fall is is immense and of
course the vertiginous and the sublime

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
course the vertiginous and the sublime
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.259
course the vertiginous and the sublime
are very close to each other this idea

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269
are very close to each other this idea
 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.949
are very close to each other this idea
of a poetic kind of falling in

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
of a poetic kind of falling in
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.940
of a poetic kind of falling in
especially when its darkness

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
especially when its darkness
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.220
especially when its darkness
I think our previous speaker was

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
I think our previous speaker was
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.610
I think our previous speaker was
speaking about a certain kind of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
speaking about a certain kind of
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.740
speaking about a certain kind of
darkness and it's that darkness that I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
darkness and it's that darkness that I
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.530
darkness and it's that darkness that I
think I'm after this sense that whatever

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
think I'm after this sense that whatever
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.470
think I'm after this sense that whatever
rational apparently rational we can

rational apparently rational we can
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.740
rational apparently rational we can
bring to to our understanding of things

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750
bring to to our understanding of things

we are always struggling with ghosts so

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
we are always struggling with ghosts so
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.140
we are always struggling with ghosts so
to describe the piece again you you the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150
to describe the piece again you you the
 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.240
to describe the piece again you you the
world shatters in whatever way and then

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
world shatters in whatever way and then
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.860
world shatters in whatever way and then
you fall into a vertigo that is purports

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870
you fall into a vertigo that is purports
 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.900
you fall into a vertigo that is purports
to be the inside of your body so it's a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
to be the inside of your body so it's a
 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.020
to be the inside of your body so it's a
kind of inversion of the self falling

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
kind of inversion of the self falling
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.250
kind of inversion of the self falling
into yourself and then it goes you'll

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
into yourself and then it goes you'll
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.830
into yourself and then it goes you'll
see you can't help in in in in virtual

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
see you can't help in in in in virtual
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.199
see you can't help in in in in virtual
processes you can't help but have a

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209
processes you can't help but have a
 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.690
processes you can't help but have a
narrative sequence but it's not really

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700
narrative sequence but it's not really
 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.670
narrative sequence but it's not really
like a feel no it's more like a space

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
like a feel no it's more like a space
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.430
like a feel no it's more like a space
well that's the difficulty is how to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
well that's the difficulty is how to
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.500
well that's the difficulty is how to
avoid it being like a film because film

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510
avoid it being like a film because film
 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.059
avoid it being like a film because film
word has explored some of these

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069
word has explored some of these
 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.990
word has explored some of these
questions but how to you know have it be

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000
questions but how to you know have it be
 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.430
questions but how to you know have it be

yeah and there's a dialogue between the
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.339
yeah and there's a dialogue between the
arts and science and I'm so pleased that

you're here because you materialize that
dialogue right now there's also a

dialogue between artistic possibilities
 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.089
dialogue between artistic possibilities
and new technologies and it's no

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099
and new technologies and it's no
 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.430

architects were 15 years ago at the
 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.249
architects were 15 years ago at the
beginning of a process of manipulating

architects could manipulate form

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409
architects could manipulate form

so that in fact you can make all kinds

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479
so that in fact you can make all kinds

so that in fact you can make all kinds
of virtual real form now it's buildable
