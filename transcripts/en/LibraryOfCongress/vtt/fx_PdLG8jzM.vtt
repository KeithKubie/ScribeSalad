&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.300 position:66%
&gt;&gt; She is joined by Dr. Michael J. Berson,
a professor of social science education

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.560
at the University of South
Florida and a senior fellow

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.510 position:69%
in the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.540 position:66%
He instructs courses in technology and
social studies, elementary social studies,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.420 position:59%
visual research methods in
education, and teaching the Holocaust.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.650 position:58%
Michael has extensively published
and presented his research worldwide.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.260 position:70%
His research on child advocacy and technology

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.750
in social studies education has
achieved global recognition.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.920 position:72%
They'll be joined by Barb Kirby who has worked

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.940
in higher education administration
for over 20 years.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.940 position:75%
She was named Director of the Waynesburg
University Teaching with Primary Sources program

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.780 position:67%
in 2004 and the TPS Eastern Region in 2007.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.400 position:58%
Combined, these programs have reached
thousands of teachers both directly

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.000
and through the network of
110 regional projects.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.130
And Sue Wise also of the Teaching
with Primary Sources program

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.510 position:64%
at Waynesburg University is the Assistant
Director there since August of 2005.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.540 position:73%
She was promoted to Associate Director in 2007.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.680 position:72%
Prior to joining TPS, she taught kindergarten.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.700
Sue also teaches all undergraduate
social studies methods courses

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.730
for Waynesburg University.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.890
So, I am going to mute myself
and drop out and turn this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890 position:73%
over to the presenters you've all come to hear.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.890
Thank you so much.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.870
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Cheryl.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.050
Greetings from Waynesburg.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.000
And welcome to the Young Learners
Explore Library of Congress Images.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.990 position:70%
This is Barbara Kirby and, as Cheryl was kind
enough to introduce me, I'm the Coordinator

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.260 position:59%
of the TPS Eastern Region and Director
of the TPS program at Waynesburg.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.380
And, again, I'm pleased to be
joined by my colleague Sue Wise.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.870 position:64%
And today we're going to share with you
the work of our regional partners who are

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.670 position:56%
on the leading edge of using primary
sources with very young learners.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.000
We think you for joining us.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.000 position:75%
We could go ahead just to -- another two slides.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.810 position:64%
OK. To get started, please use the chat
feature to let us know who's on the line.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.050 position:70%
We're very interested in knowing where you're
from and what age children that you teach.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.950 position:56%
I see K-2 in Virginia from Margaret.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.280
K-5 in Lafayette, Louisiana.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.140 position:58%
We have an administrator on the line.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.000
Thanks for joining us.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.890
Seven through 12 in Westchester.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.860
Kindergarten in Jefferson, PA,
which is right down the road here.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.080
Thanks. Please keep these comments
coming throughout the session

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.000
and include your questions too.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.590 position:63%
Early childhood education is defined
differently depending on where you live.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.420 position:58%
Here in Pennsylvania, early childhood
ranges from birth to grade four.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.260 position:70%
In the project Sue's going to present in just
a few minutes, from Cabell County schools

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.100 position:56%
in West Virginia, early childhood
is defined as birth to kindergarten.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.370 position:75%
And, in Florida, where our early childhood
experts, doctors Ilene and Michael Berson teach,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.270 position:64%
early childhood is birth to 3rd grade,
which happens to align with the national,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.430 position:70%
international definitions of early childhood.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.000 position:59%
What does early childhood mean to you?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.930
I see birth to five.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.940
We'll get a range here I'm sure.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.960 position:73%
Our objectives for this session are all focused
on early childhood and primary grade students.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.140 position:73%
For this session, we will examine the selection
of developmentally appropriate primary sources,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.600 position:69%
explore evidence based strategies to support
student's critical inquiry with images,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.000 position:59%
and reflect on actual classroom based
examples demonstrating implementation.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.430 position:58%
I am pleased to -- or turn the mic
over now to Ilene and Michael Berson.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.840 position:67%
We've been working with them for a couple
of years now and always learn something new

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.210
from Dr. Ilene and Michael Berson.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.640
So, I'll turn it over.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.630
Thank you.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Barb.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.020
And it's our pleasure to
join you here this evening.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.430 position:72%
One of the things that we want to kind of give
a bit more context to this idea of working

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.590
with young children in the
use of primary sources.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.020 position:69%
When we're really looking at young children,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.600 position:67%
we recognize that young children already
have great familiarity with gaining meaning

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.000 position:59%
about the real world through pictures.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.260 position:67%
In fact, even toddlers have been shown that
they can transfer novel information taken

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.710 position:56%
from realistic images and apply that
to their emerging world knowledge.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.570 position:66%
So, one of the things we've been exploring

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.630 position:69%
in our own research is how historical images
can provide a conduit for young children

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:20.130 position:73%
to use their real world experiences and prior
knowledge and then learn how to make inferences

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.800 position:56%
about time and place and expand
their understanding of key concepts.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.480 position:72%
So, we are working with teachers on how they
can build upon this pictorial competence young

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.280 position:72%
children already have as it gradually
develops over time throughout the early years.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.830
But the issue that we need
to face is that teachers need

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.670 position:63%
to intentionally expand upon young
children's access to informational text.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.160
And this, unfortunately,
tends to be marginalized

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.130 position:56%
in most early learning environments.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.430 position:67%
In fact, research shows that in the typical
first grade classroom, children spend less

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.120
than three minutes a day
with informational texts.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.410
So, our first point of access
is how we can bring

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.260 position:69%
into the classroom these valuable resources.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.450
We know that within our early
childhood classrooms

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:24.460
that there already is a privileged
positions of text based literacies.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.860
Literacy forms the core of most
early childhood curriculum.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:36.630 position:64%
And, although text does occupy this
privileged position in classrooms, we do,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.050
as we've already said, see
that visual representations

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.710 position:69%
of knowledge are a key role for early years.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.450 position:66%
And so we're looking at how we can draw on
developmentally appropriate accommodations

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.140
to bring in visual images
as part of communication.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.780 position:69%
In fact, teachers already do this inherently
and naturally as part of their practices.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.940 position:75%
We often times will scaffold children's
learning experiences or encourage them to engage

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.260 position:61%
in multimodal expressions with pictures
or accompany their written words

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.570
and verbal responses with drawings.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.260 position:63%
Unfortunately, though, many of us are --

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:24.740 position:72%
have to negotiate our way with curriculum
that often situates these images as incidental

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.250 position:64%
and we don't fully appreciate necessarily
the intellectual sophistication

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:37.820 position:72%
that these images provide that does even rival
text based literacies for young learners.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.280 position:61%
So, here, in this image here, we have
depicted a reading lesson taking place.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.370 position:73%
A very familiar, sort of iconic representation.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.180
And we know, although we've
already said, the inherent value

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.890
that primary sources can have
as an instructional resources.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:05.390 position:64%
Most early childhood and early elementary
teachers have not had formal preparation

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.580 position:61%
or professional development that guides
them in how to bring these resources

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.160 position:70%
into their classrooms and work with young
learners in ways that would be able to access

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360 position:56%
and engage their funds of knowledge.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.130 position:63%
Moreover, because we've had such limited
research up to this point in time

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:29.880 position:64%
on the integration of primary sources and
the early grades, a lot of the research

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.020 position:72%
that people have had to rely on have really be
situated more for how to use this instruction

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.950
with students and intermediate
grades and higher.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.070 position:72%
And we cannot just take those prophecies meant

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.950
for older learners and extrapolate
them downward.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.530 position:64%
Young children have their own unique ways
of knowing and wisdom about the world.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:58.050 position:66%
And so we want to be able to connect into
those valuable ways that they think about.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:04.360 position:72%
Even though we've had these challenges, we
also do have an opportunity and an entry point

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:11.020 position:75%
because most states throughout the United States
have standards that require the introduction

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.100
and use of primary sources
beginning as early as kindergarten.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.370
And so that's our entry point for
us to be able to look for ways

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.090 position:63%
that we can bring them into our classes.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.370 position:59%
So, what do we mean by developmentally
appropriate practice?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.640 position:64%
Well, what we're talking about there is
the ways that we can connect specifically

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.210
with young learners ways of making
sense and meaning of the world.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:45.560 position:69%
We recognize, as this young child is showing
us here, that curiosity ignites discovery.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.100 position:73%
When we unveil a sort of a -- begin asking
brilliant amazing sort of questions of interest

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.620 position:73%
about things that we see in front of us, that
-- and these initiates our process of discovery

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.470 position:58%
and inquiry that young learners
actually have an inherent skill with.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.650 position:61%
In fact, they're very skilled at asking
us the most embarrassing questions

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.050
at the least opportune time.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:13.040 position:58%
But we also recognize that this
process of seeing, of what's in front

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.820 position:61%
of you comes well before even the words
and the vocabulary have developed.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.840 position:63%
Children look and they recognize before
they even have the capability of speech.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:30.250
And so because this visual
literacy precedes verbal fluency,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.860 position:58%
this is a very important foundation
for early reading and writing skills.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.870 position:66%
But in order for those visual images to
maximize student learning and achievement,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.180
teachers need to include techniques
for teaching children visually.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:53.710 position:70%
So, this involves an intentional exploration
of images as part of this pedagogy in schools

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.010 position:61%
that we move students from what we
refer to as sort of an arbitrary seeing

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.460 position:61%
where there's not a lot of sense making
or exploration or deep consideration

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.230
about what's there to moving them
more to a deliberate looking.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:14.050 position:67%
And that deliberate looking begins to
problematize images as we construct meaning

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:19.910
of information that's depicted
in visual data in front of us.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.210
So, we're going to share
with you lessons learned

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.870
from actual implementation
that's been done in classrooms

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.180 position:59%
from preschool up through grade three.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:38.140 position:70%
And these are the field based lessons that we
have learned from our teachers and children

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.040
with whom we've worked that have
informed our body of research.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.420 position:66%
So, one of the things that we recognize
is that teachers initially face challenges

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:56.370 position:58%
when they are searching for
developmentally appropriate resources

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.800
to introduce to young students.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.230 position:70%
So, one of the things that happens is that in
order for a primary source to be meaningful,

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.630 position:64%
we recognize that our young learners need
to be able to engage with it personally.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.150
So, there has to be something
about it that has some familiarity.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.990 position:58%
And it's on that personal connection,
that relevance and familiarity,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.500
on which they can find initial
pleasure in looking at it,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:30.590 position:64%
feel interest in what they're looking at,
and then also begin exploring alternative

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.640
or deeper meanings that can expand
their intellectual engagement

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.110 position:75%
and really foster their exploration of concepts.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.030
So, given that, not all images are
well suited for young children.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:49.030
The other thing is that teachers
also have some challenges

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.880 position:67%
with are navigating the archives themselves

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.200
to locate developmentally
appropriate and relevant images.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.090 position:64%
And that can be frustrating sometimes
because the archives themselves can prove

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.400
to be a bit cumbersome if you don't
know the exact words to put in

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.530 position:58%
or not necessarily even using words
that fit within a historical context.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:18.030 position:73%
So, for example, a teacher may put in the words
"grocery store," but in the historical context

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:23.650 position:73%
or the region that they want to find a resource
maybe a better term would have been "market."

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.450 position:66%
Or they may be looking for representations
because children are interested

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.260
in exploring transportation and so
they put in the words "gas station"

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.470
but historically the term
of reference to be able

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.190
to find appropriate images
may be "filling station."

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.770 position:56%
Same thing with using terms like
"hair salon" versus "a beauty shop."

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:49.510 position:61%
And so you can get a broader range
sometimes if you situate it more closer

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.100
to the historical context and
the verbiage that was used then.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.630 position:58%
And that's a challenge for teachers
to be able to negotiate through that.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.250 position:61%
But starting off with topics from a
developmentally appropriate perspective

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.940 position:56%
of issues that have connections with
children in a locally familiar way.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.600 position:59%
Now, in our introduction noted Michael
and I are both at the University

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.290
of South Florida which is in Tampa.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:22.220 position:64%
And, for our students, a locally familiar
place is represented in this next image.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.220
And so for some of our students
as they walk to school each day,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.370 position:73%
they actually see dolphins swimming in the bay.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.590 position:73%
And they're out about -- just around that time,
the children will be walking along the sidewalk

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:42.970 position:75%
on the path of the bay and so this is a familiar
context of the image for them to be able to see.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:49.610 position:58%
But when we introduce this particular
image in a group of kindergarteners,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.400 position:56%
the one thing that they ask --
their first question of inquiry was,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:59.100
"Why are the children encaged
and the dolphin gets to be free?"

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.900 position:73%
So, they read this image as it was the dolphin
who came to visit the children who were in sort

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.640 position:64%
of like a zoo like engagement and it was
the dolphin who gets to have the free fun

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.440
of exploring in his ocean
setting throughout the day.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.880 position:66%
Because that was the context in which
they engaged and interacted with children.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, Ilene has given us some
wonderful background on the research

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.010
and the practice associated
with primary sources.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.100 position:61%
Is the primary source image attractive?

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.290
Large? And clear?

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.620
Does the image entice the
interest of the young learner?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.180 position:72%
We're going to have some fun with some primary
sources right now to give you a context

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.960
of what is a developmentally
appropriate primary source.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.520 position:72%
So, let's take a look at this image from 1940.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.550 position:64%
Publix is a Supermarket chain in Florida.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.930
And Ilene had used the term
earlier, "Problematize."

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.880 position:61%
So, when you look at this picture, what
are some problems that you might see?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.000
What are some things that you
might see that look familiar?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.360 position:69%
Anybody know where they store the ice-cream?

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.700 position:69%
Does anybody see all of those freezer cases?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.280
Why aren't they there?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.750
What types of fruits and
vegetables might you have?

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.710 position:61%
So, when you look at an image like this
from long ago and you talk to children

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:23.220 position:70%
about something that's a part of their lives,
a part of their regular everyday experience,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:29.140 position:69%
you can ask difficult questions and get them
thinking through the use of primary sources.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:38.160 position:72%
Our keynote speaker, Carol Highsmith, has done
a wonderful job of focusing on communities.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.990 position:69%
And one of the most amazing aspects of
using primary sources with young children is

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.660
to get them involved in their
own personal community.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.900
Here, we have a young woman,
a little girl taking a picture

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.100 position:61%
in her neighborhood in Naples, Florida.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.420 position:73%
And what we do is we send children out into
their communities much like Carol Highsmith did

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.160
and taking images of their own
to incorporate primary sources

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.000 position:67%
into their own experiences and instruction.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.790
Context and understanding
is extremely important.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.830 position:56%
As Ilene mentioned, as we work with
teachers one of the most interesting

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.980
and difficult aspects is making
meaning of the image themselves.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.130 position:69%
The context of the sense of place, the time,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.790
and the purpose of the primary
source becomes extremely important.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.650
The making meaning, though,
is challenging because some

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.430
of our teachers lack the content
knowledge related to the images

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.660
that they might be exploring
with their young learners.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.730 position:56%
In this particular case, we're going

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.130
to be showing you an image of
what's called a White Wing.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.090 position:56%
And when you look at this individual
and you simply look at the caption,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.230 position:58%
you might not get enough information.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.350 position:61%
So, teachers, again, and their
students might struggle to make meaning

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.330 position:61%
of what's incorporated into this image.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.150
So, how do we go about doing that?

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.500
We have to ask questions.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.710
For example, who are the
helpers in our neighborhood?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.580
Who were the helpers long ago?

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.090
Let's do some research.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:14.160 position:66%
So, when we look at this picture, let's
play a game of hide and seek for a second.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.860 position:59%
Can anyone see the pig in the picture?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.000
Where's the pig located?

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.120
So, you can see the pig on the
left hand side in the corner.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.520 position:63%
And you might ask yourself, "Why is
something like that important especially

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.150
when you just showed us a picture
of a man sweeping the street?"

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.570
Well, pigs were used in New
York City to clean up trash.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.840 position:61%
But the pigs themselves often made more
of a mess than they were cleaning up.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.650 position:69%
So, as a researcher with your young children
in class, you can explore these discussions

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:55.260
about what was New York City
like, who were these white wings?

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.370
And what was their job?

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:04.070 position:72%
These individuals would play an important role
in the health and wellbeing of New York City.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.030
And it's interesting.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.150
They were called white wings.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.100 position:56%
And, you know, when you think of the
image of white and nice and clean,

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.000 position:58%
they were there to clean up the city.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:21.310 position:73%
Now, one of the interesting elements associated
with cleaning up the city is going beyond that,

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:26.690 position:56%
taking a look at how pigs were used,
what life was like in New York City.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:31.490 position:73%
And there are a number of images
incorporated into the primary source collection

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.840
at the Library of Congress that
you can explore in greater detail.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.040 position:58%
Or you could even watch films
related to the white wings on parade.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.350 position:70%
And this creates a great frame of reference
for our young learners when they actually get

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.540
to see the white wings in action.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:54.970 position:70%
But when you look at these large pictures
and you help your students contain themselves

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.300 position:59%
as they look at all of these different
images and they try to explore all

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.000
of the different representations
in an image, where do they focus?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.470
How do you help them focus?

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.910 position:61%
One of the great ways that is available
is something called the crop-it.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.960
The crop-it technique is something
that you may or may not be familiar

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.160 position:63%
with where you take two pieces of paper.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.530 position:66%
You can do it either digitally or by hand.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.690
And you can zoom into a particular
element in a photo.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:27.390 position:61%
When a child explores a large image
with a lot of different representations

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.670 position:64%
and a lot that's going on, they sometimes
find it difficult to focus themselves.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.760 position:67%
So, having and using a tool like crop-it
helps them in a great great way by focusing

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.190 position:70%
in on a particular element of the photograph.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:47.350 position:75%
So, let's take an example of this photograph and
we're going to show you the crop-it technique.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:52.310 position:63%
When you look or you introduce this to a
young learner and it's the Palace Market

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:59.360 position:69%
in Lincolnville in Saint Augustine, Florida,
1922 to 1927, there's a lot going on.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.960
There are people there.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.730
There's a bicycle there.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.360
There's a young boy there.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.080
There's food.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.620
What would you have your
students focus on first?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.980
Where would you -- as a teacher
or as an administrator --

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.000 position:56%
someone working with primary sources
-- what would you focus in on?

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.800 position:64%
So, let us show you what we think is an
area that would be a great place to start

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.080 position:59%
when you're focusing in on this image.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.020
Good. The boy.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.640
Excellent.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.630
Julie said the boy.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:40.490 position:66%
Exactly. And here's an example of what we
would mean by using the crop-it technique.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:45.970
So, we've -- we've highlighted the
area out in the back but we boxed

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.430
in the young boy with the bicycle.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.280
And there are a lot of questions.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.900 position:69%
Let's go back to that term Ilene used before

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.350
because we're taking children
beyond just seeing and saying, "OK.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.120
I see a boy with a basically."

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.750 position:59%
to thinking about -- inquiry, inquiry,
developing thoughtful explanations

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:12.060 position:67%
to what's going on and asking difficult or
problematic -- or problematizing questions.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.560
What's he doing with the bicycle?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.740 position:59%
Why is he in the store with a bicycle?

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.570
Who is he?

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.260
What do you think he's going to do?

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:26.950 position:67%
And getting young children to start here at
this particular point and then expand out.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.680
Anybody want to guess what they
think he is doing in this picture?

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.910
Excellent, Jamie.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.770
Delivery boy.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:40.080 position:69%
Exactly. And that's why he has his bike
filled up with groceries or other materials.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.540
Excellent.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.660
Very good.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.590 position:63%
Another area that we want to focus on is
what's called the contextual knowledge.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.460 position:56%
And this is extremely important when
you're working with primary sources.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.860
OK. We find amazing images
at the Library of Congress

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.050 position:75%
or in our archives and what do you do with them?

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.770
What's the background knowledge
that's necessary?

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.000
In this particular case,
we were studying scales.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.540 position:61%
But beyond just bringing in the primary
sources, the images of the scale --

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.410
and there's a great image of a
baby being weighed on a scale.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.260 position:66%
They may have seen their brother or sister
in the doctor's office being weighed.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.720 position:72%
There's some larger scales or scales that they
are so old they may not be familiar with them.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.980 position:58%
But what we would like to do then is
to build a contextual knowledge base,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.140 position:67%
a background by bringing in some other
artifacts to build their content knowledge,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.000 position:64%
to get them thinking or seeing
different representations of information.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.480 position:69%
&gt;&gt; So, the other thing is that we recognize
is that we can utilize these primary sources

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.290
to help foster young children's
critical thinking skills.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:56.060 position:69%
So, I want you all to think about -- I think
our question got a little bit cut off here,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.250
but the question is, "What can
you catch with a fishing pole?"

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.180 position:70%
So, if you sit there and you kind of think
about in your mind, "What are possible things

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.960 position:63%
that I might catch with a fishing pole?"

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.110 position:75%
And if you're a five year old imagining the idea
again, if that's part of your favorite reference

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.350
of having places that you can
go fish and, thanks, Mike, yes!

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.330
Obviously.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.900 position:59%
We can catch fish with a fishing pole.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.930
Well, how about this?

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:25.210
We can use a fishing pole
to catch a brand new toy.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.620
So, here we have an image that
helps students begin to think

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:35.330 position:63%
about that sometimes we can be surprised
by taking what's familiar and part

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:40.640 position:66%
of our lived experience and now rethinking
about it in a different way and explore

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.890 position:73%
about other ways that tools, resources may have
been used by others as part of their lives.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:54.280 position:64%
So we can think about also taking another
context that has some familiar elements

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.380 position:56%
but also has some different things
because of its historical situation.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.240
So, let's look at this one.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.420 position:61%
And we might say to children, "So,
what clues in this picture help tell us

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.260 position:61%
about where the event is taking place?"

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:19.770 position:75%
So, Brian noticed that there's a stove and pots
and pans and Mike also noted about all the pots.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:26.080 position:67%
And so, as children, as part of that
visual literacy, what they begin connecting

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.260
with is finding representative
data points to justify

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.100
and substantiate the conclusions
that they're drawing.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:42.400 position:64%
Think about how powerful that is for very
young learners to be able to bring out

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.930 position:61%
and read the information they're seeing
as opposed to just looking at it.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.540 position:61%
Oh, you know, somebody is in a kitchen.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.530 position:70%
And we could go into harder questions about
what's happening or what's going on in there.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.840 position:61%
What is she doing in the context there?

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.500
And, actually, in this particular
picture, she's making an apple pie.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.580
So, it's an interesting dynamic
for children to be able to --

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.740 position:69%
and teachers to be able to support students'
critical thinking by introducing these kinds

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.820
of perspectives and orientations.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.760 position:73%
Now, one of the things we also recognize is
that young children typically assess the things

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:29.210 position:69%
that they see visually as sort of the truth
and representations of credible information.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:36.210 position:61%
And so we need to continue to foster,
again, those inherent sort of questions

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.710
that they begin asking and
instruct them about evaluating

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.850 position:63%
and challenging the information sources.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:50.060 position:69%
So, one of those representations of the way
that we might do that in our context, again,

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:55.150 position:75%
from Florida, is introducing this sort of image.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.870
So, if we were to introduce this
in a classroom within the context

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.910 position:69%
of our early childhood setting, maybe in the
chat I'd like to hear some of you about some

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:10.000 position:61%
of the prompts that you might ask young
students about this particular image.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.490
So, how might you focus the
lens of your young students

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.000
to help them read the text
of this particular picture?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.520
What is Santa doing?

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.500
Lounging out on the beach when you
should be delivering toys to us.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:38.950 position:75%
So, how does this young boy seem to be feeling
upon stumbling upon Santa wearing shorts instead

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.900 position:61%
of pants or whatever he might be doing?

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.170
Wondering where is this place.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:49.650
And so these are all very important
about fostering students' sense

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:57.560 position:70%
of critical literacy questions and thinking
about also what kind of skills would you need

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:04.080 position:59%
to scaffold and help children to
accomplish their thinking and engaging

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.000 position:58%
in this higher level kind of inquiry?

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.720 position:69%
So, as you all consider to think about and
contemplate what Santa is doing on the beach

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.460
on this particular day and how
this young boy may be reacting

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.570 position:56%
to stumbling upon Santa lounging
instead of working away in his shop,

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.930
we're going to go ahead and
transition over to Sue.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.000
&gt;&gt; Sue.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.000
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ilene and Michael.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.900
Now, we'd like to share with
you another powerful example

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.870 position:70%
of using primary sources with young children.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.220
Lenore Richardson is the Director
of Curriculum and Assessment

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.410 position:67%
for Cabell County Schools in West Virginia.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.180 position:75%
And she initiated and directed this TPS project.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.140 position:63%
Lenore could not be online with us
today so I'd like to share with you some

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.240
of the wonderful classroom
applications of Library

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.510
of Congress primary sources
in Cabell County schools.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:18.120 position:75%
Two unique aspects of the past and present
project were that there was a huge collaboration

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.450 position:59%
between the primary source teachers --

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:24.450
excuse me, the pre-service
teachers at Marshall University

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.920 position:75%
and the in-service teachers across the district.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.680 position:61%
They worked on this project throughout.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:36.140
And the focus also on the
local history and culture.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:41.750 position:63%
Kindergarten through 5th grade students
in rural and small urban schools learned

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.470
about the history and traditions
of their own home towns

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.850
and about the wider Appalachian
culture as they explored their past

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.000 position:56%
and present through multiple lenses.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.310 position:73%
First graders looked through the lens of homes.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:05.360 position:61%
As we were reminded yesterday during
Carol Highsmith's keynote presentation,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.820 position:72%
if you were lucky to -- lucky enough to sit in
on that -- it was a fantastic presentation --

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.970 position:59%
but she said the essence of the people
and the culture of local communities

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:20.470
across this country can be conveyed
and understood through photographs.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.810 position:63%
First graders developed visual analysis
skills as well as their reading and math

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.990
and fine motor skills in
their study of local homes.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:35.660 position:61%
Local photographs paired with digitized
images were analyzed for historic

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:43.290 position:67%
and architectural detail and later compared
and contrasted with modern built homes.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:49.160 position:69%
Next students worked to create scaled
diagrams of their own houses and they worked

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.930
with family members to measure
and draw important features.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:59.390 position:58%
As a final project, students created
model homes of their very own design.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.040 position:72%
Discussion throughout the unit helped students
think deeply about the change over time

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.060
and local cultural and --
cultural practices and changes.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.840 position:58%
Working with parents and grandparents

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.810 position:66%
and discussing the project helped families
make connections with historical items

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:21.360 position:61%
and family heirlooms in brand new ways.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.400
Third graders at Cabell County
focused on the local school culture

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.210
as their compared historic images
with modern day observations.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:36.160
They discussed daily activities and
compared classroom technologies.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.400 position:64%
They interviewed their family members
and considered how the school experiences

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:47.900 position:72%
of their elders differed from their own
experiences and why these differences existed.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.060
One Cabell County school, Martha
Elementary, is featured here.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.140 position:63%
The image on the lower right shows the
old school house before it was destroyed

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.490
by flooding.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.780 position:73%
The modern school, shown above, was built close

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.560
to the original location, but
in a less flood prone area.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:11.100 position:56%
Martha Elementary stands testament
to the local community's resilience.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.870 position:58%
Geography paired with environmentally
factors, population changes,

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:22.180 position:69%
and economic conditions all played key roles
in this study of the local school system.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.170
In the end, students even
got to make recommendations

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:31.000 position:72%
that they thought would help improve their own
schools promoting civic competence and action.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.290
Cabell County schools saw the need

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.620 position:72%
to move beyond the traditional textbook driven
curriculum and to move away from passive,

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.370 position:63%
unengaging student learning environments
by incorporating primary sources

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:53.320 position:70%
as an integral part of classroom instruction.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.670 position:58%
This TPS initiative provided ongoing
and embedded professional development

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:05.000 position:72%
for Cabell County teachers focused on locating
and carefully selecting primary sources

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.300 position:56%
from LOC.gov and other local
sources to promote inquiry learning.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:16.860 position:69%
As Michael and Ilene mentioned earlier, the
careful selection of primary sources for use

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.400 position:69%
with young children is of utmost importance.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.860 position:66%
Miss Richardson's report on the results
of this project included these highlights.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.530 position:63%
The strategies and resources provided by
the TPS program have been instrumental

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:37.140 position:67%
in shifting instruction from teacher
directed to more student directed learning.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.180
And we hear that all the
time, how important that is.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:46.710 position:70%
Young students and struggling readers have
shown increased ability to gather information

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.850
by utilizing visual primary
sources, making observations

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.780 position:72%
that contributed to collaborative discussions.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:35:00.410 position:59%
So, students who were not able to
read well could contribute much better

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.040
in this environment using
the visual primary sources.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.600 position:61%
Cabell County School District continues

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.890 position:66%
to provide annual professional development
events based on these positive results

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:18.000 position:66%
and this case study continues to inform
teacher preparation at Marshal University.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:27.680 position:72%
While the projects presented here were managed
through the TPS Eastern Region program,

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.570 position:56%
the Library of Congress has a wealth

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:34.790
of resources freely accessible
for PreK to 2 teachers directly.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:40.650 position:64%
The teaching with the Library of Congress
blog is the go-to place for discovering

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:47.620 position:69%
and discussing the most effective techniques
for using primary sources in your classroom.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.320
Projects presented today from
the University of South Florida

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.570
and Cabell County Schools
demonstrate definitively

00:35:54.570 --> 00:36:02.510 position:70%
that even kindergarteners can observe,
reflect, and ask good topic related questions

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.100 position:75%
and provide targeted reasons for their thinking.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.010
Allowing children to get
hands on with primary sources

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:14.320
and providing question starters are
developmentally appropriate ways

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.250 position:56%
to make deeper thinking and learning
more accessible for young learners.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:26.110 position:73%
The first example here on the screen,
kindergarten Historians, features video footage

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:31.130 position:61%
of yet another group of kindergarteners
in action this time from New York City.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:34.970 position:75%
So, if you have a moment, please check that out.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.750 position:61%
Educational staff at the library have
developed three sets of primary sources

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:44.810
with the specific needs of K
through 2 classrooms in mind.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.920 position:58%
Symbols of the United States,
Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.900
the three great presidents, and
children's lives at the turn

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.710
of the 20th century were all
designed for this age group.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.420
Each of these is easy to download
and print as a PDF document.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.670 position:67%
And each includes age appropriate primary
sources, historical background information,

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:15.300 position:59%
teaching ideas for the early childhood
classroom, and analysis tools.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:20.830 position:58%
The children's lives set features the
ways that children worked, played,

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.410 position:61%
and learned at the turn of the century.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:30.460 position:64%
And this is one of several primary source
sets that's also available as an eBook.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.610 position:67%
Youngsters can use iPad tools to manipulate

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:39.880 position:63%
and electronically markup individual
sources to help communicate their ideas.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:46.310 position:73%
The library also has several ready-to-go
learning activities to help foster observation,

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.640
reflection, and questioning
skills in their youngest --

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.310
in our youngest students and use
these skills across the curriculum.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:38:00.260 position:66%
Each one is aligned to state standards and
you can select whatever state you are in

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:06.970 position:63%
and find the primary source activities
that relate to your own state standards.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:12.160 position:59%
Engaging multiple senses, as you know,
can be beneficial for young learners.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.900 position:67%
Listen and wonder, is it a chicken or a
boy, can be effective for engaging students

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.070
across the learning spectrum
and lots of fun too.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:27.110 position:64%
These are just a few of the highlights
of the resources featured on the teaching

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.990 position:58%
with -- the Library of Congress Blog.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:33.780
We encourage you to subscribe
to the blog and get new entries

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.000
and resources delivered straight
to your inbox or your RSS feed.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.200 position:72%
We'd like to open it up now to some questions.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.500
So, what questions do you have?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.060
&gt;&gt; Yes. Great.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:39:00.050 position:64%
Thank you, everyone, for your
participation and I have a few questions.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.500
But feel free to add any more
as we go along right now.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.890 position:72%
We have a few minutes for question and answer.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:16.860 position:75%
One of the questions that came through is one
for either of -- either Ilene or Michael Berson.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.430
And that is, "Could you say
more about having students focus

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:27.510 position:70%
on one particular detail in a primary source?

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:33.430 position:66%
What's the advantage of having them focus
on a detail whether in crop-it or whatever

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:39.860 position:70%
that you choose and when would you want them
to choose a detail of interest on their own?"

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.690
&gt;&gt; That's a wonderful question.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.090
Thank you, whomever asked that.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:51.090 position:67%
So, part of the process of working with
primary sources with very young learners is

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:59.800 position:59%
to scaffold their skillset and be able
to help them over time develop enhance

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:05.310 position:58%
and increased visual competencies in
working with the sort of sense making

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.100
that is an inherent skill that
they have, is seeing what they have

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.270 position:63%
but really looking intently, as we said.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.640
It's very intentional movement
from just seeing to looking.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:22.060 position:72%
That idea of focusing on a small subset of an
image is really that initial scaffolding step,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.480
is that we don't want them just
to kind of go all over the place.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:33.030 position:73%
And quite honestly there can be a lot of
distracting elements that are in a visual image

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:40.840 position:75%
that may take away from either the core concept
that you're trying to teach or emphasize as part

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.070
of your instruction, or just
may create too much information.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:52.060 position:75%
So, almost an information overload for the young
learner to be able to optimize their meaning

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.860
and active engagement with
that particular element.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.970
The other thing is that it's sort
of like the interest and fun.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.660
You know, when we're working
with young learners,

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.320
we always want to be very
playful in our approach.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.840 position:59%
And so this sort of gradual
unveiling of the various little pieces

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.420 position:64%
of the puzzle also adds interest and also
helps facilitate their active engagement

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.170
in that process of learning.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:22.370
&gt;&gt; Right. We've also explored the
use of some single concept images.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:27.050 position:64%
And really we've been talking a lot today
about the formal use of primary sources.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.330 position:61%
So, using crop-it techniques, you know,

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.110
selecting images, focusing
in student's attention.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:36.700
But there are single concept
images at the Library of Congress.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.260
For example, we found a few.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.330
Children washing their hands.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:45.590 position:72%
And those can be informally placed in the
classroom where children can specifically look

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.430 position:58%
at a particular concept, washing your
hands, which is something that's done

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.720 position:59%
in most classrooms across the country.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:57.790 position:70%
So, focusing in on a particular topic through
a crop-it technique or selecting an image

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.900 position:58%
that focuses on a particular concept.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.720
&gt;&gt; And the question about at what
point do you kind of move or shift

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.750
to students being able to
direct or engage in that.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.940 position:66%
And that's always about sort of the
readiness and the skillset of the student.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.440
We are very strong proponents
of a child-centered curriculum.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.230 position:69%
Sort of following the lead of children, what
their areas of interest and inquiry sort

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:29.770 position:70%
of being the guiding framework is a wonderful
way to mobilize and foster their interests

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.000 position:64%
in looking and exploring and information.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.090 position:66%
And one of the things that we also should
mention, you know, for anyone who's worked

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:42.520 position:66%
with very young children, although there's
been this preponderance of representation

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.490 position:63%
of fictional resources in early learning
classrooms, actually research bears

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.970
out that young children have
a much greater preference

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.960
for authentic representations
of the world around them.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.250 position:72%
It's the things that they connect with better.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.770
So, although adults version
of the way children think

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:06.240 position:72%
that they should see the world is
cartoon-like, children actually prefer looking

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.160
at real representations of other
people, places, and the lives

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.000 position:58%
and experiences of those around them.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, both of you.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.880
Let's skip around a little bit.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:30.320
Perhaps Sue Wise could address
this question from Bonnie Welsh.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.030 position:72%
"With young children, is one photograph
enough or is it better to have multiple photos

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.000 position:73%
so the children compare and look more closely?"

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:43.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:49.030 position:75%
That's a great question and when you're starting
to use primary sources in the classroom,

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:57.970
sometimes the inclination is to use
a wide variety of primary sources.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:03.110
But I have found in my experience
to start with one source

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:07.810 position:61%
as kind of launching point for a topic.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:13.930 position:66%
As Ilene and Michael mentioned, narrowing
down that information that they are taking

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:20.750
in to focus on the details that are
important, building that context,

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:29.360 position:73%
and then bringing in additional primary sources
to build on that prior knowledge over time.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:37.270 position:73%
I saw earlier someone mentioned a gallery walk,
setting up a series of images that are focused

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:47.010 position:73%
on a particular topic, can help students build
their ideas about perspective and understanding

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.510 position:58%
of multiple views on a topic as well.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.220
But, starting small and building

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:58.840
from there would be what I would
advise based on my experience.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:05.050 position:72%
And I invite Ilene and Michael to add to that.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:09.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much and, in
fact, I'm just interrupting to say

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:14.720 position:73%
that Bonnie Welsh has just add a little detail.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:21.610 position:58%
She's wondering as well about whether
multiple copies of the same photo.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:27.190 position:67%
I guess she -- perhaps she's thinking about
grouping or how do you have students work?

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.420
&gt;&gt; Oh, excellent.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.980
Yes. Oh, excellent question.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.090
And thank you for that question.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:44.660 position:75%
Having children be able to have in front of them
actual images where they can circle, explore,

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.230 position:70%
use magnifying glasses we bring into our work

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.400
with young children in the
context of the classroom.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:57.030 position:72%
We give them their own hard copies of the
crop-it tools where they can sort of narrow in

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:01.940
and focus their lens themselves on
particular aspects like as we said

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.390 position:56%
that particular question, "What is a
clue in this picture that tells you

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.020 position:59%
where you think this is taking place?"

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:11.170
And they could actually themselves
crop in to maybe the pots

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.250 position:63%
or the stove in that particular context.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:18.960
So, either individual images
that children can look --

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:25.380 position:72%
use and demonstrate their own ways of thinking
with it, or in small groups be able to work

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:32.130
with peers is a wonderful strategy
in early learning classrooms.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.040
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.290 position:63%
And Sue Wise has just mentioned using
iPads for marking up the digital images.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:45.610 position:56%
This was a fabulous presentation and
I -- so much valuable information.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:50.020
Thank you so much to the presenters
and thank you to all of you

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.330
for sharing your thoughts
and asking your questions.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.880 position:61%
Just a couple of details before we end.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.380
Please give us your feedback.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.120 position:61%
There's a link at the top of this slide
and it's just a three question survey.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.410
And it will help us very much.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.870
Just take a minute or two.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.170 position:69%
Once you complete the session, you will earn
a certificate for one instructional hour

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:17.850 position:61%
and you'll get an e-mail within five
business days about how to access this.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:24.120 position:59%
Again, we thank all of you for joining
us and we thank the presenters.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.600
I'm going to end the recording
now and end the meeting.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.180
Good night.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.000
Thank you, again.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.190
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
