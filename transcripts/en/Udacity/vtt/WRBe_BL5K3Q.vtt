00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.050
Before you start discussing mental disorders in detail, I want to ask you

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.226
something. Do you know somebody with a mental disorder? Have you seen someone

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:11.461
on TV or even in public, with, let's say, schizophrenia? How did that make you

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:16.215
feel? Were you uncomfortable? Were you afraid? Unfortunately, historically,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.915
people with mental disorders were shunned and even isolated from their

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:24.252
communities. They were also subjected to bizarre treatments. All because people

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:27.684
didn't understand where these mental illnesses came from, or what was causing

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:32.296
this behavior. Now, throughout this lesson I want you to think about this

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.116
negative stigma and how, the increase of mental health literacy, we can

00:00:35.116 --> 00:00:39.415
diminish this stigma. Fortunately, today we've come a long way in understanding

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:43.324
the causes of mental illness. In fact, the're entire media campaign is

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:47.048
dedicated to teaching people about what mental illness is. And there's no

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:52.563
reason for someone today to be stigmatized because of mental illness. In fact,

00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:57.100
we should look at it just like we do any other human illness such as diabetes.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.570
People with diabetes face daily challenges as do people with mental illness.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.740
However, by managing their symptoms, both can live a happy and fufilling life.
