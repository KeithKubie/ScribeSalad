00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:06.701
METHANE HERE IS A NATURAL GAS,
AND IT'S MOST OF WHAT COMES OUT

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:09.067
OF YOUR STOVE AT HOME
TO COOK WITH.

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:11.534
IT'S A FLAMMABLE GAS, BUT IT'S
NOT FLAMMABLE ON ITS OWN.

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:14.234
IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF OXYGEN OUT OF THE AIR

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:15.734
IN ORDER TO BURN.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.267
HOW MUCH OXYGEN?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.367
WELL, THAT ACTUALLY
TURNS OUT TO BE

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:20.234
A VERY PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.567
THE RELATIONSHIP OF OXYGEN
TO FLAMMABLE GAS

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.267
IS CALLED "STOICHIOMETRY."

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:28.467
Narrator: TO CREATE FIRE, IT
TAKES HEAT, FUEL, AND OXYGEN.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.634
AND WHEN IT COMES
TO FLAMMABLE GASES,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.167
THE AMOUNT OF FUEL TO OXYGEN IS
A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.467
CALLED "STOICHIOMETRY."

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.200
TOO MUCH FUEL OR TOO LITTLE,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.667
AND THERE'LL BE NOTHING CLOSE
TO A FLAME.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.901
BUT GET THE PERFECT MIXTURE,
AND YOU GET AN EXPLOSION.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.901
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE MOVIE,
IT TOOK BOURNE 20 SECONDS

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:51.901
TO GET THAT EXPLOSIVE RATIO
OF AIR TO GAS JUST RIGHT.

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.200
SO, NOW THE MYTHBUSTERS ARE
DIALING IN TO FIND OUT

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.834
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.601
[ CAR ALARM BLARING ]

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.234
WE KNOW THAT IF WE'RE GONNA
GET METHANE TO BURN,

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:06.701
WE NEED A RATIO OF BETWEEN 6%
AND 17% FUEL TO AIR.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:10.634
THE IDEAL RANGE IS ABOUT
9% METHANE, THE REST AIR.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:13.267
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT
THAT ACTUALLY MEANS.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:15.367
DOES THAT MEAN
IF WE ARE A LITTLE OFF,

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.467
WE GET SORT OF A "WHOOF,"
BUT IF WE GET RIGHT AT THE 9%,

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.834
WE'RE GETTING
A REAL STRONG BANG?

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:24.300
BEFORE WE GO FULL SCALE, WE WANT
TO REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.534
SO, WHAT WE'VE DONE IS MAKE
A 10"x10"x10" CUBIC BOX,

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.334
AND THAT WILL ALLOW US
TO REALLY EASILY DIAL IN

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.133
ON THESE RATIOS
TO SEE WHAT IT MEANS.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:40.767
Narrator:
AND WHILE JAMIE IS BOXING,
ADAM HAS THE RATIOS IN THE BAG.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.033
Adam: ONE OF THE RATIOS
I WANT TO PLAY WITH IS

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.200
9% FLAMMABLE GAS TO AIR.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.100
THIS BAG HOLDS 9% OF THE VOLUME
OF THIS CHAMBER.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.434
I WILL FILL IT WITH GAS.

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.234
I WILL THEN HOOK IT UP
TO THE CHAMBER,

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:59.300
OPEN UP BOTH OF THE VALVES,
PRESS THE GAS INTO THE CHAMBER.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.767
I'LL BE DISPLACING THE AIR

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:02.901
THAT COMES OUT OF
THIS LITTLE HOLE RIGHT HERE.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.934
SEAL IT UP, WALK AWAY,

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.534
IGNITE IT
WITH A NEON TRANSFORMER,

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:07.868
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:09.801
Narrator:
ADAM'S BAGS WILL HELP THE GUYS

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:14.133
ZONE IN ON EXACTLY WHAT RATIO
OF METHANE TO AIR IS EXPLOSIVE.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.334
AND SPEAKING OF METHANE...

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.334
SO THAT WE CAN
IGNITE THIS THING SAFELY,

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.534
WE'RE GONNA REMOTELY TURN ON
THIS NEON TRANSFORMER

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:22.400
THAT WILL CREATE
A HIGH-VOLTAGE SPARK

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.968
INSIDE THE METHANE CHAMBER.

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:27.968
IN HERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO VARY
THE METHANE CONCENTRATIONS,

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:31.000
IGNITE IT, AND SEE WHAT WE GET.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.167
Narrator: FIRST UP,
A TEST AT THE VERY BOTTOM

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.267
OF THE STOICHIOMETRIC ZONE --
6%.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:37.200
WE'RE GOOD.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.534
Jamie:
OKAY, 6% IN 3...2...1.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.801
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.200
WE EXPECTED SOMETHING,
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED!

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.067
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:58.367
OUR FRANGIBLE BOX SEPARATED
JUST AS WE HOPED IT WOULD,

00:02:58.367 --> 00:02:59.467
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.601
KIND OF A LITTLE BIT
OF A [IMITATES EXPLOSION]

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.868
I WAS EXPECTING A LITTLE MORE
FROM AN EXPLOSION,

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:06.033
AND I'M INTERESTED
TO SEE IF

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.400
OUR OPTIMAL STOICHIOMETRIC RATIO
GIVES US THAT.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.734
ME, TOO.

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:11.300
WELL, LET'S SET IT UP.
OKAY.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.567
Narrator: 6% IS EXPLOSIVE,

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.000
BUT WHAT IF BOURNE ACHIEVED
THE OPTIMAL RATIO

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.868
OF 9% METHANE TO AIR?

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:22.501
9% IN 3...2...1...

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:28.100
WELL, THAT WAS
MORE ENERGETIC.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.667
9% WAS DEFINITELY
MORE ENERGETIC, BUT FOR ADAM,

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.968
THE SURPRISING THING IS
THAT AT BOTH RATIOS,

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:36.634
THEY SCORED
THE MYTHICAL EXPLOSION

00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:37.634
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
