00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:06.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.970
Well, hi, folks.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.197
Laci Green here.

00:00:08.197 --> 00:00:09.030
Let's watch a movie!

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.400
I watch documentaries a lot.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.680
Thanks to a huge selection that
I have on my Netflix account.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.763
Netflix is pretty amazing.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.572
It give you access
to TV and movies

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:16.780
through the internet machine.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.874
So check it out,
netflix.com/dnews to try it out

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:20.250
for a month of free streaming.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.374
And let me know what
documentaries you're watching.

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:23.970
Last night I watched
(A)sexual, which

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.180
is a documentary that I've been
meaning to watch for a while

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.670
now.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.378
Because I've heard
great things about it.

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:30.260
And it worked with a
few people in the film.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.810
Overall, I really
enjoyed this film.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.510
Asexuality is pretty
misunderstood.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900
Sexual people hear about
it and they're like, what?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.110
You don't like sex?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.185
At all?

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:40.640
That's crazy!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.780
But it's a real sexual, or
rather asexual orientation.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.420
About 1% of the
world is asexual.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.220
These are people who don't
experience sexual attraction.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.740
Period.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.940
They don't want to
have sex with anyone.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.890
A good chunk of the
film follows David Jay,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.500
who was openly asexual and
was one of the first activists

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.307
to try to organize
asexuals online.

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.890
He's been really outspoken, he's
been on TV a number of times,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.776
raising awareness, and giving
asexuals a place to belong.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.150
Before the internet,
there really

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.370
wasn't a great way to connect
to such a small community.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.830
And a lot of people
felt-- and many

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.340
continue to feel-- like there's
something wrong with them.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.230
They don't experience
sexual attraction.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.100
Meanwhile, the entire world
is preoccupied with sex.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
I mean I can imagine
that could make

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.594
a person feel like
a real outsider.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:21.510
And it doesn't help that
asexuality apparently

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.980
makes people really
uncomfortable, confused,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.650
and even angry.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.910
There's one scene where
the asexuality group visits

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.790
San Francisco Pride, the
bastion of love, tolerance,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.410
and acceptance, right?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.910
Nope!

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.460
It was shocking to me how
many people were like,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.110
I don't support your lifestyle.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.950
There's something
messed up about that.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590
Close-minded comments that
the queer community gets

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.110
from straight
people all the time,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.680
and yet they turn
around and spew it

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.480
at someone who is
different than them.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.120
Clearly, navigating the world
of sexuals when you're asexual

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.840
could be tough.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.174
And I like that the film gives
a voice to those stories.

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:52.548
One part of the film that I
really enjoyed, but also wish

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:53.950
had been made a
little more clear

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.580
is the difference between
a romantic orientation

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.100
and sexual orientation.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.060
Asexuals make the
distinction between the two

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.684
to accommodate the
fact that they still

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:03.400
need love and partnership
in their lives.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.316
And I think that the
idea that romantic desire

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:07.986
and sexual desire are
different, but often overlapping

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:09.360
is something
beneficial to people

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.949
of all sexual orientations.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.990
In the film, they interview
romantically oriented

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.150
asexuals to talk about how
it's 100% possible to have

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
an intimate, romantic
partner that you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.160
don't have sexual attraction to.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.960
So from a scientific
perspective,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.124
asexuality is
really interesting.

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:26.040
In the film, they talk
about a study debunking

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.360
the idea that asexuals have
an underlying sexual trauma

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.692
or mental illness.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.150
Just like some of
the first studies

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.040
that were done on
homosexuality, actually.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.630
Everyone thought
that they were crazy.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.660
Turns out, asexuals
aren't any different

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.820
from the average person.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.360
Could it be that asexuality
is an evolutionary response

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.660
to overpopulation?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.280
Could it be hormonal?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.050
I mean, we know that
asexuality naturally

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.990
occurs in some
animals in the wild.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.647
So we're hoping to catch up
with David Jay, himself, soon

00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:52.730
and to talk about this end
of the sexual spectrum.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.362
So I'll keep you posted on that.

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:55.820
And if you want to
watch (A)sexual,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.820

And, hey, let me
know what you think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.869
I should watch next down
