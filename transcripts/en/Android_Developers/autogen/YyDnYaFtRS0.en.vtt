00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.130
has a second configuration which is
gonna be different than the one in your

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140
gonna be different than the one in your
 

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.380
gonna be different than the one in your
app most likely so be careful not to

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:42.390
app most likely so be careful not to
 

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.150
app most likely so be careful not to
make application wide assumptions about

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:44.160
make application wide assumptions about
 

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.919
make application wide assumptions about
hardware configuration and in conclusion

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:47.929
hardware configuration and in conclusion
 

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:50.450
hardware configuration and in conclusion
Android development has evolved to mean

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460
Android development has evolved to mean
 

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.090
Android development has evolved to mean

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.390
and taking advantage of jetpack to build
 

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:08.600

a modern testable architecture thank you

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:08.610
 

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.960
all right

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:09.970
all right
 

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.510
all right
actually no no no we got there's there's

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520
actually no no no we got there's there's
 

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.090
actually no no no we got there's there's
there's actually one more thing Android

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:15.100
there's actually one more thing Android
 

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.980
there's actually one more thing Android
is actually restricting the use of some

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:16.990
is actually restricting the use of some
 

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.200
is actually restricting the use of some
non SDK interfaces in Developer Preview

non SDK interfaces in Developer Preview
 

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.780
non SDK interfaces in Developer Preview
one and you'll saw this because we were

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:21.790
one and you'll saw this because we were
 

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.419
one and you'll saw this because we were
actually warned to with like toast and

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:24.429
actually warned to with like toast and
 

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:26.280
actually warned to with like toast and
log entries if these message methods

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.290
log entries if these message methods
 

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:27.570
log entries if these message methods
were used but you'll notice if you're

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:27.580
were used but you'll notice if you're
 

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.610
were used but you'll notice if you're
testing against DP to some of these

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:29.620
testing against DP to some of these
 

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.080
testing against DP to some of these
vessels we'll just seek to work and will

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.090
vessels we'll just seek to work and will
 

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.810
vessels we'll just seek to work and will
cause your app to crash so please test

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:33.820
cause your app to crash so please test
 

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.880
cause your app to crash so please test
and file issues if you don't think

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:35.890
and file issues if you don't think
 

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.860
and file issues if you don't think
there's any way your app can work other

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:37.870
there's any way your app can work other
 

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.080
there's any way your app can work other
than these methods and to help you out

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.090
than these methods and to help you out
 

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.299
than these methods and to help you out
in the future we've actually added a new

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:42.309
in the future we've actually added a new
 

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:44.310
in the future we've actually added a new
VM policy for strict mode that you can

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320
VM policy for strict mode that you can
 

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.860
VM policy for strict mode that you can
use to turn on and detect all non SDK

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:46.870
use to turn on and detect all non SDK
 

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.419
use to turn on and detect all non SDK
API usage which is really important

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:48.429
API usage which is really important
 

00:24:48.429 --> 00:24:50.160
API usage which is really important
because it's non SDK usage you may

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.170
because it's non SDK usage you may
 

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.810
because it's non SDK usage you may
actually be happening in your libraries

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:51.820
actually be happening in your libraries
 

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.970
actually be happening in your libraries
so this is a really great way to

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:53.980
so this is a really great way to
 

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.560
so this is a really great way to
actually make sure that your app is

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.570
actually make sure that your app is
 

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.090
actually make sure that your app is
going to be compatible going forward

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.100
going to be compatible going forward
 

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.890
going to be compatible going forward
because we don't guarantee the

00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:58.900
because we don't guarantee the
 

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:04.049
because we don't guarantee the
compatibility of any non SDK API and so

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:04.059
compatibility of any non SDK API and so
 

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:06.419
compatibility of any non SDK API and so
that really is it now if you haven't

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:06.429
that really is it now if you haven't
 

00:25:06.429 --> 00:25:07.770
that really is it now if you haven't
paying attention in the last 30 minutes

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:07.780
paying attention in the last 30 minutes
 

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.930
paying attention in the last 30 minutes
that's okay because clearly my jokes

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:09.940
that's okay because clearly my jokes
 

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.140
that's okay because clearly my jokes
need work if you're an engineer

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.150
need work if you're an engineer
 

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.310
need work if you're an engineer
hopefully much the information shared

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320
hopefully much the information shared

today was a review for you and we hope
you found the tips useful so if you have

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:18.850
you found the tips useful so if you have
 

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.180
you found the tips useful so if you have
p.m. and if your app is not quite

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:21.190

to plan things out work with your teams

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:25.270
to plan things out work with your teams
 

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.360

to figure out you know how much work is

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.370
to figure out you know how much work is
 

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.070
to figure out you know how much work is
needed and in fact we've prepared a

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080
needed and in fact we've prepared a
 

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.010
needed and in fact we've prepared a
guide on Android developer sites to help

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:32.020
guide on Android developer sites to help
 

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.049

current really is the amount of work

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:35.770
current really is the amount of work

the ecosystem forward thank you very

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120
the ecosystem forward thank you very
 

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.600
