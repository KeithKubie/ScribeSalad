00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.510
In the last video I constructed
a scenario where

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.480
we get all of the upside in an
investment and our downside

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.340
was limited to essentially
15% of our investment.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.930
Or in that case it was $25.50.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.210
I think I made a slide
math error.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.790
I kept saying $24.50.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.010
It was really $25.50.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.000
And I also apologize, I
realize I had my sound

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.750
settings a little off.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.540
But hopefully you'll be
able to still listen

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.260
to that last video.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.140
But just to review what we did
is instead of putting $30--

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.010
let's say the asset
price was $30.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.260
Instead of just going out there
and paying $30 for it,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.990
what we did is we put
$25.50 aside.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.810
And then we used $4.50 to
participate in Geithner's

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.010
project, or his plan.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.530
And we put in $4.50.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.970
The Treasury puts in $4.50.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.590
Then the Fed lends us $51.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.360
And then we're able to buy $60
worth of security, or twice as

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.260
many as we would've
otherwise bought.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.380
But we're splitting
the upside.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.340
So essentially we're getting
the upside on the security.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.470
And we saw in the last video
what the payoff looked like.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.319
And let me draw that here.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.750
So hopefully this'll be a
slightly cleaner version than

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.580
I did in the last video.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.190
So this is going to
be the eventual

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.440
price of the security.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.920
And let me make the y-axis
the eventual value of my

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.170
investment.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.030
Now if I just straight up
invested in the thing then the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.400
value of my investment is the
value of the security.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.260
So it would just look
something like that.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.210
So let's say if the value of
the security ends up being

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.710
$30, then the value of my
investment ends up being $30.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.970
This is the scenario
where I just

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.630
straight up buy the thing.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.940
If the thing ends up being worth
nothing, then the value

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.890
of my investment's nothing.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.990
If the thing ends up being worth
$60, then the value of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.180
my investment is $60.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.200
This is my investment value.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.420
Not too fancy there.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900
But what we saw in the last
video is, if we do this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.440
scenario where I put $25.50
aside, and I only put $4.50 at

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.340
risk in this type of reality,
what we had is that if the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.380
value of the security is
anything less than $25.50,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.200
then the equity holders
here get wiped out.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.120
My $4.50 is worth nothing.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.900
My $4.50 is worth nothing.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.070
But I still have that $25.50
that I put aside, the cash.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.850
So my losses were limited to
essentially $4.50 or the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.190
capital that I put at risk.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.760
So the payoff diagram then
looks like this.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.780
In an upside scenario, with my
$4.50 investment I'm able to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.520
capture all of the upside that
I would have normally gotten,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.540
and then my downside is
essentially capped to $4.50.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.540
No matter what happens to the
security, I'm going to be

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.400
sitting with $25.50.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.440
So the worst case is that I
really just lose $4.50,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.350
assuming that my original price
that I pay is $30 for

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.810
the security.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.010
This'll be my loss.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.530
And then this is obviously
my gain, just like that.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.350
Now let's see, if there was no
Geithner Plan, let's see if we

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.640
could set up the same type of
payoff using more conventional

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.750
securities, I guess we
could call them.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.950
And if we can do that, then we
can try to price those more

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.000
conventional securities, and
then we have a good sense of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.150
the subsidy or essentially what
the government is giving.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.360
So instead of the Geithner
Plan, let's say that we

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.230
invested straight up
in the security.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.570
And I'll just say, we invest
in the security for $30.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.330
And then we also buy an
insurance contract.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.090
So we buy the security
for $30.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.530
And then we also buy
a put option.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.250
And that sounds fancy, but all
it is is an insurance contract

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.120
essentially on a security.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.370
So we buy a put.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.210
And the put gives us the right,
it's a contract that

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.010
says that we can sell.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:30.470
We have the right to sell
our security for $25.50.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.780
And we don't have to sell
our security for $25.50.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.310
Let's say it ends up
being worth $60.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.610
We're out here.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.710
Then we're just going
to take our put

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.920
contract and rip it up.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.400
It's worthless.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.770
We don't want it.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.950
We didn't need the insurance.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.070
Our house didn't burn
down, right?

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.040
But let's say we're down here.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.590
The thing we bought, this toxic

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.560
asset, really is worthless.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.950
Then wow, we have
this contract.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.090
We got into a contract with
someone else who said that

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.370
they would agree to buy
that thing for us

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.510
from $25.50, right?

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.670
We have the right to sell it to
them, or to put it to them,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.610
for $25.50.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.240
And just so you get a little
bit of the lingo, although

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.180
many of you all are probably
familiar with this, this is

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.950
the strike price of
the put option.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.960
And what would the payoff
diagram look like?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.190
Well, I have the security.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.920
So in all of the scenarios where
the security is worth

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.810
more than $25.50, my payoff is
going to look like this.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.180
It's going to be just
along this line.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.100
Now, in these scenarios down
here, what is my payoff?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.760
Well if the value of the
security ends up being

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.020
something less than $25.50, well
I have this thing here

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.670
saying, you know, the market's
saying that they're only

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.270
willing to pay I don't know,
$12 for my security.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.480
But I have this contract with
somebody that says hey,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.620
they're willing to pay $25.50
for my security.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.380
So in any of these scenarios,
I'm just going to exercise my

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.640
put option, and I'm just
going to sell it to

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.610
this guy for $25.50.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.460
So, no matter in all of these
downside scenarios, I still

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.400
get $25.50, because I have
that put option.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.730
So essentially, as you see,
this payoff diagram is

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.450
identical to what the
government gave us.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.270
So throughout this whole
structure, this public private

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.740
partnership, all the government
is essentially

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.130
doing is giving us a
put option with a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.340
$25.50 strike price.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.240
And so to figure out how large
of a subsidy that is, we

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.940
really just have to figure out
what is a put option with a

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.520
$25.50 strike price.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.880
And people have Nobel-- It's
actually not that easy to

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.830
calculate this type of thing,
because you have to know about

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.530
the volatility of the security
and its dividends, and

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.300
actually the math to originally
come up with this

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.270
came out of-- People have won
Nobel Prizes for this.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.180
But it's a known problem.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.060
What I'm going to do here--
And it's a little bit

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.520
theoretical.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.440
What a lot of people do in
reality is, they look at what

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.610
the market is paying for these
options, and then they figure

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.870
out what the implied assumptions
are, the

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.440
volatility.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.680
And that's really the
big assumption.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.575
But I just did a little
bit of a web search.

00:06:59.575 --> 00:07:01.210
And just to give proper
credit, this is

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.520
math.columbia.edu.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.420
And this is a little tilde sign
~smirnoff\options13.html

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.170
But what he has here is a
little bit of an options

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.140
calculator.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.980
And I'll take my chances with
this guy, who's probably a

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.190
Ph.D student or a professor at
Columbia, that he knows how to

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.610
calculate options, and that
his JavaScript is correct.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.650
And the numbers make sense.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.370
But let's say the security
in our case is $30.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.840
The strike price is $25.50.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.140
Let me make this larger.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.200
The interest rate.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.400
So this is the risk free
interest rate.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.770
It could also be the interest
on the debt.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.060
It depends.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.110
But you know, it's
something small.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.040
Interest is low right now.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.850
Say 2%.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.500
The dividend yield-- We're
buying these toxic assets that

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.530
essentially have a pretty
high yield.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.570
And if you're buying it at
$0.30 on the dollar, your

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.030
yield's probably in the range
of 30% or something.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.510
But you can play with
these assumptions.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.980
I'm trying to be as favorable
as possible to this, to kind

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.570
of see how large the
subsidy could be.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.830
And maybe we'll come
up a range.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.150
And you could play with
this in your own time.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.990
Volatility per year.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.520
I think 30% is pretty fair.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.910
That in any given year, the
perceived value of this could

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.650
fluctuate by 30%.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.060
And the time to expiration.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.180
These are long lived assets.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.450
A lot of mortgage assets, their
average maturity is

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.390
around 10 years.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.480
So instead of 365 days, let's
make it 10 years.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.660
3,650 days.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.090
And let's calculate it.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.340
All right, and what we want
to worry about is

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.190
the American put.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.289
In future videos, I'll talk
about the difference between a

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.360
European put and an
American put.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.700
But an American put means you
can essentially exercise it at

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.520
any time you want
to exercise it.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.950
While a European put just has an
exercise date, where that's

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.120
the only time where you can
exercise your option.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.650
But the American put says that
the value of this, for the

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.420
assumptions we gave,
is about $19.50.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.710
So it's a pretty big subsidy.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.430
And of course, the numbers
change a good bit depending on

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.620
if we make the yield on
the security less and

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.010
we calculate it.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.680
Whoops, I made a mistake here.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.290
It becomes something less.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.060
But no matter how you play with
the assumptions, you get

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.470
something in the
$15-$20 range.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.810
So that option calculator told
us that the correct price or

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.630
the theoretical price for
something like this, for a put

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.350
option for a security like this,
with 30% volatility that

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.320
maybe has a 30% yield
on it, because it's

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320
paying a lot of dividends.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.650
People are paying their
mortgage payments.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.020
That the option value of this
put, if you had to go buy it

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.880
on the market.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.790
You know, it's a range.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.920
It's maybe $15 to $20.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.560
So a rational investor who would
have paid $15 to $20 for

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.920
the option, how much are they
willing to pay for the

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.330
security plus the option?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.430
Well, that same rational
investor, we're saying was

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.090
willing to pay $30 for
the security before.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.240
And now they're getting the
security and the option.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.280
So now, if they had had to go
buy the option by themselves,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.090
they'd have to pay $15 to $20.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.050
So in theory, they would be
willing to pay up to $30 plus

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.200
the value of the option.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.880
So they'd be willing to
pay up to $45 to $50.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.560
Now I want to be
clear on this.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.820
If the investor with this option
is, let's say they end

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.480
up paying $50, who
is benefiting?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.400
If the private investor here
ends up paying $50 for the

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.410
security, because the government
is essentially

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.230
giving them a free option, if
they pay $50 they're actually

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.690
paying for the what the
government is giving them.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.010
They're paying for the option.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.570
So the real benefit is the
person selling the toxic

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.520
assets, which are these
banks that I'd argue

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.730
are probably insolvent.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.810
So the subsidy wouldn't be
to the private investor.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.950
It would be to the banks.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.140
Only if the private investor
pays the same prices that they

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.080
would have already
paid, the $30.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.360
And the bank's willing
to sell it for $30.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.500
Then you could say that the
subsidy is going to that

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.490
private investor.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.630
But this begs the
whole question.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.180
The whole point of this exercise
was that the bid in

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.590
the market right now,
or what people are

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.020
willing to pay, is $30.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.500
While the banks, essentially,
they can't sell for anything

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.830
less, because if they did then
the gig would be up.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.590
People would know they're
bankrupt.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.680
The offer is $60.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.690
So even with this option that
the government is giving them,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.750
and even if this investor were
to pay up for the entire price

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.290
of the option, we're kind of
getting that maybe they'll be

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.550
willing to pay up
to $45 or $50.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.260
In which case the private
investor is really getting no

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.840
value from this whole gig.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.860
So even then, you don't
get to this point.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.900
And obviously if the private
investor's only paying in the

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.710
$30, range, then that's no
different than the reality

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.830
we're already into.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.570
And so this goes back to
that Geithner 2 video.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.980
That even with this option, a
rational investor is only

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.190
willing to pay up to maybe
$40 or $50, how

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.120
could this plan work?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.330
Well it either won't work.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.060
Because a rational investor
still won't pay the magic

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.780
number that the banks need
in order to be solvent.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.980
Or the scenario that I described
in the Geithner Plan

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.750
2 video will happen, where the
banks have this huge incentive

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.850
to buy these for themselves.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.910
They just create these kind
of shill hedge funds.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.400
And maybe I'll do a bunch of
videos on all of the different

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.310
ways they can do that.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.760
And banks are experts at this.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.610
At creating kind of off-balance
sheet entities

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.210
that they really do control.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.880
And then those things
participate with the

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.550
government and buy the
assets off of them.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.100
So my general take on it is,
if when we see this program

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.730
start to happen, if we see
bids that are above $60.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.170
If we see bids at $0.70 on the
dollar or $0.80 on the dollar,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.880
then these bids are actually
coming from the banks

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.420
themselves.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.290
Because there's no rational
reason, even with the put

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.080
option, why a regular investor
would pay in

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.080
excess of $40 or $50.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.130
And then there is a whole
liquidity argument here, that

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.090
Geithner has made, that oh well
it's not just the subsidy

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.570
we're giving.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.980
It's just also the
buying power.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.680
That right now, you have all
these distress sellers, and

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.300
you don't have that
many buyers or

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.650
dollars that are buying.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.330
And by kind of leveraging things
up, you're increasing

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.640
the buying power out there.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.650
And in the next video, I'll kind
of address that question.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.000
If that is the real problem that
Geithner wants to solve,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.070
there's a much better way to
solve it than doing this

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.750
public private partnership.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.490
And essentially allowing
the banks to

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.660
potentially set the price.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.710
You're either letting the banks
set the price, which

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.430
would be a direct transfer of
wealth from taxpayers to banks

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.540
that made mistakes.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.460
Or you're giving a put option,
which has a pretty good value,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.780
to a bunch of hedge funds and
investors, who maybe aren't

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.460
the reason why we got into the
mess, but there's no reason

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.830
why you should be transferring
money from

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.920
taxpayers to hedge funds.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.470
So in the next video, I'll
address that, and hopefully

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.450
this gave you a good sense of
what exactly the government is

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.780
doing, and how you
can value it.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.560
See you in the next video.
