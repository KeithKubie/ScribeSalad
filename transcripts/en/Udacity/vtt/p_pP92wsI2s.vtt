00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.695
There appears to be a moderate genetic heritability for OCD, as seen from twin

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:10.629
studies, but researchers are still examining the biological basis of OCD. One

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.270
hypothesis has suggested heightened neural activity in the caudate nucleus. And

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.790
the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC, of the brain. Some research findings

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.014
suggest that those with OCD have an overactive loop between the thought that

00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:28.304
something is wrong, which the obsession, and wanting to do something about it

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:35.801
to make it stop, which is the compulsion. The obsession involves the ACC,

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:41.410
whereas the compulsion involves the caudate nucleus. This cycle goes on and on

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.811
and gets stuck leading to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Now

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:50.200
let's go back to Lauren and talk about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
