1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.390
You fucking keep going.
The foot on the gas.

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.080
If you're the Rock,
do you need to do 19 movies?
And He's 22 ladies.

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.710
Can we just three last year did 19 movies this year.
20 to 22 movies.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.420
20 2022 boobs getting bigger.
Matter of fact,

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.600
he'll be your 3000 pounds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like how many?

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.020
He's a gorilla man that is so jacked right now.
He's so huge too.

7
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.370
When you meet them in real life,
you're like,
oh my goodness,
he's so,

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.550
he's so jacked.
He's so inspirational too,
man.
You know,
he's,
but it's,

9
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.000
you know,
not as being busy.
Like how,
how often is he home to these?

10
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.600
So inspirational.
Oh,
that's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's hard,
man.
It ain't easy.
Well,

11
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.530
I know my schedule.
Yeah.
And I look at how often with this month.

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.750
That's a silver back dude.
His under Armour shoes.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.950
So his workout workout shoes are dope.

14
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.950
I love this fucking guy,
man.
I love the five.
Love them too.

15
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:03.000
I can go to his Instagram at anytime and he's always super positive and it's

16
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.780
always super motivated and motivational and he's always getting after it.

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.970
I love it.
He's always getting after it.

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
But I wonder what it is in him that you have to do this many movies when he was

19
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600
young man,
he was young.
He fell upon hard times and he never forgot.
And that's a,

20
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.880
that's who he is now.
He did.

21
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.310
And he also knows that he inspires people with that work ethic.

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
Part of what who he is is not just the things that he accomplishes,

23
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.040
but how he makes people feel like that guy.
He's an inspirational person.

24
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.040
I think the same thing you can say about Kevin Hart and a lot of ways,
man,

25
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.310
I think it's for selfish reasons too though.
Cause you checked those boxes.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.880
I'm not saying he's a bad guy,
but there's also this,
this ego.

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.640
Everyone has an ego that he has to fill.
I'll do that.

28
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:48.080
She gets from the tungsten red carpets and he talks about,
it,

29
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.450
talks about kicking ass.
He talks about how everything's going great.
You know,

30
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:55.920
he talks about that whole getting after it,
that whole aspect of it.
Sure.

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.520
But there's a kidney cancer.
Selfish for sure.
For sure.
You have to be,

32
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.970
they have to be for anybody who does anything really good like that.

33
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.330
Like you've gotta be doing some of it for yourself.
But he's also,

34
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.290
what he's getting out of it is his,
what he gets out of it.

35
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.920
But what he gives out of it,
it's not just entertaining with that guy.

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.900
What's interesting is he's,
he's also super motivational.
Right?

37
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.700
Like if he leads by example,

38
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.710
which I always really positive now w before social media,

39
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.960
when you had an action star,

40
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.440
you just had the guy that you went to see in the movie and you saw like,

41
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.120
you know Sylvester Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator.
Yeah.

42
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.440
They would do interview.
Can't relate to them.
Yeah.

43
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.590
It would be kind of interesting,
but it wasn't this kind of thing.

44
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.450
The Rock is the rock and he's also the rock on social media and he makes very

45
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:49.530
good use of social media because he just taught x right to the fucking camera.

46
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.080
And you could tell he knows what he wants to say,

47
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.590
but he's speaking from the heart.
She's still planning,
right?

48
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.720
So he's interacting with people in know who's done even better than this,

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.260
which the rock might be the best.
But on the other side of this will Smith,

50
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.640
he's fantastic.
Wellsmith hold up.
Okay,
so the movie's doing are right,

51
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.140
but Instagram is the new shit.
All right,
let me focus on this.
And it's,
I mean,

52
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.240
ridiculous how good he is on there.
