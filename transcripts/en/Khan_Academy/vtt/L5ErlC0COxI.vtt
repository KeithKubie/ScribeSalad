00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:01.857
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:05.781
is give you a satisfying
proof of the product rule.

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:08.962
So let's just start with our
definition of a derivative.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:12.143
So if I have the function F of X,

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:14.883
and if I wanted to take
the derivative of it,

00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:17.390
by definition, by definition,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.687
the derivative of F of X is the limit

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:24.155
as H approaches zero,

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:29.131
of F of X plus H minus F of X,

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.782
all of that over, all of that over H.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.058
If we want to think of it visually,

00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:37.031
this is the slope of the
tangent line and all of that,

00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:38.540
but now I want to do something

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.351
a little bit more interesting.

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.967
I want to find the derivative

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.452
with respect to X, not just of F of X,

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:48.796
but the product of two functions,

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:52.257
F of X times G of X.

00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:54.300
And if I can come up with
a simple thing for this,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.343
that essentially is the product rule.

00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:58.874
Well if we just apply the
definition of a derivative,

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:00.679
that means I'm gonna take the limit

00:01:01.864 --> 00:01:04.442
as H approaches zero,

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.710
and the denominator I'm gonna have at H,

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:09.475
and the denominator,
I'm gonna write a big,

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:11.147
it's gonna be a big rational expression,

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:13.191
in the denominator I'm gonna have an H.

00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.093
And then I'm gonna evaluate
this thing at X plus H.

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:20.686
So that's going to be F of X plus H,

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:25.686
G of X plus H and from
that I'm gonna subtract

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.601
this thing evaluated F of X.

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.945
Or, sorry, this thing evaluated X.

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:32.503
So that's gonna be F of X times G of X.

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.825
And I'm gonna put a
big, awkward space here

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.683
and you're gonna see why in a second.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:39.121
So if I just, if I evaluate this at X,

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.878
this is gonna be minus

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:44.711
F of X, G of X.

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.240
All I did so far is I just
applied the definition

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.841
of the derivative, instead
of applying it to F of X,

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.511
I applied it to F of X times G of X.

00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:55.415
So you have F of X plus H, G of X plus H

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.994
minus F of X, G of X,

00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:58.340
all of that over H.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.516
Limit as H approaches zero.

00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:04.326
Now why did I put this
big, awkward space here?

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:06.114
Because just the way I've
written it write now,

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.366
it doesn't seem easy to
algebraically manipulate.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.293
I don't know how to evaluate this limit,

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:13.055
there doesn't seem to be
anything obvious to do.

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:14.914
And what I'm about to show you,

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:17.027
I guess you could view it
as a little bit of a trick.

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:19.441
I can't claim that I would
have figured it out on my own.

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.923
Maybe eventually if I
were spending hours on it.

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:25.130
I'm assuming somebody was
fumbling with it long enough

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.328
that said, "Oh wait, wait.

00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:29.740
"Look, if I just add and
subtract at the same term here,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.878
"I can begin to
algebraically manipulate it

00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:33.410
"and get it to what we all know

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.918
"as the classic product rule."

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:38.303
So what do I add and subtract here?

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:41.363
Well let me give you a clue.

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.430
So if we have plus,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.487
actually, let me change this,

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:51.227
minus F of X plus H, G of X,

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:53.127
I can't just subtract, if I subtract it

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:55.078
I've got to add it too, so
I don't change the value

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:56.030
of this expression.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.940
So plus F of X plus H, G of X.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.897
Now I haven't changed the value,

00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:05.288
I just added and
subtracted the same thing,

00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.773
but now this thing can be manipulated

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:10.304
in interesting algebraic ways to get us to

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:12.997
what we all love about the product rule.

00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:14.762
And at any point you get inspired,

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.869
I encourage you to pause this video.

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.446
Well to keep going, let's just keep

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:22.768
exploring this expression.

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.433
So all of this is going to be equal to,

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.748
it's all going to be equal to the limit

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.581
as H approaches zero.

00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:32.904
So the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.962
I'm gonna look at, I'm
gonna look at this part,

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:39.306
this part of the expression.

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:42.325
And in particular,
let's see, I am going to

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:45.761
factor out an F of X plus H.

00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.850
So if you factor out an F of X plus H,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.196
this part right over here is going to be

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.722
F of X plus H,

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:56.346
F of X plus H,

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:57.599
times

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.889
you're going to be left
with G of X plus H.

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:06.749
G of, that's a slightly
different shade of green,

00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:10.977
G of X plus H, that's that there,

00:04:10.977 --> 00:04:13.182
minus G of X,

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:15.289
minus G of X,

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.325
oops, I forgot the parentheses.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.206
Oops, it's a different color.

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:22.715
I got a new software program
and it's making it hard

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:23.735
for me to change colors.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:25.964
My apologies, this is not
a straightforward proof

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:28.495
and the least I could do is
change colors more smoothly.

00:04:28.495 --> 00:04:31.305
Alright, (laughing) G of X plus H

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:35.312
minus G of X, that's that
one right over there,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.789
and then all of that over this H.

00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:41.647
All of that over H.

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.597
So that's this part here

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:47.258
and then this part over here

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:51.463
this part over here, and
actually it's still over H,

00:04:51.463 --> 00:04:53.731
so let me actually circle it like this.

00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:57.050
So this part over here

00:04:58.562 --> 00:05:00.393
I can write as.

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:03.615
So then we're going to have plus...

00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:06.674
actually here let me,

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:11.334
let me factor out a G of X here.

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:14.424
So plus G of X

00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:19.270
plus G of X times this F of X plus H.

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:23.561
Times F of X plus H

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:26.227
minus this F of X.

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.082
Minus that F of X.

00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:33.054
All of that over H.

00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:35.167
All of that over H.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.747
Now we know from our limit properties,

00:05:36.747 --> 00:05:39.254
the limit of all of this business,

00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:40.851
well that's just going
to be the same thing

00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:44.543
as the limit of this as H approaches zero

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:47.144
plus the limit of this
as H approaches zero.

00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:48.677
And then the limit of the product

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:51.092
is going to be the same thing
as the product of the limits.

00:05:51.092 --> 00:05:53.483
So if I used both of
those limit properties,

00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:57.698
I can rewrite this whole
thing as the limit,

00:05:58.578 --> 00:05:59.970
let me give myself some real estate,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.783
the limit as H approaches
zero of F of X plus H,

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:09.310
of F of X plus H times,

00:06:10.218 --> 00:06:11.835
times the limit

00:06:12.813 --> 00:06:16.435
as H approaches zero,
of all of this business,

00:06:16.435 --> 00:06:20.655
G of X plus H minus G of X,

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:23.535
minus G of X,

00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:25.207
all of that over H,

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:27.134
I think you might see where this is going.

00:06:27.134 --> 00:06:28.614
Very exciting.

00:06:29.573 --> 00:06:30.886
Plus,

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:33.318
plus the limit,

00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:36.334
let me write that a
little bit more clearly.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:41.334
Plus the limit as H
approaches zero of G of X,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.377
our nice brown colored G of X,

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:48.768
times, now that we have our product here,

00:06:48.768 --> 00:06:49.946
the limit,

00:06:50.574 --> 00:06:51.589
the limit

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:56.432
as H approaches zero of F of X plus H.

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:02.237
Of F of X plus H minus F of X,

00:07:03.654 --> 00:07:05.884
minus F of X,

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.254
all of that,

00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:08.461
all of that over H.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.343
And let me put the parentheses
where they're appropriate.

00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:11.456
So that,

00:07:11.456 --> 00:07:12.664
that,

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:14.126
that,

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:15.335
that.

00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:16.936
And all I did here, the limit,

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.585
the limit of this sum,

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.955
that's gonna be the sum of the limits,

00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:21.232
that's gonna be the limit of this

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.835
plus the limit of that,

00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:24.691
and then the limit of
the products is gonna be

00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:26.550
the same thing as the
product of the limits.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.791
So I just used those
limit properties here.

00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:30.439
But now let's evaluate them.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.550
What's the limit,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.315
and I'll do them in different colors,

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:34.545
what's this thing right over here?

00:07:34.545 --> 00:07:37.564
The limit is H approaches
zero of F of X plus H.

00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:38.972
Well that's just going to be

00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:40.757
F of X.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.655
Now, this is the exciting part,

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:44.932
what is this?

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.138
The limit is H approaches
zero of G of X plus H

00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:49.064
minus G of X over H.

00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:49.854
Well that's just our,

00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:51.503
that's the definition of our derivative.

00:07:51.503 --> 00:07:54.242
That's the derivative of G.

00:07:54.242 --> 00:07:55.938
So this is going to be,

00:07:55.938 --> 00:07:58.817
this is going to be the
derivative of G of X,

00:07:58.817 --> 00:08:01.015
which is going to be G prime of X.

00:08:01.922 --> 00:08:04.152
G prime of X.

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:06.056
So you're multiplying these two

00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:08.308
and then you're going to have plus,

00:08:08.308 --> 00:08:10.955
what's the limit of H
approaches zero of G of X?

00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:12.581
Well there's not even any H in here,

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.832
so this is just going to be G of X.

00:08:14.832 --> 00:08:17.171
So plus G of X

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:20.859
times the limit,

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:24.181
so let's see, this one is in brown,

00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.968
and the last one I'll do in yellow.

00:08:25.968 --> 00:08:28.499
Times the limit as H approaches zero,

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:30.076
and we're getting very close,

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.983
the drum roll should be starting,

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:33.607
limit is H approaches zero of F of X

00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:35.441
plus H minus F of X over H.

00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:37.135
Well that's the definition
of the derivative

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.158
of F of X.

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:40.247
This is F prime of X.

00:08:40.247 --> 00:08:42.476
Times F prime of X.

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:43.800
So there you have it.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.749
The derivative of F of
X times G of X is this.

00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:48.351
And if I wanted to write
it a little bit more

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.714
condensed form, it is equal to,

00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:54.261
it is equal to F of X

00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:57.710
times the derivative
of G with respect to X

00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:01.542
times the derivative
of G with respect to X

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:03.370
plus G of X,

00:09:04.092 --> 00:09:08.240
plus G of X times the derivative
of F with respect to X.

00:09:08.846 --> 00:09:10.402
F with respect to X.

00:09:10.402 --> 00:09:11.935
Or another way to think about it,

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:14.209
this is the first function
times the derivative

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.230
of the second plus the second function

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.971
times the derivative of the first.

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.176
This is the proof, or a proof,

00:09:21.176 --> 00:09:24.563
there's actually others
of the product rule.
