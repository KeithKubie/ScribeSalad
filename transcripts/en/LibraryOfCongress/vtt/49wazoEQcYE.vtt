00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well, today
we're starting a wonderful series.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.630
Profiles of remarkable
women from the Middle East,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.430
from the Muslim world who have
achieved extraordinary things

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.820
in their lifetimes.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.380
This project is done in
cooperation with the [inaudible]

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.350
and the Library of Congress.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.540
And this afternoon we're
interviewing Najat Khelil,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.880
one of the most remarkable
women that I have met.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.680
A nuclear physicist, a woman
advocate, a peace maker,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.420
and a delightful friend
and colleague.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.580
Najat, I know that your
life has been full and rich.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.360
Tell us something, where were
you born and how did you get

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.090
to become a nuclear physicist?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: Well, I'll
try to make it as short as possible.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.500
And thank you very much
for the introduction.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.570
I don't know if I deserve it.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.010
I was born in Nablus, and
you can tell I'm old enough

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.950
to have been born when
it was called Palestine.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.890
So it says on my birth
certificate Nablus Palestine.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.200
Then, you know, I grew up there,
of course, through high school.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.660
And I happen to be among the first,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.000
the top five in the national
high school examination.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.080
You know, in Jordan they
have an examination just

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.710
like the baccalaureate where I was
among the top five in the country.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.620
And I was awarded the
scholarship to go study.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.610
And I happen to be really good
in math and sciences in school,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.540
but I was interested in psychology.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.130 position:56%
So when I was given the scholarship,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.240
they asked me what
do you want to study?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.610
I said psychology.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.050
They said no way.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.550
You'll read it in your free time,
we want you to study mathematics

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.550
and physics so you
come back as a teacher.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.390
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
that was your parents?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.690
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil:
The government.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.360
Because I was awarded the
scholarship from the government.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.450 position:56%
No, my parents, my father encouraged
us so much he really cared

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.060
so much for our education.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.380
So I went to study

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.610
for undergraduate,
and I started physics.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.220
And once I started, I enjoyed it.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.520
And then.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.820
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
And that was there?

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.560
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: That
was in Cairo, Cairo University.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.960
Then in 1962 I was awarded an
Fulbright Scholarship to go

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.340
to the United States and
to Ohio State University

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.160
where I continued with
a master's degree.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.360
And at the time, you know,
everything was talking

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.960
about nuclear physics and
we were going into space.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.770
It fascinated me, and I continued
then went to Texas and continued

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.840
for the PhD in nuclear physics.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.980
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And that's where
you met your husband, isn't it?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.780
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: I met my
husband five days after I arrived

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.150
in the United States at
Ohio State University.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.450
So I always.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.890
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
he's also a man of science.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.110
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil:
He's a petroleum engineer.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.330 position:56%
He's a PhD in petroleum engineering.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.550
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And the current
administer of energy in Algeria.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.960
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: In Algeria.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.420
So I always tell him, you
know, you never give me time

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.840
to really enjoy myself in America.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660
You know, you got me
five days after [laughs].

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And then you
became very interested in women.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.840
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil:
Well, it happened,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.470
you know, after a long while.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.900
I graduated in 1973.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.340
Actually, when I got my PhD in
Texas, I was the first woman

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.400
in the state of Texas to
get a PhD in this field.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.700
So it was a big.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.850
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: A
big deal, of course.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.150
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil:
They wrote about me

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.790
in the newspapers at the time.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.380
After that, so from '73 till
1982, that's when I shifted.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.780
I was teaching at George
Washington University,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.720
and then the situation became
really bad, you know, in Lebanon

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.290
and Palestine, the Middle East.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.730
So I felt I needed to do something.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.910 position:56%
So I started being active, and we
established this organization there,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.170
a women's council in 1982.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.980
And then I started attending
conferences and going to seminars

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.470
and really having meetings.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.120
So it occupied me so much that I
felt I have no time for teaching.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.760
And that's when I quiz
teaching and became more active

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.290
in all women issues
and American issues.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.100
That was a change.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.860
And then I found also that
it's very interesting for me

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.950
and very important to do.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.820
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Tell me
something about your organization.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.700
Because it's a very important one,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.630
and I know that you're doing
some exciting projects.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.950
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: Well,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.830
the Arab Women's Council
started in 1982.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.360
And when we started, it was
really more political activism.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.450
Then we shifted to have it more
for information and educational.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.790
So currently our major agenda is
giving lectures at universities,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.150
attending conferences and
participating in them just

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.410
to present the proper
image of the Arab woman

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.020
which is very much
misunderstood and misconstrued.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.940
And it is very important for
us for the American public

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.610
to know how Arab women
are, their achievement,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.710
and their capabilities,
and what they can do.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.420
This is part of the work we do.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.870
Another part which is also training
for Arab women in the Arab world.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.730
And so far, we got two grants
from the state department

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.830
through the Office of
Education and Cultural Affairs

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.030 position:56%
to do leadership training for women.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.260 position:56%
We had one done already in Syria
where first we had Syrian women come

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.980
to Washington and attend
two weeks of workshops

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.800
about leadership training, and
how to establish and organize

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.750
and strategize in a
non-governmental organization.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.900
Then the second part was to go
to Syria and do the same program

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.200
for a larger number of women.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.860 position:56%
Now, we've been awarded recently a
grant to do the same work in Morocco

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.350
and Syria again and [inaudible].

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.610
And follow a program to do
it in Jordan [inaudible].

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Wonderful.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: So as
matter of fact, when we did the work

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.570
in Syria, when we went there, it
was the first time that a project

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:30.090
or a program was done
officially and right above board

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.700
between the Syrian government
and the United States Embassy.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.780
The minister of labor and
public works in Syria came

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.630
and she opened the workshop
which was, you know,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.330
for us it was really
amazing, you know.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.830
It's just a plain workshop
for women.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.130
But they give.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.520
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: The minister
gave it so much importance.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.090
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil: Yeah,
importance because it was the first

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.560
and the ambassador at the time,
the American ambassador to Syria.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.170
And, I mean, they told
us they considered

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.030
like a groundbreaking
event that happened.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.850
So that's why we're very
interested in this work.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.390
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I wish
you, Najat, all the very best.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.410
I know that you are
doing wonderful things

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.000 position:56%
and that you will continue doing so,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.500
and that you are promoting women's
image and helping women out.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.080
And this is something which
is important to us all.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.910
So thank you very much for being

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.730
with us today and giving
us your time.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.810
I know you're leaving for
Osaka in a few minutes.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.520
And so in the name of the
Library and Fulbright,

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.040
okay, we thank you very much.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.340
&gt;&gt; Najat Arafat Khelil:
Oh, well very much

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.100
for giving me that chance, too.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.230
And it's very important all the
work we're doing, all of us.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.970
Thank you.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.860
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
