ROBERT ROBBINS: Why
should we care about what

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.029
this mission is all about?

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.450
DANTE LAURETTA: We're going
back 4 and 1/2 billion years

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.790
to the dawn of the solar
system to understand

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.239
why Earth is a habitable planet,
why there are oceans here,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.030
and how did the seeds of life
get to the surface of the Earth

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.990
to trigger the origin and
evolution to humans today?

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.100
But we also look forward.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.880
Our tag line is "exploring our
past and securing our future."

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.640
Asteroid impacts are one of
the greatest natural disasters

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.780
facing humanity.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.430
And we're developing
the technologies

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.520
to get out there, characterize
a potential impactor,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.390
and if we need to, deflect that
asteroid away from an impact

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.420
with the planet.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.660
 One are the
other side benefits

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.190
is economic development for
not only Tucson but Southern

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.350
Arizona, the state, the region,
and in fact, the country.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.850
 Yeah.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.600
OSIRIS-REx has had a
huge economic impact

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.820
on the city of Tucson
and the state of Arizona.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.330
Over $200 million
in contract work

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.210
came directly to the U of A
as a result of this mission.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.959
Obviously, that's good
for the institution

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.720
because that feeds forward into
all kinds of infrastructure

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.710
and support.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.560
But to me, most importantly,
it attracts top talent

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.040
to the University of Arizona.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.580
We have the best
engineers and scientists

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.590
in the world working
on this program right

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.940
here in our hometown.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.640
Not only that, we're training
our University of Arizona

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.950
students using that expertise.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.690
They get to do real
science, real engineering,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.200
get those resumes
absolutely outstanding,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.110
and then go off into the world
and make an economic impact

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.400
of their own.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.890
 And so Dani, you're an alum.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.490
You were one of
Dante's students,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.070
and now, you're one of the
leaders of this mission

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.660
on the scientific side.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.850
 There are unparalleled
opportunities

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.220
for the students that
attend this school.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.510
We have been very fortunate.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.930
We've trained a number
of undergraduate students

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.880
just in the working
group that I lead.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.830
But there have
been students that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.350
have worked in our
engineering disciplines,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.080
helping with the operations,
commanding the instruments

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.370
for OSIRIS-REx.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.120
And so this project has really
been an incredible impetus

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.010
for training the
next generation.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.870
 Both of you are actually alums
of the University of Arizona.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.510
Tell me more about your
story about why did you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.700
choose the University of
Arizona in the first place?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.950
And how did you go from being a
bright-eyed, first-year student

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.270
to where you are now?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.400
 I originally came to
the University of Arizona

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
because it's renowned for
its astronomy department.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.960
My mom is an alumni of
the University of Arizona.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.390
And so, yeah, I remember
actually going to the Flandrau

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.790
Planetarium as part
of Girl Scout camp

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.320
in elementary school
Yeah, so I have

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.320
a long memory of
associating U of A

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.240
with exploring the universe.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.210
I actually took a class with
Dante my first semester,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.680
as a freshman.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.210
And at the end of
that semester, I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.640
sent him an email because I
thought the class was great.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.590
It was a class on
meteorites and how

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.570
they link back to asteroids.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.890
And said I really
enjoyed the class.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.010
If there's any
opportunities that you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.810
might have in your lab, I'd
love to hear about them.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.050
And we've been working
together for a long time.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.450
That was over a decade ago.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.240
 I can't imagine
another place where

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.460
you could come as
an undergraduate

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.090
and be part of a NASA mission.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.590
And this is the
second NASA mission

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.870
that the University
of Arizona has led,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.170
and that's unprecedented.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.710
NASA just doesn't let
universities do that.
