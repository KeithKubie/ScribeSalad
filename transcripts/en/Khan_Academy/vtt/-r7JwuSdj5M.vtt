00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.317
We have multiple
lengths of time here,

00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:03.650
and they're measured in minutes.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.108
So what we want to
do is say, well,

00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:07.020
what's an equivalent
number of seconds?

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.000
And so the first one is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
1 minute is equal to 60 seconds.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.910
By definition, a second
is 1/60 of a minute.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.720
But what about 5 minutes?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.380
Well, we could try
to visualize that.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.050
If 1 minute-- so let's say
that is 1 minute-- if that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.150
is equal to 60 seconds,
then 5 minutes--

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.270
let's just make
five copies of this.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:42.950
So that's 1, 2, minutes,
3, minutes, 4 minutes,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.590
and then 5 minutes.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.330
So you see that 5 minutes
would be 5 times 60 seconds.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.650
And 5 times 60 is 300.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.880
So here you have
so this is going

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.610
to be 5 times 60, which
is equal to 300 seconds.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.535
So what about 10 minutes?

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:05.960
Well, same idea.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.480
10 times 60 is 600 seconds.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.470
And what about 60 minutes?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.580
Well, 60 minutes or 60 seconds
per minute times 60 minutes

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.254
is equal to 3,600 seconds.

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:23.170
So that's interesting.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.044
Let's take things a
little bit further other.

00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:34.430
Let's convert between
hours, minutes, and seconds.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.570
So let's start
off with something

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.870
that's a little bit
more straightforward.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.720
Let's say that we have 1 hour.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.800
Well, we know by definition 1
hour is equal to 60 minutes.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.060
And how many seconds
is 60 minutes equal to?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.650
Well, we just figured that out.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.470
60 minutes times 60
seconds per minute

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.020
gets us to 3,600 seconds.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.160
Now, what about 2 hours?

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.050
Well, it would be
the same exact idea.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.270
60 minutes per hour,
if I have 2 hours,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.686
it's going to be 2 times 60.

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:19.870
2 hours times 60 minutes
per hour gets us to 120.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.287
Well, how many seconds
is that going to be?

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:24.620
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.390
You could take 120 minutes
times 60 seconds per minute.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.310
Or you could say 2 hours
times 3,600 seconds per hour.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.820
So let's do it that way.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:46.660
So two 2 times 3,600 seconds per
hour gets us to 7,200 seconds.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.880
Now, what if we were
to say 10 hours?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.600
Well, once again, 10
times 60, 10 hours

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.390
times 60 minutes per hour
would get us to 600 minutes.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.170
And if we want to think
in terms of seconds,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.240
10 hours times 3,600 seconds
per hour gets us to-- well,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.190
it's going to be
3,600 tens, which

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.600
would be 36,000, or 10 times
36 hundred, or 10 times 3,600.
