STACY WOLF: "Why
music theater?" is

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.810
the question we asked ourselves
as soon as we wanted to start

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.100
this program at Princeton.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.360
And we are excited that
we can have this kind

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.150
of expansive vision in a place

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.590
because we're small, we're
very undergraduate focused,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.260
we're completely collaborative
in everything we do.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Wherever the student
is coming from in terms

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.120
of the art, that can lead.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.630
So the theater, the text can
lead, the music can lead,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.180
the composition can lead,
or the dance can lead.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.290
And we are supportive
of any of those balances

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.960
among these different forms.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.490
We don't have an agenda in
terms of what music theater

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.390
creation can mean at Princeton.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.320
We are excited to see where
students are coming from

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540
and how we can help
them as artists

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.480
and as scholars
to make new stuff.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.730
I'm Stacy Wolf.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.030
I'm a professor in
the program in theater

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.420
at the Lewis Center for the
Arts at Princeton University,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.080
and I'm the director of
Princeton's new Program

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.350
in Music Theater.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.810
WESLEY CORNWELL: Princeton for
me is this great combination

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.140
of the academic side and then
the creative side with faculty

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.910
that are really there to support
you every step of the way,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.240
from visual research
to scene breakdowns

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.340
to technical drawings
or costume sketches

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.390
through tech all the
way to the performance.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.480
OGE UDE: The school has been
incredibly supportive in terms

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.010
of just giving me the funding
to get where I want to go.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.650
I know exactly
what I want to do.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.380
And oftentimes, it lives
outside of what is available.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.370
And I think Princeton has been
really supportive of getting me

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.890
to that very
specific, niche place

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.920
that I have said that I'm
very passionate about.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.140
JULIA PEIPERl: I have
had this guidance that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.480
has helped me to
radically increase

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.990
the quality of my
work, or at least

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.910
the quality of my research
and the foundations

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.790
that are going into my work.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160
And that's because
of the classes

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.400
that I've gotten to take.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880
STACY WOLF: And we very
much pride ourselves

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.810
on balancing scholarly
pursuits and artistic pursuits,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.460
performance and creation.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.140
All of our students are scholar-
artists and artist-scholars.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.450
We do not see the difference
between making scholarship

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.970
and making art.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.790
WESLEY CORNWELL: And you
have an incredible diversity

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.880
of academic backgrounds
all being brought

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.320
into the same classroom
for the same project,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.940
asking the same questions.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.190
And that diversity of
academic thoughts, I think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.540
yields so many more
interesting results.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.820
The combination of intellectual
rigor and creativity

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.620
is really astonishing
and something

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.240
I've found immensely rewarding.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.950
STACY WOLF: We've had
directors, designers, critics,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.490
musical directors.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.930
And they come to class and
talk about what they've done,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.260
how they've made their careers.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.130
They engage with the students.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.330
And because we're so
close to New York,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210
it's very easy for them
to hop on the train

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.300
and come and spend
an afternoon with us.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.700
And to have access to
artists in that way

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.640
is absolutely
unique and amazing.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.500
DEAN MOSS: What I
like about students,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.590
and Princeton students in
particular, is their openness.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.880
They come from a wide range
of academic experience

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.600
that they bring to the
art-making process.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.680
And it's their love of making
art that forces this to happen.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.680
And I have been excited
by that engagement

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.260
and what they
bring to the table.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.220
BILLY COHEN: The resources
are obviously crazy,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.910
but what I like about it
is the professors take

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.120
a genuine interest in
each and every student,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.540
no matter what
their background is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.960
or what they plan on doing
with theater or musical theater

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.790
in the future.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.110
They really focus on bringing
to life what each student is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.060
capable of doing every day.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.000
STACY WOLF: This program very
specifically is music theater,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.240
so it does include
the Broadway musical.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.920
It also includes opera.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.960
We have a very strong opera
program here as well as

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.980
what we think of as more
avant garde music theater,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.190
different ways that music
theater, dance, text

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.900
and performance
all come together

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.640
to make an entirely
new hybrid form.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.990
