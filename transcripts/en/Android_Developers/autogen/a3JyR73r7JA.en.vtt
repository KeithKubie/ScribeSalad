00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 Hi everyone, I'm the Navy's grandson. 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 team of help boats google brazil and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 Let's see this video some today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.480
 details that can take your ep to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.960
 next level 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.279
 but what do you want with your ep and you? 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.099
 Do you want money, you want fame? 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.179
 I do not think we know what you mean. 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.949
 would you like 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 also in this list of categories besides 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 highlights what you want is that your 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.170
 season is there as a highlight in the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 google play because it's here it's 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.570
 a way to reach more people from 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 have more downloads to be more relevant 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.930
 and there is a novelty now the system has 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.899
 perceived that we have the year to google 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 collection of exclusive collections and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.199
 also located 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.059
 so it's another opportunity you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.149
 who already knows the Brazilian market well 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.539
 makes your ep stand out and a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.430
 reference to Brazilian debtors 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.930
 first step you achieve this is that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 You have to follow the grizzlies to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.150
 android platform you are seeing there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 some links a part about quality 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.869
 of android apps you go 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 to find eagles, including cases of 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.119
 test to see if your ep is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.580
 also adhering to the guidelines 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 very important design has a design 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.049
 and graphic interface that pleases the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 users to be relevant because it is a 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.350
 people are an era 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 people want to install and have 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.470
 utility and of course work 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.049
 is a time that works without bugs in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.780
 that the person can trust his or her 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 application has an important 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.000
 reaching this next level is not having a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 provocative visual always up to date 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.659
 Let's show a point here that can 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 happen that can be an indication with 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.610
 a face not so updated so the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.189
 people take this screen that looks like 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.710
 wrong looks nothing is a screen has 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.570
 a list in which the buttons of the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.520
 android operating system and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.819
 first look like this has nothing 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.099
 It is different to draw attention 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.830
 three dots in the corner there are who 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.960
 options call - virtual 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.700
 lippi compatibility issue because 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 is that they were developed by versions 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.890
 android and needed the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.930
 menu button are supported by this 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.080
 version of android but in many cases 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.690
 this button has no use that either does not have a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.270
 number 1 or what do you think people 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 is using for example a show bar 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.030
 So what do we do this? 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 corrected does not appear without 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.910
 need is very simple in the manifesto 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.850
 You'll change ownership times. 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.020
 through the latest version available 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.450
 android 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.030
 so remember always keep the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.170
 tactical property is with the last 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.570
 version available 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 so it will not need to display 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.459
 simon of compatibility without necessity 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
 and if you use the menu it will 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.330
 display a correct time 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.910
 another important point to consider 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.230
 continues to design your application is the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.690
 water issue 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.850
 since action bar was implemented 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.740
 has also changed a little the way 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.830
 classes are being arranged in a 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.220
 application is then this theme here in 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.260
 2.3 gingerbread screen is very expensive 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.000
 he looked good at the time is a way 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.600
 correct to do the classes are in the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.550
 from above but the ideal is that you now 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.940
 update their waters for a new 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.459
 model so it is easier to use more 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.230
 easy to understand is more colorful then 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.850
 which is better the user 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.820
 something very important including 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.850
 to use the tabs heard pg that is a 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.519
 where you can change from one screen 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.750
 for another side scrum farm is the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.970
 example that is here on earth including 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.610
 the gmail part can not change from one 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.140
 message to another, this makes it 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.660
 Imagine that he would have to go back to 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.940
 message list for next to next 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.610
 message here only with the movement with 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.280
 a gesture then he changes the conversation in the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.600
 gmail thing worth remembering is 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.390
 that you can leave things a little 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.010
 more animated in your application the eyes 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.440
 likes to have constant feedback 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 things that show that you are 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.000
 happening there a little glance 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.049
 things that can be animated by your 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.220
 window application can make transitions 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.740
 transitions between 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.600
 fragments when you add remove 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.030
 a blatant of the screen 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.030
 also can but was then working 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.790
 with the alpha part of the rotation range 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.710
 heard translation devils that are 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.290
 present on the screen can also 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.390
 the layouts make transition with some in 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.000
 child is added for example a 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.400
 list or a set of objects are in the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.410
 screen or even when you change from one 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.880
 position of the other you drag a layout 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.000
 for example making a zany animation 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.750
 to emphasize that movement too 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.060
 which can animate properties and values 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.860
 of objects such as modifying the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.520
 color of an object make a transition 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.010
 of this color change and of course some 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.470
 animation how to make animations 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.930
 with frames or rotations to indicate 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.390
 always in motion a bone marrow that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.970
 has taken and you have feedback for it is 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.280
 always cool keeping the user informed 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.350
 of the activity and at the same time this 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.520
 animation gives a touch of modernity to the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
 your app 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.530
 let's go now there is a very 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.740
 important information about your application in 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.560
 android platform does not impose on the user 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.720
 how he should hold his own phone 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.510
 After all, he bought his phone. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.310
 do not you want to control how he 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.660
 have to insure any correct way 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.010
 to hold the phone 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.570
 of course, except in very 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.340
 with the games where 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.300
 the orientation has to be the same 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.280
 but the usual tone but an invitation may 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.870
 to set up your typical 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.080
 rotation the correct way which is what 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.690
 you should do good first thing 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.140
 Do you go to your fitness unit? 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.740
 tite then put orientation keyboard 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.300
 river 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.600
 you can put this is that you choose 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.550
 notified of changes in the 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.550
 device configuration 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.600
 After that, you have to deal with the change. 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.700
 this setting 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.760
 arriving here the method on configuration 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.180
 you owe about writing what to treat 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.670
 and the orientation the phone is 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.130
 at that moment it's in this case here sema 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.650
 is only making a post to show in 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.600
 40 jumping but this point should not be 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.440
 save some instance save some 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.630
 object you want to use later 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.729
 was even talking like holding an object 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.400
 in this change 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.610
 temptation when I will subscribe to the 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.159
 the NGO method has in an insistent 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.129
 I'll get an object I want to make 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:54.349
 retention and place this object 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.539
 return it through this method 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.849
 this way then the android knows that the 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.800
 object is being held in the 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.479
 memory and then you can 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.419
 retrieve this object 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.999
 you go in a method the client chooses 20 and 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.080
 will treat this object is not in the 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.349
 reminding you what to do 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.839
 because it always goes through the 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.580
 your activity 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.770
 if it is being built in the first 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.529
 or rebuilt 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.529
 so be careful then good 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:26.930
 besides keeping the visual updated there the 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:29.689
 your application is very 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.729
 important to increase interaction with 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:33.199
 its user that often it can 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.990
 install in your app 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.749
 forget about never coming back 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.389
 so the first thing take your user 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:42.740
 Back the app and warn of things 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.990
 what's going on 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.449
 notify of new authorizations of new 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.849
 features or even keep 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.919
 updated about your application 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:53.740
 here we have a link where you have 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.060
 showing the guide on notifications 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.689
 How can you implement your 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.009
 application and course leaves the basic uswitch 

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.349
 I have modified those that are available for 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.990
 you now including putting stock 

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:08.659
 the notification then maintaining the 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.459
 updated and modern application and 

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:12.259
 smooth way of the user 

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.839
 another way to increase this interaction 

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:18.199
 with the user is through google cloud 

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:19.849
 message or gcm which is a service that 

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:23.569
 sends messages from a server 

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:26.659
 for illegal android devices that gcm 

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:28.849
 takes care of both the back end server and the 

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:30.979
 mobile client to maintain a 

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:32.599
 data between the two 

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:34.909
 thus saving money. 

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:36.709
 battery meaning since it is not 

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.050
 I need each ep to take care of the 

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:42.229
 a legal example of you 

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:44.060
 using gcm is with modifications 

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:45.920
 you can warn the user with some 

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.870
 thing you asked for was ready and 

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.000
 Through the night I stayed on the ground. 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.459
 knowing that it's ready and legal that this 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.380
 it is free and without canopy you can use 

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:56.390
 your app's will 

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.510
 Also important android gives your 

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:02.840
 different forms of content from the 

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.910
 your application for this do India is 

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.100
 a very direct and simple way is that the 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.020
 always have your application 

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.360
 available on your screen or at home 

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.000
 screen com is seeing here the example or 

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.070
 including right on the screen 

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.700
 blocking of the cell with the batches 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.890
 media 

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.840
 this way even without unlocking the 

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.910
 phone and you can now access 

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.730
 relevant and relevant information from the 

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.530
 your application down here 

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.690
 we have a link that you can see the 

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.240
 guide how to better implement 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.930
 videos with good practice recommendations and 

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.550
 etc 

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.740
 but if you already have a limit and 

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.840
 developed home screen is very simple is 

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.240
 it also works on vox widgets 

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.400
 for that the first thing there in the 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.500
 of the category part of your 

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.810
 You idiot are going to cry now the category 

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.090
 you keep so that it can be 

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.490
 Unlocked until unlocked 

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.220
 then customize layout because the 

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.900
 layout is a little different for this 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.730
 in this example here we put a 

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.400
 priest in the area you are checking 

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.770
 If he installs here he will use a 

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.290
 specific layout for what you save 

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.480
 not he uses is something normal and with that 

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.730
 you can get your index you already 

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.740
 developed and also transformed it into 

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.450
 note that it would include another 

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.890
 interesting is that sometimes you go 

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.800
 need to ask the user to create a 

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:21.200
 account or register with your service 

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.430
 this is sometimes not very simple because 

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.800
 I already have to create a new password 

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:28.190
 remember your password and use it also has no 

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.630
 the security is that the actual user with goal 

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.090
 plus this process could leave 

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.790
 easier to help with this check 

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.960
 with these advantages of using google 

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.060
 plus in me 

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.070
 the first clear is that it facilitates the login 

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.990
 and enter a password and enter the 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.580
 wait for this new password it can give 

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.260
 access to the data they have already 

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.720
 certified with umbu and thereafter 

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.470
 he only uses his service with the account of the 

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.570
 Google 

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.640
 Another interesting point is to allow 

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.230
 users can share content 

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.300
 from your ep 

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.940
 so it works like a word of mouth 

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.070
 without having to invest in 

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.500
 marketing something else more people will 

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.110
 find your app and a very thing 

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.400
 cool is the power of the +1 button 

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.580
 this way users 

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.770
 of relevance and credibility the content 

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.660
 that only the ep display and so also 

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.790
 making it easier for people to find 

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.790
 Your application shows fitch is fine 

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.710
 interesting is the green and installs it 

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.330
 allows you to have a website and 

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.650
 use google plus also leave 

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.810
 on this site 

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.460
 when the user signs in 

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.520
 if he has an android device 

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.500
 associated with his account at that time 

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.790
 there in front of the computer 

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.830
 it will have a screen where it can 

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.480
 install your android app 

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.790
 look that cool simple yet google 

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.070
 places thor search for it app 

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:45.650
 will have direct the option of the installation there 

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.840
 so you can easily log in to the 

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.150
 user and life typing new passwords 

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.190
 and can reach marun of 

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.440
 installs of your application 

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.840
 good guys this was the video about next 

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.880
 web apps with some tips on how you 

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.850
 can improve your application and 

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.650
 a new level and thus achieve more 

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.540
 users and improve their qualification 

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.220
 including google play rankings 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.220
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
