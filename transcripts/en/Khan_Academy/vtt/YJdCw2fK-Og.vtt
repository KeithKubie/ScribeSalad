00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.460
So let's think about what
happens when we multiply by 10,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.050
and see if we can see
some type of a pattern.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.030
So let's just start with 1
and multiply that 1 by 10.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.460
And this, of course,
is equal to 10.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.780
You knew that already.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.940
But let's multiply by 10 again.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.260
So let's do 1 times 10.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.570
And now let's multiply
by another 10.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.050
Let's multiply by another 10.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.880
So what's this going to be?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.800
This is going to be 1 times
10, which is 10, and then that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.020
10 times 10.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.820
So it's literally 10 10s or 100.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.850
Now let's multiply by 10 again.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.180
So we're going to have 1 times
10 times 10 times 10 times 10.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.160
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.602
Well we already know that
1 times 10 times 10 is 100,

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.810
and then we're going to
multiply that times 10 again.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.460
So we're going to literally
have 10 100s which

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.650
we know is the exact
same thing as 1,000.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.230
So what's the pattern here?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.050
Well here we multiplied by
10 once and we have one zero.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.500
Here we multiplied by 10
twice and we have two zeroes.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.400
Here we multiplied
by 10 three times

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.407
and we have three
zeroes in our answer.

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:22.990
Let's do it again,
although this looks

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.650
like a pretty clear pattern.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.670
Let's multiply by 10 four times.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.150
So we'll start with a 1.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.770
We'll multiply by one
10, that's our first 10,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.690
then our second 10, then
our third 10, and now

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.220
our fourth 10.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.860
Well what's this
going to be equal to?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.380
Well it's going to be
this thing, I should say,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.800
times 10 or 1,000 times
10, which is ten 1,000s.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.470
So let me write that 10 1,000s.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.790
So once again, we
started with a one,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.165
we multiplied by 10 four
times, and we got 10,000.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.012
One followed by one,
two, three, four zeros.

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:07.970
Let me make that clear.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.740
We start with a 1.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.200
We multiplied by 10 one,
two, three, four times,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.860
and our product is one followed
by one, two, three, four zeros.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.410
So I think you see
the pattern here.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.243
But there might be
something you're craving.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:26.600
You're like, hey
Sal, this is a pain

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.680
to do this repeated
multiplication.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.570
I wish there was some
type of operation

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.390
that just did it for us.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.339
The same way that
back in the day

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.130
when you were doing
repeated addition where

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.140
if you were saying 10 plus
10 plus 10 plus 10, you said,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.764
hey, this is the same
thing as 4 times 10.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.180
There should be another thing
for repeated multiplication.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.010
If I have 1 times 10
times 10 times 10 times

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.559
10, which is really the same
thing as taking four 10s

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.350
and multiplying them
together because the 0

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.870
doesn't change the value.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.222
So 10 times 10
times 10 times 10.

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:05.680
You're saying, hey,
there should be

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.980
some type of shorthand for
this, and you're right.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.130
There is some type
of shorthand for this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.030
and it's called an exponent.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.090
So the same way if you take
four 10s and add them up,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.400
that's the same
thing as 4 times 10.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.790
If you take four 10s
and take their product,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.860
this is the same thing as
10 to the fourth power.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.700
10 to the fourth power
literally means taking four 10s

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.290
and multiplying them together.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.590
Or you could view it
as starting with a 1

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.030
and multiplying
by 10 four times.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.981
So this is also equal to
10 to the fourth power.

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:44.730
This right over here,
we started with a 1.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.635
We multiplied by 10
three times, which

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:48.300
is the same thing
as taking three 10s

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.180
and multiplying them together.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.280
This is 10 to the third power.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.780
This right over
here is 10 squared,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.860
or 10 to the second power.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.484
And this right over
here, we just have one 10

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:02.150
right over here.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.710
We just started with the one
and we multiplied by 10 once.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.340
This is 10 to the first power.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.760
And just so you know a little
bit of the terminology,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.280
here 10 is our base.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.180
The base is 10.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.040
And this 4 that we
have right over here,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.320
this is the exponent.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.520
So given that notation,
let's just do one practice.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.040
Let's think about what--
I'll do new colors-- what

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.510
10 to the sixth power is.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.094
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:36.760
Well there's two ways
to think about it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:45.940
You could view this as six 10s--
so 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.990
and multiplying them together.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.360
So we multiply
them all together.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.900
Or you could view it
as starting with a 1

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.540
and multiplying it
by 10 six times.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.060
But either way, what
are you going to get?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.180
Well if you're multiplying
1 by 10 six times,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.710
you're going to end up with
1 followed by six zeroes.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.070
We already saw this pattern.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.490
So it's going to be 1 followed
by one, two, three, four, five,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.310
six zeros, or one million.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.950
So 10 to the sixth power
is the same thing as 1

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.360
being multiplied
by 10 six times.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.760
We're taking six 10s and
multiplying them together.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.440
And that's going to be equal to
1 followed by six zeros, which

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.230
is this pattern we
saw or one million.
