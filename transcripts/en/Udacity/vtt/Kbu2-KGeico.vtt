00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.820
Why is it that the product of two
negative numbers is positive?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.920
An analogy might help us understand why.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.670
Let's say I invite Sarah
to my pizza party.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.230
We can think of coming to my
pizza party as a positive.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.050
Sarah says she might
not come to my party.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.220
We can think of that as a negative.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.790
If I then say to Sarah,
do not, not come to my party,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.920
that's the same thing as saying,
come to my party.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.897
The word not here can be
thought of as negative.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.497
So when there are two
negatives in a row,

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:36.186
they effectively cancel each other out.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:40.699
So with that in mind,
what is -3 times -2?

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.610
And just so you know,
this dot means multiply.
