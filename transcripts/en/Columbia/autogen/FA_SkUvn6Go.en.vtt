World Economic Forum was happening when
 

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:29.990
World Economic Forum was happening when
they started shifting once more away

01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000
they started shifting once more away
 

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.140
they started shifting once more away
from the net centric view to a new view

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:33.150
from the net centric view to a new view
 

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.600
from the net centric view to a new view
that was kind of a hybrid between

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:34.610
that was kind of a hybrid between
 

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:37.670
that was kind of a hybrid between
strategic rival and net centric which

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:37.680
strategic rival and net centric which
 

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.100
strategic rival and net centric which
they called the axis of evil which was

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:40.110
they called the axis of evil which was
 

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:42.950
they called the axis of evil which was
minor strategic rivals which now started

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960
minor strategic rivals which now started
 

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.290
minor strategic rivals which now started
being defined as North Korea all these

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300
being defined as North Korea all these
 

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.270
being defined as North Korea all these
sort of elements and they viewed it more

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280
sort of elements and they viewed it more
 

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.880
sort of elements and they viewed it more
as a trans corporate element right so we

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:49.890
as a trans corporate element right so we
 

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:52.130
as a trans corporate element right so we
came in interactions right about the

01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140
came in interactions right about the
 

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.410
came in interactions right about the
shift of that and what happened was we

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420
shift of that and what happened was we
 

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.930
shift of that and what happened was we
did have marches quite large and of

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940
did have marches quite large and of
 

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.190
did have marches quite large and of
course there were cops everywhere and

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:58.200
course there were cops everywhere and
 

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.380
course there were cops everywhere and
the virtual sit-in had I think we have

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:00.390
the virtual sit-in had I think we have
 

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.840
the virtual sit-in had I think we have
800,000 people worldwide joined the

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:02.850
800,000 people worldwide joined the
 

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:04.670
800,000 people worldwide joined the
World Economic Forum site went down

01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:04.680
World Economic Forum site went down
 

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.140
World Economic Forum site went down
after about seven hours did it go down

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:09.150
after about seven hours did it go down
 

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:11.360
after about seven hours did it go down
because of our virtual sit-in my

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:11.370
because of our virtual sit-in my
 

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:14.000
because of our virtual sit-in my
response to the people and the officials

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:14.010
response to the people and the officials
 

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:16.520
response to the people and the officials
and the newspaper was that I felt that

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:16.530
and the newspaper was that I felt that
 

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.070
and the newspaper was that I felt that
the World Economic Forum's site was as

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080
the World Economic Forum's site was as
 

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.140
the World Economic Forum's site was as
flimsy as the World Economic Forum's

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:21.150
flimsy as the World Economic Forum's
 

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:23.420
flimsy as the World Economic Forum's
economic policies so it didn't take very

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:23.430
economic policies so it didn't take very
 

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.000
economic policies so it didn't take very
much for it to crumble and I couldn't

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.010
much for it to crumble and I couldn't
 

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.650
much for it to crumble and I couldn't
really say that it was us because there

01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:27.660
really say that it was us because there
 

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.780
really say that it was us because there
were people inside Waldorf who said

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:29.790
were people inside Waldorf who said
 

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:31.640
were people inside Waldorf who said
there are wireless PDAs and whatnot

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:31.650
there are wireless PDAs and whatnot
 

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.340
there are wireless PDAs and whatnot
weren't working very well so you know

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:34.350
weren't working very well so you know
 

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.340
weren't working very well so you know
again this nuance kind of navigation

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:37.350
again this nuance kind of navigation
 

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.820
again this nuance kind of navigation
between did we or didn't win and you

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:40.830
between did we or didn't win and you
 

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.080
between did we or didn't win and you
know so it's that question of

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:42.090
know so it's that question of
 

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:44.390
know so it's that question of
performativity and again because it is

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400
performativity and again because it is
 

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.630
performativity and again because it is
performance because it is HTML

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640
performance because it is HTML
 

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.160
performance because it is HTML
conceptualism it is difficult for them

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:49.170
conceptualism it is difficult for them
 

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.150
conceptualism it is difficult for them
to pinpoint it as a real or how should I

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:53.160
to pinpoint it as a real or how should I
 

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.160
to pinpoint it as a real or how should I
say in techno realism it would be

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:55.170
say in techno realism it would be
 

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.740
say in techno realism it would be
distributed denial-of-service right but

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:57.750
distributed denial-of-service right but
 

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.200
distributed denial-of-service right but
remember we're transparent we don't hide

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:00.210
remember we're transparent we don't hide
 

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.030
remember we're transparent we don't hide
we let everybody know what we're going

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040
we let everybody know what we're going
 

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:02.359
we let everybody know what we're going
to do

01:13:02.359 --> 01:13:02.369
to do
 

01:13:02.369 --> 01:13:04.370
to do
so it goes against kind of digitally

01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380
so it goes against kind of digitally
 

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.680
so it goes against kind of digitally
correct manner and then the other thing

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:06.690
correct manner and then the other thing
 

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.750
correct manner and then the other thing
that the NSA was very angry at us and

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760
that the NSA was very angry at us and
 

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.109
that the NSA was very angry at us and
our hackers and activists net activists

01:13:12.109 --> 01:13:12.119
our hackers and activists net activists
 

01:13:12.119 --> 01:13:13.550
our hackers and activists net activists
get angry about this is the use of

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560
get angry about this is the use of
 

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.189
get angry about this is the use of
simulation right because basically the

01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199
simulation right because basically the
 

01:13:16.199 --> 01:13:17.689
simulation right because basically the
self at least the flood net as that as

01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699
self at least the flood net as that as
 

01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.970
self at least the flood net as that as
the Socrates does taught us is you know

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980
the Socrates does taught us is you know
 

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.770
the Socrates does taught us is you know
like paper airplanes it's a simulation

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780
like paper airplanes it's a simulation
 

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.169
like paper airplanes it's a simulation
of something and what happens is that a

01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179
of something and what happens is that a
 

01:13:24.179 --> 01:13:27.169
of something and what happens is that a
lot of people are so deeply involved and

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179
lot of people are so deeply involved and
 

01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:29.780
lot of people are so deeply involved and
passionate about simulation and that

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:29.790
passionate about simulation and that
 

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:31.839
passionate about simulation and that
they actually start seeing it as real

01:13:31.839 --> 01:13:31.849
they actually start seeing it as real
 

01:13:31.849 --> 01:13:34.729
they actually start seeing it as real
right it's sort of like remember nichy's

01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739
right it's sort of like remember nichy's
 

01:13:34.739 --> 01:13:37.520
right it's sort of like remember nichy's
phrase we shall not be rid of God till

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:37.530
phrase we shall not be rid of God till

we're rid of grammar in a certain sense

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:39.570
we're rid of grammar in a certain sense
 

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.600
we're rid of grammar in a certain sense
we can change that too we should not be

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:41.610
we can change that too we should not be
 

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:44.750
we can change that too we should not be
rid of the matrix until we are rid of

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760
rid of the matrix until we are rid of
 

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.359
rid of the matrix until we are rid of
special effects right and in a certain

01:13:47.359 --> 01:13:47.369
special effects right and in a certain
 

01:13:47.369 --> 01:13:49.510
special effects right and in a certain
sense the NS a love special effects

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520
sense the NS a love special effects
 

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.890
sense the NS a love special effects
right and one of the elements is they

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900
right and one of the elements is they
 

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.390
right and one of the elements is they
begin to believe those special effects

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400
begin to believe those special effects
 

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.060
begin to believe those special effects
are real but because as we said we use

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.070
are real but because as we said we use
 

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:58.220
are real but because as we said we use
simulation as this up a thesis taught us

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:58.230
simulation as this up a thesis taught us
 

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.379
simulation as this up a thesis taught us
so it's difficult for them to say it's

01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:00.389
so it's difficult for them to say it's
 

01:14:00.389 --> 01:14:04.640
so it's difficult for them to say it's
illegal right and when the NSA asked us

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:04.650
illegal right and when the NSA asked us
 

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:08.930
illegal right and when the NSA asked us
about it we said the reason you are so

01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940
about it we said the reason you are so
 

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.300
about it we said the reason you are so
angry and simulation makes you so angry

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:11.310
angry and simulation makes you so angry
 

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.580
angry and simulation makes you so angry
is that you feel like the character in

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:13.590

is a play to simulation the bad guy's

01:14:42.589 --> 01:14:42.599
is a play to simulation the bad guy's
 

01:14:42.599 --> 01:14:44.300

so the Pentagon and the NSA were

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280
so the Pentagon and the NSA were
 

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.640
so the Pentagon and the NSA were
basically like country bumpkins right

basically like country bumpkins right
 

01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:51.830
basically like country bumpkins right
they believed because the simulation

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840
they believed because the simulation
 

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.379
they believed because the simulation
created such sense of emotive realism

01:14:54.379 --> 01:14:54.389
created such sense of emotive realism
 

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:58.459
created such sense of emotive realism
that it was actually happening which I

think makes him even angrier because
 

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:03.020
think makes him even angrier because
they can deal with the techno realistic

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:03.030
they can deal with the techno realistic
 

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:05.600
they can deal with the techno realistic
view of things but it's difficult to get

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:05.610
view of things but it's difficult to get
 

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.729
view of things but it's difficult to get
deeper into the techno realism of the

01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739
deeper into the techno realism of the
 

01:15:07.739 --> 01:15:10.160
deeper into the techno realism of the
simulated sense of empathy that occurs

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.170
simulated sense of empathy that occurs
 

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:13.419
simulated sense of empathy that occurs
and I think psychologically that really

01:15:13.419 --> 01:15:13.429
and I think psychologically that really
 

01:15:13.429 --> 01:15:15.950
and I think psychologically that really
what is not happening well you series

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960
what is not happening well you series
 

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.280
what is not happening well you series
why we basically what happens is they

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.290
why we basically what happens is they
 

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:21.080
why we basically what happens is they
they believe that distributed

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:21.090
they believe that distributed
 

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:23.090
they believe that distributed
denial-of-service is taking place this

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100
denial-of-service is taking place this
 

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.640
denial-of-service is taking place this
is under techno realism right that it is

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:25.650
is under techno realism right that it is
 

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:27.770
is under techno realism right that it is
a you know effective tool that will

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780
a you know effective tool that will
 

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.870
a you know effective tool that will
bring down our networks that's what they

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880
bring down our networks that's what they
 

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.070
bring down our networks that's what they
believe right it's sort of like Hamlet

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080
believe right it's sort of like Hamlet
 

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.950
believe right it's sort of like Hamlet
has a sword and you believe the sword is

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960
has a sword and you believe the sword is
 

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.330
has a sword and you believe the sword is
real and he's going to stab somebody

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340
real and he's going to stab somebody
 

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.160
real and he's going to stab somebody
it's very motive but basically we're

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:37.170
it's very motive but basically we're
 

01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:39.410
it's very motive but basically we're
creating a simulation of that sort of

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420
creating a simulation of that sort of
 

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:46.399
creating a simulation of that sort of
event no what I'm saying is that well

01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:46.409
event no what I'm saying is that well
 

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.109
event no what I'm saying is that well
what I'm saying is that I remember I

01:15:48.109 --> 01:15:48.119
what I'm saying is that I remember I
 

01:15:48.119 --> 01:15:49.820
what I'm saying is that I remember I
started off that cyberspace is a mass

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:49.830
started off that cyberspace is a mass
 

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:52.250
started off that cyberspace is a mass
consensual hallucination right so

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:52.260
consensual hallucination right so
 

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.439
consensual hallucination right so
basically people gather by the hundreds

01:15:54.439 --> 01:15:54.449
basically people gather by the hundreds
 

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:56.899
basically people gather by the hundreds
of thousands and we hallucinate that we

01:15:56.899 --> 01:15:56.909
of thousands and we hallucinate that we
 

01:15:56.909 --> 01:15:58.910
of thousands and we hallucinate that we
are creating an untimely weight of human

01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920
are creating an untimely weight of human
 

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.700
are creating an untimely weight of human
beings in a digital space and this

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:01.710
beings in a digital space and this
 

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:04.580

performance creates a certain techno

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:04.590
performance creates a certain techno
 

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:06.770
performance creates a certain techno
realistic response by the community of

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780
realistic response by the community of
 

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.080
realistic response by the community of
power right but once the community of

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:09.090
power right but once the community of
 

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:11.330
power right but once the community of
power responds they discover that what

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340
power responds they discover that what
 

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.680
power responds they discover that what
they're responding to is paper airplanes

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:14.690
they're responding to is paper airplanes
 

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.970
they're responding to is paper airplanes
signifiers that signify something else

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980
signifiers that signify something else
 

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:21.620
signifiers that signify something else
right maíam technology so it just makes

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:21.630
right maíam technology so it just makes
 

01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:34.270
right maíam technology so it just makes
them uncomfortable it disturbs them

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280
 

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.720
yes no no no what we're saying is what

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:38.730
yes no no no what we're saying is what
 

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:39.380
yes no no no what we're saying is what
we're saying

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:39.390
we're saying
 

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.780
we're saying
no no what we're saying is those people

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:41.790
no no what we're saying is those people
 

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:44.570
no no what we're saying is those people
were there they did create a simulated

01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580
were there they did create a simulated
 

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.720
were there they did create a simulated
effect right it's sort of like when you

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:47.730
effect right it's sort of like when you
 

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:49.880
effect right it's sort of like when you
do a march down the street and you have

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:49.890
do a march down the street and you have
 

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:52.040
do a march down the street and you have
Bread and Puppet you basically have a

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:52.050
Bread and Puppet you basically have a
 

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:54.350
Bread and Puppet you basically have a
mass community gathering creating a

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360
mass community gathering creating a
 

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.780
mass community gathering creating a
gesture now is this a gesture of war all

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:56.790
gesture now is this a gesture of war all
 

01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:58.310
gesture now is this a gesture of war all
these sort of things no it's a gesture

01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320
these sort of things no it's a gesture
 

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.440
these sort of things no it's a gesture
of kind of creating a narrative and

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:00.450
of kind of creating a narrative and
 

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:03.290
of kind of creating a narrative and
basically that happens in this space but

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300
basically that happens in this space but
 

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.110
basically that happens in this space but
the net art element is that we give it a

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120
the net art element is that we give it a
 

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.990
the net art element is that we give it a
tweak right and we say them it's a mass

01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000
tweak right and we say them it's a mass
 

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.570
tweak right and we say them it's a mass
hallucination based on the weight of

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580

simulation of meaning a political
meaning of symbolic efficacy as opposed

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:18.810
meaning of symbolic efficacy as opposed
 

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:21.530
meaning of symbolic efficacy as opposed
to technological efficiency right which

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540
to technological efficiency right which
 

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:38.930
to technological efficiency right which
is what they see yes well one of the

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940
is what they see yes well one of the
 

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.370
is what they see yes well one of the
interesting I mean there were several in

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380
interesting I mean there were several in
 

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.890
interesting I mean there were several in
99 several kind of large gatherings

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900
99 several kind of large gatherings
 

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.260
99 several kind of large gatherings
right there were there yes there were

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:45.270
right there were there yes there were
 

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:47.570
right there were there yes there were
activists who who merged everywhere

01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580
activists who who merged everywhere
 

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.150
activists who who merged everywhere
using these sort of technologies and of

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:50.160
using these sort of technologies and of
 

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.590
using these sort of technologies and of
course there was the building of the

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600
course there was the building of the
 

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.660
course there was the building of the
streets up to Seattle I write all those

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:53.670
streets up to Seattle I write all those
 

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.070
streets up to Seattle I write all those
sort of things and one of the things

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080
sort of things and one of the things
 

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.070
sort of things and one of the things
that started happening is that in 2000 I

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080
that started happening is that in 2000 I
 

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.050
that started happening is that in 2000 I
started being invited to hacker

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060
started being invited to hacker
 

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.450
started being invited to hacker
conferences where they had actual

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460
conferences where they had actual
 

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.980
conferences where they had actual
electronic civil disobedience and

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:03.990
electronic civil disobedience and
 

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.960
electronic civil disobedience and
hacktivism as part of their dialogue

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:05.970
hacktivism as part of their dialogue
 

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:09.590
hacktivism as part of their dialogue
which in 1991 when I talked to 2600 they

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600
which in 1991 when I talked to 2600 they
 

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.530
which in 1991 when I talked to 2600 they
said ooh go away you know it smells now

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540
said ooh go away you know it smells now
 

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.630
said ooh go away you know it smells now
one of the things that happened at 2600

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640
one of the things that happened at 2600
 

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.580
one of the things that happened at 2600
in 2000 at I think it was called hope

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:16.590
in 2000 at I think it was called hope

you know they all went down cult of the
 

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.380
you know they all went down cult of the
dead cow is a very famous hacker group

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:24.390
dead cow is a very famous hacker group
 

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:29.150
dead cow is a very famous hacker group
okay sorry 2600 is another one and new

01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:29.160
okay sorry 2600 is another one and new

convention which to me was the first

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:36.510
convention which to me was the first
 

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:38.450
convention which to me was the first
time in which there was a crossover from

01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460
time in which there was a crossover from
 

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.940
time in which there was a crossover from
a very hardcore hacker community with

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:40.950
a very hardcore hacker community with
 

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:43.100
a very hardcore hacker community with
the street community the next level was

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:43.110
the street community the next level was
 

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:45.320
the street community the next level was
to get the street community involved

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:45.330
to get the street community involved
 

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:46.940
to get the street community involved
with a certain level of hacktivism

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:46.950
with a certain level of hacktivism
 

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.430
with a certain level of hacktivism
and that started happening when I was

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440
and that started happening when I was
 

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.960
and that started happening when I was
invited by different communities in

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:50.970
invited by different communities in
 

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:53.600
invited by different communities in
Australia and Germany to help develop

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:53.610
Australia and Germany to help develop

Australia and Germany to help develop
and coordinate actions for them one of

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:56.190
and coordinate actions for them one of
 

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.920
and coordinate actions for them one of
the interesting actions was one called

the interesting actions was one called
 

01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:59.630
the interesting actions was one called
the deportation class action against

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:25.010
emerged for a very long time and then so
 

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.940

you have these kind of cyclical periods

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:26.950
you have these kind of cyclical periods
 

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:30.310
you have these kind of cyclical periods
why you hope in every cycle is that

01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320

right and so at this point in time I

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:40.130
right and so at this point in time I
 

01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:42.820
right and so at this point in time I
