00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.970
Branch piction and if conversion help us eliminate most of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.410
the pipeline problems caused by control hazards. But data dependencies can

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
also prevent us from finishing one instruction every single cycle. So,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.260
what can we do about data dependencies? And why stop at only one instruction per

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.280
cycle? In this lesson we will learn about instruction level parallelism which

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.010
tells us how many instructions could be possibly executed in any given cycle.
