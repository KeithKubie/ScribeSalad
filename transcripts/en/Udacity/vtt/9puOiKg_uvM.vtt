00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now for the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The user has reported the bug, and Dora has confirmed it is valid.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It got assigned to Erol, but Erol now already has fixed the bug.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, we're currently in a resolved state.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What has not happened yes is that somebody else has verified the fix,,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what also has not happened yet is that the fix actually shipped to the user--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for instance, by releasing a new product.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Therefore, the correct answer is resolved.
