NORA SWITHENBANK:
My name is Nora,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.500
and I'm a partner development
manager on the Google Play

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.880
Games team.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.680
I'm very excited
to be here today,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.900
because I get to
speak about a subject

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.130
that I'm very passionate about,
and that's live operations

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.800
and how LiveOps can help
you engage your gaming

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.594
communities to create long term
player retention and value.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.570
So, to kick off our agenda,
I'll start with a framework

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.690
to define live operations,
that way we're all speaking

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.820
with a common language.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.500
Then I'll talk a
little bit about why

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.620
LiveOps has become so important
in today's mobile gaming

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.240
ecosystem.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.550
But really you shouldn't
take my word for it,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.740
and that's why I've
called in an expert.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.490
Keith Alexander, the LiveOps
manager for Kabam's smash

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.280
hit "Marvel Contest
of Champions."

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.760
He'll be here to tell you about
Marvel's best in class LiveOps

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.690
program, and also to give
you a few tips for running

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.847
engaging live ops
events in your games.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.490
So, what is LiveOps and
why is it important?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
Put very simply, LiveOps is
running games as a service.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
This means that your games
become a living, breathing,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.500
organic product that
is constantly changing,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.710
giving your new users a
brand new experience each

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.170
and every single day.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.950
The goals of LiveOps are to
augment engagement, stimulate

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.316
monetization, and
prevent player churn.

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:33.690
So, let's dig a
little bit deeper

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.562
into how to actually
achieve these goals.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.300
As you guys are already
aware, content is king.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.210
New content is what keeps
your players actively

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.960
playing and actively
spending in your games.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.900
The players who devote
the most time in your game

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.560
become your loyal fans
and your best advocates.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
These are the players who
have higher retention rates

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.930
and higher session frequency.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.920
Now, Kabam, has lovingly coined
these players the regulars,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.560
but for all you
Norm Peterson fans

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.769
out there-- anyone who
knows what "Cheers"

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.130
is-- it's the Norm Petersons.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.100
High engagement and
retention are the keys

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.040
to creating long
term lifetime value,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
because in the world of
mobile gaming content is king.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.130
And that means that time
on device equals money.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.590
Your most active
and engaged players

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.120
are more likely to
have higher LTV curves.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.700
So, another way to
think about LiveOps

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060
is the strategic distribution
of content through time

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.290
limited sales and events.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.490
Now, when we talk about content
in the context of LiveOps,

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.630
we're not talking about large
APK updates and client side

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.740
features.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.530
It can be small,
server side changes.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.080
For example, adding
a weekend tournament,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.650
or temporarily changing the
drop rates in a dungeon,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.470
introducing a brand
new hero character

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.510
or a new piece of legendary
gear into your gaming economy.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.270
This new content is
delivered in mobile games

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.950
through two different
channels-- sales and events.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.130
When you sell content through
a gotcha or IAP bundles,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.180
you drive monetization metrics,
such as new buyer conversion,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.860
or ARPU.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.520
But using content as the chase
prize in a competitive event

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.535
can help you drive
engagement metrics like log

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:36.300
in velocity or session length.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.840
Making small server side
changes to your game

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.230
or strategically cadencing
small pieces of new content

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.170
that are hidden within
your large APK updates

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.930
keeps the player
experience fresh.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.814
But why is all of
this important?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.130
Kabam's CEO, Kevin
Chou, recently

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.430
wrote an article for
GamesIndustry.biz describing

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.020
the mobile game revenue curve
that he calls the shark fin.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.180
This occurs when
a mobile game is

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.120
released without a consistent
pipeline of content

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.040
to keep users busy.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.900
As you guys know, mobile
gamers love to consume content,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.070
but they also get
bored really easily.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.270
All your new content is
bundled into large APK updates,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.670
but releasing that
content all at once

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.640
leads to rapid
content consumption.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.160
Once a player runs through
all the new content,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.770
they eventually get bored and
then churn out of your game.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.890
This means that each
of your new updates

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.860
is reaching fewer
and fewer players,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.530
and the revenue bumps that
you see from these new updates

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.700
diminish over time, creating
these smaller and smaller shark

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.830
fins.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.530
In his article, Kevin
points to LiveOps

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.950
as a way to minimize
this revenue degradation.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.560
LiveOps limited time
sales and events

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.290
can help you slow
roll the content held

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.730
within your large APK updates
and thereby helping you avoid

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.380
the shark fin, and
instead helps to drive

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.740
a steady and consistent
heartbeat of revenue.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.220
But it's also important to
note that LiveOps is not

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.770
about short term revenue gains.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.040
When executed properly,
the strategy behind LiveOps

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.470
is to engage and
retain your users,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.630
to create healthy long
term lifetime value.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.820
So, to recap, LiveOps is
running games as a service.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.890
It's a strategic distribution
of content through time

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.470
limited sales and events.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.630
A consistent stream
of new content

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.480
will help you augment
engagement, stimulate

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.840
monetization, and
prevent player churn.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.920
And, finally, a happy and
engaged gaming community

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.230
drives consistent
healthy revenue

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.080
along with higher LTV curves
to help you get the most

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.870
out of your UA budgets.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.850
So, by now, you
guys are probably

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.950
ready to see some
real world examples

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.990
of these engaging
LiveOps events.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.330
So, it's my pleasure
to bring to the stage

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.870
the LiveOps Manager for Kabam's
"Marvel Contest of Champions,"

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.860
Keith Alexander.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.080
KEITH ALEXANDER:
Thank you, Nora.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.760
Just getting your
game launched is

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.725
a huge achievement, often after
months and months of hard work.

00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:31.930
But you're going to have to
keep it running after day one.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.040
What will keep the players
interested on day 30, day 60,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.130
a year?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.660
Marvel is reaching its two
year anniversary next month,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.330
and we have mountains of
more content and events today

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.538
than we did when we launched.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.890
We're lucky to be working with
Marvel, an IP with decades

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.740
of history and a deep roster
of interesting characters

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.010
and stories.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.990
We build many of our events to
tie-in with current story lines

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.590
or to create new ones in
collaboration with Marvel.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.750
Running LiveOps is
like continually

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.520
adding to the story.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.350
Some examples are
the characters we've

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.500
created with Marvel
like Guillotine, Civil

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.230
Warrior, and Venompool,
as well as the Contest

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.650
of Champions comic book.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.270
Here are some examples
of past loading screens

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.450
showing events or characters
featured in the game.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.750
We had a civil war event between
Iron Man and Captain America

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.860
over the summer.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.220
We added Loki, who was
recently a featured hero.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.350
We had a series of
quests where MODOK

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.320
tried to take over the contest.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.790
And this month, of course,
we're featuring Doctor Strange.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.620
"Marvel Contest of
Champions," at its core,

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.410
is a fighting game with
fairly simple mechanics.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.820
You dash in and out.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.940
You have three
strengths of attacks,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.990
and a few special moves.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.820
But the team
continuously has been

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.770
working on adding new variations
through new buffs, mechanics,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.690
events, and heroes.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.205
It keeps the gameplay fresh
for our loyal players.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.830
A great example
tying all of this

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.880
together is Ghost Rider, who
was just added to the contest.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.740
He was featured in our
monthly event quest

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.130
for October called
Pandamonium Rising.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.530
He has a new mechanic that
fits with his character called

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.110
judgments that have
different effects depending

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.480
on how and when you attack.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.980
He's also more effective against
villains like Ultron or Venom.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.380
A lot of work was put
into the art and design

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.679
to be authentic to the
original character.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.650
We added a new mode-specific
boost for this quest

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.530
that players could use to
complete the event content.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.270
We supported this
with a new splash

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.350
screen and a new special
event calendar as well.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.270
Just by adding
this one character,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.050
we can use events and other
small game changes to engage

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.360
players for an entire month.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.990
So, let's break this
down a bit more.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.210
Here are five tips
from the Marvel LiveOps

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.340
team on how to run a successful
and engaging LiveOps event--

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.780
the first, run a
variety of events.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.030
Variety is definitely
the best way

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.310
to keep the core gameplay fresh.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.350
The goal is to run
a variety of events

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.780
to engage different
types of players

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.600
and incentivize different
player behaviors.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.000
Here are some examples.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.380
We have arenas running all
of the time for those players

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.270
who want to compete
for top rewards

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.420
like four star featured heroes
or rare upgrade materials.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.290
But there are also arenas for
mid-range players, for three

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.510
star heroes, and hero crystals.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.940
So, it doesn't just
cater to the top veterans

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.280
but a wide range of players.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.010
This was one of the very
first events in the contest,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.000
and it promoted competition as
well as a deep champion pool

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.030
in order to succeed.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.060
In general, events
with competition

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.620
often do better
than events without

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.480
a competitive component.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.300
So, if you're limited on
the events that you can run,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.020
start with a competitive one.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.520
And this is shown
in the above stat.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.710
Players who compete
in arenas tend

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.710
to complete a lot more
fights than those who only

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.350
do quests or alliance events.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.170
Arenas are more competitive
and can motivate players

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.616
to participate in more fights.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.720
Anyone at any phase of
the player life cycle

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.310
can go on quests.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.670
These are maps with a variety
of opponents the player needs

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.220
to defeat in order to progress.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.430
The main story quests are
increasing in difficulty,

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.260
and we also have
monthly event quests

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.360
with four difficulty levels.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.900
Players can choose which version
they want to attempt and earn

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.440
rewards respective to the
difficulty they complete.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.070
These come out monthly,
kind of like a comic book.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.030
Over 20% of monthly active
users complete at least half

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.900
of a monthly cost.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.910
This might seem like
a low percentage,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.850
but it includes new
players who are more

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.250
interested in the main story.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.550
We can see from our data that
a constant stream of quest

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.990
content improves the
retention of our regulars,

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.760
and it is one of the
main reasons we continue

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.910
to build them each month.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.600
Alliance quests are also
a huge part of our game.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.670
Players work together
with their alliance

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.500
to complete a quest map.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.840
These maps can have
challenging bosses

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.290
with much more powerful
buffs, requiring coordination

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.260
from all members of the
alliance to complete.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.200
But together, they can earn
some of the best upgrade

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.567
materials in the game.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.390
Many of the events are launched
server side rather than built--

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.420
rather than based
on a build or APK.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.720
The game configurations
control pretty much everything

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.190
within the game.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.910
We use them to update the daily
quests with additional shards

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.160
and fragments earlier this year,
as well as randomizing some

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.920
of the enemies and ambushes.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.090
We can create and send messages,
launch new quests and events,

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.720
and add new sales or
promotions at any time.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.990
Our daily log in calendar is
controlled in the same way,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.120
allowing us to create
special event calendars

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.190
like the one for Ghost Rider.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.410
This gives us a great
deal of flexibility

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.630
when planning our events.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.630
And this speaks back to
what Nora was talking about

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.610
in avoiding the shark fin.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.940
The more control you can give
your LiveOps team on the server

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.700
side, the more
content and iteration

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.803
they can do without
major build releases.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.520
Periodically, we also add
special event content,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.820
often linked to things going
on outside of the game.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.580
We added factions during
our Civil War event,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.300
which coincided with the launch
of "Captain America Civil War."

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.140
Players could choose to be on
Team Captain America or Team

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.290
Iron Man.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.100
There were special quests
and buffs associated

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.620
with each faction, and
players could switch partway

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.740
through if they wanted
to earn both rewards.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.500
Chloe's Warriors of
Awesomeness Challenge

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.050
was a series of tough
battles in an event

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.120
we did with Chloe
Bennet, the actress

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.210
from Marvel Agents of Shield.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.750
And we've also done
versions of this

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.730
with Ming-Na Wen
and Clark Gregg.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.470
And our newest event is a Doctor
Strange dimensional rifts,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.780
adding portals to our
maps, in conjunction

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.230
with the release of the
"Doctor Strange" movie today.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.410
These special events tend
to shake up the routine

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.540
and have your players
change their behaviors

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.670
for a short period of time.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.100
Adapting to the
special event and then

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.927
adapting back to a pre-event
state, both adds variety.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.390
Remember, variety isn't just
the type of event you run

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.640
but also who is playing.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.410
Some players are very
into the PVP arenas

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.810
while others are into being
the best at completing the PVE

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.490
quest content.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.980
Other players focused
on social events

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.740
like alliance quests
or alliance battles.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.240
Different types of
players are going

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.980
to gravitate to different
areas of your game,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:11.640
and variety is trying to ensure
there's something for everyone.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.350
Now, we didn't launch with
all of these elements.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.330
They've been built up
over the past two years.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.140
Each layer we added was built
with the other layers in mind,

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.890
and many of the later events
we added were alliance related.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.870
The social and
cooperative element

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.090
is an important part
of keeping players

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.170
interested in your game.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:40.170
Cadence events to
maximize engagement.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.300
Major events are
planned far in advance.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.110
Some elements of "Marvel
Contest of Champions"

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.910
are sketched out
all the way to 2020.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.780
We have an amazing
backend tool called Sparks

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.990
that allows us to automate a
lot of the staples of the game,

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.840
so many of the alliance
and solo events

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.720
are set up to require
very little of our time

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.550
to keep running.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.790
That allows us to focus on
what variations or additions

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.530
we can add.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.190
So, let's talk about an
example week in the game.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.340
The arenas are constantly
running with feature hero

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.410
events running twice a week.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.590
We release a new hero
every other week,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.680
so one week it will be
for a brand new hero

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.520
and the other week it will
be for an older champion.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.680
The idea is this
gives players who want

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.760
the new featured hero-- they'll
get a break every other week.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.660
But we still have
some hardcore players

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.370
that want to win every
single arena no matter what.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.220
Alliance events are
run with seven, three,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.020
and one day durations.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.060
The seven day Summoner
Advancement event

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.580
starts at the same
time every week,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.880
but the three day events
are on a 12-day rotation

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.080
and the one day events are
on an eight-day rotation.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.970
These events have
different goals

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.040
and drive different
player behaviors,

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.670
but the staggered rotations
mean that the events will

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.470
stack up differently each week.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.520
Alliance quests are run every
eight days-- five days on,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.050
three days off.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.690
During this time,
alliances compete

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.750
to move up brackets
and earn better awards.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.580
The alliance versus
alliance battles

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.020
are about two days long.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.090
And, in general, alliances can
complete about three a week.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.980
Both of these modes
use champion lockouts.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.350
That means champions
used in these events

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.290
will not be able to be
used in other modes.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.140
This expands the champion
pool a player needs in order

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.410
to participate in
all of the content.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.400
You can't just use your one
best character or one best team

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.815
in every mode in the game.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.060
Every month we add
a new event quest

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.920
that players can complete.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.580
This quest usually includes
two or three of the heroes

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.430
that we plan to release as
a way of introducing them

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.870
to the players.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.400
Last month, it was Ghost
Rider and this month

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.230
it will be Mordo
and Doctor Voodoo.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.960
Our fastest players can complete
heroic and mastery difficulty

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.260
versions of this quest in
about six to eight hours.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.200
And if they're the
top 100 fastest,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.710
they will earn extra rewards
and a legends title in the game,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.190
so we have quite a few players
striving for that goal.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.010
In addition, there are
the special event quests

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.260
like the Chloe quest,
and every day we

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.556
run daily quests for
upgrade materials.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.850
Finally, solo events-- we
added these in the past summer.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.990
These are shorter events players
can complete on their own

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.530
with 22 hour and
seven hour durations.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.480
These are different in
that they're random.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.620
They're pulled from a
pool of possible events.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.720
Each time an event
ends, the player

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.290
won't know which
event will occur next.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.510
If you're looking for
two events to stack up

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.260
like the 22 hour general level
up event and the seven hour

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.540
class specific level
up event, you're

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.330
going to have to keep logging
in and checking the game

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.440
to see which events are running.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.770
But if you find a situation
where both are running,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.960
you can double up on rewards
for the same amount of effort.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.700
The schedule is
packed full of things

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.650
to do each week to keep even
our most voracious players busy.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.530
The players who enjoy
your game the most,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.410
the ones who are most
invested are usually

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.410
the ones that will complete
your content first.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.400
Keeping them happy with new
content on a consistent basis

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.713
is a key factor in
retaining those players.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.750
Reward players based
on participation.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.740
Different rewards from
different areas of the game help

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.880
spread out player activity.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.400
We intentionally made
arenas the best place

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.010
to earn gold to
upgrade your champions.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.910
Alliance quests are the best
place to earn late game upgrade

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.760
materials, and alliance
battles are a great way

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.594
to earn new heroes.

00:19:09.594 --> 00:19:11.510
Spreading the different
currencies and upgrade

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.330
materials into separate
events means players

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.130
have to spread their resources.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.830
And with the champion
lockouts I mentioned earlier,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.660
this leads to players
needing to upgrade

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.610
multiple champions rather
than just their top five.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.950
So, not only do
rewards promote variety

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.320
by getting players to
participate in different game

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.660
modes, it also
increases the value

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.344
of top champions and
upgrade materials.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.370
Some types of rewards-- sorry.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.420
Milestones give players
a clear goal to achieve.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.860
They know how much
effort it will

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.230
take to reach milestone
five, and they

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.360
can determine if they
want to stretch and reach

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.220
milestone six.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.880
But the very best rewards
are found in rank rewards

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.220
where the player must
compete on a leaderboard

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.590
with each other for top items.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.690
That way, players
determine the ceiling

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.720
on the effort needed
to earn the rewards.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.330
As the top players
increase in power,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.850
so will their top scores.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.070
We also use bracketed rewards.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.430
This image is from an old
version of our alliance quest

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.630
brackets.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.790
Doing well and
earning a high score

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.100
could move you up
to greater rewards,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.040
while not doing quite as well
could get you bumped down

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.870
to a lower bracket.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.970
This is an added
level of competition

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.300
as not only do you have to
do well on a given event,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.686
you have to continue to do
well to maintain your position.

00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:42.810
All of these are ways you
can reward your players,

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.190
but in general, a combination
of milestones and rank rewards

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.720
works best.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.840
Milestones work well with
a broad range of players

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.840
while rank awards entice
the smaller percentage

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.000
of very competitive players.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.570
We use data analytics to
look at the number of players

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.180
who hit each milestone
or rank reward,

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.160
and this helps us make decisions
on tuning and future events.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.360
Think globally and localize.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.360
We're continuing to grow Marvel
and reach additional markets

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.700
by adding more
languages to the game.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.130
We've added Dutch and
Norwegian in October,

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.520
and recently added simplified
and traditional Chinese.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.890
You'll obviously have a
hard time reaching players

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.740
who do not understand your
events and promotions,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.170
even if they love your game.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.450
With planning and a
great localization team,

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.570
you can greatly increase
the efficiency and reach

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.290
of your LiveOps by
improving your localization.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.740
In addition to languages,
targeted promotions

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.370
based on region or holidays
could be very effective.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.010
We've run targeted promotions in
countries like Russia, Mexico,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.985
and Brazil, and for special
occasions like Ramadan.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.240
"Marvel Contest
of Champions" runs

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.050
on one server, which means
all countries and time zones

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.690
usually get the same events.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.510
When we added solo
events, we made them

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.110
22 hours and seven hours
so that the start and end

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.990
times would not be static.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.990
So, where one 22 hour event
might start at 10:00 PM,

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.760
the next one will
start at 8:00 PM,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.850
and the next one will start
at 6:00 PM, and so on.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.550
The start and end
times for these events

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.900
change so that is more fair to
people in different time zones.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.600
This is not always
possible with your events.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.100
But when dealing
with global events,

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.975
it's something that you
have to keep in mind.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.110
Collaboration between
great teams-- LiveOps

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.420
makes the events
happen in-game, but we

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.160
are lucky to have all of
these teams supporting us.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.667
And I'll highlight
a few of these teams

00:22:57.667 --> 00:22:58.625
on the next few slides.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.520
Lifecycle marketing and
social media channels

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.740
can reach players
outside the app

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.050
and reengage lapsed
players by letting

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.840
them know there are new,
exciting events happening

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.340
in the game.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.000
That means planning events well
in advance and LiveOps working

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.220
closely with these teams.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.180
A combination of lifecycle
marketing, LiveOps, and data

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.440
analytics can make your
processes more efficient

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.710
and improve the effectiveness
of your messaging.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.580
Remember, be relevant,
timely, and succinct.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.060
Have a clear call to action,
show value and urgency,

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.300
and segment and
target your players.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.240
Your community manager
and customer service teams

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.950
are the ones interacting with
your players on a daily basis.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.190
They can provide valuable
feedback on events

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.220
and will be the first to let
you know if there are issues.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.050
When we talk about
regulars, we're

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.710
talking about long
term active players

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.920
with a love for your
game, and these teams

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.201
help ensure your
players become regulars.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.600
Teams helping extend your
reach are also important.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.280
Marketing and
business development

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.020
help us work with our partners
like Marvel and Google Play,

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.330
increasing user acquisition
through Google Play

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:28.480
featuring or collaborations
with Marvel are very beneficial,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.360
and often require
LiveOps support.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.810
We have had some of our team
recently at New York Comic Con

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.360
to meet with players
and do interviews.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.880
There was a giant booth
in the Marvel area,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.830
and we set up a
special event battle

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.860
and gave prizes
from a prize wheel.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.540
It was great for
the team to interact

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.730
with players in that way.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.260
I've heard that
some of the players

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.380
spent most of their day
repeatedly coming back

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.080
to beat the quest so they
could take additional spins

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.117
on that prize wheel.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.220
And, finally, a talented
development team

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.556
paired with insightful analytics
can create powerful results,

00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:09.430
even if it's something
as simple as improving

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.220
your tutorial
completion rate by 1%.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.650
If you keep improving
small percentages,

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.080
they will add up to big returns.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.170
The data science team is
embedded with LiveOps.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.240
Their dashboards provide
us with up-to-date KPIs

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:29.110
like retention, engagement,
and event participation.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.240
Whenever we have a
question, we can go to them

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.820
and get an answer.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.090
When we create new events,
it's often a joint effort

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.240
between the design,
LiveOps, and data teams

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.351
to build and tune the
event before it goes live.

00:25:43.351 --> 00:25:46.240
LiveOps also works closely
with the design team

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.060
on any new features, ensuring
that the launch of the feature

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.800
goes smoothly.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.850
But-- as any developer with
a live game can tell you--

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.790
things don't always
go smoothly, so I'm

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.590
going to tell a short story
about the Yolo incident.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.250
So, one Friday evening,
we were surprised to see

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:14.250
a bright orange banner appear in
the game with one word-- Yolo.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.680
And it seems that there was
an incredibly rare bug that

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.590
caused a test message to be
sent as an announcement rather

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.440
than a general chat message.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.140
So, all the players
in the game are now

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.320
looking at the words
Yolo in bright letters

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.540
at the top of their screen,
and I am so, so thankful

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.460
that it was Yolo and not any
number of possible other words

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.530
or phrases that we could
have used for a test message.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.960
The LiveOps team quickly
pulled down the message.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.420
The QA team found the
problem almost immediately.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.550
And our tools team fixed
the issue in under an hour.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.880
Our community team quickly
messaged out to our community

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.100
that it was our mistake.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.050
And by the next
morning, an artist

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.495
had created this wonderful
image-- which we posted it

00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:08.820
on our Facebook
social media page--

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.510
where it became one of
our most liked images.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.840
We were able to quickly turn a
negative into a positive thanks

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.220
to the whole team
jumping on the issue.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.330
So, here's an extra bonus
tip-- versatile tools.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.190
These are some things you
want in your backend tools--

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.450
flexibility.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.140
You want to create a tool that
can build a lot of variations,

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.720
so that you can
iterate on your events.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.060
Also, building in
features that allow

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.090
you to target groups of
players can help optimize

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.520
your promotions and sales.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.600
Data tracking-- if you don't
track and log your events,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.820
you're going to have a
harder time figuring out what

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.730
went right or what went wrong.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.670
Willingness to
iterate-- and this

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.190
isn't just about
iterating on your events.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.530
You need to iterate
and improve your tools

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.960
so that you can create
more sophisticated events

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.970
and promotions.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.200
And one last point--
scheduling and automation.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.460
Every December, the studio shuts
down between Christmas and New

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.450
Year's.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.070
But rather than that be
a slow period where not

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.100
much is happening in
the game, Christmas

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.650
is one of our busiest
times of the year.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.620
So, to do this, we build all
of the events ahead of time

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.650
before the break, then we just
push the events when needed

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.900
and ensure everything
runs smoothly.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.990
If there are any
issues, we can fix

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.330
them all server
side without support

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.790
from the rest of the
development team.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.500
By building this
kind of tool, you

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.010
can continue to launch
content to your players

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.360
in between builds,
but it requires

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.510
an upfront investment and a
commitment to maintain it.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.690
We're constantly tweaking
and building upon our events.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.930
As the game ages, so do the
players and their champion

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.280
teams.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.290
Our data team provides
us with metrics

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.400
that help us analyze
players so we

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.010
can make informed decisions
with our events and our rewards.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:15.060
So, when we're building
events, we start with a goal.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.730
What are we trying to
accomplish with this event?

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.030
What kind of KPIs can
we use to measure it?

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.730
Can we build it
without client support?

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.550
If support is needed,
we can see if we

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.120
can get it added to
the product backlog.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.610
But if we can build
it, we launch it

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.680
and we analyze how it does.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.510
Did it do well or not?

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.500
Why?

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.570
How can it be improved?

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.880
If the event goes
really well, is there

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.000
a way to permanently add
this event to the game

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.540
or build upon it with
additional development support?

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.320
By adding more flexibility
and control into your tool,

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.350
you can increase LiveOps's
ability to iterate and improve

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.951
your events.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:05.370
So, to recap, run a
variety of events--

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.650
competitive and social ones.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.610
Cadence your events to maximize
engagement, reward players

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.990
based on participation,
think globally and localize,

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:20.130
invest in talented teams and
communicate, and, of course,

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.620
invest in backend tools.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.680
One final example,
to wrap this all up,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.440
is the new Doctor Strange event.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.420
Players will earn currency
called dimensional shards

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.200
by participating in different
events over the next five week

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.610
period.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.930
The more they participate,
the more shards they'll earn.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.880
Using this currency,
they can open up

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.420
new dimensional rifts, which are
limited time quests with very

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.120
valuable rewards.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.400
They can choose when they
want to open these rifts,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.400
so they aren't locked to
any start or end time.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.070
And this new event is the
result of the hard work

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:03.210
of countless talented
people all working together

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:07.020
so that the LiveOps team
just has to hit a button

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.061
and launch the event.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.550
Thank you.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:14.000
