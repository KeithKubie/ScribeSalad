00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.340
A while ago I did an editorial about the death of the Joker, in which I referenced the comic book classic, The Killing Joke.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.639
This, not surprisingly, got people talking about the animated adaptation released on DVD, and even on the big screen for one night.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.770
There was a lot of hype around this. People have wanted to see this for years,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.279
Mark Hamill said he wouldn't play the Joker again  unless it was in The Killing Joke,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.180
which naturally led to his return, it looked like the comic, it had an R-rating, all the pieces seemed to fit into place.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.140
But then following a disastrous preview, people suddenly turned. A scene of Batman and Batgirl

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.660
doing each other started circulating, reviews were turning out very rotten, and what was originally the most anticipated

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.580
animated DC release ever became the most dreaded. Thus, when it was released, almost inevitably, people hated it.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.540
What happened? Who thought these were good choices? Where's the cinematic portrayal of the timeless classic we all know and love?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.400
While I, too, was pretty surprised at how bad some of the choices were, as the smoke clears, I do have to ask:

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210
Is it as bad as everybody says it is?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.599
Now some of you might be wondering, how the hell can I even ask that?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.239
Well, let me start off by saying, like many of you,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.250
I hated the first third.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.320
A pointless story involving Batgirl was thrown in that literally didn't connect to any of the rest of The Killing Joke,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.400
outside of the fact that Batman and Batgirl were in it.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.760
And I mean, "in it."

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.900
The reasoning for this was, not only did the film need to be longer for a theatrical release -

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.300
adapting the original comic would probably run about 46 minutes -

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.660
but Batgirl in the Killing Joke comic gained controversy

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.120
from leaning too much on the "Woman in the Fridge" trope, where a female character is killed or maimed just as a plot device.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.620
I guess it was done a lot at the time but,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.260
I don't know, I think a lot of comic book characters would be grateful to have that treatment nowadays.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.760
Hell, even a few Robins I bet wish for that outcome.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.660
I can see where people are coming from, though, and the idea of giving Batgirl more to do didn't seem like a bad one.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.900
Especially seeing how she did little in the original and making her role bigger would make her fall all the more tragic.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.640
Ironically, though, in trying to make her stronger, they actually made her weaker.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.200
By bat-bonking in what many consider an uncle-niece relationship,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.820
obsessing over said bonk by talking to her gay best friend -

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.320
yeah, we're doing that thing -

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.480
and, like I mentioned, having no connection to The Killing Joke whatsoever.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.940
Even the dialogue seems jarringly different when the word-for-word text begins in the Killing Joke portion.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.260
Just compare them.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.420
Batman: I need to know that I've made a genuine attempt to talk things over, to try and avert the inevitable.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.580
Batgirl: It was just sex, for God's sake! It doesn't have to mean anything! It's not like we have to care! I don't care!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.060
The Joker: Somewhere dark and cold, filled with the damp, ambiguous shapes of things you'd rather forget.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840
Paris Franz: Must be that time of the month.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.980
Batman: I don't know what it was that bent your life out of shape, but maybe, I've been there too.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.180
Reese: And they say the gay scene is complicated. What?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.840
Two different people wrote these parts?
They blend so seamlessly together!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.200
To its credit, the first third is animated well, paced well, and acted well,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.760
but for many people there was no overcoming this

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.000
distracting mess that left a bad taste in everyone's mouth through the rest of the actual Killing Joke portion.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.019
That's a shame because when it actually gets to the Killing Joke part, it isn't that bad. It's actually incredibly faithful.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.540
It's crazy how much they tried to get down the exact look and feel of the comic.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.040
It's about as close an adaptation you can get to a panel by panel interpretation.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.260
In an online world that hates variations from the original source material,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.980
The Killing Joke, when it gets started, actually strays very little.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.580
Like the first third, the acting, animation, and pacing all seem on track.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.940
Except this time, it actually has good writing to back it up.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.400
It's incredible to hear Mark Hamill do his Joker voice to this unbelievable dialogue.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.520
It's so cool to see Kevin Conroy's Batman talk about what could be the beginning of the end.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.220
I can't help but wonder, if the first third of this movie never happened, would it have gotten all the hate that it got?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.180
After all, people still like Return the Jedi despite the Ewoks and a lot of repeats.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.720
People still went nuts for The Avengers despite the first third being pretty slow.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.629
And with Batgirl's story having nothing to do with the Killing Joke portion,

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.500
it's really not that hard to block it from your mind.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.160
Again, even the dialogue shows there's pretty much no connection in this world.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.120
I did an editorial about whether or not the ending can ruin an otherwise good film, and like many things it depends on the eye of the beholder.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.880
And for many people, the sins of the first third are so bad they can't be removed from the final product;

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.410
whenever they think of the animated Killing Joke they'll always connect this first part.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.569
But let's just try it. Let's pretend the first third of this movie never happened,

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.880
and The Killing Joke started when The Killing Joke starts and it's only 45 minutes.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.820
How would it rate?

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.929
Would it be seen as the masterpiece we were all hoping it to be?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.589
Well, if we want to be honest, there would still be a few problems.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.780
Ironically, its biggest strength, portraying the comic line by line, is also kind of its biggest weakness.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.960
Everything from the angles to the dialogue seem copied from the original perfectly,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.900
but there is one problem with that sentence: the word "copied."

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.989
If you read the comic, there's almost no point in seeing The Killing Joke.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.820
It adds very little in terms of a new layout or designs.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.660
At least with something like Sin City, which was also faithful almost panel to panel, they had a third dimension,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.200
which meant some things had to be different no matter what, and we could see the live-action interpretation, which seems to create a different realm of reality.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.100
But because both of these are drawn, and, to be fair, isn't a ton of movement because they want to replicate the original panels,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.640
there seems to be a touch less life in the animated movie than in the comic.

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.819
Strangely enough, because comics are still pictures, you fill in the blanks about what kind of movement is taking place.

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.649
It's similar to how your mind fills in what a character looks like in a book just through the descriptions.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.399
In the comic, this image leaps off the page because it's

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.620
indicating the movement through the insanity of the lettering, the layout of the pose, and the crispness of the still image.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.220
Your imagination fills in the rest of the motion.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.420
In the movie It's taken a little too literally.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:29.280
So, rather than seeing an incredible moment leap off the screen, we're seeing an image from a comic book moved around a little bit.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.460
It looks just like it, but nothing much is really being added to it.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.940
The amount of detail you can do in a still image but not in animation should have been reversed

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.520
with the amount of detail you can do in animation and not in a still image.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:49.760
And funny enough, if the same amount of attention went in to applying the movement of the first third into the story of The Killing Joke, this could have been amazing.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.300
Imagine the movement of the truck scene done with this reveal of the Joker.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.180
There's other missing details too that would have helped make this more of a spectacle.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.000
Joker sees an image of a fat lady at a carnival and thinks back to his pregnant wife.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.180
In the comic, it just cuts to a flashback,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.220
but in a movie you can maybe show the picture transforming into his wife,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.400
or maybe the picture even comes to life starting the flashback, blending realities for him.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.460
The Joker says he remembers his past differently every time, almost like it's multiple choice,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.280
so why not have him hold his drink up and through the reflection we see his old self at a bar talking to the gangsters?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.360
That wasn't in the comic, but it would have helped give the film more of its own identity rather than just using the comic as storyboards.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.800
It's kind of like when Mel Brooks did the Broadway version of The Producers and the Broadway version of Young Frankenstein.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.979
The Producers was based on the original story,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.680
but there were a lot of changes to it, making it enough of its own thing.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.200
Young Frankenstein was all the same, just with songs put in, thus it didn't do as well.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.280
Being your own interpretation, even if it's already based on something else, is very important.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.240
There are one or two differences, though.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.680
Like there's a song sequence when the Joker is torturing Commissioner Gordon. Now, that's not in the original, but let's be honest:

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.140
if the Joker could put one in, he would.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.380
It's really not a bad idea, especially, again, in giving the film a little bit more of a unique energy.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.440
But it seems a little toned down.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.300
If the Joker is going to do a song and dance number, it's going to be an amazing song a dance number.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.960
Joker: The Musical. Think about that. It would be mind-blowingly insane.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.360
But this is just him and his carnies walking back and forth and not much else.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.180
Again, if more time went into developing this instead of developing:

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.500
And they say the gay scene is complicated. What?

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.440
that. 
This could have really stood out.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.440
In fact, the pacing could have been amazing too.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:48.240
Even though It's totally decent and passable, imagine if even more time was given to the Joker realizing his family was gone.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:55.300
Imagine if, instead of a few seconds, a few minutes were dedicated to him going nuts and realizing what he's become.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:02.520
If several minutes were added to each scene, either in dialogue or visual storytelling, this could have been phenomenal.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.240
With a comic you have to keep things short and tight because you only have so many pages you can print and so many word bubbles you can fill.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.060
And truth be told, Killing Joke was probably pushing both of those already.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.540
But in a film that's already short on time, fill it up.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.080
Maybe Batgirl could have been helping Batman find the Joker before she gets shot.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.760
Maybe the Joker could return to his empty home after he's transformed.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.840
Maybe he can tear it apart or set it on fire or laugh. I don't know.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.720
Maybe everybody could visually take in what's being lost as opposed to just talking about it.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:43.920
Even the final scene, which people in the comic are still up in the air about whether or not Batman is placing his hands on the Joker's chest laughing or strangling him to death.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.340
Granted, it'd be very tough to keep that open to interpretation in a movie, but it could be done.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:58.640
Have the Joker's laughs spring louder when Batman puts his arms on him, and have the Joker sway back and forth in emotion where it can either be him laughing or being strangled.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.560
It's tricky, but it could work. So much of this could have been downright brilliant.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.180
But for all the talk of me saying how much better it could be, here's the thing.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:15.680
The Killing Joke did technically give us exactly what it promised. It gave us The Killing Joke.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.820
Even the first third is described as a prologue, a separate story to get you ready for when The Killing Joke actually starts.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.680
It just sucked at it.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.900
However, when The Killing Joke started it did everything in its power to give us The Killing Joke.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.020
This both worked for and against it.
It does look like the comic,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.220
It does follow it as closely as possible,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.040
and it does try to add one or two new elements.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.440
Like I said, audiences can get very fickle when anything is changed from the original source material,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.840
and while the critiques I gave earlier definitely bother me,

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.780
can we really be that angry at The Killing Joke for giving us The Killing Joke?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.760
It's like if before Harry Potter there was a prologue on Ron Weasley's backstory that was written horribly.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.160
And that would be weird and suck but Harry Potter fans would still get an obsessively faithful version of Harry Potter.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.700
Would that prologue be enough to throw the whole thing off or would they still be satisfied?

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.680
Personally, I think when The Killing Joke part starts, it's okay.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:21.100
It definitely raises the question of what adaptation should leave in, take out, or add,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.720
but you can't argue that the film isn't giving exactly what it advertised: The Killing Joke with an extra prologue attached.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.260
I know a lot of hard work goes into making any of these movies, and even though the mistakes of the prologue are pretty painful,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.960
it doesn't necessarily mean it should erase what many would consider on its own an adequate representation.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.020
Amazing? No, but not awful either.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.720
Had the prologue not been there the reaction most likely would have ranged from good to okay,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:56.860
and not gotten nearly the backlash that it got. But many can't separate the prologue, and I guess that's kind of understandable too.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.880
It is part of The Killing Joke. They could have cut it out, but they left it in.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.120
You can't help what you like or dislike. It just leaves whatever impression it leaves on you.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.890
But for fans that wanted to see The Killing Joke on the big screen, maybe, like the comic,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.400
It's an interpretation you possibly may want to think about one more time.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.800
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.
