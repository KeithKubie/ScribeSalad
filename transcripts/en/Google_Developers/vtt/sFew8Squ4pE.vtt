ANDREW BRAGGINS: Hey,
everybody, and welcome back

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.837
to the Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:04.420
I'm Andrew Braggins,
and with the help

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.010
of my partner, Gary
the graphics guy,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.520
today we're going to talk
about AdMob mediation.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.500
We'll cover how it works, what
the pros and cons are, and then

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.390
have screencasts
of iOS and Android

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.452
of sample implementations.

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:18.410
All right, Gary, let's
get straight into my app

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.060
so we can talk.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.340
When you request an ad from
AdMob like this banner,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.750
a whole bunch of advertisers
compete in an auction

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.330
to see who's willing to pay you
the most to display their ad.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.130
When the auction is
done, the winning ad

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.290
is sent down to the
device for display.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.010
This competition
between advertisers

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.490
is one of the ways AdMob helps
you maximize your revenue.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.380
Now, mediation is a way
to have competition,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.240
not only between
different advertisers,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.510
but between entire ad networks.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.910
When you make a request
for a mediated ad unit,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.520
the server returns a mediation
configuration, or stack.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.120
It's a list of which networks
to request an ad from,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.070
ordered by which one's
likely to make you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.820
the most money at that moment.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.860
The SDK looks at
that list and starts

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.640
trying networks one at a
time, and the first one

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.970
to return an ad wins.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
This is where AdMob
adapters come in.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.000
The mobile ad's SDK
uses them to rap

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
other networks' SDKs so they
all have a common interface.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.890
The beauty of it
is that all of this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.940
happens automatically
under the hood.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.730
As long as you make sure the
other SDKs and their adaptors

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.540
are built into your
app, there's usually

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.720
no other mobile work required.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.430
So the plus side
is that you have

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.146
more networks of
advertisers competing

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:28.770
for your impressions, which can
mean better fill rates and more

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.820
revenue.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.970
The downside, though, is that it
can take longer to load an ad,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240
and because you need
those other networks' SDKs

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240
and adapters built
in, your app size

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.790
is bigger than it would
be with just AdMob.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.250
Also, because you're now
dealing with multiple networks,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.350
you have to register with
them, create ad units

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.450
in their network, and so on.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.600
How those pros and cons
weigh out is up to you.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.710
A lot of smaller publishers
prefer the simplicity

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.410
of using AdMob alone, while,
for others, the chance

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.650
to increase revenue makes
the extra work worthwhile.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.490
All right, time to
get our hands dirty.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.990
Let's take a look
at how you can use

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.820
the AdMob console
to configure an ad

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.427
unit to use multiple networks.

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:05.760
It's the first step toward
getting that mediation money.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.400
Is that Peruvian money?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.290
Why did you go to Peru?

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.990
All right, then.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.820
OK, so if you've created
an ad unit before,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.570
you're probably familiar
with this screen.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.153
This is the page
that lists all the ad

00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:24.162
units associated with an app,
in this case, my test app.

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:26.370
I want to draw your attention
to the mediation column

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.757
here, though.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:30.340
You can see I only have one ad
source competing for this unit,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.673
and I'd like to add another one.

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.820
So I'll click this
link and I get

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.250
a view of the ad networks
assigned to the unit.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.780
And I can click the
New Ad Network button

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.250
and choose a mediated network
to add to my own unit,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.630
and you can see there's a bunch.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.190
For this video, I've actually
created a fake ad network

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.620
with an SDK and everything.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.269
It's called the Sample network.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.060
It's just for this
recording, so you're not

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.320
going to see it here when
you set up your own ad units,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.528
but you're going to want
real ads from a real network

00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:58.230
anyway, because they
result in a real check.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.210
And you can see I put
in an ad unit here.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.630
Because AdMob uses the same
SDK that you would normally,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.190
you do need to have an ad unit
for each mediated network.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.450
Right, so now I've
got two ad sources

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.566
competing for my
impressions, which is great.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.940
One thing I also want to
mention is how they get ordered.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.550
So I can come in here and set
a hard estimate on the CPM

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.320
for what I think that
network is earning me,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.110
and AdMob will use
that when deciding

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.930
which network gets first try.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.420
AdMob also features something
called automatic network

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.820
optimization, which can
order the networks for you

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.650
based on how much
money they're making.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.720
The server knows how
much you're getting

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.970
for AdMob ads, of course,
and for many other networks,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.670
if you allow it access
to your account,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.128
it can actually
pull reporting data

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.880
and then put it to
use in determining

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.420
which source should go first.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.470
Just make sure you're
using optimization anywhere

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.860
you see it offered.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.570
All right.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.227
Once you've got an
ad unit configured,

00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:48.060
the next step is to get
the project building

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.530
with the mediated
SDK and its adapter.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.270
Let's take a look at
how that works with iOS.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.100
First I'll import the
mediated SDK and its adapter

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.400
into my project.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.711
Then I just need to
rebuild my app and profit.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.890
OK, that's money
from a board game.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.850
You're an odd person.

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:11.380
OK, here are my steps,
and I'm actually

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.060
going to do the
first two at once.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.890
Here's my app, and
this is the project

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.579
that I need to get that
SDK and adapter into.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.702
So I'll turn to the AdMob
mediation networks page.

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:22.910
There will be a link for
this at the end of the video

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.200
so you can find it easily.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.620
It's a great resource for
anybody using mediation.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.440
It lists all our
mediation partners

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.460
plus links to their SDKs,
adapters, and instructions,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.970
so you can find out the
exact steps for each network.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.480
Some networks, for
example, may have

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.520
CocoaPods that you can
just add to your pod file

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.960
and import that way, just
like you see me doing here.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.340
But my simple network
just uses a static lib,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.380
so I'm going to grab the files
and drop them into a group.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.325
Again, every network has their
own particular instructions,

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.700
so make sure you check them
to see if they require linker

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.910
flags like the Objective-C
flag for categories

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.870
or any other additional steps.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.120
All right, so that's it,
that's all for the importing.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.110
Time to rebuild my app.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.299
And there's my mediated ad.

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:11.590
Thank you, Gary, but that's
actually kind of the point.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.131
You'll notice I
didn't have to change

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:14.640
any of my actual mobile code.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.250
Referencing the GADBannerView,
loading the request,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.710
none of that changed,
and yet AdMob

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.166
was able to fetch the
configuration from the server,

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.540
then call into
the adapter, which

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.860
called into the sample SDK,
and then came back with an ad.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.640
Pretty cool, and the
only step left is profit.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.320
All right, so that's iOS.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.970
Now let's try Android.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.920
As you can see,
it's the same steps.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.460
Import, rebuild, profit.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.170
Gary, those are skeeball tokens.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.820
OK, so here are the
four steps again,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.780
and we're going to start with
importing the mediated SDK.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.120
Here's my project that I'll
be importing that SDK into,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.390
and the first question is,
where do I get the SDK?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.724
A great resource, again, is
our mediation networks page.

00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:01.598
There will be a link at
the end of the video.

00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:03.620
This page lists all of
our mediation partners

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.584
and has links to their SDKs,
adapters, and instructions.

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.000
The instructions
part is important

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.999
because different networks
distribute their SDKs

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:12.696
and adapters in different ways.

00:06:12.696 --> 00:06:14.570
Some might host them on
JCenter, for example,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.570
and I could come right
into my build.gradle file

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.340
and just add a dependency
for them and their adapters.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.000
Some networks also bundle
the adapter into the SDK.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.177
So there'd only be one
artifact to import here.

00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:26.760
The most common
setup, though, is just

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.940
JAR files, which is how
my sample network does it.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.230
So I'm going to
cut these back out.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.320
So I'll drag and drop
the JAR into my project

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.740
here and get it done that way.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.495
There's the SDK.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.350
All right, so that was
the JAR for the SDK.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.080
Now I just need the adapter,
which goes in the same way.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.480
There we go.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.440
All right, so now I've got the
mediated SDK and its adapter

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.020
imported into the project.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.090
Time to rebuild my app.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.900
And there's my mediated ad.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.400
The AdMob SDK gets the
configuration from the server,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.580
goes through the adapter
to the mediated SDK,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.420
and comes back with an ad.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.860
The only thing left is profit.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.560
So that's AdMob mediation.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.900
It's a little more work, but
it's also more competition

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.290
for your impressions, meaning
more potential profit.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.561
Again, we use banners here
just to keep things simple,

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:22.060
but you can do other formats
like interstitials and rewarded

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.676
video as well.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.050
To help you along
the way, here's

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.719
a link to our mediation
networks page,

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:28.260
which has a list of
all our mediation

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.760
partners plus links to
their SDKs, adapters,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.150
and instructions.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.840
We've also got implementation
guides for iOS and Android.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.811
So check those
out, and as always,

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:38.810
you're welcome to bring
your technical questions

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.685
to our support forum.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:42.018
And if you've got a question
about this video or an idea

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:44.340
for something we should
cover, leave a comment below,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.750
and Gary and I will
see you next time.
