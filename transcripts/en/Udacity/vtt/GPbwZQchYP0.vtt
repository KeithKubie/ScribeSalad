00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:04.700
Now we need to add the buttons for
the slow and fast playback of the audio.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.550
For this we're going to
use two UI buttons.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.710
With the main story board open and
the play sounds view control selected,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.560
let's search for button in the object
library in the bottom right.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:18.560
Drag that UI button to the document
outline directly under

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.690
the horizontal Stack View.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.620
In the attributes inspector remove
the word button underneath the title.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.940
In the image drop down
select the SnailButton.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.455
In the document outline single
click to select this button and

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:33.135
let's rename it to the SnailButton.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.900
Now let's set the RabbitButton
with the same steps.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.065
Drag a UI button under the horizontal
Stack View underneath the SnailButton.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.430
In the attributes inspector for this
button, let's erase the title and for

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.120
the image, let's select the Rabbit.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.190
Finally, single click on
this button to select it and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.820
let's change the name to RabbitButton.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.118
That's all it takes to add
buttons into a Stack View.

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:01.360
Next, we'll add the buttons for
Darth Vader and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.640
squirrel sound effects, as well
as another horizontal Stack View.
