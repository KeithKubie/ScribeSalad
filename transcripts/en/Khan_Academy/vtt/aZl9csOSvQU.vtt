00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.487
- [Voiceover] A pair of jeans
that regularly costs $40

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:05.809
is on sale for 30 percent off.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.665
As part of a promotion, each
customer will also receive

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:11.068
an additional discount
on the marked sale price

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:12.844
at the cash register.

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:17.244
If the final price of
the jeans was $22.40,

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:19.043
what additional discount was applied

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:20.890
to the marked sale price?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.281
All right, this is interesting and useful,

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.428
cause we need to know what
we're gonna pay for our jeans.

00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:27.947
All right, so the regular price is $40,

00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:29.503
we're gonna assume
everything is in dollars.

00:00:29.503 --> 00:00:31.627
It's on sale for 30 percent off.

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:34.878
Well if you're 30 percent off
that means it's gonna cost

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:37.396
70 percent of the regular price.

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:40.578
So let's put 70 percent of 40.

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:43.457
So let's multiply that times
0.7, which is the same thing

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:44.885
as 70 percent.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:49.192
40 times 0.7, that's going to be equal to

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:52.892
28, $28.

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:55.887
Right? Yeah, seven times four is 28.

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:59.985
Point seven times 40
is also going to be 28.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:01.924
All right, so it's going to be $28

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:03.665
would just be the 30% off.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.684
But the final price of
the jeans was $22.40.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:07.949
What additional discount

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:10.748
was applied to the marked sale price?

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:13.347
Well to figure that
out, we can just divide.

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:16.468
We can say, what fraction of 28 is 22.40.

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:21.468
22.40 divided by, divided by 28.

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:23.985
Well this is going to
be equal to, let's see,

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:27.131
28, and actually you could even rule out,

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.674
well I'll do the
arithmetic right over here.

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:33.648
So 28 goes into 22,

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:36.888
22.40, so get the decimal right over here.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:41.888
28 doesn't go into 22,
but it does go into 224.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:43.446
Let's think about it, how many times

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:46.023
does 28 goes into 224?

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.262
I don't know, maybe, maybe seven times?

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:50.702
Let's see if this works.

00:01:50.702 --> 00:01:52.989
So it goes seven times.

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.972
Seven times eight is 56.

00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:01.459
Seven times two is 14 plus five is 19.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.361
And then if we were to
subtract, let's see,

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.739
we could make this a
14, regroup from here,

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.998
this would be a one, so
then we regroup from here,

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.217
this would be an 11.

00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:16.280
14 minus six is eight,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.681
11 minus nine is two.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.980
Okay, so we actually could
have gotten one more in there.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.814
So let's see, this is going to go,

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:27.302
28 goes into 224

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.563
exactly eight times, eight times.

00:02:30.563 --> 00:02:33.535
Eight times eight is 64, 64.

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:38.016
Eight times two is 16 plus six, is 22.

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:39.364
No remainder.

00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:42.591
So this is 80 percent

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:44.994
of the marked down price.

00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:47.716
So if this is 80 percent,

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:51.093
if this is 80 percent of this,

00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:54.960
then the additional
discount that was taken

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.619
is going to be 20 percent.

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.301
Because you take, once
you take 30 percent off,

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:01.020
you'd expect to pay $28,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.340
but you only paid 80 percent of that.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.115
So they took off another 20 percent.

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:07.740
They took off another 20 percent.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.494
If you take off 20 percent,

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:12.849
then you're going to pay
80 percent of the price.
