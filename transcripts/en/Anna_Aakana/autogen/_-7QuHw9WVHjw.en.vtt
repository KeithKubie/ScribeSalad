00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
You know that horrible moment when you realize you fucked up?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.980
Oh fuck.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.940
OH FUCK!

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.480
*gasp* ~oh pho~
~mmmmmmmmmmmmm~

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.862
There are two possibilities when you've messed up:
you can own it, and apologize.

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:19.100
"Hey, I'm really sorry, I- I had a big overreaction to that, and I got really angry,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.840
and I said some things that totally went over the line..."

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
"...and I promise I'm gonna evaluate this and do better."

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.260
Or, you can do what I used to do all the time:

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.040
[distorted] "Well like, WHATEVER!"

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.560
I used to be horrible when it came to accepting blame and owning it.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.900
It's something I've been working on for a long time in therapy and I still sometimes have issues with it.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.580
You know, 'cause my father also never accepted blame or could ever be wrong,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.720
and that was my role model for how I should hold myself accountable with other people.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.620
But you know, therapy- parents- breaking patterns- fun.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.880
Even if it's like a misunderstanding, I was awful.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.080
Like in middle school, this guy told me:

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.040
"Oh, wow, ah. Your drawings are bad."

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.320
"Uh, excuse me sir?"

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.120
"I would have you know that I learned how to draw from my best friend Sayaka Yunaha in Okinawa Japan, and I was an /exemplary/ student,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.920
and yes, clearly I still have much to learn, but I would like to see you try and draw better

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
I don't think you could.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.040
In fact, I think you're a terrible person

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.580
Because what kind of human being comes up to another who is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.520
minding her own business and insults her artwork?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
Did you know that kind of criticism could completely deter me from pursuing creative endeavors in adulthood?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.980
Your words have meaning, they have impact, and I am at a sensitive time in my adolescent development!"

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.380
"nah bro, bad means good"

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.880
"it's... slang bro"

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.020
[distorted] "WHATEVER"

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.680
But now, I realize the importance of genuine accountability in order to ~grow~

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.340
I mean, we deflect blame because we think it makes us bad people, right? We get defensive, insecure and scared

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.180
But how often when you're in conflict with someone,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.280
would just an apology -- an authentic apology -- fix everything?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.960
Almost every single time, right?

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.340
I mean unless you've done something truly horrendous, like murder someone's mother or steal their cat,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.560
any time I fought with someone and they're wrong,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.200
all I want is for them to say sorry and try to do better.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.220
And every time I've been wrong, and I've apologized, like I've immediately felt better,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.500
because we all have this basic understanding that
'Hey, we're human. We're flawed'

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.220
'We don't expect anyone to be perfect.'

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.360
I will say my reaction time with this
has gotten a lot better,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.700
like recently I did a film called 'Go Back to China'

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.560
and one of the crew members -- adorably named Saturday -- posted an Instagram story of us saying

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.660
*gasps* "Oh my god! What a bitch!"

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.040
"Why would he say this about me?!
Why would he call me a guy?!

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.280
"I know we disagreed about politics on the bus ride from Hong Kong to China,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.220
but it's like I really liked Saturday but not anymore."

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.840
"There are no feminine or masculine
pronouns in Chinese."

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.320
"Oh my god, that's a huge misstep on my part,
I totally overreacted.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.540
I should have thought about the language barrier.
Like at least he can speak some English

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.140
I can't even say a single thing in Chinese other than 'I am a lobster' and 'Are you my real dad?' I'm really sorry."

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.860
So the next time you're wrong and you feel flares of defensiveness, insecurity, anger

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.860
- whatever you feel when you're wrong that makes you want to deflect or deny blame -

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.020
Instead just try apologizing, try honestly looking at what you did wrong, and how you could do better next time

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.200
because taking responsibility and being genuinely accountable for your own words and actions

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.060
- which are sometimes in the wrong -

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.580
will only bring you respect, the opportunity to grow,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.760
and sometimes if you're lucky, a good laugh,
because who doesn't love to laugh at their own idiocy?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.940
I'm Anna Akana - stay right here for some super bad drawings.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.340
