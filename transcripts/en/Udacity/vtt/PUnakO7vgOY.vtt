00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.330
Markov models are also trees, but

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.630
introduce recursion where steps can be
repeated and time is now represented.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.120
However there is typically no memory, so

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.520
that each step is based entirely
on the current state of things.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.530
Here's a diabetes example
where the patient risks and

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.870
outcomes evolve over time.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.470
Note that unlike decision trees
there are many paths to the model.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.130
And it is possible to
go back as shown here

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.189
to a prior point depending on
actions and probabilities.
