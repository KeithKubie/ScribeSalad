Most widgets offer some way
to disable input.

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:14.012
If you set the <i>onPressed</i> callback
of a <i>RaisedButton</i> to null, for example,

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:15.413
it becomes disabled.

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:18.185
And you can use
<i>NeverScrollableScrollPhysics</i>

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:21.088
to tell a <i>ListView</i> not to scroll
when the user drags it.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.258
But if you have a complicated
subtree of widgets

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:26.206
and just need a simple way
to wall them off from touch events,

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.608
try <i>AbsorbPointer</i>!

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:31.039
Just put it at the topmost point
in the widget subtree you'd like to block,

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.510
and even though you can't see it,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.540
it'll keep touch events from getting
to all the widgets below.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.079
You can use the absorbing property

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.628
to quickly turn
the <i>AbsorbPointer</i> on and off,

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:41.057
and the <i>ignoringSemantics</i> property

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:43.349
lets you control whether
screen readers and other features

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:45.037
will ignore the blocked widgets.

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:48.168
