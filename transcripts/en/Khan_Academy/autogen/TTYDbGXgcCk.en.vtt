00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.487
 He wants to get over 9000 comments 

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:05.008
 of your YouTube videos. 

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:06.831
 He receives the same number of comments 

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:09.025
 for every clip with cats that uploads, 

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.533
 and the same number of comments 

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.589
 for every clip with dogs that uploads. 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.040
 This is unbelievable in a sense. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.627
 Totally the same number of comments for each clip with cats 

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:20.808
 and totally the same number for each clip with dogs. 

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:23.431
 But we will just accept what we have been told. 

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.578
 The following inequality 

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:29.631
 By showing the number of clips with cats, 

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.739
 and D presents the number of clips with dogs, 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.826
 which Goku has to upload, 

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:37.567
 to achieve its goal. 

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:40.551
 So, 750 in the number of clips with cats 

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.891
 plus 450 on the number of clips with dogs 

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.307
 must be greater than 9000. 

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:48.665
 According to inequality, 

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.800
 how many reviews each cat gets with cats 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.974
 and how many comments does each dog get with a dog? 

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:57.604
 Let's see if we understand what we have here 

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.518
 in this inequality, to answer the question. 

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.956
 He wants to get over 9,000 comments, 

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:04.082
 as we see it here. 

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:07.623
 He wants more than 9,000 comments. 

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:09.660
 We can see this as a number of comments, 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.508
 which he actually receives. 

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.796
 Since we have some number of C, 

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:17.430
 we can assume that C ... 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.606
 We know that C is the number of clips with cats. 

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:21.614
 So we have the number of C, 

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.791
 this is the number of comments, 

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.934
 which he gets from the clips of cats. 

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.291
 For a Clip with Cats 

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.969
 he will get 750 comments. 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:30.805
 Because, if I say, "Hey, look. 

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:32.852
 I have Cs of videos with cats and for each of them 

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:35.456
 I have exactly 750 comments. " 

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:39.097
 So I will have 750 on the C comment 

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:41.651
 total for all my cat clips. 

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:46.631
 Each video with cats will receive 750 comments. 

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:49.093
 And in a similar way 

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:50.853
 every clip with dogs gets ... 

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:54.758
 This is the total number of comments on the videos with dogs. 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.040
 You collect all these together. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.880
 We see the total number of comments needed 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.459
 be greater than 9000. 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.972
 Okay if the total number of videos with dogs is D, 

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:07.163
 then we see that he gets 450 comments on a clip with dogs. 

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:10.599
 450 comments per video on the number of clips with dogs 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.757
 gives us the total number of comments from clips with dogs. 

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:18.262
 So he gets 450 comments for a dog clip. 

00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:22.278
 Can Goku achieve his goal by uploading 8 clips of cats 

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:24.414
 and 7 clips with dogs? 

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:25.710
 Let's think about it. 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.721
 8 clips with cats and 7 clips with dogs. 

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:29.441
 Let's see. 

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:33.095
 If we have 750, let me write them in the same colors, 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.140
 if we have 750 by 8, 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.120
 plus 450 at 7, 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.035
 is that greater than ... 

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:49.182
 I will write a question mark because we do not know. 

00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:54.744
 Is this greater than 9000? 

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.564
 Okay, we just have to calculate it. 

00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:58.438
 How much will it be? 

00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.314
 Let's see. 

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:04.314
 700 at 8 is 5600. 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.211
 This will be 5600, 

00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:10.228
 plus another 50 at 8 is 400. 

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:14.709
 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000. 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.203
 That's 6000 here. 

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:20.711
 If there are 8 clips with cats, 

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.845
 he gets 750 comments per clip, 

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:25.777
 so there will be a total of 6000 comments 

00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:28.525
 for all 8 clips with cats. 

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.664
 And then 450 at 7, 

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:34.142
 let's see, 400 at 7 is 2800, 

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:37.940
 plus another 350, 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.497
 this will be how much? 

00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:43.455
 3150, is it? 

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.625
 Let's see, this will be, 

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:45.483
 let me show you that this is so, 

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:48.183
 2800 plus ... 

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:51.348
 400 at 7 is 2800. 

00:03:51.348 --> 00:03:54.379
 50 at 7 is 350. 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.507
 Yes, I think this is true. 

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.630
 That's all, 3150. 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.186
 The 6000 Plus 3150 is really bigger than 9000. 

00:04:04.186 --> 00:04:06.108
 It's really bigger than 9,000. 

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.302
 This is 9150, 

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:11.286
 which is really bigger than 9,000. 

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.085
 So yes, he can achieve his goal, 

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:17.921
 uploading 8 clips with cats and 7 clips with dogs.
