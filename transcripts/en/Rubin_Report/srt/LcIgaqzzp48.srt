1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,370
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,620
alright.
Ladles and jellies spoons.

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:12,621
We are alive on
www.youtube.com/rubin report.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,240
All right.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,990
And there's a lot to do here and we've
only got an hour today because I've had a

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,800
completely bananas day. I feel like
my days are getting more and more.

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,840
I like to say bonkers, but I've gone with
bananas. I said Banana sometimes to, uh,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
my days are getting crazier
and crazier these days. Um,

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,750
I've already taped three shows today and
I was up at the crack of dawn and I did

10
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:36,570
a 45 minute a radio interview.

11
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,360
I had about two minute breaks in
between everything. And here we are.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,490
We're going live.
The second I'm done here,

13
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,220
there's already a car waiting for
me outside. I'm heading over to, uh,

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,270
to do Tucker Carlson tonight and then,
excuse me. Then I hear that that a,

15
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,120
that Trump fell has given a big speech.
I guess I'll have to tweet that thing.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,390
So it's going to be one of those days.
It's all good. Uh, what I wanted to do is,

17
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,710
as you guys know,

18
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:59,630
I am departing Patrion Sam Harris
has already left Patrion uh,

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,670
Jordan Peterson will be
joining me on January 15th.

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,880
We will be deleting our patrion accounts.

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:10,590
This is all because of their treatment
of Carl Benjamin Sargon of a cod.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,290
I'm sure most of you are well
aware of that whole situation,

23
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,770
so I don't want to repeat the whole thing.
Uh,

24
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,960
suffice to say that every now and again
in life I think you have to just take a

25
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,200
stand when it's not easy to do so
and maybe not popular to do so.

26
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,730
And maybe puts yourself at some risk.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,010
And I just think this is the
right one for us to take.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,110
A patrion has been amazing to us.

29
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,850
We've been on there for
about two and a half years.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,770
You guys know all the stuff about youtube
demonetization and how hard it is to,

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,370
to make a living as a, as a youtube
creator. A patron has been awesome for us.

32
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:41,040
I built a business, I bought
a house, I hired employees.

33
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,090
Everything that we've done basically in
the last two and a half years has been

34
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:48,660
because of Patrion. Uh, but
we are deleting it. It's
time. It's time to stand up.

35
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:53,661
Jordan and I are working on a platform
that I think can be a solution to this.

36
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:58,110
There are many layers of problems that
we're going to have to deal with a,

37
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,850
but we're thinking them all through about
payments and crypto and the terms of

38
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,120
service and the whole thing. You've
heard me talk about all of that before.

39
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,090
So what we're doing today,
I'm only gonna do two more.

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,310
One today and one on the 15th on
January 15th. Uh, two more live streams,

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,940
uh,

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,880
doing a little fundraising because we're
getting everybody off Patrion and we're

43
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,210
trying to get people over
to Dave rubin.com/donate.

44
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,360
That removes some of the middleman we can.
We can control everything.

45
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,810
It doesn't solve all of the technological
or monetization problems yet,

46
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,640
but get everybody to
over to our website and,

47
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:34,830
and off of Patrion and stand
up to the man, so to speak. Uh,

48
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,810
so we're doing a little fundraising.
So here's the deal.

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,580
Anyone that donates@daverubin.com slash
donate for the next hour while I am live.

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,330
Anyone who donates $5 or above,
however you do it over there,

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,160
I'm going to give you a live shout out.

52
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,130
So I've got an iPad here and my
guys will be typing out names.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,770
You will get alive.
Shout out if you do $5 or above.

54
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,180
If you do $25 or above,

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,250
you're going to get the Rubin report tee
shirt. Now this select member tee shirt,

56
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,000
this was the t shirt that we were given
to our patrons who were at the high

57
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,530
level that we're at the tee shirt level.

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,540
So we've got about a
hundred of these left.

59
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,660
They will never be printed again
because we're not on patrion anymore,

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,840
so select no longer exists.
So these are the last ones.

61
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,960
They are a limited edition collector's
item. Ladies and Gentlemen,

62
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,370
I'm wearing one of them right now.

63
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,970
Maybe I'll have to give away the one
right on my back. We we shall see.

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,020
So that's $25 or above monthly.
And you're going to get a tee shirt.

65
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,320
If you go to $50 or above,
uh,

66
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,330
during this live stream for the next hour,

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm going to take the official
Ruben report mug and what
am I going to do to it?

68
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,830
I'm going to sign it. I'm going to show
you how, I'm going to sign it right here.

69
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,220
I'm going to sign it for Ya.
And you could get that mug.

70
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,170
So whoever does the first
50 and dollars Mug, uh,

71
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,150
the first $50 person monthly at a time's
up, Dave Ruben. Dot. Constellation donate.

72
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,300
You can get this mug that I just
signed right now. There you go. Okay.

73
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,310
Putting that down.
So we've got tee shirts,

74
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,940
we've got mugs and basically you guys are
funding our ability to keep this thing

75
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:01,930
totally independent. We have had, as I've
said, we have had offers from networks.

76
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,140
There's all sorts of advertisers that
want to jump on board, all sorts of stuff.

77
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:09,400
So none of this is Crimea river and I'm
not sitting here woe is me or anything

78
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,960
like there is plenty of opportunity.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,580
I love doing what we've done the way
we've done it, remained independent. I am,

80
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,320
I am beholden only to you guys.

81
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:21,490
And there's a certain beauty in that
because I genuinely have, I can't say,

82
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,240
I have no idea. I have almost no idea
what most of you think about anything.

83
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,510
So it's like I couldn't really sell
out one way or another or any other way

84
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,330
because I get emails, people that are
conservatives, I get liberal emails.

85
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,750
I get some angry emails from
progressive's. I get a lot
emails from Libertarians.

86
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,440
I mean all of this, but I don't
even know exactly what my, my, uh,

87
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,040
patrons in the past and people who
are currently supporting us things.

88
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,360
So I can just do what I think is right,

89
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,100
which is what I've tried
to consistently do.

90
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,830
And just what I'll consistently
try to do. So, okay,

91
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,360
if you go to Dave
rubin.com/donate $5 and above, uh,

92
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm going to give you a shout out,

93
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:56,170
25 bucks and above monthly
you're getting the Rubin report,

94
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,530
tee shirt and $50 or above monthly.
You're getting assigned mug right now.

95
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,890
And you're getting the t shirt and
I'll just keep talking to you guys. Oh,

96
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:07,630
by the way,
tomorrow I will be at the Ontario Improv,

97
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:11,290
not Ontario, Canada. I'm sorry
to those of you in Canada.

98
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,950
A lot of people were very confused last
time. Uh, it's Ontario, California,

99
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,630
which is, I think it's about an hour
away. Uh, southern California. Um,

100
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,360
I will be there tomorrow
night doing standup.

101
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,670
I do about an hour set and then I
will be bringing Bret Weinstein,

102
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,110
a professor in exile, Bret Weinstein,
formerly of evergreen state. And you guys,

103
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,490
I'm sure all know his story.

104
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,630
He'll join me for a sit down afterwards
and it's just like a fun night.

105
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,330
It's not normal standup like
you've ever seen before.

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,840
I mess around with the crowd a lot. We
got people screaming, I giveaway stuff.

107
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,600
We do a live Q and a. It's like, it's
like just a free for all. I think you'll,

108
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,470
I think you'll really dig it. Um, so
check that out. And uh, Oh and on, uh,

109
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,400
January, Twitter 30th, I will be
at the Irvine Improv in Irvine,

110
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,540
California,
Orange County.

111
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,780
And I will have an IDW guests with
not saying who that is just yet. Okay.

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
We've got a couple shout outs to Jared
and Andy, welcome aboard. Thanks guys.

113
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,710
And Garrett, you were the first one that
I saw. So Garret is getting this mug.

114
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,040
Let's make sure we put this mug aside.
That was a person when I signed and Brad,

115
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,874
welcome aboard.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,540
You also are getting a mug which
I'm going to sign for you right now.

117
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,860
Thank you guys. You are a supporting
our ability to do what we're doing.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,510
So as I said, I'm only gonna do one more
of these and then I won't, uh, you know,

119
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,470
promoter, whenever you're going to call
this fundraiser drive, whatever it is,

120
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,720
I won't do it throughout
the year. I, you know,

121
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,600
once a year I think we'll do it going
forward like one day where we're like,

122
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,460
all right, we're trying to raise
some funds to do this or that.

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,980
The next one that I'll do and then it'll,

124
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,890
we'll be done for all of
2019 will be on January 15th.

125
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,850
We're going to do one of these.

126
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,250
I'll do a little giveaway and
some fun stuff and all that.

127
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,170
And then I'm going to take my computer.

128
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,900
We have to figure out how this is
exactly going to work. Logistically.

129
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
I will turn it around and I'm going to
press delete on Patrion right in front of

130
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:53,661
you guys.

131
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:57,530
So you will watch me delete patrion right
then and there we will get rid of that

132
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,700
thing. Um, it's no hard feelings,
any of those guys in a weird way.

133
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,350
It's like you want to run
your business that way.

134
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm not going to have the government
jump in and tell you what to do,

135
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,830
but I just don't want to be part of,
of what they're doing anymore.

136
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,900
So we're going to do that on January 15th,

137
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,260
Jordan and I also should have some updates
on things. Hopefully somewhat soon.

138
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,910
Things are moving. Trust
me, things are moving.

139
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,870
Just takes a little time to get
things done. All right, so, uh,

140
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,780
let me jump into some questions. We're
also take some questions on super chat.

141
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,540
I see a whole bunch of you guys
jumping in on that. So, uh,

142
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,300
from Patriot and I got a question
from Patriot about patrion.

143
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,560
Do you have any idea how much of a
financial hit patrion itself has taken

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,940
because of the exodus of you,
Jordan, Sam, etc. So I don't know,

145
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,370
I mean I could extrapolate if
I was to look at, you know,

146
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,920
sort of the amount of money that
I know we were making per month.

147
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,800
I have a general sense of what
Jordan was making per month.

148
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,590
I have a sort of sense but less so
of what Sam was making per month.

149
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:51,440
And let's say a couple other
people, patriotic gets, you know,

150
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,800
like 5% of each of us per month
plus some other fees and things.

151
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,270
Let's say it's 10% total. I'm, I'm
actually not totally sure. Um, it's,

152
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,110
it's a nice amount of money. Um,
but considering as far as I know,

153
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:07,700
Patrion got something like $450 million
dollars in VC funding in the last couple

154
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,200
of years.
It's a small amount.

155
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,590
So I don't think this is about while it
is hurting them in the pocket. Right.

156
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,230
And it's like they want to
make as much money as possible.

157
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,130
I think us taking the stand
is more important. So look,

158
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,490
if patrion crumbled after this,
that's not really my goal here.

159
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:26,390
But like if it started a chain reaction
of people inside there that suddenly

160
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:30,410
we're into free speech and don't like
all of this d platforming and are afraid

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,220
of the way the line is moving to exclude
people. I would be okay with that.

162
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,020
But this is more about us just doing what
we think is right. But by the way, look,

163
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,900
people like Bret Weinstein, who I just
mentioned, people I call them, I already,

164
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,320
I mean, people that I love and admire
are staying on Patrion for now.

165
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,080
And maybe there's an argument to
be said that if you stay and fight,

166
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,050
that could be more effective. But
I also liked the idea of, okay,

167
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:55,410
some people say stay, some people go,
some people write articles about it. Um,

168
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,780
some people talk about it on
social media, et Cetera, et cetera.

169
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,440
There were more than, there's
more than one way to skin
a cat, so to speak. So, uh,

170
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,050
I think we're all going to hit it from
different angles and see what happened.

171
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,440
But I do think that there is a,

172
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,330
a technological and business solution to
this and that's where I'm going to put

173
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,460
a lot of my energies,
although it's pretty bizarre.

174
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,260
I gotta I gotta show it around here,
which is a job unto itself, a tour.

175
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:21,030
We just got an offer last night to do
a live Reuben reports for all of April

176
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,640
taken me across America. I'll be in, uh,

177
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,090
Australia with Jordan for most of
February. I'm writing this book.

178
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,910
We're probably going to head back out on
the road in May and June with Jordan in

179
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:34,320
Europe. So there's a lot of
cooking and now I guess I'm
a tech guy as well. Uh, so,

180
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,370
you know,
we'll see what happens.

181
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,510
Shout outs to Jeffrey to gunner
and to Richard and a Mug for Jared.

182
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:43,200
You're getting a mug. Thank you very
much guys. Really appreciate it.

183
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,190
You guys are helping us do this thing
and uh, I hope, I hope it's, look,

184
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,220
if you care about these ideas, then I
guess it is worth it to you. Let's see,

185
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,450
a good luck on your endeavor of creating
a new platform. Thank you very much. Uh,

186
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,290
make a blockchain based payment service.
I can help hit me up.

187
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,300
So I'm talking to a lot of
people based on a well just,

188
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,470
I'm getting a lot of recommendations.

189
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,100
Let me say first about doing a lot of
this through blockchain and taking more

190
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,890
blockchain payments. So first
off, just on the blockchain front,

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,580
we are taking payments right now for uh,

192
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,340
we're taking bitcoin
payments@daverubin.com slash donate. Um,

193
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,010
and we've been doing pretty
nicely on there and you know,

194
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,300
it goes up and it goes down and it's
just sort of something to, to have. Um,

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,630
I think there were more options.
We're, we're looking into light coin,

196
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,800
we're looking into a theory and we're
looking into ripple and a couple of the

197
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:34,020
others, we're looking into some blockchain
based video stuff. I mean we're,

198
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,580
we're just scaling through all of this.

199
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,120
And I see when I do these videos now I'm
apparently a gajillion people that are

200
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,810
watching these things because then people
start slicing and dicing every word I

201
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,600
said. Reuben said this about that and
he said this thing about that thing.

202
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,310
And the other thing about
that, it's like, guys,

203
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,620
we're just trying to work this
thing through. You know what I mean?

204
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,800
It's a weird thing cause I have noticed
that the amount of hate that I'm getting

205
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:55,170
these days has really ramped
up and I don't really care.

206
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,150
It's like I mute or I
blocked these people.

207
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,130
I'll give you just going to
endlessly throw hate at me.

208
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,540
Like I don't care for you.
Really.

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,450
It's like if I was walking down the
street and somebody was like, Hey Ruben,

210
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,970
go fuck yourself. It's not like I'd
walk across the street and be like, oh,

211
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,570
should we talk about that? No. So I'm
not going to do it online either. Um,

212
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,900
but it's funny cause it's like I have
so much good stuff happening and show is

213
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,470
going great, like touring
and all this good stuff. Um,

214
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,190
and yet that isn't really what is
the marker of success in a weird way.

215
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,820
I see all these people writing about me
and doing videos about me lying about me

216
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:27,390
constantly. I'm like, Oh, if I'm somebody
that they're doing that stuff about,

217
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,470
I must really be a threat to these people.
I guess I am successful. So that's the,

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,390
that's actually a pretty good, all
right. Shout outs to Christopher, Joel,

219
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,190
David and Nicky and Alexander.
You're getting a mug. Here we go.

220
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,200
You've been signed Alexander.
Thank you very much. Okay. Uh,

221
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,890
good luck sticking it to the man. I closed
all patriots support. I appreciate it.

222
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,320
Are you coming to New
York City anytime soon?

223
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,130
So we just got this offer for live
Reuben reports as I said, uh, in a,

224
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,820
in April, basically the entire month. Um,

225
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,890
which will be pretty cool to be doing
the show in front of it would be theater

226
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,040
audiences, usually about a thousand
people. One of the shows is in New York.

227
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,210
I haven't signed on to the deal yet.

228
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,420
I got it late last night and I haven't
had a chance to fully dive into it,

229
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,720
but that could potentially
be in April. Um, let's see.

230
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:14,170
Just change my $5 to 25 bucks monthly.
Send me a medium.

231
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:17,570
Been funding for a few years and got
off the patriarch train before near.

232
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,530
Good luck. I appreciate
it. And uh, when you,

233
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,800
when you submit via paypal or,
or your credit card,

234
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,230
we have your email and then
we can figure out the sizes.

235
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:30,730
So that's how we do that. Greetings from
Argentina. I love what you're doing. Uh,

236
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,750
and what Jordan's doing.

237
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,420
My question is have you too
considered coming to South America?

238
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:39,010
So I don't know why the, the Jordan
toward didn't make it to South America.

239
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm not sure. It's on the docket for what
we're thinking about in May and June.

240
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,870
I'll, I'll ask on that. I'm
actually not sure. Um, okay.

241
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:51,220
Shout out to Steve and to Maureen.
Thank you guys. Appreciate it.

242
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,750
Um, thoughts on Coinbase
economically, D platforming, Gab.

243
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,320
So yeah, I heard about this and
what's weird I guess, and again, I,

244
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,750
I don't know everything about Crypto,

245
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,450
but I know that Coinbase is one of
the places I have a coin base account

246
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,470
actually.
Uh,

247
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,940
Coinbase is one of the exchanges
where you can buy and sell crypto.

248
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,790
Apparently they booted Gab,
but not only do they boot Gab,

249
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,020
if I'm understanding this correctly,

250
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,760
they booted the private account of the
CEO of Gab, uh, Andrew something or other,

251
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:22,810
I think his name is. This strikes
me as, as particularly odd,

252
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:26,530
like unless they're doing
something illegal, but this is,

253
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,570
this is becoming increasingly the problem.

254
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:33,571
We're going to slowly watch all sorts of
maybe kind of potentially shady people.

255
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,500
And I'm not even saying that this guy is
a be pinned off and we're all going to

256
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,480
think, oh, if I don't say
anything, I'll be okay. I don't
say anything. I'll be okay.

257
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,810
But that's how it comes for
everybody because nobody stands up.

258
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,600
So I'm very proud to stand
up, uh, with Jordan and,

259
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,910
and see if we can figure this thing out.
Um,

260
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,790
so I'm not happy when I see any
of these d platforming issues. Uh,

261
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,590
I had lunch with Eric Weinstein yesterday
and one of the things that we were

262
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,920
talking about was that maybe
what the Internet needs,

263
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:03,940
and this is an interesting play on my, my
small government believes, is that, look,

264
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,600
I don't want the government telling
these companies to know, uh,

265
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,640
to telling them what they can do,
right? You all know that. Okay,

266
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,210
but maybe what we need on the
Internet is a public space.

267
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,090
So in other words, if everything's private
online right now, as it basically is,

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,970
you've got all these roads going in every
which direction everyone can be on any

269
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,640
of these platforms. The platforms can
get rid of anybody that they want,

270
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,650
but there's no public space.

271
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,460
And maybe what we need is a
public space that is based,

272
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,560
let's say it was made
in the United States.

273
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,670
The United States create some sort of
public space online that stands by the

274
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:40,510
principles of free speech and the
first amendment. And beyond that,

275
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,750
as long as you aren't doing anything
doing anything that is illegal in the

276
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,190
United States,
you can do whatever you want.

277
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:48,550
So think about it as like
just a public park, right?

278
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,290
So like if you're at a
cafe next to the park,

279
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,380
a crazy person can't walk in and start
screaming like they're allowed to kick

280
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:56,240
them out. And that's what
the private company could do.

281
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,250
If they don't want the person there,
they can kick them out.

282
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,870
But that at least we would have a public
space and public platform for people to

283
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,460
be able to do whatever they want.
That is based in American laws and,

284
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,760
and the free speech principles that,
that we all love.

285
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,350
I think there's some way that Pi could
actually sort of be for public funding

286
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,540
being for something like that.

287
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,700
That would actually be interesting
because in a weird way,

288
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,970
if we only have private things online
and then nothing's really private and I

289
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,320
think that that's what's
happening right now.

290
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:30,950
So there's something there I need to
think it through a little bit more. Um,

291
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,900
let's see.
Dave,

292
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,960
is there one particular rule out of
Jordan's book that helped you the most?

293
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:40,640
What are, that's a good question.
Um, man, well I tell you, I've,

294
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,310
you know, I've obviously heard Jordan
lecture about the book, you know,

295
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,220
a hundred some odd times. And you know,
some nights I've, I've said this before,

296
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,130
but some nights he does all the hill,
you know, lecture for an hour and a half,

297
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,590
about all 12 rules.
He'll hit all 12 some nights.

298
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,290
He picks three rules and he focuses
on them some nights. He does one rule,

299
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,900
some nights he does no rules and he talks
about what someone else that's on his

300
00:15:56,901 --> 00:16:00,950
mind. Um, you know, I think

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,753
God,

302
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,480
is there one that's affected
me more than the others?

303
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Well I, it's Cliche to say the one
about telling the truth. Right?

304
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,320
Cause like you should try to tell
the truth as much as you can.

305
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,210
I'm always trying to tell the
truth as much as they can.

306
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,720
So I don't think it's that, um, you
know, the one about petting a cat.

307
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:23,180
If you see a cat pet a cat, now I'm
allergic to cats. I don't like cats.

308
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:26,210
Don't pet cats in my estimation. But he
said, you can swap any animal for that.

309
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm a dog guy,
but in effect,

310
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:30,380
what he's saying there is just
stop and smell the roses, right?

311
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,710
Just you know when things are going
well and you're in the thick of it,

312
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,700
like don't get so lost that
you don't remember to enjoy it.

313
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,390
And when things are going bad that there's
still some goodness out there kind of

314
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,240
and start, try to pause and remember
those things. So for me right now,

315
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:48,530
my life is moving very fast. I have very
little time to come up and breathe. My,

316
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,360
I tried to take a
vacation around Christmas,

317
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,820
the whole Patrion on thing happened
and I didn't get a vacation.

318
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,500
Like I haven't had a
lot of slow down time,

319
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:58,160
but try to take those little brief moments
when there's a little bit of quiet or

320
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,570
a little bit of something.
Uh,

321
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:04,040
I played my nine year old nephew and
NBA Two k on playstation four online the

322
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,041
other day.

323
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,970
Like just try to do some things to whether
it's petting a cat or petting the dog

324
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:12,260
or whatever it is to enjoy a little
of this, the craziness. All right.

325
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:16,760
Shout outs to bud, Rudy and Theresa.
David, you are getting a mug.

326
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,240
Thank you very much.
There you go.

327
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,680
David to David and Joe,
you're getting a mug.

328
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,890
Oh, I signed all these. Here we
go. Got Another one down here.

329
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,530
Thank you guys for the support.
It is really appreciated, uh,

330
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:37,160
on super chat. I found out about you via
Collin. Good luck on everything. Thanks.

331
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,930
So you're talking about column Moriarity
every uh, obviously I love Collin. Uh,

332
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,721
he's a great guy.

333
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:46,070
He's been through the outrage machine
and the mob and he has survived Collins

334
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:49,090
doing his podcasts,
sacred symbols with, uh,

335
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,310
with Chris Ragan who you guys may
know, who's also been on the show. Um,

336
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,750
and Collin staying on Patrion on. And as
I said, in no way do I judge him for it.

337
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:02,340
And in certain respects I think having
some of us on there and off their offers,

338
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:03,390
the best form of attack,

339
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,340
maybe having some of the guys stay on
there still allows for them to fight from

340
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:10,800
within. And maybe who
knows, maybe, you know,

341
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,950
between some of us go in and it's
almost saying that the Patriot people,

342
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,010
Jack Conti and Jacqueline Heart, the head
of trust and safety, there'll be like,

343
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,580
you know, maybe we should alter
the terms of service a little bit.

344
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,170
Not that I would trust them,
uh,

345
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,010
because obviously conti came in here in
lied directly to my face when he said

346
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:29,490
that, you know, you're not going to be
kicked off over speech, but you know,

347
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,470
it's just another way of
dealing with things. Everyone,

348
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,660
everyone does things a little
bit differently. You know,

349
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:36,150
unfortunately the way the
online conversation is,

350
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:39,810
it's like everyone wants to behave, force
everyone to behave the exact same way.

351
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,300
And if you do anything even a little
bit different, you're the enemy.

352
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,880
And it's just like, I don't think that
way and I'm not gonna live that way. Uh,

353
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,490
thanks to Alexander, to Douglas
and to David. Um, let's see,

354
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:54,120
uh, church, I'm Dave.

355
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:58,620
If Sargon had used actual slurs against
someone and not just use a slur to quote

356
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:02,160
someone's language back at them
and Patrion had banned them,

357
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,980
would you still have left?
That's a really good,

358
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,140
interesting philosophical
question. So, okay,

359
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
so the way for those of you that don't
know the wake Sargon was using the n word

360
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:15,270
in this specific video that was not
on Patrion and not even on his youtube

361
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:19,200
channel was he was basically using the
language of the all right against them.

362
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,230
He wasn't using the n word
as a pejorative. So your
question is a good one.

363
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,250
If he had used the n word in a,
in a racially offensive way,

364
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,490
would would this have resonated
with us the way that it did?

365
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,330
I don't know exactly. I don't. I, well,

366
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:40,320
I certainly wouldn't want to defend him
the way that I'm defending him right now.

367
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,750
Like let's say, let's think about it.
If it was a friend of yours, right?

368
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,480
Let's say you found out that a
friend of yours was truly a racist,

369
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,110
was running around calling people the n
word and it didn't like people because

370
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,090
of their skin color or
whatever that entails.

371
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Like would you really want to defend them?
The answer's probably no.

372
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,030
You might want, you might want to
find out more about them and be like,

373
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,300
is this part of the person I knew
and whatever that is, but would,

374
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,550
would we have all,
I guess your question really is,

375
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:07,551
would we have seen this as the
opportunity to take a stand now if they,

376
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,590
if he had been using the n word as a
pejorative and in a racially offensive way

377
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,230
against specific people,

378
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,640
then it would have made this a little
more of a messy situation where,

379
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,180
where patriot, it would have more easily
been able to say, you're not on Etsy.

380
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,020
That would have not been on platform
also. Um, it would've made it messier.

381
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,930
I think that's the best I can say
short of being in the exact situation.

382
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,810
It would have made it
messier. Um, I'm for,

383
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:36,660
I'm for all people to be able
to say whatever words they want.

384
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,690
I'm not afraid of words. You can call
it. People call me all sorts of things.

385
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:42,750
You'd call me a faggot or whatever
you want to call me. I will survive.

386
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:46,140
I really will. It's crazy. Someone says
a word to me and I don't crumble. It's,

387
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,070
it's incredible. Um, but
at the end of the day,

388
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,980
the, I still believe that these
companies can do what they want.

389
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,620
What is the solution? Well, now I'm
coming around to this idea that a,

390
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:00,250
there's a technological solution,
that sort of decentralized solution,

391
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,330
but it's not just that,

392
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,630
it's also the fact that maybe
we need these public spaces.

393
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,100
So we're at an interesting spot to be in.

394
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:10,090
If you come from a classical liberal
or libertarian position where you don't

395
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,300
want the government doing things
that aren't within its purview,

396
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,740
that you might go, well, wait a minute.
This is actually a good use of government.

397
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:22,390
This is a good use of government dollars
to be. We are going to create spaces,

398
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:26,530
online platforms that allow people to
be involved in conversations that allow

399
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,770
people to be able to post video, to
interact. All of those things, uh,

400
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,580
that are public spaces that the only,

401
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:36,700
there isn't a 27 page terms of service
that you've got to look at with your

402
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:41,701
lawyer that nobody has before you clicked
accept that the only rules that you

403
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,580
will have to abide by are the rules
that you have to abide by as a citizen,

404
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:49,630
which are the rules of the constitution
and your local laws and things of that

405
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,870
nature. There's something to that and I
want to think about it a little bit more.

406
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,011
A reminder guys,

407
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:58,030
if you go to Dave rubin.com/donate
if you donate five bucks or above a,

408
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,730
I'm going to give you a live
shoutout 25 bucks or above.

409
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,310
You're getting one of the last
remaining monthly. By the way,

410
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:06,790
25 bucks or about monthly, you're getting
one of the last remaining Rubin report,

411
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:11,440
select tee shirts, which will never
be produced again and for $50 or more.

412
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,970
I will sign them up for you right now
and you get the t shirt. So there you go.

413
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,770
All right. Um, here have some money
since I'm no longer on Patrion.

414
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,730
Thank you very much. That was
from super chat. Um, okay.

415
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,660
Curious how you'll decide who will
be allowed to join the new platform.

416
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,880
Keep it open.
Verse limit extremists.

417
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,700
This is one of the many things
that we're discussing right now.

418
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,300
We are discussing all of this stuff.
Look, if we open it up to everybody,

419
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,230
well then you know what happens. You're
going to get all of the truly bad actors.

420
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:46,231
They're real racist and white supremacists
and Isis and all of the real bad guys

421
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,370
that everyone agrees are the
bad guys, you know, like that,

422
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,060
that are probably up to criminal
activity and all sorts of stuff.

423
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,210
Now as long as they're not doing
something specifically illegal,

424
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,270
I think there's an argument to be made
that they can be on there and express

425
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:00,310
their right to express themselves.

426
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,050
That may not be the platform
that we are going to build here.

427
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,640
We're really trying to
figure this out like that.

428
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm not leading that
answer in any weird way,

429
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,050
like we're all having a sort
of internal debate about that.

430
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,620
Do we want to do something? Maybe the way
the Internet is the, the nature of the,

431
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:19,180
the future of the Internet is that not
everything should be so big and everybody

432
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:22,060
should be able to get on there and
fight with everybody. That may be,

433
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:26,080
it should be invite only or a sort of
white listed things, something like that.

434
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,410
So we're figuring out all of these things.
I think you guys know me,

435
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:34,180
my general position on this is I want
as little gatekeeping as possible.

436
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,400
I would rather have as
many voices as possible.

437
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,700
I would rather have for all the people
that have been banned on Twitter,

438
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,610
it's like I'd rather have all those
people back and if you don't like them,

439
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,410
you mute them or you block them
or you just ignore them. Um,

440
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:48,560
but this subjective way that they
do it is crazy. So it's like,

441
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,570
so it's like Sargon is also banned on
Twitter or Milo was banned on Twitter or

442
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,810
Alex Jones and his band on Twitter.
Okay fine. Twitter can do what it wants.

443
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,130
But at the same time say Farrakhan is
on Twitter, he said some he called Jews,

444
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,590
termites and what a Twitter do.
They took away his blue check,

445
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,640
but they left him on there.

446
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,490
So it's like you can stay on our platform
but we're not going to tell people who

447
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:12,350
you are. No, no, no. I guess
that's something or uh, you
know, Hamas is on there,

448
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,260
so you know,
like really awful groups are on there.

449
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,950
But we select basically if you're on,
if you're more on the right,

450
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,080
the groups that get booted. So it's
this selective enforcement and this,

451
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,140
this never ending a morphous terms of
service that seems to always hit people on

452
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,690
the right and not people on the left.
Look, if you're on the left right now,

453
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,540
anyone watching this or anyone
watching the test me right now,

454
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,360
anyone watching this,
go on Twitter and call whoever you want,

455
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,850
a white supremacist,
you will not be banned.

456
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,270
It's extremely damaging to call someone
a white supremacist. And, and it's,

457
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,670
and it's usually slander.
Um,

458
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,640
but you can do it and there's
no repercussions for it.

459
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,310
Now go on and call someone the n word.
Now I'm not saying do that.

460
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,540
I'm not saying do that,

461
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,330
but you get my point here is
that we've got a selected way.

462
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,470
We enforce these things.

463
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,890
These companies can selectively
enforce if they so choose.

464
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,800
But maybe we need an option
outside of these companies.

465
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,700
And that's what I'm saying about that.
Uh, shout out to Ryan and to Jord.

466
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,950
You're getting a Mug,
brother. Thank you very much.

467
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,920
Welcome aboard the future of the Internet.
Um,

468
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:17,570
okay. Um, let's see. Uh,

469
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:22,460
would you talk to Peter Schiff privately
about if and how to incorporate crypto

470
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:25,290
or a different payment system other
than cryptos? He's, uh, he's brilliant.

471
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,750
He's been on Joe Rogan's show a few times.

472
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,800
I think we've traded some emails over
the years and for some reason it didn't

473
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,290
work out. I'm not opposed to doing it. Um,

474
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,860
and I am exploring all sorts of
other financial options here.

475
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,830
We're trying to figure it out. That's,
that's what we're doing there. Uh,

476
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,010
get bitcoin, Jesus on the
show. I don't know who that is,

477
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:47,840
but seems like an interesting guy. Uh,
keep up the good work. Okay. Um, what,

478
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,710
what donated 25 on the website?
Need an extra large shirt.

479
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:54,470
Loved the content if they hate
you, you're doing good. Yeah,

480
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,780
I'm definitely coming around to
that one. It's like, all right,

481
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,100
you guys are going to spend all day,
like,

482
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:00,740
can you imagine somebody
like waking up and it's like,

483
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,540
why did Ruben do aren't alive stream?
What did he do? It's like, oh my God,

484
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,850
get a life. But that's more than
anything else. It's just like,

485
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:11,390
what are you doing with your life?
Um, okay. What are we doing here guys?

486
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,950
I'm giving away mugs $50 and above
monthly at Ruben [inaudible] dot com.

487
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:20,951
I'm going to sign it for you or a Dave
ruben.com/donate 25 bucks or above.

488
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,620
You're going to get a tee shirt. Uh,
we're going to send it out to you.

489
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:27,260
That's monthly and five bucks or above.
Uh,

490
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm giving shout outs to anyone that
jumps in. I am at the [inaudible]. Uh,

491
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,490
I'm at the Ontario Improv tomorrow and
with Bret Weinstein and I am at the

492
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,970
Irvine Improv on January 30th
within IDW member. Tbd. All right.

493
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:45,840
Keep the questions flying in. Guys. A
shout out to Joshua. Thank you very much.

494
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:49,410
Welcome aboard. Uh, this is on
super chat. Shout out to CBD,

495
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:51,210
American Shaman of San Antonio.

496
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,860
Are you a or are they selling CBD
legally in Texas right now? Well,

497
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,180
I guess CBD can be sold.

498
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,260
This is where I'm always a little
confused about the CBD situation. Um,

499
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,851
but I haven't,
you know,

500
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:07,260
I have a friend who heard her shoulder
and she's been using medicinal CBD, but,

501
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,310
but out of cannabis.
And I think maybe if it's in Texas,

502
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:14,920
you're getting them out of hemp. Um,
I totally crossing this thing up. Uh,

503
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,790
but anyway, it had a really bad shoulder.
She had been used as in medicinal CBD.

504
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,330
It seems to be working. So there you go.
There's a little CBD, something for you.

505
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,530
Keep up the good work. Another one
of those. Okay. I will. Um, oh,

506
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,200
here's a whole bunch more. I
didn't scroll properly. Um,

507
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,370
which crazy lefty would you most like
to most like to interview and I'd love

508
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:35,340
among, all right, well you can get
a mug if you donate a over a day,

509
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:39,360
ruby.com/donate which crazy lefty.
Let's remove the word crazy for a second.

510
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,150
There are plenty of lefties I would
love to sit down with. Obviously,

511
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:46,680
I'd love to sit down with Bernie and
Elizabeth Warren and certainly Alexandria

512
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,870
Cortez. Um, I would love to sit, you know,

513
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,970
I offer it up to the
celebrity types all the time.

514
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,970
So like a rob rider or a Judd Apatow
or Sarah Silverman or Chelsea handler.

515
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,870
I'll talk to any of these people.

516
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:01,090
Look as long as you don't
attack me personally or,

517
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:05,500
or other people that I know personally.
Like if you're, if your basic, um,

518
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,140
behavior is decent and we can agree on
what a conversation is, I'll talk to you.

519
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,730
But if you're going to attack people,

520
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,440
if you're gonna lie about
people and all those things,

521
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,680
I just don't want to do it. It's just
not a game I want to be. I want to play,

522
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,330
go play that game with somebody
else. Um, okay. Where are we? Um,

523
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:24,510
I love that hyperspace painting behind
your couch. Keep it up. Oh yeah.

524
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:27,630
If you saw the, uh, was, did
I do both of those in there?

525
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:30,690
I think I did both of the conversations
with Jordan. That's in my, uh,

526
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:34,650
in my living room. It's a huge
five foot by six foot, uh,

527
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:39,450
hand painting of hyperspace. So
Millennium Falcon going into hyperspace.

528
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,230
That was done by Caitlin, Janet, by the
way. I think her website is Kaitlyn rose,

529
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,110
janet.com. She also did the
painting that's behind me right now.

530
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,840
The painting that's over there and a
whole bunch of other stuff in my house.

531
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:53,250
She's really phenomenal,
versatile actress, actress.
She's probably an actress to,

532
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,450
uh, artists who can do almost
anything. Let's see. Um,

533
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,220
what are your thoughts? Uh,
wait, have you heard of,

534
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,850
have you heard the beauty and the Beta
podcast where a caller mentioned is

535
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,160
making an alternative to Patriot
and he mentions you by name?

536
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:11,130
It might be a good idea to get in
contact with them. I haven't heard it.

537
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,370
I did that podcast once.
That's a Matt Christiansen, um,

538
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:18,720
who's been a huge ally in this,
in this Patrion, uh, fiasco. Um,

539
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,310
but I haven't heard of
that one specifically,

540
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:23,700
but I can't tell you that I've had a
bajillion people just reach out to me.

541
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,910
Here's a, you know, people are just coming
up with ideas too, which is also cool.

542
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,200
And it also shows you that this thing is
going to be solved by human ingenuity,

543
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,830
not by the government or not by
just like the same old people.

544
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:38,430
Like I don't think it's going to be the
same old tech people that solve this,

545
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:42,460
right? Like I actually think it's going
to be new people that are doing it.

546
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,280
And I wish I had time to
respond to everybody that's
reaching out to me and all

547
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,500
that other stuff. Uh, shout
outs, if you donate it,

548
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,270
Dave rubin.com/donate a.
Okay.

549
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,810
And there's a shout out for Brooke. I
made that. What happened quick. Okay,

550
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:59,500
let's see. Uh, this is from
superchat. Coinbase is problematic,

551
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,620
but you can still buy crypto on their
platform and then move it to another

552
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,440
wallet before sending it.
Sending to support to Gab.

553
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,180
Crypto is still the best option
for censorship resistance. Uh,

554
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:12,610
I also sent you $10 in Bitcoin.
Well, thank you for that. Um, yeah,

555
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,790
so from what I understand,
if I'm really grasping this all property,

556
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:20,750
you could properly, you could still
forget putting gab aside for a second. Um,

557
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,250
just the principle would be that you
could still use Coinbase because you can

558
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:28,570
use it as your wallet and then you can
put your crypto at wherever else you want

559
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,850
to put it. I got one of
these, it's called the ledger.

560
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:34,330
And that's where like a physical device
that I have where I'm now keeping, uh,

561
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:34,931
the crypto.

562
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:38,710
So we're truly were truly just trying to
figure this out alongside of you guys.

563
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,450
A mug for Zachary, you're getting
a Mug, Zachary. Here you go.

564
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,390
Oh, and somebody told me, but
please confirm this before I, uh,

565
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,930
before I ruin this way, somebody told
me that. So if you put these in the,

566
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,840
in the washing machine, sometimes
the signature is going to be written.

567
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:59,980
Even though I'm using,
I'm using extreme fade resistant sharpie.

568
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,700
Um, but it could wash off
in the, in the dishwasher.

569
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,170
Somebody told me that if you bake them up,
but I can someone confirm this for me.

570
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,710
If you bake the Mug, that the
signature, uh, will stay in there.

571
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:14,890
So I guess we will see about that.
Um,

572
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,240
the meaning of life is to give life
meaning therefore isn't the key to life

573
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:23,020
giving big love to you and Jordan.
That's very profound.

574
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,160
The meaning of life is to live it deleted
as I said it. All right, there you go.

575
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,560
Um, let's see. Yo Dave, crazy
idea. Invite Joe Rogan on the show.

576
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,730
He always does the interviewing.

577
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:37,150
So I think it would be cool
to have him as the subject.

578
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,190
Plus I think you guys would
get along for the most part.

579
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,440
Well I've been on Joe
Rogan's show three times.

580
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,940
I was on there the last time was uh,
maybe may or June or so.

581
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,080
I had just blown it, flown in from Atlanta
that morning. I think that was may. Um,

582
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,790
I love Joe. He knows he's welcome anytime
the guy is beyond, beyond, beyond busy.

583
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,600
He doesn't do that many shows. He did
do. Ben Shapiro is a Sunday special,

584
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:02,490
which I gave him a little shit for, uh,
because he hadn't done my show yet. Uh,

585
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,960
but I'm sure at some point it will
be here. So Joe, if you're watching,

586
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,720
cause I'm sure you're just sitting
around watching these. Uh, please,

587
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:10,300
you're welcome on my show anytime.
He knows he's on welcome.

588
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,510
Anytime a shoutout to Othman.
Thank you very much.

589
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,060
A patron and canceling my
Patriot on account. Now.

590
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,510
You were the only person I was
contributing to a, so thank you very much.

591
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,310
We'll start up on your website a very
soon. Um, another one on Patrion.

592
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,980
I set up a recurring contribution
directly on your website and I'm going to

593
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,290
cancel my account with patron.

594
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,330
Thank you for making me aware and leading
the way from my small act of standing

595
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:35,410
up to intolerance and oppression. Thank
you very much. Uh, another one on Patrion.

596
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,380
I just now canceled my pledge to the
Rubin report from my Patriot on account.

597
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:41,900
Okay. Did somebody already get
the old coffee table? Oh yeah.

598
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,620
So I mentioned in the live stream the
other day that we've got our, you know,

599
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:48,620
this is our new set, so we've got our
old set, which are the old chairs.

600
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,270
We've got to have the old guest chairs,
we've got the old coffee table,

601
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,330
we've got the old, a lot of the old
trinkets and things that are around here.

602
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:57,320
Some of the old artwork.

603
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,010
I thought maybe if people make us like
some really great offers on that stuff,

604
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,470
as long as we're raising funds right now,
people could do that.

605
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:05,660
So we did get a couple of offers.
They were, they were kind of low,

606
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:09,680
like it just wasn't worth parting
with them at that level. Um, so yeah,

607
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:10,760
if you want to make a great offer,

608
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:14,570
you could just email us
contact@rubenreport.com. Um, as I said,

609
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,160
we've got to have the guest chairs.

610
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,160
I'm not getting rid of my red chair cause
I still use that when we do the three

611
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:20,960
ways in here.
Um,

612
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,140
but we got the coffee table and a couple
of other things so you can check that

613
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:28,430
out. Um, we'll your old shows
be accessible somewhere.

614
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,850
I'm behind in my recent retirement was
going to afford me time to catch up.

615
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:32,684
That's from patrion.

616
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,750
I think what you're referring to is that
you watched the show in the Patriot and

617
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:39,230
feed. So to be clear, 100% of our content,

618
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,870
especially if you're
watching this right now, um,

619
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,600
you're watching this via youtube.
The video might be in the Patriot on fee,

620
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:49,700
but this is all on youtube.
100% of our content will remain free.

621
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,820
It will always be free.
I am not putting content behind a paywall.

622
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,820
The only thing we've ever done behind
a pay wall as a couple like behind the

623
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:58,640
scenes things or I ask our guests an
extra question or something like that.

624
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,520
We've never put any interviews behind
a paywall. I am not gonna do that.

625
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:05,390
I'm not starting a separate show behind
a pay wall or anything along those lines.

626
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,420
As long as we can afford to produce the
show as we're doing it and hopefully

627
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,870
expand a bit and keep doing everything
we're doing and I can keep working on

628
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:15,740
other projects, which can also
help fund all this. Um, you will,

629
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:17,390
you will be able to see
everything we've ever done.

630
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,790
So right now if you're watching this
person that asked me that question,

631
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,470
every video that we have ever posted
anywhere, it's all on youtube right now.

632
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,250
Every interview we've ever done so you can
catch it there. Uh, shout outs to Tony,

633
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:32,300
Charles and Gary. I appreciate it.
Thank you. Um, oh, I get this one a lot.

634
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:35,030
What are some books that
changed your life? Loved the
show and everything you do,

635
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,010
Dave.
So I,

636
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,540
I'll give the two books that I most give
and then I'm going to start coming up

637
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:42,530
with a newer answer for this on my bed
right now on my nightstand right now,

638
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:46,100
I keep a copy of on liberty by John Stuart
Mill. You can read it in a day. It's,

639
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:51,101
it's that thick and it's just a wonderful
explanation of the individual and what

640
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,060
liberty and freedom are.

641
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,930
And it's a great explainer of sort
of classical liberalism as I see it.

642
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,650
And then the other book that I would
recommend, which I should have on set, um,

643
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,310
but I don't cause all the books that we
have on set actually are our books of

644
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,610
former guests. And I wish I
could've interviewed this guy,

645
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:12,170
but he died about maybe 15 years ago.
No, he died. I know the year he died.

646
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:15,590
He died I think in [inaudible] 97 so,
wow. 21 years ago, if I'm not mistaken.

647
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,940
Carl Sagan,

648
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,920
who was the incredible scientists
who did a cosmos, the book and the,

649
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:25,660
and the television show. His last book
was called billions and billions. Uh,

650
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,020
he actually died before it finished.

651
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:30,230
And then his wife Andrea and
who's also a professor at Cornell,

652
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,500
she had to finish it for them. And it
was just sort of a broad explanation.

653
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,590
It was a, it was a little bit easier
to read than some of his other books,

654
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:40,860
which were a technical, although he was
an incredible explainer of science. Um,

655
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,790
it's a broad sort of explainer about the
way the world is and the way he sees it

656
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,500
and when he sort of sees
the future looking like,

657
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,590
and it really just like sparked so
much of the things that I care about.

658
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:53,730
I mean a shout out to Steven and a
Mug for Tom. Thank you very much guys.

659
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,980
Appreciate it. There you go, Tom. Um,

660
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,980
let's see.
Uh,

661
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:05,880
why do you think crypto would help be
specific? It's not a silver bullet.

662
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:10,380
If you can't convert tender into crypto,
it's useless. Too many hoops to jump.

663
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,020
I'm not totally sure I
understand the question.

664
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,110
If you can't convert tender into crypto,
it's useless.

665
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,320
But you can right now you
can buy crypto using tender.

666
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,020
So am I am I am not
understanding the question?

667
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,820
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.

668
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:28,470
If you want to clarify the question a
little bit more. Um, okay. Let's see.

669
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,290
Um,
Dave,

670
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,900
you should consider inviting the
author Robert Greene on the show.

671
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,680
He's in California would be a great fit.
I'm actually not totally sure. I who I,

672
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,330
who that is. So if you want to write a
little bit more, I will check it out. Um,

673
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,350
okay.
Let's see.

674
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,960
Here's a second emphatic load for
getting in touch with Peter Schiff.

675
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,570
A crypto currency backed by gold.

676
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,310
His thing is the most promising
political solution in my view. All right,

677
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,030
noted. I will, uh, let's, let's
put Peter Schiff on the list. Guys.

678
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,580
If he's not on there already, he
must be on there already. Um, okay.

679
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:03,600
How long do we got here? What time is it?
Three 37. I've got 23 minutes left guys.

680
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,560
Uh, this is, I promise you this is the
second to last fundraiser of the year.

681
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:09,540
Even though we're in the
first week of the year,

682
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,050
or when we're in a week of the day of
the year, a week and a day of the year,

683
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:13,980
we're going to do one more of these.

684
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,650
On January 15th I'm going
to take my computer,

685
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,800
I'm going to walk over to the camera
right over there and you're going to watch

686
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,180
me delete patron.
You know,

687
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:25,020
I shouldn't tell you something
about what's going on with
Patrion right now. So,

688
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,290
um, so you know, I've done obviously
a bunch of videos about leaving.

689
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,740
I have sent emails to my email
list about leaving. I have,

690
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,950
we posted on Patrion that we're leaving.
I've put it on Instagram. I mean,

691
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:39,120
wherever you can put it, I put it. Um,
but right now, despite all of that,

692
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:44,070
we still have about 2000 people
that are paying monthly on Patrion.

693
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,920
And I think if I'm not mistaken or
last I checked the day or so ago,

694
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:51,020
there was still about $14,000 a
month of paying people on Patriot,

695
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,260
meaning that if I didn't cancel patrion
they would all be charged again on

696
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,190
February 1st.

697
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,670
So it's sort of interesting because it's
like people buy into something and then

698
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:03,420
you may not pay attention to the day to
day. You may have unsigned for, uh, uh,

699
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,920
an email list,
let's say.

700
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,880
And if you're not paying attention on
Twitter and you don't check youtube for a

701
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,170
couple of weeks or this or
that or the other thing,

702
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,890
it's like you may not even know. So
it's such a weird thing. It's like,

703
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,590
I'm going to say goodbye to this money.
That in effect is like free money,

704
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:19,470
but obviously I don't think it would be
right to say I'm leaving and then not

705
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,900
leave just to collect on that.
So we're obviously not going to do that,

706
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,940
but it'll be an interesting
thing to see how much,

707
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,510
how many people and how much is
left in the account when I do this,

708
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:31,680
a week from today. Uh, that would
be a, that would be interesting.

709
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,490
Let's see. Um, shout out
Henrik. Thank you very much.

710
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:39,160
Appreciate it. Uh, all
right, 20 minutes left guys.

711
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,920
Dave rubin.com/donate get yourself a mug.

712
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,310
Get yourself a Reuben select tee shirt.
They're right here.

713
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,410
I'm wearing one right now. I'm
wearing a medium, by the way,

714
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,530
if that gives you any perspective on
sizing, they're quite comfortable.

715
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,330
It's not like one of
those crappy tee shirts.

716
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,910
You know those crappy tee shirts you
put on them? They feel like cardboard.

717
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:59,590
It is not that. It feels nice. I think
you'll like it. Uh, my dad often,

718
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,560
where's the t shirt? When he's wandering
around town and people say item,

719
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,950
I want to take selfies with my dad. That's
very weird. But people wanted to do it.

720
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,000
Okay. Let's see what's going on here. Um,

721
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,410
I got get bitcoin. Jesus is on the
show. I did that one already. Uh,

722
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,820
when you inviting Matt Christiansen
Christiansen on the show,

723
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:19,090
so that was mentioned already about
Matt. Yeah, we'll do it at some point.

724
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,530
I think he lives in like Montana
or Wyoming or something. Um,

725
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,100
I don't know how often he gets out to la.
You know,

726
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,600
we can do these things by Skype,

727
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,190
but I'm really trying not to do them
unless it's either like a s a really big

728
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:33,370
guest or somebody that's international
that really just can't make it here.

729
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,130
But if it's someone in the
states that's mobile or whatever,

730
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:40,480
I'd much rather do it in person.
Um, also right now, just Fyi,

731
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,860
um, we're booked out all through
January. We've got a good Julian shows,

732
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:47,440
we're taping a ton of stuff.
Um, so really cool stuff. Oh,

733
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:50,600
and tomorrow we taped this
already. I've got an interview, uh,

734
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,620
with behavioral scientists,
Jeffrey Miller, who is a really,

735
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:58,120
really site psychological behavioral
scientists. Jeffrey Miller. Really,

736
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,470
really interesting guy.
It was,

737
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,020
it was one of my favorite interviews I've
done in awhile and I think we've been

738
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:06,640
on a nice, a nice run here. So that'll
be a part one of that be up tomorrow. Um,

739
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,750
let's see. I'll donate a hundred
bucks if you answer these questions.

740
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,780
Do you think you will shave your
beard soon? The answer is no.

741
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,490
I do love the beard and
people love the beard.

742
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,890
Everyone that I meet everywhere I go,
they want to touch the beard.

743
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,890
They love the beard. So I'm not going
to shave the beard anytime soon.

744
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,680
Although when I got the beard,
which was not last August,

745
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:27,040
but the August before when I did my thing
off the grid and I just grew and grew

746
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,740
it and grew it, and then I trimmed it a
little bit before I came back on camera.

747
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,020
I thought I was going to maybe
have it for like a month or so,

748
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:35,050
but then everyone loved it and I really
like it. So I'm going to keep the beard.

749
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,220
And also, do you like Jordan Peterson
better with a beard or without a beard?

750
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,770
I liked him better with a beard.
I like them better with the beard.

751
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:45,190
I think there's something
about, you know, his,

752
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,120
there's something about his persona that
a beard fits it, like his grain beard.

753
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,280
Um, you know, he, he's, he's sort of
the older wise professor. Um, he's,

754
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:58,480
he's mentoring or helping a
lot of people, um, you know,

755
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,490
get their shit together and
get their lives together.

756
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,170
There's something that fits
with a guy in a beard. Right?

757
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,310
Like if this was a movie,

758
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,270
like he's the older professor with a
beard that's like teaching people some

759
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:07,571
stuff.

760
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:10,420
It seems like he would have a beard
that's like a Harry Potter or star wars

761
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:12,910
thing. He would have a beard. Uh,
when are you coming to Brazil?

762
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:14,530
No plans at the moment. Yeah. As I said,

763
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:19,030
I don't know why we're not doing much in
South America. Um, on the Jordan tour.

764
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:21,190
I'll, I'll look into that a little
bit more. I'm actually not sure.

765
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,220
Shout outs to George,
to nick and to Matt.

766
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,300
You guys sound like you could be a
boy band and a, and a mug for Dennis.

767
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,950
Welcome aboard, Dennis. There you go.
That's a fine signature right there.

768
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,940
You got it, Dennis. There you go.
Um, okay. What else is going on here?

769
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,990
So, wait, what else can I
tell you? There's been so
many things happening at once.

770
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:46,130
It's like, it's hard to keep my head on
straight in the midst of all of this. Um,

771
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,010
oh, you know, I got a question
for you guys actually,

772
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:53,000
because you guys often give me some
good advice on some things. So I've, uh,

773
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,750
I've shown her on video a couple of times,
but my dog, Emma, she's 14 years old.

774
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:59,510
I love, love, love this dog. Uh,

775
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:03,590
I got her when she was two years old.
She's actually from New Orleans,

776
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:08,240
from Hurricane Katrina. And when the
dog's got split up after the hurricane,

777
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,780
they were sent all over the country and
I assume all over the world actually.

778
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,230
They actually found Emma in a box.
Uh,

779
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,010
and she had given birth
during the hurricane and she
was nursing three puppies

780
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,180
and she was deathly sick because they're
drinking all sorts of oils and in the

781
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,240
water and all sorts of chemicals
and grow stuff that's in the water.

782
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:29,090
Though the puppies were actually
healthy. She was really sick. Uh,

783
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:33,170
the animals got sent all over the place.
She had a collar with no tags,

784
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,550
so they didn't know what her name was.

785
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,910
So she's actually had three names in
life because when she was in New Orleans,

786
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,500
she had a name.
We don't know what that was.

787
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,770
Then we got her at the humane
society of New York, um,

788
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,850
which is a great little non kill shelter.
It's,

789
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:48,140
it's not associated as far as
I know with the Ma, the uh,

790
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,560
national humane society.
It's just the one in New York City.

791
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:53,930
It's on 57th street between
first and second, I think.

792
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,890
And we got her there and they had named
her Paisley and then when we got her,

793
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:58,341
we named her,

794
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:02,930
Emma and I had had her the
first day I'm walking her,

795
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:07,370
I got her walking her first day in
central park and this woman comes up to me

796
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:11,420
and says, is that Paisley from the
humane society? I said, yeah. She said,

797
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:14,990
this is her son Bernard. And
they went crazy. They sniff,

798
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:18,710
bought like only a mother and son
could. And you know, there was at,

799
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:21,860
we used to get Bernard and
Emma together often. Anyway,

800
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:24,050
Bernard ended up moving to North Carolina.
But how bizarre.

801
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:27,650
Like they went all over the country and
Bernard and Emma both ended up on the

802
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:30,950
upper west anyway and it was about
14. Right now. She is the greatest,

803
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:33,610
happiest one, most wonderful
dog. We get people in,

804
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,690
all my guests come into my
home because my studio is here.

805
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:40,100
People that don't like dogs
end up absolutely loving
her. Uh, but at 14, she's,

806
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,320
she's not a a young pup anymore.

807
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,920
And I've noticed that she's a little
stiff in mostly in the back hips lately.

808
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:48,710
So I'm thinking that maybe she has a
little bit of arthritis or something.

809
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,600
So I'm looking at all sorts of, um, uh,

810
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,180
supplements and things
that we can give her.

811
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,730
And I know that they want you to take,
it's a little counterintuitive.

812
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,010
You'd think you'd want them to
rest more if they're in pain,

813
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,160
but they actually tell you that an older
dog should be walked more if they have

814
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:04,260
arthritis cause that keeps them
loose. Um, we can give them clues,

815
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,870
glucosamine and Chondroitin.

816
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:09,140
Try saying that three times fast and a
whole bunch of other stuff in massages,

817
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,660
heat pads. But if any of you
have any great ideas on that,

818
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:16,130
I would love to hear them, so
please let me know. Um, okay. Uh,

819
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:19,010
shout out to Pamela.
Thank you very much and a Mug for Mike.

820
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:21,350
Thank you very much guys.
Appreciate it.

821
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:23,690
You're keeping the Rubin
report totally independent.

822
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,870
I should mention actually what that
means when I say we're completely

823
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,470
independent.
We are 100% independent period.

824
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,100
I am the boss. The buck stops with me.
That might be good. That might be bad.

825
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:39,120
I think it's pretty good. Um, but we, we
treat all our, all of our employees great.

826
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,270
You know, we take care of 100% of
health insurance. We give Nice bonuses.

827
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,690
I try to let everybody be as,
as free as they can be,

828
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,680
as long as they're doing their job
and we get that respect back. We,

829
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:51,900
we've got a great little operation
here that I'm super proud of.

830
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:55,350
And when I say we're independent, we
have no, it's my production company.

831
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,310
We run it as we see fit. The chances I'm
ever going to fire myself. Pretty slim,

832
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:03,180
I guess anything could happen. Um, but
we're free to do what we think is right,

833
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:05,790
which is why when I'm getting
these offers from these networks,

834
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,260
it's like it would take something
crazy and I'm not even using this as a

835
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,250
negotiating tool.

836
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,970
It's like it would take something crazy
for me to have a boss and not be in a

837
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:17,790
studio in my home and all of the things
like we really did this thing right

838
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:20,070
somehow and knock on wood,
we can keep doing it.

839
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,570
A shout out to sh to Chaz
and a shout out to Louis. Um,

840
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,351
and just a reminder,

841
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:30,351
we've got about 15 minutes left that one
week from today on January 15th we will

842
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:35,070
be doing a live stream.
You will watch me delete Patriana alive.

843
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,740
I'm going to bring my computer right
up to that camera right there and we're

844
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:40,680
going to do it live a patriot
and really proud of you Dave.

845
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:43,740
There aren't many willing people willing
to stick their necks out the way you

846
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,700
and Mr. Peterson or doing 2019 is going
to be an exciting year to say the least.

847
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,970
We will definitely be
switching contributions over
Dave rubin.com/donate all the

848
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:53,160
best. Thank you very much. Um,

849
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,330
someone else on Patrion it's not so much
that we are not paying attention to the

850
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,400
day to day.
I am hoping that Patrion figures this out.

851
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,970
What they did for independent voices was
nothing short of amazing and I'd hoped

852
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,750
to be a creator myself.
The they're the only game in town sort of,

853
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:11,340
and I want them to come to their senses
and rethink their casual disregard for

854
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:13,650
free speech.
That's totally legit.

855
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,560
And that's why I said for my
friends that are staying on Patrion,

856
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,200
I get it for someone like,
like right now,

857
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,510
like the idea that let's
say Colin for example,

858
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:24,090
column Moriarty who's obviously been on
the show and it's a good buddy of mine,

859
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,270
for those of you that are canceling
patron patrion because of me,

860
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,740
the idea that some of you might fund
Collin as well and now he's not going to

861
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:34,260
get that. That obviously it
doesn't make me happy in any way.

862
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:35,520
It actually upsets me,

863
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,210
but I think everyone just has to do what
they think is right. Like at the end,

864
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:42,280
it's on you and you have to
decide what to do look like.

865
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,450
I suppose there's probably some people
that'll stay on there for Colin and then

866
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:47,430
donate separately for me.
You know, it's everyone,

867
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,890
everyone or screw both of us want or
whatever you think is right there.

868
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,380
There you go. Shout outs to Lucille, to
Robert and to Dimitri. Thank you guys.

869
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,950
Um,
beautiful story about Emma.

870
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:01,320
Dave also IX to explain my last comment.

871
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,540
Robert Green is the author of 48 laws of
power. You'd really love his stuff. Uh,

872
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,460
let's get the book. Can somebody write
that down? We'll, we'll get the book.

873
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:11,700
There we go and see what
happens there. Keep it up. Dave,

874
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:14,790
please donate my tee shirt.
Um,

875
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,970
I don't know if you're saying you're
donating a tee shirt to us or something

876
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,310
else, but thank you. Um,

877
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,790
I've spent a thousand plus hours
building a Patriana alternative with

878
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,980
anticensorship features in the past year.

879
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,710
What would be the best way to get
in touch and present it to you guys?

880
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,050
So getting all sorts of offers like this
and it's a little hard to track like

881
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:33,030
who's legit,
who isn't.

882
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,010
I've had some phone calls where people
that I think have been really interesting

883
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:40,990
and some kind of go nowhere.
Uh, contact@rubenreport.com
is the best way to do it.

884
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,960
My guys kind of go through it and the,
and the most important ones get to me.

885
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,230
And then if, if you're, if you're
really onto something here, I hope so.

886
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:51,310
And then we, you know, we do a zoom or a
Skype or take a call and go from there.

887
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:56,380
A super chat. I appreciate
your willingness to stand
up. Thank you very much. Um,

888
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,071
super chat.

889
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:00,640
The government slash payment processors
can stop you using crypto if they really

890
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:05,320
want to, especially the
ones with transparency built
in like bitcoin. So this,

891
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:08,710
I need to learn more about
this. I fully admit that. Like,

892
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,450
I don't fully understand
how the government,

893
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:14,920
if you were doing all the transactions
were on Crypto, were crypto based,

894
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:16,330
how would the government be tracking that?

895
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:20,530
And I guess they could track
if they had the specific, um,

896
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,510
bitcoin number or the wallet number,
Wallet Address,

897
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,220
they could track what's going in there.

898
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,680
I need to learn a little bit
more about this. Guys, I'm,

899
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,560
you're watching me do some of this stuff
on the fly. Like that's just the truth.

900
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,830
Uh, shout out to David. There
you go. Um, oh, you know,

901
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,290
speaking of doing some stuff on the fly,
something funny happened the other day,

902
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:41,080
so I did this live stream just like this.
And you know,

903
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:42,120
I'm taking questions right.

904
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,650
And you guys can see these
questions are just flying in, right?

905
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,210
And my guys color code them sometimes
if they think something's like

906
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,400
particularly important
for me to get to or,

907
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,990
or that I need to read it
quicker or whatever it is. Right.

908
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,990
Um, and so the other day I took, I don't
know, I took 50 questions. I have no idea.

909
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:01,420
And I'm just reading them on the
fly. I'm, they're not censoring them.

910
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,250
And then someone asked me something
about Brazil and I said one little thing

911
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:08,740
about how I need to know
about and I need to know more.

912
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,540
And then all of these
people started writing.

913
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:13,990
All these articles are doing these videos
about how I'm backing a dictator in

914
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:17,830
Brazil and I'm a fascist. And the rest
of it, it's like, man, like Bill Kristol,

915
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,230
formerly of the weekly standard,
which just folded,

916
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,320
he retweeted somebody saying
something about me. And it's like,

917
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:27,700
what are you people talking about? I said,
one sentence in a two hour live stream,

918
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,290
you're taking it totally out of context.

919
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,750
And I admitted I need to
know more about the topic.

920
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,110
Like this sort of desire to
destroy everybody. It's like,

921
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:37,120
it's going to destroy you guys.
It ain't going to destroy me.

922
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:41,350
It's going to destroy you guys.
And deservingly. So, um, let's see.

923
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,460
Um,
Dave,

924
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,350
is the new platform going to be 100%
geared towards free speech or is it going

925
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,480
to be an echo chamber? I promise you
it is not going to be an echo chamber.

926
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,680
As I've said, we're trying to figure out
what the parameters around that mean.

927
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,390
Is this an absolute place for everyone?
I mean,

928
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,700
I can be very clear. I don't want
people doing criminal activity.

929
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:04,180
I don't want child porn on there.
I don't want terrorist activity on there.

930
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,300
So an absolute free speech space
within the content confines of the law.

931
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,710
My goal is yes, but we have to
figure out exactly what that,

932
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,200
what that means and we're working
on it. Uh, all right guys,

933
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,130
we've got 10 minutes left.

934
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,160
So Dave rubin.com/donate you guys
are the lifeblood of the show.

935
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:23,710
You've already shown up for me
here today as you have last time.

936
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,240
I promise you we're only doing one more.

937
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,910
Are these this entire year we're knocking
them out by January 15th we will not

938
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:32,630
do any sort of fundraising for the rest
of the year. We're doing well. We've,

939
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:36,740
we've obviously, we took a huge hit on
Patrion and I'm, I'm now forcing it and,

940
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,050
but we're making up a nice
amount of it on our own website.

941
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:41,330
Dave rubin.com/donate I'm,

942
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:44,120
it's a short stop gap measure of
getting rid of the Middle Guy.

943
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,130
If you donate 50 in the next 10 minutes,

944
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,140
I'm going to sign the
Ruben Report Mug for Ya.

945
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,930
If you donate 25 monthly
in the next 10 minutes,

946
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:54,470
I'm going to send you this tee shirt. And
if it's you 50, you get the t shirt too.

947
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:59,360
Okay, let's see. Um, find a chiropractor.

948
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,510
It saved my boy's life. Oh, I think you're
talking about your dog. All right. Yeah.

949
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,430
Oh, find a dog. Find a dog
chiropractor. It saved my boy's life.

950
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah. Um, yeah, I read that there
are actual dog chiropractor,

951
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:14,120
so I may take her to one of
those. We'll see about that. Um,

952
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,410
Dr Jon Bergmann studies on reversing
arthritis may help you with Emma.

953
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,430
As a side note, Dr. Joseph
Dispenza is a great guest choice.

954
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:25,750
So I'll look and I'll look into both of
those. Can you guys write those down? Uh,

955
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,090
thank you guys for that. I really
appreciate it. Um, let's see.

956
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:30,980
I'm a conservative and
I just bought a Mug,

957
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:34,640
but I wanted to give the Mug to a liberal
teacher of mine because your show gave

958
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,520
us common ground. Could you
sign it for her? That's awesome.

959
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,850
I can email you the info. Yes,
I'd be happy to do that. Helen,

960
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,340
we'll keep an eye out. So
email us, contact that Ruben,

961
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:47,360
report.com remind us about this and I
will sign it directly to her and you can

962
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:49,820
give it to her. That's what it's all
about. That's what it's all about.

963
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:53,660
People don't hate each other for the
most part. Like there are good liberals,

964
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,190
there are good conservatives.

965
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:58,610
There are even good progressive's I
think their ideas are all terrible,

966
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:00,980
basically. Right? Like you
guys know that. I don't,

967
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,520
that doesn't mean I think they're
all terrible people are, are, are,

968
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,570
are many of them I think
confused sort of logically and,

969
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:12,830
and um, and morally at, at
a certain level. Uh, yes,

970
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:15,740
I think so, but I don't think
they're inherently bad people.

971
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,900
Do I think that they think that
they're doing the right thing. Yes.

972
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,580
I think those things are the wrong things,

973
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,940
but that's why we got to care about facts.
So it's like when,

974
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,940
when AOC the other day she said
this thing about, you know,

975
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:29,180
too many people get hung up on on facts
and making sure everything's exactly

976
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,520
right as opposed to what's morally right.
What,

977
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,830
that's a pretty dangerous thing to say
because we all have different morals.

978
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:40,040
One of the topics we've spent in
the last year talking about most,

979
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:43,520
here's where to morals come from
and the difference where, you know,

980
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:46,220
Sam Harris says morals can
come from facts that you,

981
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,510
that are sort of right in front of you
and we can figure out what we can derive

982
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,250
value and meaning from.
Fact.

983
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,320
Some people Ben say and and Jordan would
say that comes from a Judeo Christian

984
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:58,700
ethic.
It doesn't matter what the answer is,

985
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:00,590
but the point is we believe
different things or moral,

986
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:03,470
but I don't want politicians
who were on a moral crusade.

987
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,290
I want politicians who look
at the government, they go,

988
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:10,970
this should be as least intrusive as
possible and we're going to get out of the

989
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,770
way and we're going to
let people live freely.

990
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,570
And that's going to be a little
messy and it's going to be,

991
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,040
not everyone's going to
get whatever they want,

992
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,190
but we're not gonna keep taking from
everybody to give to some and we're not

993
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,690
gonna. Um, just, we're not
going to be involved in every
facet of everyone's life.

994
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,820
Most bad things that have happened in
the course of time have been done by

995
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:31,050
government and we have to really
remember that. Okay. Shout out to Elisa.

996
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:34,890
There you go. Um, all right guys,

997
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,130
we got six minutes left. Give me some
good questions to end up strong on.

998
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,640
Uh,
best

999
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,990
of luck, Dave and other best
of luck. We got a whole bunch
of best deluxe. Um, okay.

1000
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,460
Do you like many are chasm in Libertarian,
political philosophy,

1001
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:54,461
a nightwatchman state or mini are chasm
many or chasm I guess is a model of a

1002
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:56,660
state whose,
who only functions,

1003
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,740
who's only functions are to provide
citizens with the military. The police,

1004
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,130
the courts, thus protecting
them from aggression, theft,

1005
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:08,840
breach of contract and fraud and
enforcing property laws. I mean,

1006
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:13,790
that's not that far from what an
ideal libertarian state would be.

1007
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,350
So I would need to know what do you mean,

1008
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:18,470
how is that different than what just a
basic libertarian state would be? I mean,

1009
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:23,150
I'm for, I'm for and as much
as possible, the states,

1010
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,670
each individual state
deciding what it wants to do.

1011
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:28,670
If it wants to tax high or tax low,
and that may be,

1012
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,040
that's going to either bring
in business or lose business.

1013
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,450
I'm for states deciding whether they want
marijuana to be legal or not and maybe

1014
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:37,730
that's going to bring people in and
help the economy or maybe it's going to

1015
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:39,110
force certain people to leave,
um,

1016
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:42,530
for states deciding how much tax money
they want to take to put into education

1017
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,110
versus whether they want to,
uh,

1018
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,410
put it into funding a baseball stadium
or whatever else. I want that experiment,

1019
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:52,610
that incredibly beautiful American
experiment of testing this and that and

1020
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:56,630
seeing what works and seeing where people
move and where they stay away from. Uh,

1021
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:01,190
and where freedom prospers
and where people can make
the most out of their lives

1022
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,240
and in what laws cause people to leave.
That that experiment is awesome to me.

1023
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,460
And I'm for anything that
would lead to more of that.

1024
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:11,780
So what you just laid out there for me
is pretty congruent with most of the

1025
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:16,010
things that I believe. Um, but I, I
would need to know a little bit more. Um,

1026
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:20,570
let's see. Super Chat. Yossi being a
patrion being a patron isn't enough.

1027
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,880
What am I buying here?
I don't know that you're buying anything,

1028
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:25,510
but it has been nice getting
to know you a little bit. That,

1029
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:26,600
that is actually one of the things.

1030
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:30,080
One of the things is that I've been
able to meet a lot of these patron, uh,

1031
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,630
people and I've had dinner with some
people and when I was on the road with

1032
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,110
Jordan, I would get coffee with
people and chat with people.

1033
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,430
There's something cool happening here.
There's something cool. All right,

1034
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:38,900
we've got four minutes left people.

1035
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,700
These are your last chances right now
during this live stream to get the mug or

1036
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:45,860
the t shirt. I'm going to
sign mugs. How many more here?

1037
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:48,530
I've got four in this box right now.
Can we get rid of all these four?

1038
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,710
I got a of your box right here, but I've
got four remaining. And you know what,

1039
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:54,950
if you do it for these last four,
cause we got four minutes left.

1040
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,700
I got four mugs for these law.

1041
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,480
Anyone else that gets on until
we shut down in four minutes?

1042
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,920
I'll actually put your name on it too.
There you go. Uh, rude. Uh, Dave Rubin,

1043
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,670
[inaudible] dot com slash donate 50 bucks
monthly. You're going to get the mug.

1044
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:10,040
I'm going to put your name on it and
you're going to get the t shirt and you're

1045
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:14,240
going to feel good about
yourself. We should be selling
totes. Okay. Uh, all right,

1046
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:18,170
Tanner and Eric, I'm writing your
name. There you go. Tanner and Eric,

1047
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:21,290
I don't know if you guys were signing
up before I did it, but Tanner,

1048
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,930
you're getting a mug.
Tanner,

1049
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,420
I even put an exclamation point
after your name. That's exciting.

1050
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,670
And Eric with a c. K the rare c.
K. Eric. All right, very good.

1051
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,440
Eric,
you're getting a mug.

1052
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,300
Eric.
Eric,

1053
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:45,560
you got a comma I gave. I gave the other
guy a, uh, an exclamation point. Brandon.

1054
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:46,910
Thank you very much.
All right guys,

1055
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,300
getting rid of these last couple of
mugs right here. Dave ruby.com/donate.

1056
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:55,280
We've got three minutes left. I talked
a lot today. I mean, try to imagine.

1057
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:59,390
I did. I did two full on interviews. Then
I did a half hour interview. Then I did,

1058
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,560
I started the morning at 7:00 AM with
a radio station and, um, Altoona,

1059
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:07,250
Pennsylvania, I think, which actually
was totally fun. Um, let's see why. Oh,

1060
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:09,260
this is a great question.
Why is the Reuben,

1061
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:13,160
we're based out of California if that
state's economic and political climate is

1062
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:17,870
as bad as conservatives say. Is
it exaggeration now? Um, well,

1063
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:21,350
I don't think it's as bad. So first
off, the taxes here are in sane.

1064
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,230
They're absolutely insane.
Now, I do have a business here,

1065
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:26,330
so I'm able to write off a lot of stuff,
right?

1066
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,150
So if we buy a whole bunch of bugs,
um,

1067
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,990
we were able to write that off as
a business expense, obviously. Uh,

1068
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,640
there's some other things that we're
able to write off that, you know,

1069
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:38,570
business expenses when we buy equipment
and computers and things of that nature.

1070
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,370
Um, so that helps a little bit on
the tax front. Um, why is it here?

1071
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:47,690
I mean the main reason it's here
is that in La specifically is um,

1072
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,250
that will a,
I moved to La,

1073
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:53,630
it'll be six years in February
and when I moved to La, um,

1074
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:56,990
it was sort of at the beginning of all
of this and I was just trying to get a

1075
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,380
gig that I thought was cool and
whatever. I hadn't really, um,

1076
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,140
sort of figured all this stuff out. What
I would say now is a, I mean first off,

1077
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,040
so cow la, the weather is great. Like
it is 80 and sunny almost every day.

1078
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:12,170
The worst day in cal is like the best
day almost everywhere else instead of San

1079
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,600
Diego. But you're going to pay for that
because a lot of people want to live here

1080
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:18,440
obviously. But, but that's
not eight, although I do enjoy
the weather for sure. The,

1081
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:21,020
the real thing that keeps me
here right now is that, um,

1082
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,620
there really is a nice thing
growing in Los Angeles,

1083
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:29,180
a nice sort of center,
right? Classical, liberal,

1084
00:58:29,181 --> 00:58:31,790
Libertarian, conservative thing.
Rowing right here in la. I mean, look,

1085
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:36,770
Ben Shapiro's here, Peter Teal just
moved down here. A Dennis Prager is here.

1086
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,920
Um, but then there's other people that
aren't, don't necessarily fit into that.

1087
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:40,940
Sam Harris is here.
I mean there's,

1088
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,730
there's a lot of people in the
Los Angeles area, you know,

1089
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:45,830
because the thing is that as politics,

1090
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,270
as politics collide more with media,
right?

1091
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,960
And his politics becomes more invested
in what's going on with the digital world

1092
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:54,860
and youtube and all that.

1093
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,370
Well now and La is the home of
entertainment and now politics is kind of

1094
00:58:58,371 --> 00:58:59,181
becoming entertainment.
Now.

1095
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:01,700
That may be terrible for the
longterm health of the country,

1096
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,560
but it's something that's happening
right now. So I think this, the,

1097
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:07,570
the whole gestalt of that, I would say
is the reason that I'm here just stalled.

1098
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,270
Good word, by the way. I'm all
right guys. We got one minute left.

1099
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,320
How many more mugs am I
going to get rid of? Uh,

1100
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,760
we will be doing another one of these
on January 15th when I will be, uh,

1101
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,790
shutting down Patrion on live right here.
Uh, it's Dave Ruby. Com slash donate.

1102
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,470
And uh,

1103
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,900
here's what we'll do just in case you
were about to sign on right now because it

1104
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:29,840
is four o'clock and I got to go, I think
the Tucker guys waiting for me outside.

1105
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,440
Uh, anyone that donates in the
next 10 minutes till four 10.

1106
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,550
We're going to shut the stream in a sec,

1107
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:38,180
but if you don't eat in the next 10
minutes, uh, we'll, and you get the mug.

1108
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:40,610
I'm going to put your name
on the Mug itself anyway,

1109
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,180
we'll do another one of these next week.
We got Jeffrey Miller on tomorrow. Um,

1110
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,900
we've got another bunch of cool shows
coming up over the rest of the month.

1111
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:52,190
Then I hit Australia for most
of February with Jordan. Uh,

1112
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,620
then I'm back here in March and we're,
we're already,

1113
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,000
we're like overbooked already,

1114
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,340
but we'll leave some room in case
some interesting things pop up.

1115
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,830
Then I may take the Ruben
report on the road for April.

1116
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,470
I got to look at that deal and see
where we're at on that. Then Jordan,

1117
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,010
I may hit the road again or it sounds
like we are a for May and June back to

1118
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:11,120
Europe and uh, yeah, let's
just keep going. Right.

1119
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,580
Why not when he got better
to do so. Uh, thank you guys.

1120
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:16,470
Thank you everybody that just donated.
You guys are the lifeblood of this thing.

1121
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,070
You're keeping it going. Uh,
we're, we're going to be okay.

1122
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,470
Like if we don't get any more donations,
we are going to be okay.

1123
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:24,780
But the more we get, we can keep growing
and expanding and all that stuff. But,

1124
01:00:24,781 --> 01:00:25,880
but truly,
when I,

1125
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,080
when I said we were leaving Patrion I
did not know what was going to happen.

1126
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:33,020
Like I didn't know if we said,
okay, well people go to our website.

1127
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:35,840
Like I didn't know if we were gonna
wake up and it was going to be like 15

1128
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,150
people went there and we got a
couple hundred bucks. I'm like,

1129
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,890
I've got to lay off. People are like,
figure out something else to do. Um,

1130
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,970
but you guys have shown up. You really
have. It's, it's, it's incredible.

1131
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:46,460
It's humbling. It's awesome. You
make me want to be a better man.

1132
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,360
I am looking forward to seeing some of
you guys tomorrow night at the Ontario

1133
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:54,140
Improv in so cal with Bret Weinstein.
January 30th at the Irvine Improv.

1134
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,790
January 29th. I'm at cal state.
Uh, ah, I'm blank. And where am I?

1135
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,710
Cal State somewhere? Um, yeah, I mean,
I think I'm at cal state. Uh, the, uh,

1136
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:05,270
the College Republicans are inviting me.

1137
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:07,550
I would've been glad to talk to
the College Democrats, but they,

1138
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,470
they never invite me anywhere. Um, and uh,
all right, that's it. Catch me on Tucker.

1139
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,510
I think I'll be on at eight 45 eastern,

1140
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,530
which is about five or 15 minutes before
this Trump guy has given a talk about

1141
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:20,870
the wall. So, all right, I'll see
you guys around. Thanks a lot.
