00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.560
 Some people call light and vitality, but for some reason 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.760
 Even if you seem to have just been able to sleep, 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 You will still suffer from drowsiness and impotence throughout the day 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.200
 So, why are you always tired? 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.880
 If you know that the number of hours of sleep is not a problem 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.880
 The second most common cause of stress 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680
 It comes from lack of activity and poor nutrition 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.480
 A study followed by a study proved that adults 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.180
 Who practiced light exercises several times a week, became active six weeks later 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.520
 People who have been trained regularly have also been encouraged to sleep better 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.060
 Although studies show they do not sleep longer 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.380
 But if this does not benefit you, do not rush to the cup of your strength 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740
 While many studies have shown that coffee is beneficial to your health 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.940
 Research has shown that relying on it makes you need to sleep more 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.400
 Coffee reverses the action of adenosine in the brain 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.020
 Which accumulates throughout the day 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.680
 It makes you feel sleepy at night 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 But the consumption of coffee or energy drinks before bedtime by 6 hours 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.260
 Will affect the quality of sleep 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 So we see people who do not use coffee 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.720
 They are often less tired in the morning 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.480
 Make sure you drink enough water 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.760
 One study found that the water shortage in the body by 1.5% 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 It can cause difficulty concentrating 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.300
 Your blood gets more intense, causing slow oxygen and nutrients 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.180
 For muscles and organs 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.440
 However a 2% shortfall is enough to make you thirsty 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
 So there is no need to drink gallons of water 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.080
 Staying wet throughout the day will certainly help 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.540
 Urine should be yellow 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.160
 Any clogging of color suggests your need for water 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 A cup of wine or alcohol before bedtime 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.860
 They can affect your day 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.060
 Studies have found that you are in the case of buzz 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 You will sleep faster 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.600
 But the quality of your sleep is much worse 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.280
 Especially during the second half of sleep 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.440
 In the end alcohol reduces the sleep you get 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.360
 And if you drink and sleep on the weekend 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.900
 Be aware that a fixed sleep schedule is the solution 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.180
 Try to wake up at your usual times on weekdays 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840
 And get naps for 20 minutes during the day 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.640
 This will make you recharge your body without having to sleep long 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 Or made you more tired 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.340
 Sleep in time on Sunday evening 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.960
 Makes Monday morning easier 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.480
 And certainly your psychological state also has a role 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.540
 Anxiety is a big thing 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.400
 Fear of people's words or feeling nervous about work 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.140
 Or be concerned about every decision you make 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 It will make you tired and tired 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.840
 Fatigue is one of the main causes of anxiety disorders 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.780
 Not only that, anxiety can affect the quality of sleep 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.060
 Another serious risk, depression can be a cause of physical and emotional pain 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.560
 An increase in sleep will not necessarily be a solution 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.640
 Some anxiety causes insomnia 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.460
 Or inability to sleep 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 Unfortunately, there is no quick cure for 10% of Americans 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 Who suffer from depression 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.940
 So if you think you are suffering from acetab 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.600
 Go to a doctor or psychologist 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.460
 In the end you might be a night person like a mole 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.660
 About 10% of the population has genes 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.760
 Keep them awake late at night 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.920
 But living in a day-to-day world makes it difficult 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.180
 You get enough sleep 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.740
 In fact scientists call it the phenomenon of different timing community 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.380
 The night person feels that he is living within the wrong timing every day 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.640
 If you do not feel any improvement, you may have a medical problem 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.820
 Cause you fatigue so you should talk to a specialist about them 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.920
