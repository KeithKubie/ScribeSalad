well if you look at the history of the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410
well if you look at the history of the
 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.529
well if you look at the history of the
automobile there have never really been

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539
automobile there have never really been
 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.380
automobile there have never really been
any radical changes I don't see any

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390
any radical changes I don't see any
 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.460
any radical changes I don't see any
radical changes or step changes in the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470
radical changes or step changes in the
 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.280
radical changes or step changes in the
near future at least but I think we're

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290
near future at least but I think we're
 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.889
near future at least but I think we're
perhaps we will see some bigger changes

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899
perhaps we will see some bigger changes
 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.030
perhaps we will see some bigger changes
than in the past I believe that if we're

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040
than in the past I believe that if we're
 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.130
than in the past I believe that if we're
going to continue to use automobiles in

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140
going to continue to use automobiles in
 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.350
going to continue to use automobiles in
any big way we have to be much more

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360
any big way we have to be much more
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.830
any big way we have to be much more
selective as end users in making sure we

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840
selective as end users in making sure we
 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.010
selective as end users in making sure we
use the right vehicle for the right job

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
use the right vehicle for the right job
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.540
use the right vehicle for the right job
the right tool for the right job the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
the right tool for the right job the
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.490
the right tool for the right job the
right car for the right journey and you

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500
right car for the right journey and you
 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.110
right car for the right journey and you
mentioned a little earlier you know how

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
mentioned a little earlier you know how
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.810
mentioned a little earlier you know how
85 87 percent of people still use the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820
85 87 percent of people still use the
 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.940
85 87 percent of people still use the
car for their commuting rather than

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950
car for their commuting rather than
 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.500
car for their commuting rather than
other means of transportation so then

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
other means of transportation so then
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.110
other means of transportation so then
reality is that most of those car

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
reality is that most of those car
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.200
reality is that most of those car
journeys are done alone so why do we

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210
journeys are done alone so why do we
 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.719
journeys are done alone so why do we
haul around ourselves in a vehicle

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729
haul around ourselves in a vehicle
 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.240
haul around ourselves in a vehicle
that's 20 or 30 times our own weight

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
that's 20 or 30 times our own weight
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.389
that's 20 or 30 times our own weight
because it's got three four or five six

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399
because it's got three four or five six
 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.510
because it's got three four or five six
seven sometimes empty seats around us

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520
seven sometimes empty seats around us
 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.069
seven sometimes empty seats around us
those vehicles are fine when they used

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079
those vehicles are fine when they used
 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.370
those vehicles are fine when they used
to carry a lot of people but so I think

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
to carry a lot of people but so I think
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.080
to carry a lot of people but so I think
one of the changes that I believe we

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
one of the changes that I believe we
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.029
one of the changes that I believe we
need to see as a much greater

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039
need to see as a much greater
 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.399
need to see as a much greater
opportunity for people to to use whether

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409
opportunity for people to to use whether
 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.699
opportunity for people to to use whether
it's through buying or sharing vehicles

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709
it's through buying or sharing vehicles
 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.469
it's through buying or sharing vehicles
specifically for commuting there'll be

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
specifically for commuting there'll be
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.020
specifically for commuting there'll be
as safe they'll be much more energy

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030
as safe they'll be much more energy
 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.529
as safe they'll be much more energy
efficient use up less space and then you

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539
efficient use up less space and then you
 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.480
efficient use up less space and then you
can make a better case for using cards

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490
can make a better case for using cards
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.879
can make a better case for using cards
so i think the architecture of vehicles

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889
so i think the architecture of vehicles
 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.489
so i think the architecture of vehicles
will will will start to see much smaller

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499
will will will start to see much smaller
 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.709
will will will start to see much smaller
vehicles i think that one of the one of

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719
vehicles i think that one of the one of
 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.589
vehicles i think that one of the one of
the big issues of the vehicle design to

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599
the big issues of the vehicle design to
 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.269
the big issues of the vehicle design to
is the crash of Odin's technology that

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279
is the crash of Odin's technology that
 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.330
is the crash of Odin's technology that
we're beginning to see being introduced

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340
we're beginning to see being introduced
 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.550
we're beginning to see being introduced
personally my own opinion is that if the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
personally my own opinion is that if the
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.969
personally my own opinion is that if the
automobile is to remain a major player

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979
automobile is to remain a major player
 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.350
automobile is to remain a major player
in personal mobility then I think

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
in personal mobility then I think
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.080
in personal mobility then I think
autonomous vehicles are going to be a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
autonomous vehicles are going to be a
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.309
autonomous vehicles are going to be a
real a real advantage some people think

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319
real a real advantage some people think
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.980
real a real advantage some people think
this is crazy and is not possible

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990
this is crazy and is not possible
 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.590
this is crazy and is not possible
I and quite a few other people think

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600
I and quite a few other people think
 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.180
I and quite a few other people think
that this is not crazy and there are

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
that this is not crazy and there are
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.280
that this is not crazy and there are
some really good reasons why we should

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
some really good reasons why we should
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.660
some really good reasons why we should
go that way we're kind of on the way now

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
go that way we're kind of on the way now
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.400
go that way we're kind of on the way now
how will this affect the way cars look

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
how will this affect the way cars look
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.110
how will this affect the way cars look
as I've said we're going to see cars

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
as I've said we're going to see cars
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.570
as I've said we're going to see cars
that I hope we see more cars on the road

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580
that I hope we see more cars on the road
 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.100
that I hope we see more cars on the road
that are much smaller we've seen some

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
that are much smaller we've seen some
 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.280
that are much smaller we've seen some
examples at recent auto shows Volkswagen

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290
examples at recent auto shows Volkswagen
 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.380
examples at recent auto shows Volkswagen
and some of the Japanese companies have

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
and some of the Japanese companies have
 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.230
and some of the Japanese companies have
shown much smaller vehicles there is

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240
shown much smaller vehicles there is
 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.170
shown much smaller vehicles there is
still a lot of reticence amongst car

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
still a lot of reticence amongst car
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.880
still a lot of reticence amongst car
users that they're not as safe was

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890
users that they're not as safe was
 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280
users that they're not as safe was
driving around in a big car that needn't

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290
driving around in a big car that needn't
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.380
driving around in a big car that needn't
be the case small cars can be engineered

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390
be the case small cars can be engineered
 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.660
be the case small cars can be engineered
to be extremely safe they still have to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670
to be extremely safe they still have to
 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.000
to be extremely safe they still have to
pass all the same crash regulations that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
pass all the same crash regulations that
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.280
pass all the same crash regulations that
a big car does so a lot of it is about

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
a big car does so a lot of it is about
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.100
a big car does so a lot of it is about
perceptions at the same time if cars can

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
perceptions at the same time if cars can
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.680
perceptions at the same time if cars can
be engineered to drive themselves

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690
be engineered to drive themselves
 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.790
be engineered to drive themselves
reliably without crashing into each

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800
reliably without crashing into each
 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.210
reliably without crashing into each
other then you can make the cars a lot

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220
other then you can make the cars a lot
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.590
other then you can make the cars a lot
lighter still because you don't have to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600
lighter still because you don't have to
 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.930
lighter still because you don't have to
engineer them to be like tanks

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.300
 
I think given the right circumstances we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
I think given the right circumstances we
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.180
I think given the right circumstances we
could see vehicles that are able to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190
could see vehicles that are able to
 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.850
could see vehicles that are able to
drive by themselves in within a decade

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860
drive by themselves in within a decade
 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.220
drive by themselves in within a decade
but that's under ideal circumstances the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230
but that's under ideal circumstances the
 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.190
but that's under ideal circumstances the
the main barrier that people flag up

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200
the main barrier that people flag up
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.670
the main barrier that people flag up
with autonomous driving is yes but how

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680
with autonomous driving is yes but how
 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.410
with autonomous driving is yes but how
do you mix cars that can drive

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420
do you mix cars that can drive
 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.750
do you mix cars that can drive
themselves with older cars that can't

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760
themselves with older cars that can't
 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.870
themselves with older cars that can't
drive themselves and so actually

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
drive themselves and so actually
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.850
drive themselves and so actually
introducing these autonomous cars into

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860
introducing these autonomous cars into
 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.360
introducing these autonomous cars into
the legacy fleet is that is the is a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
the legacy fleet is that is the is a
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.680
the legacy fleet is that is the is a
challenge that I believe it's quite

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690
challenge that I believe it's quite
 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.620
challenge that I believe it's quite
possible honestly I think it's probably

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630
possible honestly I think it's probably
 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.490
possible honestly I think it's probably
20 or 30 years away before we see a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500
20 or 30 years away before we see a
 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.300
20 or 30 years away before we see a
landscape a car landscape where all cars

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310
landscape a car landscape where all cars
 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.520
landscape a car landscape where all cars
are driving themselves but I often think

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
are driving themselves but I often think
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.170
are driving themselves but I often think
what would it be like if we if we

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180
what would it be like if we if we
 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.270
what would it be like if we if we
transported ourselves and a hundred

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
transported ourselves and a hundred
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.800
transported ourselves and a hundred
years into the future or imagine our

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
years into the future or imagine our
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.410
years into the future or imagine our
great-great-grandchildren and they say

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420
great-great-grandchildren and they say
 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.650
great-great-grandchildren and they say
granddad is it true that in twenty ten

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660
granddad is it true that in twenty ten
 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.360
granddad is it true that in twenty ten
people were allowed to drive their own
