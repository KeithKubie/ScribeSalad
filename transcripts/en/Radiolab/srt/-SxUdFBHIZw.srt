1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,150
Gonads. Episode three.
I'm Molly Webster. Hello.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,590
Hello. Are you still there? I'm still
here. And this is my mother Mary Webster.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,300
Yeah. Um, but uh, but yeah, no, the
bedbugs are such a freaking pain.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,700
You have to vacuum all of the baseboards.
You have to vacuum the floors,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,040
you have to vacuum the door jams cause
they crawl up the walls when they're

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,874
trying to get away.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,630
Oh Molly, that sounds awful.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,710
So I recently called my mom for
I guess to catch up but also

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,430
bye.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,270
I had a work question

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,170
[inaudible] that's been bugging me

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,490
cause on my mind, yeah.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,170
So I asked her mom been working on this
story and it made me wonder what you

14
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,820
would have named me if I was a boy.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,280
You would have been named Daniel
Dad always liked the name and yeah,

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,390
if we ever had a boy, dad said
he was going to name of Daniel.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,990
I if that's you want, go for it. Yeah.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Cause he didn't want a junior. You wanted
it Daniel. He wanted a little Danny.

19
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,010
Instead he got a Judy, Chrissy,
Peggy and Molly. Your poor father,

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,350
Mike glucky father,

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,770
if you had come out, boy you
would have been Daniel. Yes. Wait,

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,180
all of us. Not Well No,

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,870
we wait Daniel for up
forever. You were just ready.

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,140
We didn't know when I'm breaking him
out. He was going to be up. Yeah,

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,000
I mean [inaudible]

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,983
[inaudible]

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,540
so this is just going to sound ridiculous,

28
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,990
but I called my mom because all these
stories that we've been doing in this

29
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,830
series, they do make you think about fate.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,110
Like even if you think about the first
one where they're the primordial germ

31
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,140
cells, um,

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,580
and they are holding on to all sorts
of possibilities and futures and then

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,720
chromosome step in and no more infinity.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,780
You're just like shunted
onto a path I guess.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,920
I guess.

36
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,930
I guess asking my mom about Daniel was
just like a clumsy way of getting back to

37
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,210
what feels like a really pristine moment.

38
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:29,211
Like a moment where no decision
had been made where you exist.

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,790
Totally embalm, ish by
life and choice and fate

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,873
in less.

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,330
Maybe life isn't so
fateful. Case in point.

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,690
David, dark hour. Hello. Hi.
Actually, I'm just going to make,

43
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,400
I don't like correcting people,
but I'll just correct you.

44
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,780
My name is pronounced Sarah Kovar is
our covert covert yet cause it is a w

45
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,930
right? I'm not missed. It's a
w for the sake of my parents.

46
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,290
I pronounce it with the like a v.
Um, it's, it's essentially Polish.

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,900
That's good. And um, you
work at the University of
Minnesota? Yep. That's right.

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,260
Uh, what do you do there? Uh, genetics,
cell biology and development. That's,

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,130
that seems scary. It's broad. Anyways,

50
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:17,131
the reason I called Zack Kovar was because
I came across a series of experiments

51
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:21,310
that he did that just straight
up kicked me into gonads. Okay.

52
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,230
So to begin, this was,
um, back in the, uh,

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,980
early 1990s there Kovar was working in
a lab doing genetic stuff in worms and

54
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,660
flies and mice and things. And one day
Presto, we got lucky done, Dah, Dah, Dah.

55
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,020
He and his team discovered a
brand new gene. Yup, that's right.

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,770
They saw it in mice and gave it a name.
I unfortunately am responsible for this.

57
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:46,620
It's DMR. T One d m r t one
DMR t one. Yup. Demert one.

58
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,530
I keep trying to say d r m t it's
a little bit, it's a nightmare.

59
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,970
Very sorry for that.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,990
And what was interesting was that this
gene was in mice but also in humans

61
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:58,950
[inaudible]

62
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,270
and in the male mouse it
was expressing itself in the

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,870
testis. You forgot to say it.

64
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,240
Testis testes. Testes, testicles,
testers. Is that a single? Yep. Okay.

65
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,660
So yes, we found this gene and
humans had it and the test is,

66
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,980
and the question we had was whether
it was doing something or not.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
Like you've got genes in your eyes that
are making chemicals that are making

68
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:30,510
your eyes the color. They are this
gene DMR t one. What is it doing?

69
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,400
We wanted to know if it's involved in
maybe making sperm or maybe it just hangs

70
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,340
around. It doesn't matter. It doesn't
do anything, you know, we don't know.

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,640
And so they're like, let's mess
around with it and see what happens.

72
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,670
But

73
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,400
you can't do that
experiment in humans. No.

74
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,480
So instead they get some adult male mice,

75
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,540
perfectly normal fertile
males that are making sperm.

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,720
And we use some fancy
molecular genetic tricks.

77
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,290
And so basically it's kind of a
mean trick, but a, it's genetics.

78
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,080
They cut the gene out,

79
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,040
we did that and then they take a slice
of the testis and they look at it under

80
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,520
the microscope and it didn't look
like what we would have expected.

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,030
And what they expect to see is that these
are the cells that help make the sperm

82
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,350
in the testis. And normally
they're kind of tall and lean,

83
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,760
long and skinny,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,690
but suddenly they're
different with DMR t one gone.

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,070
They had gotten smaller rounder
and their cover was like,

86
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,010
this was not something that was supposed
to happen. What is going on here?

87
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,360
What are these things?

88
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,010
And then he realized that the cells
are making estrogen and he was like

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,250
[inaudible]. Oh yeah.

90
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,210
I think what is happening is that the
cells in the testis turned into ovary

91
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:52,430
cells. Wait, wait and wait.

92
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,090
It's a male mouse. Yes. So you're
saying this male mouse now has

93
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
over resales in its testicles?

94
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,050
Yes. These are cells that are
changing their, their sex.

95
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,690
That's insane. Can I, can we just
have like a, a exclamatory moment?

96
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:12,920
Like where you were you like, whoa. Is
that pot that's possible. That happened.

97
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:13,650
What is it, you know,

98
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,510
what do you say for, for us anyway,

99
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:19,360
the greatest of all scientific
exclamations is, that's weird. Um,

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
so we had that weird moment

101
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,000
and just to take this weirdness
like a one step further,

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,390
a group of scientists did
similar experiment in adult
female mice where they did

103
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:32,740
like the same

104
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,420
fancy molecular genetic tricks.

105
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,210
Only this time they knocked out a female
gene in the ovary and when they went to

106
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,130
look at it,

107
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,840
the ovary is trying to kind of
reorganize itself into, um, the testis.

108
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,723
Wait,

109
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,040
[inaudible] you're saying in both cases
there's one gene that's flipping the sex

110
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:57,180
from male to female or back?
Yes. One gene. One gene.

111
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,280
How many genes do we have in our body?
I don't know, like tens of thousands.

112
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,320
Wow. And just one is doing this,

113
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,350
which is weird concept to think of
because we typically connect like sex or

114
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,740
gonads to chromosomes at least. I do like
an accent of why is a girl and a boy,

115
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,150
so how could a gene step
in and reverse that? Yeah.

116
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,050
Cause I thought chromosomes
were a, lots of genes.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,620
There are these like massive
things. One gene is so tiny,

118
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,330
ginger tiny chromosomes are much bigger.

119
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:31,310
And I think the answer to that
is that when you get down to sex,

120
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,430
like what makes us one sex
or the other, it's not,

121
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,600
it doesn't work exactly like we thought.
Like take for example the x and y idea,

122
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,580
this like chromosomal narrative
we have of biological sex.

123
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,350
It's a specific way of thinking about
things from a certain moment in history

124
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:54,240
that we are potentially
starting to rethink. Huh.

125
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,340
I think it's helpful to see sort of the,

126
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,260
the history of how we
understand sex and in a,

127
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,130
in a longer timeframe. So
let me bring in this guy.

128
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,890
I'm David Page biology professor
at MIT. Where do we start?

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Oh my gosh. Well we're
going to go. So let's see.

130
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,900
We could go off the rails in
any number of directions here,

131
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,550
all of which would be quite, quite
productive. But let's see. So, um,

132
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,420
let's go back to um, the 1890s.

133
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
Yeah, that definitely is 1890s.

134
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,730
So genetics was in its infancy,
Mendel peas, all that was [inaudible]

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,060
and people had been
pondering for millennial.

136
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,210
Where do boys and girls come from

137
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,300
now when it came to how you look? People
thought mom and dad clearly involved

138
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,550
because people had realized, you know,

139
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:48,390
the children ended up growing up looking
something like their mother and their

140
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,050
father.

141
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,370
Like maybe you have a Chin like your dad
and knows like your mom and the hair.

142
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,204
That's a little bit of a [inaudible].

143
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,040
There was a kind of blending of
mom and dad to make you you right.

144
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,290
But when it came to why
you were the sex you were,

145
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,300
that was a mystery because
there was no blending.

146
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,010
You ended up being like either
your mother or your father,

147
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,670
one or the other.

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,930
Therefore it must not have
anything to do with heredity.

149
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,050
It had to be imposed from
the outside in some way.

150
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,440
So people came up with all kinds of
ideas for what made you a boy or a girl

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,910
phase of the moon at that moment
of conception called dark moon.

152
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,810
Definitely a girl. The state of
the economy wouldn't be surprised.

153
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:40,400
Down economy girl, everything
that was bad was given to women.

154
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,720
Uh, there was what the mother
ate, mom's body, heat, stress,

155
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,420
all sorts of crazy things. And then, um,

156
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,380
in 1923, we started looking elsewhere,

157
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,490
but how do we inherit our
characteristics for an answer?

158
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,150
Chromosome chromosomes determine
our physical appearance and our sex.

159
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,710
In 1923,

160
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:09,400
a scientists looking down the barrel
of a microscope discovers to new

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,850
from the silence x and a
y all the sex chromosomes.

162
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,530
But I just want to hit pause here.

163
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,840
I came to find out actually from David
Page that the x and y chromosomes do not

164
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:24,890
look like an x and y. Wait, they don't
look like the letters. Oh No, no, no, no.

165
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,460
When they first discovered them,
they were blobs under the microscope.

166
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,270
They just look like
these misshapen clumps,

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,430
kidney being mark. The x look bigger.
The y looks smaller, but that's it.

168
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,520
That's so interesting because there's
something about the shape of the x and the

169
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:45,190
shape of the why, which read as gendered
letters that feel so yeah, cause right.

170
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,600
Why has a little stem on it,
which is sort of peanuts.

171
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:51,530
Like there's like a duality or something
in the x, which feels like, you know,

172
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,990
ovaries and breasts or
something. Like there is like a,

173
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,030
there is something about those letters.

174
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,070
So I was totally shocked when he was like,

175
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,520
there's no real reason they got those
letters. It was totally arbitrary.

176
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,750
Anyways, when they
found these chromosomes,

177
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,210
it was clear that if you
had x, x two x chromosomes,

178
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,480
you would develop as a
female anatomic female.

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,490
And if you had a y chromosome, your x,
y you would develop as an anatomic male.

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,680
Oh boy. That was the thinking.
So you see Roger on suse.

181
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,093
Yeah.

182
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,390
But then that idea it got
more complicated. Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,460
When did you intersect with this story?

184
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,240
The summer of 1970 pages at MIT.

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,310
First Year of medical school
and the DNA revolution. So

186
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,090
far tonight we've been
bringing you a news.

187
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
So the world around us was just beginning.

188
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,650
Now we have news of the
incredible world inside us.

189
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,430
He was involved in what he
described, like the precursor

190
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,850
to the human genome project,

191
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,440
what would become the human genome
project working with a group of senior

192
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:06,441
scientists who were envisioning maps of
the human genome [inaudible] we all know

193
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,220
within complete set of
instructions which made people,

194
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,730
and we began to look back
at some exceptional human
individuals who had not been

195
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,890
understood previously.

196
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,980
That saliva test women revealed that
Maria had a set of x and y chromosomes who

197
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,200
had an x and a y
chromosome. Like most men,

198
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,520
women usually have a pair of xs and they
were also looking at men who had been

199
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:35,190
an all together male
anatomy, penis, testes,

200
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,220
but whose chromosomes appeared to
beat those typical of a female xx.

201
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,250
And for Paige and other
scientists, they were like, oh,

202
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:46,730
there must be something more happening
here than just like the chromosome.

203
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,390
There must be something
deeper going on here.

204
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,640
So we might actually be on
the trail now of the secret.

205
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,670
So scientists across the world started
looking at these people's chromosomes,

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,800
and what we found was that the few x y
females were actually missing a little

207
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,240
bit of the y chromosome
with these x, y women.

208
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,820
A little bit of the y wasn't there,

209
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,910
and the bit of the why that the x y
females were missing was the same bit that

210
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,930
was present in the xx males,

211
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,430
meaning somehow a little bit of the y
chromosome had gotten onto one of the exes

212
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,900
of these x x males.

213
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,020
And so it was becoming very clear that
this must be the bit that matters.

214
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,570
And around 1990 other news this day,

215
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,940
scientists say they've
made a major discovery.

216
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,800
Scientists in Britain announced they'd
found this one gene on the y chromosome,

217
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,090
the genetic trigger on the y chromosome
that determines whether a baby will be a

218
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,530
boy or a girl.

219
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,840
What they found is that of the
200 odd genes on the y chromosome,

220
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:02,040
there was this one single
gene that acted as the switch,

221
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,220
the master switch, the
grand master switch,

222
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,140
which determines the child's sex.

223
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,040
So it's not x and Y as a whole.

224
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,410
It's one tiny piece.

225
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,770
[inaudible].

226
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,900
So back in the first episode,

227
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,210
there were those primordial germ cells
and they had to go on that super long

228
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,220
journey to get to the Gonad Cathedral.

229
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,880
And on the journey when
they got to the cathedral,

230
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:38,020
they were full of potential, right?
They could be anything can be male,

231
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:42,160
they could be female, they could be
whatever your version of anything is. Um,

232
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,620
and then when they get
[inaudible] get there,

233
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,530
there's a moment where like we said,
fate stepped in and just crushed,

234
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:52,490
like swept all their
possibility away and said,

235
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,120
you are one thing and this
is the thing you will be,

236
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,340
this gene is fate. Uh, this gene,

237
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:04,520
these scientists
discovered if it shows up,

238
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,550
then you shoot off down the path
that his sperm test is male.

239
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,210
And if it doesn't show up, you
shoot down the path of egg,

240
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,770
ovary female, and the scientists, uh,

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,440
gave this gene and name
s r y. [inaudible].

242
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,653
Sorry

243
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,963
man. Sorry.

244
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,480
So it sounds like we've gone from like
crazy ideas about what makes a boy or a

245
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:38,130
girl to chromosomes to
now like this little gene.

246
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,810
Yeah. But the,

247
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,380
the sorry gene that you just mentioned
is different than the gene that I just

248
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:47,580
heard about from a, I'm forgetting
his name. Zara Kovar is our Coover.

249
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,790
It's our covert, Yep. It's our
covert covert. Yes, it is. I think,

250
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,250
is it different that's the
same gene or is it DMR?

251
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,940
T one is a different
gene than s r y but this,

252
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,510
this is what's so crazy
about DMR. T y. Okay.

253
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,510
Primordial germ cells.
They're in the embryo.

254
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,680
They're waiting to become something
and then, sorry, shows up.

255
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,210
But it just comes on for about
a day and then it goes away.

256
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,470
But once it turns [inaudible]

257
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:14,960
Zan,

258
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,910
it then starts this like cascade
of Jean after Jean after Jean.

259
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,480
That all sort of say, you're
male, you're male, you're male.

260
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,280
And what all of these genes do is they
create chemicals that send out signals

261
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,440
that start forming and shaping

262
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,230
being the test is. And as soon
as the test is begins to develop

263
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,050
[inaudible] turns the fourth
gene, DMR t one zero clovers gene.

264
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,470
And it clearly is important for
finishing the job of making a testis.

265
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,100
But the thing is most of these other
genes that make the test is turn off the

266
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:50,920
DMR t one. It doesn't
go away at that point.

267
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,070
Yes,

268
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,970
stays active

269
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,460
forever in the wound when
the test is, is just growing.

270
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:03,260
And then when you're born and through,
you know, childhood, your teenage years,

271
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:07,520
adulthood, like until
you die, DMR t one is on.

272
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,420
And if you take it away,
likes are covert, did

273
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,940
the cell will actually change sex,

274
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,540
which leads you to believe that DMR t
one is actually preventing a cell from

275
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,860
switching sexes. That's right.
So I called blanche capable,

276
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,080
who is a geneticists
from our first episode.

277
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,750
And she explained that what all
this means is that that other path,

278
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,460
the path that you did not take
in the Gonad Cathedral, um,

279
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,520
it never went away. It's
actually still there.

280
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,710
You carry it with you always.

281
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,180
It's just that that Jean has
been shushing it. Yeah. Wait,

282
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,050
I'm repressing the other
pathway. My whole like, I

283
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,140
think we think so. Yeah. Really? Yeah.
There's like a parallel universe.

284
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,180
Male Molly. Yes. I think there is.
There's a parallel universe. Male Molly.

285
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,470
Wow. That's just cool. Wait,

286
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,960
when you say this gene has
been shushing the other Molly,

287
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,470
what does that even mean? Huh? Okay,
so you could think of it like this.

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,530
The code for that other
Molly who I'll call Daniel,

289
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,710
that code is still in my cells and dark
cover says that what this gene does is

290
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:19,861
it sort of,

291
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:23,160
one of the things this gene does is
sort of patrols and it makes sure that

292
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,800
Daniel genes don't turn on

293
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,080
basically what this gene's been doing.
It turns out as playing whack-a-mole,

294
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm basically just going around and
being like, Daniel, no, off Daniel, no,

295
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,170
op and it does this maybe every day.

296
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,350
It's like an election that's always
being kind of challenged. Yes.

297
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,130
Or why cast the deciding
vote and male happened.

298
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,900
But there's recount every
now and then and a 50.

299
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,450
Marty one's not there to
say, nope, still male. Uh,

300
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,130
then you can go the other way.

301
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,370
So now I understand why you're so obsessed
with Daniel because it's not just as

302
00:18:55,381 --> 00:19:00,330
an idea, he's like trying to get out
and it does go both ways. Like, like,

303
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,480
um, you know, there's SROI
and there's DMR t one,

304
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,670
but they have found these key genes in
ovaries that you can turn on and off and

305
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,410
have similar results. Why would or why
would our bodies be set up this way?

306
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Like you think once the decision gets
made that you just make that decision and

307
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,250
be done with it,

308
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,430
why would there always be the
possibility of unmaking the decision?

309
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,240
That is a good question and I
will answer that after break.

310
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,470
But first I'm going to call my sisters

311
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,923
[inaudible]

312
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,110
[inaudible] uh,

313
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,470
uh, [inaudible] on

314
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,590
chase [inaudible]

315
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,420
this is Kayla Cabo calling
from Sunny Austin, Texas.

316
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,180
Radiolab presents gonads.

317

Hey everyone. I'm Dr
Raj. I love getting to

321
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,730
talk with you on my show every single
day. But when the cameras stopped rolling,

322
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,290
the conversation isn't over for I decided
to start a podcast in order to dive

323
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,520
deeper into the issues and ideas
that I love sharing with you. Yes,

324
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,750
help unfiltered.

325
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,980
My wife Lisa will be joining me and
together we're taking wellness to the next

326
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:10,690
level and having a little fun along
the way. So download the Dr Oz podcast.

328
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,340
All right, back to gonads. I'm
Molly Webster. Everyone's say,

329
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,140
say their name or hello.

330
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,360
Okay, it's Chrissy [inaudible].

331
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,510
Peggy. Yeah. Hi. Hi. How are you?

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,670
I'm great. And these are my sisters,
Judy, Chrissy and Peggy. Okay.

333
00:21:34,671 --> 00:21:38,360
So I'll tell you. So I'm going to tell
you guys the thing, it's not easy,

334
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:41,960
that big of a deal, but it's just
sort of funny. Oh, I know. Okay.

335
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,090
You're pregnant. I'm not
pregnant. I'm not. No, no.

336
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,250
I just want to tell you about some
reporting that I've been doing.

337
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:52,320
And then a funny thing that mom and
dad told me, that's all it is. Okay,

338
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,820
mom had an affair. No,
God that doesn't belong.

339
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,540
That's Chrissy. Yeah,
this is ridiculous. Um,

340
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,460
the third episode is basically
about how we all carry in us,

341
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,170
like the opposite self that
we never became. So, um,

342
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,720
so I called mom cause I was like,

343
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,570
what would mail Molly
have been like, like,

344
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:21,620
did you guys have like a name for Mayo,
Molly [inaudible]? And they were like,

345
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,230
oh, um, we would've called you Daniel.

346
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,120
No, that was what they were supposed
to call me. They were so desperate.

347
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:28,954
They used them.

348
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,360
Daniel, it turns out that we were
all supposed to be called Daniel

349
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,290
reveal. It's not either.
Daniel Webster is,

350
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,520
she does Molly.

351
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,420
Oh Man. Um, are you surprised that your
name would have been Daniel Webster?

352
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,820
That you would have been a Daniel? No.

353
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,680
No. I think we all knew that. Right?

354
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,020
Peggy? Did you know that?

355
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
I didn't know that.

356
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,510
I don't feel like my inner Daniel Webster
would have that much of a different

357
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,800
life than I have. So, but
I think you guys, honestly,

358
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:04,420
not to railroad this conversation,

359
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:08,080
but I think you guys lucked out because
I was the one that was raised with the

360
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,810
hopes that there was like
some gang no lingering in me.

361
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:13,920
Isn't Daniel Webster like
a famous dude in history?

362
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,903
Yes.

363
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,960
Oh, I took a picture of a statue of him
once and send it to dad because I was

364
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:23,250
supposed to be Daniel. Who is Daniel
Webster? He's a boring white dude.

365
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,380
Well of course he is. We knew that part.

366
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,470
He served as senator from Massachusetts
and was the under secretary of state

367
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,040
under three presidents.
Well, someone googled fast.

368
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:33,980
Yes.

369
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,400
I think he's just a reg. A regular
like old white lawyer dude. Yeah,

370
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,413
they're all racist

371
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,580
or ages or just douchebag.

372
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,590
All right, well great. That was funny.

373
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,420
Thank you. Got Her giggles in. It's all
been worth it. All right. That's all.

374
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,403
That's all I got.

375
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,573
We love you mom.

376
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,580
I love you guys. Goodbye.

377
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,650
Love you. Bye Bye. Sorry
Molly. You're amazing. Okay,

378
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,130
bye. Sorry about your bedbugs. Bye.

379
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,520
Okay. So to catch everybody up,

380
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,890
we have learned that we are all
carrying around with us another path.

381
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,200
We all have our own inner
Daniel Webster's, um,

382
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,030
and we're constantly shushing
it or them, whatever.

383
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,910
So my question for is our cover was like,

384
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:31,510
why would I carry this path with
me if I'm always trying? Like if,

385
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,190
if I'm just turning it off.

386
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,220
Um,

387
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,230
do you have any answer to that?

388
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,970
I wish I had the answer. So the,
we don't really have an answer. Um,

389
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,700
it could be as boring as, well,

390
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:46,060
it doesn't really matter because normally
no molecular geneticists comes in and

391
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:49,720
hacks out DMR t one or turns
on Fox l two or whatever. Um,

392
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:54,721
so why solve a problem that you haven't
created that that's quite possible but

393
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:55,804
boring?

394
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,790
The more interesting answer is that
this is an evolutionary holdover from,

395
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,130
from a common ancestor with fish.

396
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,620
[inaudible].

397
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,030
Okay. So this ancestor would
be our great grandparents,

398
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:15,920
16 million times removed, which
means 400 million years ago,

399
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,950
a fish swim out of the depths of the
ocean crawled onto land and took like

400
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,710
squelching steps forward and board
and board and board and board through

401
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:32,630
millions of years of luck and chance
and fate until finally getting to

402
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,090
you and me and boom. Hello? Hello.

403
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,360
Can you hear me? Yes. Can you
hear me? Yes, I sure can. Bob.

404
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,240
My name is Bob Warner.
I'm a research professor,

405
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,870
studies evolution and marine
biology at UC Santa Barbara.

406
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,320
What's your attraction
to the ocean? Uh, well,

407
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,330
the whole idea that there is
a different world under there.

408
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,360
Well, I'm just going to add
in brothers out of this.

409
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,710
So down in the waters around the Florida
keys there swims a remarkable fish who

410
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,230
had rats. It is a very
common, a coral reef fish.

411
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,920
This is Marshall Phillips Graduate Student
at North Carolina State University.

412
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,670
She like Bob's studies.
Blue heads. Yes. Anyways,

413
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:26,410
down in the keys are some
Primo spots, nice patches

414
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,220
that might have a group
of say a dozen blue heads.

415
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,850
And in that group there will be a
single large brightly colored male.

416
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,150
Just one of them. Yeah,

417
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,350
about the size of your hand with a blue
head and it's shiny blue, green body,

418
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,580
it white and black stripes right
behind its head that go black,

419
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:47,731
white,

420
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:52,020
black that we've very technically called
the Oreo and if he's got a big Oreo,

421
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,883
well

422
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,960
that's a sexy male

423
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,140
[inaudible]

424
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,140
and then the rest of the group is
essentially a Harem of lady fish and the

425
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:06,480
ladies in the group are little
and yellow, very pretty.

426
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,580
It kind of swim a little slower
watching out for things that the male is

427
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:14,420
flashing, darting all
around, much more aggressive.

428
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,860
And so this one male and this Herriman

429
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,290
females will basically spend their entire
lives on this one patch of ri where

430
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,230
they mate every day, each
female with that one male,

431
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,580
all it entails is the male and the
female will dart up in the water column

432
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:32,870
together and then at the same time he'll
release his sperm and she'll release

433
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:36,560
her eggs and then they dart right
back down and then a different female,

434
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:41,240
same male go up, egg sperm and
dark back down. And then again,

435
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,710
different female, same male,

436
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,880
they go up down and this is what
they do every day over and over.

437
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,790
Kind of sounds like a cult of that idea.

438
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:53,791
Sixties but say something
happens to this male.

439
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,360
I'll say a Predator comes
along and he chumps that mail.

440
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,670
So the Alpha male is
eaten up. Dead. Yup. Gone.

441
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,280
Now the question is what
happens to the ladies?

442
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:08,920
You'd think it would be chaos because
their whole system has been thrown out of

443
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:09,754
whack, but

444
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,050
within minutes to hours, life finds a way.

445
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,340
Somehow the ladies pick
who will be the next male.

446
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,550
The ladies have it pretty well
worked out. Who's the largest?

447
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,920
Do they all start like
eyeballing each other?

448
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:33,800
Like they don't line up or
anything? My bigger than, you know,

449
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,850
but somehow they, um,

450
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,490
figure it out until once they
establish who the largest female is,

451
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,790
she starts to change her behavior.

452
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,780
She gets a little more friendly
towards the other females.

453
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:48,430
She'll swim up to them, do
this little Wigley Dance,

454
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,000
Sorta waving her pictorial
fin at the ladies,

455
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,240
which isn't really something
they do as a female ever.

456
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,890
And then as time goes on,
her body starts to change.

457
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:02,080
She will get a little bit bigger.

458
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:04,970
Uh,

459
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,830
how do you just suddenly get bigger?

460
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,890
Testosterone or brain starts sending
signals to produce tons of testosterone.

461
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,800
Testosterone is, is taking
over and as she starts to grow,

462
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,590
a little bit of blue starts
to appear right at her nose.

463
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,150
Her scales start to change color then
sort of spread backwards right at her chin

464
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:24,170
and spread outwards

465
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,960
until her head is entirely
Baloo. And then [inaudible] these

466
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,670
dark stripes start to form. Those will
eventually become that black, white,

467
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:33,504
black Oreo.

468
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,810
And the other thing that starts to happen
is her ovaries start to disintegrate.

469
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,010
These are

470
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,240
the most valuable cells in the
body, and now suddenly they're being

471
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,320
destroyed and then they start to rebuild
themselves into testes that start

472
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:56,820
producing sperm really rapidly. Wow. It's,

473
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,830
it's not. It's absolutely incredible.

474
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,690
And then sex calls is back.

475
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,630
There's a new dominant male
at the top of the heap,

476
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,110
but at first he's not
very good at being a male.

477
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,650
Like he doesn't quite know when
to dart up and when to spawn.

478
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,190
It's just like a teenager who
doesn't know how to talk to girls,

479
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,220
but eventually he gets the hang of it
and can produce baby blue heads and the

480
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,630
cycle

481
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,670
school of life continues

482
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,480
as a good Attenborough. Thank you.

483
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,170
It's crazy that they just disintegrate
their insights and then rebuild.

484
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,260
But the funny thing is if you
ask Bob about this stuff, no.

485
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,490
It in fact about how these little lady
fish completely transformed. He's like,

486
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:43,420
Eh.

487
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Yeah. I hate to admit that, but
uh, yeah, it's not that shocking.

488
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,080
The shocking thing is how many

489
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,500
fishes change sets?

490
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,520
It turns out it's a lot of fishes.

491
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,290
Nearly all the rass you blue had your
ferries, your flashers, parrot fishes.

492
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,730
They actually looked like parents. They
changed sex. Most of the big groupers,

493
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,650
the tiny gobies damsel fishes. Everyone
asks about clam fish finding an email.

494
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,260
Yes, they change sex, but they
do it a little differently.

495
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,920
They go from male to female up
with the clown fish matriarchy.

496
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,470
Bob Says we're dealing with like hundreds,

497
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:23,200
a whole lot of sex changing
fish easily. Wow. Hundreds. Yep.

498
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,750
Here's the really crazy thing.

499
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,160
It's not just fishes. Some
shrimps, worms, alligators.

500
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,420
If you include all of the animals in
which their sex goes a different way than

501
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:41,310
you would think lies. Lobsters,
bananas, lizards, birds, mussels,

502
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:46,110
snails, slugs, chickens, chickens.
Oh, ELL frogs. It's just amazing.

503
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:47,490
And wait till we get to turtles.

504
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,090
It's the whole zoo in
this conversation. I know.

505
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,370
So why would fish like, why would it tell
her? Why would any animal change sex?

506
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,750
Well, I think a sex change increases
your fitness. You have more young,

507
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:06,751
either eggs you produce or eggs that you
fertilized than you would as a c as a

508
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:09,214
single sex.

509
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,450
In other words, it just ensures that
you can pass on your genetic material.

510
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,870
Like if you're the fishes on the
reef and the male disappears,

511
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,590
you're stuck and there's no,
there's your DNA goes nowhere.

512
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,920
But if you can become a male socially,

513
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,690
you can make sure that your DNA goes
somewhere and then like all the other

514
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:31,930
fishes in your little
kingdom go somewhere. Okay,

515
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,520
so now let me ask you the
next obvious question.

516
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,820
You've told me that we
come from the fish. Yeah.

517
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,430
They've got this flexy sexy thing
and that we have at, to some degree,

518
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,360
Daniel Lurks within you and is being
actively suppressed every single day.

519
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,440
So can we be like the fish? Yeah,
it does make you think of that.

520
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,100
Does our covert says that ever since
he did those mouse experiments,

521
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,420
he gets this question a lot.

522
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,350
Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,040
There's some interest from a transgender
community and whether this could be

524
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,520
something, it'd be helpful,
but we can't do it.

525
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,710
We technically can't.

526
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,430
Is there a cover says it's unethical and
at this point probably even technically

527
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:11,940
impossible to take that gene
away. And even if we could,

528
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,080
removing a gene just won't physically
reorganize us in the way the fish do.

529
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,690
He says at most

530
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,690
you might be able to produce your own
natural sex hormones of the type that's

531
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,160
more aligned with your gender identity.

532
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,870
Oh, pretty crazy. You can even
get the body to do that. Um,

533
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,910
but the reason we can't actually do
the full on switch is because humans,

534
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,020
uh,

535
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,020
male and female humans have developed
internal reproductive plumbing that is so

536
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,590
different from each other.

537
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,180
It would be impossible at the drop of
a hat to switch was the then then this,

538
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:49,910
this makes me confused. Well,

539
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:55,090
is this to use blanche is a word from a
few episodes ago as this by potentiality

540
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,360
that still is there? Yeah.
Latent being suppressed.

541
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,280
Is that a legacy thing that is
just fading away or is there,

542
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:07,280
is it there for a reason? It's
there for a reason and the fish,

543
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,410
is it there for a reason in us?

544
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:15,070
Does it serve a purpose and therefore
it will be with us always or maybe even

545
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:18,290
get stronger. Yeah, no,
I asked blanche that.

546
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,860
I don't know. I don't know. I
don't have a good answer for that.

547
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,840
But it, do you think
anyone does or is this,

548
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,470
no, I don't think anyone does. I,

549
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,550
I think we're all trying to figure
out why it would be the case. Um,

550
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,060
and most people ask the same question
you ask why would this be true?

551
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,120
And I don't know why it would be true

552
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,610
even if we don't know why.

553
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,060
Just knowing that that other path
is there just below the surface,

554
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,180
you know,

555
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:56,180
almost like wanting to express itself
does make you think a different way about

556
00:34:57,571 --> 00:35:01,350
how rigidly we define ourselves.

557
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,520
I think we like to bend people
as male or female and we, I,

558
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,660
we've always put people in two piles but
I think there's a tremendous amount of

559
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,200
middle ground even when you're
just talking about, you know,

560
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:20,730
things like the level of testosterone
you're making or the level of estrogen

561
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:25,120
you're making or um, the shape
of your genitalia or, uh,

562
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,000
many other features that we can,
we, we've been as male or female.

563
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:34,800
I think there is a lot of, um, there's a
lot of variation between the two piles.

564
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,460
[inaudible]

565
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,340
and maybe we haven't appreciated the
variation that exists naturally in our

566
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,174
population.

567
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,363
[inaudible] [inaudible]

568
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,933
