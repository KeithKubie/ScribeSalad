00:00:00.092 --> 00:00:02.050
MALE SPEAKER: There's a
freakishly large number

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.795
of book sales on "Freakonomics."

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.420
I mean, 7 million is
the public figure.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.015
I'm sure it's probably a bit
more than that in reality.

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:10.140
STEVEN J. DUBNER: Why do
you assume that it's more?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.629
It could be that we lie.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.420
MALE SPEAKER: I think
it was a 2014 figure.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.160
STEVEN J. DUBNER: It could be
that we inflated it by 100%

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.860
though.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.399
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.440
MALE SPEAKER: It wouldn't
surprise me, I suppose.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.010
STEVEN J. DUBNER:
But you're right.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.308
You're right.

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.593
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:25.420
MALE SPEAKER: I can see
how this is gonna go.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.190
The blog itself has had
about 3 million downloads

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.480
on each of its episodes,
which is pretty impressive.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.952
And of course there is the
one thing which all of us

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:36.410
Googlers who are
looking for things

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.930
to do once we leave Google.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.300
We think about careers to do.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.382
And so Steven is going to
talk to us about robbing banks

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:42.007
today, I think.

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.325
STEVEN J. DUBNER: Yeah.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:44.200
MALE SPEAKER: Cheers.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.660
STEVEN J. DUBNER: All right.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.160
Thank you.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.826
I appreciate it.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000
Good morning.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.100
I apologize for being
late, but it is entirely

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.520
your Queen's fault. The book
is called "When to Rob a Bank,"

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.290
which is almost entirely random.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.060
So if you really want to know
more about how to do that,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880
I can tell you.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.630
Although the short
answer is "don't."

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.150
The ROI on bank
robbery is terrible.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.530
That's what it's
really all about.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.560
It's actually a story of how
the book came to be called

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.643
what it came to be called.

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:17.850
So if we want to get
into that later in Q&amp;A,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.146
we can, which is how little
leverage authors exert

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.770
with their publishers
even when they've

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.936
sold a few copies of a book.

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:25.250
Because that was our
third or fourth title.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.510
The first few got rejected.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.450
So anyway, there is a book
called "When to Rob a Bank."

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.370
It is a book that
is a compilation

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.270
of the best, the greatest hits,
of our blog from 10 years.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.770
So we published by now
about 8,500 blog posts

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.050
over the course of 10
years, most of which

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.200
were terrible either in
the moment or beyond.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.359
They just didn't last.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.150
But we went through,
and we found about 500

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.774
that we actually
still enjoyed reading.

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:53.512
Then we whittled
that down to 132.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:54.720
So that's what's in the book.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.972
So I'm gonna talk for a while.

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.430
Then I'll take
questions, because I

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.380
know every time I speak
at a Google event,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.050
there are a lot of questions
which I really enjoy.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.760
So I'm not gonna talk
too long right now.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.340
But the occasion of the
book was the 10 year

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.475
anniversary of the
publication of our first book,

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:11.100
"Freakonomics."

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.190
So this is our fourth
book, and for 10 years,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.370
I've been working together
with Steve Levitt, who's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.119
an economist at the
University of Chicago.

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.077
And we've been doing
this project together

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:21.410
that's had many different forms.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.890
The first couple
books were, largely

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.520
but not exclusively, based on
academic research he'd done.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.728
Our third book was called
"Think Like a Freak," which

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.310
was using everything
we'd learned

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.710
from not only methodology
but from getting out

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.750
in the real world to work
with firms and governments

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.990
to try to solve problems.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.180
Because after the
first couple books,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.804
we were called in by
people who thought

00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:43.000
we'd be useful in that way.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.550
Almost always we
weren't, but we set

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.709
out a blueprint for problem
solving, essentially.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.500
And then this fourth
book, which as I said,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.150
is a compilation of blog
posts marking 10 years

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.160
of us doing our thing together.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.490
So it is inherently
a retrospective time.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.430
As all anniversaries are.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.850
And because we've been doing a
long time you start to think--

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.660
or I've started to think--
a little bit about legacy,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.660
and what it means to do anything
for that long a time, and what

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.620
kind of mark if any one leaves.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.580
And so I wanted
to share with you,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.360
I think, the
perfect illustration

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.590
of the legacy of "Freakonomics"
as gleaned last night.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.725
When I was here in London I was
doing media all day yesterday.

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:37.900
It started about 8:00 AM, and
it went till about 11:30 PM,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.560
right?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.411
And the last stop was the
500th BBC visit of the day,

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:44.410
and it was "News Night."

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.868
So does anybody
watch "News Night?"

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:46.820
I assume not, really.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.420
So I'm in the green room
at "News Night," which

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.620
is the room where they put
the guests before they go on.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.500
And there were a couple
of MPs, male MPs who--

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.930
one conservative, one liberal,
or whatever you call them,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.666
Labour-- and

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.310
They were and they
were just chatting

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.720
very amiably with each other.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.260
And then they got ushered in to
the set to go do their piece.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.510
And then someone else
came in, and this

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.260
was a woman who was also an MP.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.810
And she's standing now for
the head of Labour Party.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.800
So I probably shouldn't
name her because

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.365
of what I'm about to tell
you about what she said,

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:35.490
although it's not that bad.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.490
And I understand there
are three women running?

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.680
So you'd have to actually go
back and watch last night's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680
show to narrow it down.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.388
So I'm not going to
do that work for you.

00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:48.200
But one of the three women
who were standing for Labour,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.970
you could tell right away she's
a great politician because she

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.044
looks at us, and she
wants to know who we are,

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.710
what we're doing,
very friendly, chatty,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.001
sticking out her hand to shake.

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.830
She has her bike
helmet, which I'm

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.240
sure she brought along with
her in the taxi to look good.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.160
And she says what
are you in for?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.660
That's what they always ask you
when you're in a green room.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.110
And I always say
homicide, because that's

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.910
what they ask in my country when
they say what are you in jail

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.430
for.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.587
So then she said, what
are you gonna talk about?

00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:15.670
And I said, I'm an author.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.860
I'm gonna talk about the books.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.693
She said what books?

00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:20.940
And I said, I write
the "Freakomics" books.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.700
And she said oh, oh.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.040
And she starts nodding.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.950
And she said, yeah.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.920
I've loved-- I remember
reading "Freakonomics."

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.580
She said that was the book
with the ridiculous names like

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.900
Shithead that's pronounced
"Shuh-teed," right?

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.500
And I said, yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.360
And this is what the MP who's
running for head of Labour

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.560
remembers about the book, right?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.150
She says, oh, yeah, Shithead.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.250
I loved Shithead.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.600
That was fantastic.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.200
So it's not about any of
the public policy stuff.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.490
It's not about the relationship
of abortion and crime.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.680
It's not about drug dealing.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680
It's not about anything.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.520
It's Shithead.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.810
And then furthermore,
she says, yeah,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.210
I really love how you
wrote that when parents

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.940
give their kids these
ridiculous names,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.987
they ruin their lives for them.

00:06:03.987 --> 00:06:05.820
And what I wanted to
say, what I always want

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.361
to say in that
situation but never do

00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:09.810
is that, actually, you've
got that exactly wrong.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.440
The argument that we made
using the data on naming,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.280
and parents education, and the
outcome of children, and so on

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.030
was that the name that
you give your child

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.295
doesn't matter at all.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:21.740
All the name is is an indicator
of who the parents are.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.410
But if your Parents A, and
you have a boy named James,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.590
or parents B and your
observationally equivalent

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.230
to Parents A, and you name your
boy Shithead-- or "Shuh-teed"--

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.900
Shithead and James are not
going to have any substantially

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.233
different outcome in their life.

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:38.150
That's what the data
showed, and yet,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.650
most people who read
this and remember,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.570
remember exactly wrong.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.460
So the two things that the
potential ahead of Labour Party

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.280
remembers about our legacy is
Shithead, and she got it wrong.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.520
So that's my legacy.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.510
That's what I'll be
remembered for, if anything.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.430
And I guess it's deserving.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.210
Because let me tell you
know how I spend my day.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.397
So I know you all
are mostly engineers?

00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:08.980
All engineers?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.170
Anybody here not an engineer?

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.860
Anybody sneak in?

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.900
Where did you sneak in from?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.140
Yeah.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.390
Are you in the building?

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.820
AUDIENCE: So I'm not
even in this building.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.996
I'm in our sales
office, but I managed

00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:20.246
to sneak in from another door.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:20.630
STEVEN J. DUBNER: OK.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.260
That's why you have such better
glasses than the engineers.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:25.800
There were a couple others.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.750
Are you?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.040
Yeah, it's so easy to pick
out the non-engineers,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.785
I have to say.

00:07:29.785 --> 00:07:30.454
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:32.370
AUDIENCE: I sneaked in
from the same building.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.203
I work in marketing.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.150
STEVEN J. DUBNER: OK,
and there was one more?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.476
Yeah.

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:38.790
AUDIENCE: I work in editorial.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.290
STEVEN J. DUBNER:
OK, so a good half

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.500
a percent's smattering of sales,
marketing, and editorial along

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.125
with engineers.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:46.310
OK, so I know how you all
spend your day generally.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.100
I couldn't survive doing
what you do for half a day.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.860
I have no idea how
to do what you do,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.110
but I generally understand
what it is you do.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.355
So let me just tell you
briefly how I spend my day.

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.105
I live in New York in
the Upper West Side.

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.264
I have a nice family.

00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:00.930
I've got a wife.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.680
I've got two kids.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.740
I've got a little dog.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.793
And my office, which is another
apartment near where we live--

00:08:07.793 --> 00:08:09.250
it's about two blocks away.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.109
So in the morning, I get up.

00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:11.900
I have some coffee.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.750
I read some papers, say
goodbye to the kids,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.160
and I go to my office
at about 7:30 AM.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.220
And I usually walk the dog along
the park, which is very nice.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.020
And then once I start
my day, all I'm doing

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.170
is I'm walking with the
dog, looking at the park,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.434
and I'm thinking about stuff.

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:26.350
I'm looking at people.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.710
I'm looking at the people
interacting on the street,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.059
in their cars, and
bikes, and pedestrians,

00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:32.850
and wondering why more
people aren't killed

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.433
on that intersection,
because it seems

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:36.559
to be a very dangerous one.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.849
I'm looking at weather,
how people respond to it.

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:41.140
I'm just thinking about the
way people live their lives

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.460
and how they make their
decisions, stuff like that.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.230
Then I get to my office,
give the dog some food.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.600
And then I just sit, and
basically all day long, I just

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.270
keep doing that.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.470
I sit and think.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.500
And I read.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.230
And I write.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.180
And it's entirely
inconsequential.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.450
And that's I spend my day.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.690
So for instance, I
like economics a lot.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.440
I never really liked
the form of economics

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.110
we study in university so much.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.820
It felt, for me at least,
overly mathematical, not that

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.530
interesting, not that useful.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.850
It sounded like the
brightest people

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.120
among the professional
economists

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.800
were divided on the most
important issues of the day.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.060
In other words, we look to
them to describe the economy,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.642
to actually tell us how the
macroeconomy really works.

00:09:22.642 --> 00:09:25.100
And it turns out that they're
wrong more often than they're

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.150
right, and that the
best and brightest argue

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.470
with each other constantly
about the most essential facts

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.020
of that.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.978
So I never really liked
that kind of economics,

00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:36.590
but I like the weirder
kind of economics,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.610
including that my partner Steve
Levitt has worked on for years.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.562
I like agricultural
economics, for instance.

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:45.520
Get some of those journals,
like to read those.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.600
I grew up on a little
farm in upstate New York.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.020
And food is one of those things
that I marvel at every day.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.484
A century ago, it was thought
that we had roughly a billion

00:09:55.484 --> 00:09:56.150
people on Earth.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.960
It was thought that there's no
way we could support 2 billion.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.459
There's no way we can grow that
much food for 2 billion people.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.000
And then after that,
there was no way

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.570
we can get to three
or five billion.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.072
Here we are at seven billion,
more than enough food

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:08.655
for everybody.

00:10:08.655 --> 00:10:10.488
A lot of people still
don't get enough food,

00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:12.200
but that's almost
entirely because

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.210
of political or
economic failures,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.145
is not because of
agricultural failures.

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:18.520
So agricultural economics, to
me, are really interesting.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.662
How did we get so
good at this, right?

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.620
It's not just economics,
obviously, but the way

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.045
that it's sourced, the
way that it's resourced,

00:10:25.045 --> 00:10:27.200
the way it's distributed.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.330
When it goes wrong, like
in California right now,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.290
what's going on with
the water prices

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.400
or with the water shortages
is plainly a product of water

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.930
being badly, badly, badly
mispriced for many years

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.360
in California.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.390
So agricultural
economics are fun for me.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.610
Like, I wonder why is it
that living in New York,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.980
I can buy a kiwi fruit and
a banana for less than it

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.630
costs me to buy one apple, which
is grown often in New York,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.674
whereas the kiwi fruit
is grown in New Zealand,

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:54.590
the banana's grown
somewhere in Latin America.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.480
Why is that?

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.800
So those parts of economics
and agriculture I like.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.180
And one day, I was
reading this journal.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.640
And I just saw a simple fact.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.300
It was nothing but
one simple fact.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.650
And I'm curious
whether you guys,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.840
when you run across this
kind of simple fact,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.840
if it triggers the same
kind of thought process.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.800
I'm guessing it does.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.940
The fact I saw in
a journal said that

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.390
of the turkeys that are bred
for consumption in the United

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.560
States, that roughly 100%
of them, of those birds,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.560
are the result of
artificial insemination.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.280
So I thought, first
of all, weird.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.010
And I'd never in my life
thought about turkey sex at all.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.242
I did grow up on a farm.

00:11:35.242 --> 00:11:36.200
We didn't have turkeys.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.360
We had chickens.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.459
We had some other animals.

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.750
I'd never thought about turkey
sex, so I see this fact,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.124
and I think that's odd.

00:11:42.124 --> 00:11:44.040
And then you immediately
start to think, well,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.360
who's doing that,
and how is it done?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.860
OK.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.750
But then I wanted to know why.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.150
What does it mean?

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.820
Does it represent anything
interesting worth knowing?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.810
So whenever you see a fact,
or whenever I see a fact,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.780
the next instinct is then
to surround it or attack it

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.630
with data so you can put it in
context and see what it means.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.550
Is it a blip?

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.400
Is it part of a
trend, or whatnot?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.117
So of course then you go
to the data on chicken sex.

00:12:11.117 --> 00:12:12.950
Turkeys and chickens
are pretty similar when

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.930
they're rates for consumption.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.037
If turkeys are 100%
bred artificially,

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:18.120
I assume chickens are too.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.420
Then you go to the chicken
data, and it turns out

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.750
that's not the case at all.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.120
So it turns out that most
chickens breed naturally

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.490
as God intended, right?

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.600
But turkeys don't.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.050
So why is that?

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.760
They're relatively similar.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.570
So then I went looking
for other fowl data,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.985
and there just wasn't that much.

00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:36.110
We don't really eat enough
other fowl in the States

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.276
to have a whole lot of data.

00:12:37.276 --> 00:12:39.040
So it was really
turkeys and chickens,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.331
and they were really different.

00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:41.777
So then I wanted to know more.

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:43.360
So you go try to
find some other data.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.854
Then you try to find
people who know why

00:12:45.854 --> 00:12:47.020
things are the way they are.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.485
And that's what you do.

00:12:48.485 --> 00:12:49.360
You get on the phone.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.810
You start writing emails.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.100
So here's what the
story turned out to be.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.734
In the States, particularly
but also here and in

00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:00.150
other countries
were where there's

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.566
a lot of turkey--
so first of all,

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:04.780
turkey consumption has risen a
lot in the last 40 or 50 years.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.670
Now turkey plus poultry
plus chicken consumption

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.160
almost equals red
meat consumption,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.570
which is a big, big
change from the old days.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.090
And as Americans began to
eat more and more turkey,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.300
it became very evident
that the preference,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.590
the primary preference,
was for breast meat, OK?

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.120
People like white
meat of turkeys.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.070
Now, I don't.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.180
I'm a dark meat person.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.315
My personal thought is
that people don't really

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:35.940
like the white meat
that much, but it's

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.469
a better delivery system for
gravy and for mayonnaise.

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:40.010
But anyway, they
want the white meat.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.640
OK.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.970
So how did that change things?

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.190
Well, breeders began to
grow, to breed, turkeys

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.890
with larger breasts, OK?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.620
So if you look back
at the turkeys that

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.080
were bred for consumption
50 years ago in the States,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.280
they had a very, very,
very scrawny breast

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.420
and big hind quarters.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.840
They were like wild turkeys.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.570
They bred them to have larger
and larger breasts over time,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.070
OK?

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.691
So now the male
and female turkeys

00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:03.690
are both bred to have
larger and larger breasts.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.990
So you can imagine
in the old days,

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.710
the turkeys had
scrawny little chests.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.610
But now they're growing,
and growing, and growing,

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.526
and growing like this.

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:12.020
So now they get to the
point where the turkeys now

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.640
that are bred for consumption
have such large breasts

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.820
that when they meet
in the barnyard

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.600
or where they meet, and they
try to get close to have sex,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.930
they can't get close
enough to physically

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.950
have sex, thus the need for
an entirely new industry,

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.800
which is the turkey masturbation
and artificially insemination.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.270
This is how I spend my days.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.728
So then I wrote a
piece about this.

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:35.746
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:36.870
I wrote a piece about this.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.790
I thought was
pretty interesting.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.600
I maintain it's
very interesting.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.375
And it's so interesting to me.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.766
You try to surround an
issue, or surround a problem,

00:14:46.766 --> 00:14:48.390
and consider all the
possible data, all

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.911
the possible explanations,
and then you write it,

00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:51.910
or you put it out there.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.409
And I'm sure this happens with
you guys with coding as well.

00:14:54.409 --> 00:14:57.420
You try to think about all
the possible avenues, where

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.040
it can go, but also how it
can be responded to once

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.310
the public gets hold of it.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.750
So one thing that
happened with that story

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.700
afterwards that I never
could have anticipated

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.440
was that there was a small but
very, very, very vocal group

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.020
of people who's just
railed against the story

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.920
on the grounds that we were
glorifying turkey rape.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.700
And they said that you can call
it artificial insemination,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.500
but what it really is is
removing the rights of living

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.580
creatures to
naturally procreate,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.550
and you're raping them in
order to make more of them

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.479
to eat them.

00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:36.770
So when you put it like that,
it does sound pretty bad.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.840
Honestly, it was something
I hadn't thought about.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.157
I did eat less turkey
for a month or so

00:15:42.157 --> 00:15:43.990
as a result of that,
but I've since resumed.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.030
So like I said, this
is how I spend my day.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.080
So it's fitting that my
legacy from the MP is Shithead

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.510
and that she got the notion of
the way the names move exactly

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.454
wrong.

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.620
I'll give you another example
of how I spend my day.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.340
OK, education.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.260
I'm guessing that the
median level of education

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.830
here is somewhere
between M and PhD, yeah?

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.630
So you guys have many, many,
many, many years of education

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.190
under your belts.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.050
If you were to look at every
form of investment known

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.890
to humankind, it's hard to make
this argument definitively,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.590
but I would argue that the
single best investment ever

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.480
in history is education, right?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.020
So if you have one hour,
or $1, or one brain cell

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.860
to spend on something, if
your primary concern is

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.710
ROI that's scalable, education
is the best investment.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.795
So the data for that
are pretty overwhelming.

00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.790
If you didn't know it-- I
think it would be surprising

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.206
if you didn't know it-- which
is that the higher you go up

00:16:49.206 --> 00:16:51.240
the scale, the
greater the ROI is.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240
So it's the opposite
of diminishing returns.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.090
You guys with PhDs and M
degrees earn a lot more

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.520
than those with B degrees,
which diminishing returns

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.950
would argue against.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.822
So we know that, and it's great.

00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:07.030
And it's the reason that so
much of our public policy

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.280
tries to encourage people
who are in position to set up

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.579
education systems to get
their kids educated and so on.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:18.114
Why we urge them to do that is
because it's not only the best

00:17:18.114 --> 00:17:19.614
investment, it's
the best insurance.

00:17:19.614 --> 00:17:23.859
I mean, if you want to ensure
against criminal behavior,

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:28.420
against poor health behaviors,
against risky behaviors,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.810
education is a phenomenally
leveraged unit.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.880
So when we know that.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.119
In the past recent years
with the recession,

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.660
there were a lot of
people coming out

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.630
of college with degrees,
with good degrees, not

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.497
able to find a job.

00:17:46.497 --> 00:17:48.330
So that began this big
debate in the States,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.160
and I assume here as well, that
oh, maybe it's not worth it.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.550
What's the opportunity cost?

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.500
Maybe it's way too high.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.770
You know, Steve
Jobs didn't finish

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.215
college, Mark Zuckerberg,
Bill Gates, dadadadada.

00:18:00.215 --> 00:18:02.215
You can find a handful
of really famous dropouts

00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:04.210
and say maybe it's
a really bad idea.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.040
So we did a pretty
multifaceted analysis

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.190
of the cost of education
and the payoff of education

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.034
for college.

00:18:12.034 --> 00:18:13.450
And we came to the
same conclusion

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.980
that all the other
scholars have,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.560
which is it's still really good.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.101
So whenever you have
something that's

00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:22.500
really valuable-- in this case
it's expensive and valuable.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.170
Those two don't always go
together-- you also wonder,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.690
well, are there people
who want to get the value

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.240
part without paying the cost?

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.290
Are there people who are gonna
try to cheat or try to steal?

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.026
So this became a really
interesting question, in part

00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:37.650
because it's really
hard to figure out.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.967
So whenever you're trying to
learn about illicit behavior,

00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:44.550
you know, drug
dealing, prostitution--

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.830
all the regular kind of crimes--
embezzlement, bank robbery,

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.760
and so on, the obvious hard
part of getting those data

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.712
is because it's an
illicit activity,

00:18:53.712 --> 00:18:54.670
it's a hidden activity.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.109
Because it's hidden, the
data are hard to get.

00:18:57.109 --> 00:18:59.150
So one thing that we've
spent a lot of time doing

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.690
the past bunch of
years is finding ways

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.740
to get data from those
realms of illicit behavior.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.050
So there's this amazing
fella named Sudhir Venkatesh.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.450
Some of you may remember his
name from "Freakonomics."

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.720
Although if the MP remembered
only Shithead, I'm doubting

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.680
you're gonna remember
Sudhir Venkatesh's name.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.850
But he's an amazing guy
who's a sociologist, who

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.990
at the University of Chicago
showed up and ultimately ended

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.100
up embedding himself
in a crack gang

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.720
and lived with this gang
for five or six years.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.060
And among the trophies
he walked away

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.930
with was a set of financial
records from the gang.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.717
So they weren't quite KPMG
audit quality financial records.

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:45.800
But they were pretty good.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.400
And from those data,
we were able to write

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.390
about the economics
of the crack gang.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.040
Until you have that data
that, you're guessing.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.480
When you watch movies
about drug gangs,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.950
they're based usually on
one person's story that's

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.360
usually exaggerated,
and magnified,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.740
and distorted in many ways.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.400
So to try to get data
like that, getting data

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.770
like that is really valuable.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.200
Similarly, with Sudhir
we did a project

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.680
a few years later on street
prostitution in Chicago.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.340
So again, if you're trying to
ask a very basic question like,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.840
why do people do prostitution?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.390
Is it because they actually
have no choice whatsoever

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.930
and they're driven
there by desperation?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.870
How well does it pay?

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.150
What are the risks of
arrest, of violence,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.285
of disease, and so on?

00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:33.910
But until you can get some data
you can answer these questions.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.080
So again, in this
case, we went out

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.610
and solicited data, set
up a bunch of, basically,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.850
grad students with
clipboards to sit

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.990
with prostitutes before
and after every trick

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.310
and fill out a survey.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.580
And survey data is
often very squishy,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.840
as I'm sure you all know.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.880
But in this case, it
worked out pretty well.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.100
We could verify that the
data was pretty good.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.350
And so from that we were
able to learn a lot of things

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.390
about the cost of
different sex acts.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.320
We were able to learn
what kind of premium

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.280
a prostitute would demand
for having the john not

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.035
use a condom.

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:08.160
We were able to look at
the interaction between law

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.276
enforcement and prostitution,
which illustrates

00:21:11.276 --> 00:21:13.900
really beautifully what's known
as the principal agent problem.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.370
You guys knows the
principal agent problem?

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:15.490
Most of you?

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:15.990
Some know?

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.260
The principal agent problem
is-- again, keep in mind

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.135
I'm not an economist.

00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:21.176
So everything I say that
the economics you should

00:21:21.176 --> 00:21:22.700
check the textbook afterwards.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.130
But the principal agent
notion in economics

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.390
argues that when there are
two parties, let's say,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.060
a principal and
agent, who would seem

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.830
to have their
incentives aligned,

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.500
it's often the case that
they're not aligned for reasons

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.700
that I'll explain right now.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.307
So let's say in a
police department,

00:21:39.307 --> 00:21:41.390
you would think everybody
in the police department

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.750
wants to arrest people who
are doing crimes, right?

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.920
That's their mission.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:52.690
But let's say that the
mayor Chicago tells

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.400
the chief of police
in Chicago, you know,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.872
we're bidding on the
Olympics and we really

00:21:57.872 --> 00:21:59.080
want to clean up the streets.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.040
And we need to wipe out the
most obvious prostitution, OK?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.930
So let's make it a mission
to get rid of the most

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.900
obvious street prostitution.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.149
So then what happens?

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:10.190
The chief of police tells
the cops on the street,

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.773
you know what?

00:22:10.773 --> 00:22:13.400
Let's go Arrest a bunch of
prostitutes for a few months

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.100
and just tell them
that they have

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.570
to get off the street for a year
or so, or maybe take it inside

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.190
or whatever.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.440
So it would seem to be that's
an alignment of incentives.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.580
Everybody's getting paid to
do the job, which in this case

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.290
is to get prostitutes
off the street.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.220
But the way the
real world works,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.620
you often have a
principal agent dilemma,

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.934
which is that the
principal has a clear goal

00:22:36.934 --> 00:22:39.600
and the agent, who's supposed to
be carrying out the principal's

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.420
wishes, seems to have
a clear goal, but then

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.022
personal incentives
come into play.

00:22:44.022 --> 00:22:45.730
Because there are the
personal incentives

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.670
and the public incentives,
or the official incentives.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.470
So as it turns out,
from the data what

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.550
we learned about this particular
case of the principal agent

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.230
problem was that a given
prostitute in Chicago

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.680
was more likely to
have sex with a cop

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.400
for free than to
be arrested by one.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.380
In other words, the cops found
it much more to their liking

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.680
not to arrest the
prostitutes and actually

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.790
to take advantage
of them the way

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.170
the customers did,
except, because they

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.910
had the leverage, for free.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.275
So those are the
kind of findings,

00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:20.900
if you want to call
that, that you just

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.080
can't get without data.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.970
So we work to get those data.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:30.140
And when it comes to education,
and college diplomas,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.320
and college degrees, we
were interested to know,

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.010
since they're so valuable
and so expensive,

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.400
how many people cheat?

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.075
How many people steal
them in some way, right?

00:23:41.075 --> 00:23:42.450
There are a lot
of different ways

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.444
to cheat to get a college
degree or a diploma.

00:23:47.444 --> 00:23:48.860
So we began looking
into, and it's

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.490
turned out to be really hard to
get any kind of firsthand data.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.960
The best we could
do, however, was

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.910
an FBI agent who had spent years
doing this, looking into it.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.204
And he was really good.

00:24:01.204 --> 00:24:02.870
Plus, it helps when
you're with the FBI.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.770
You can go to the
people who have the data

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.840
and demand that they
give you the data, which

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.880
you and I can't necessarily do.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.980
And what was really
interesting about this guy is

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.430
he, like a lot of the
people that we write about,

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.010
a lot of the people that I
consider heroes for the way

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.620
that they try to solve
problems, he was motivated by,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.070
he was driven by a
personal interest.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:30.360
And in his case, this was a guy
who was an FBI salaried worker.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.982
So he's not making
a ton of money.

00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:34.190
And had two daughters getting
ready to go to college.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.710
He lived in North Carolina.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.730
And he realized that even if
he sent them to very good state

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.630
colleges, like University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.040
that it was going to
cost-- I don't know-- maybe

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.260
$60 to $80,000.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.920
If you add in everything, maybe
$100,000 for the two daughters

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.540
to get their college degree.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.520
And the human in him,
not the FBI agent in him,

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.830
the human in him was just
thinking that's a lot of money.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.040
I wish I could just
buy them a fake diploma

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.590
and buy them a fake degree.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.850
And I would pay $5,000
or $10,000 for that

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.250
happily if it was good
enough to convince everybody

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.750
that needed convincing.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.380
So obviously, that's not what
we think of as education.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.900
That's what we think as just
the outcome of the education.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.200
But if you think about it, when
you show up to apply for a job,

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.730
they don't really ask-- except
maybe at Google-- what you

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.124
studied in philosophy class.

00:25:24.124 --> 00:25:25.790
They just want to
know that you have it.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.750
And nobody even ever
asks for the degree.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.620
So he thought if
I'm willing to pay

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.237
that money for fake
diplomas for my daughters,

00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:34.820
and I'm an FBI agent,
presumably there

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.403
are some other people out there
who would be willing to do it.

00:25:37.403 --> 00:25:41.030
So he begin to explore
the world of diploma mills

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.410
and counterfeit shops.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.020
So it turns out there are a
lot of different kinds of ways

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.110
to get a fake diploma, or
to make a fake diploma,

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.810
and to market it.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.180
And the two basic ones
are diploma mills,

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.850
which would be basically like
you could take a correspondence

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.790
course in, like, golf
course maintenance

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.090
from some university.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.830
And you could then parlay
that one correspondence course

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.570
into a bachelor's degree
for an extra $500 or $1,000.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.450
OK?

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.040
then So that's the
diploma mill form.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.240
And then there are
counterfeit shops

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.920
where they can just, basically,
print very, very, very

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.760
good diplomas.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.070
And the market being what it
is, the price variance is huge.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.020
But for like about
$5,000 or $6,000

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.360
you could get a beautiful
indistinguishably inauthentic

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.270
medical degree from Harvard
for about $5,000 or $6,000.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.070
OK?

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.930
So when this agent began
to gather these data,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.100
arrest these people, find their
sources, find their customers,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.540
began to measure the customers
against the actual number

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.700
of college graduates, it turned
out that approximately 1%

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.390
of all college degrees awarded
in the United States every year

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.870
were totally fake.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:56.445
So 1%.

00:26:56.445 --> 00:26:59.380
So you think 1% of anything
is not necessarily that much,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.090
except when it's 1% of a big
number like that for whom

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.510
this credential is supposed
to be kind of life altering,

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.510
and for which you're
supposed to have spent four

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.730
to eight years and
maybe $100,000 on,

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.250
it's pretty significant.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.380
So the bottom line
of that statistic

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.882
is if you work with,
let's say 100 people,

00:27:19.882 --> 00:27:22.506
and how many people are in this
room today would you say, Will?

00:27:22.506 --> 00:27:24.082
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:24.082 --> 00:27:26.290
So I won't point any fingers,
but if you look around,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.910
the odds are that someone
here is totally piping it in

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.827
and that their diploma
is entirely fictitious.

00:27:30.827 --> 00:27:32.826
Now, it doesn't mean that
that person's actually

00:27:32.826 --> 00:27:34.860
gonna be a worse employee
than the people who

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.900
went to school for the
four years or eight years,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.270
but that's what the data say.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.890
This is how I spend my days.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.760
It's in some ways, I guess,
not that different from yours,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.870
in some ways fundamentally
very different.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:52.370
So I'd love to open it up
to questions now and see

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.872
what you'd like to know.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:54.986
MALE SPEAKER: Please raise your
hand if you have a question,

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:56.069
and wait for a microphone.

00:27:58.494 --> 00:27:59.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.934
I think it's fascinating,
this interaction

00:28:01.934 --> 00:28:05.301
between the counterfeit diplomas
and the ROI on education

00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:06.263
that you mentioned.

00:28:06.263 --> 00:28:08.710
Is the ROI in the bit of
paper or in the knowledge

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.239
that you get?

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:11.780
STEVEN J. DUBNER:
That's the question

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.095
no one can answer, honestly.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.540
If you could come up with
a good way to measure that,

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.890
I'd love to know.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.300
There are ways you could
imagine measuring it,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.920
but no one that I've ever
found has actually done that.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.180
It's not hard to imagine that
the vast majority of the value

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.180
lies in actual knowledge
and skills acquisition,

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.880
but there are those who argue
that a great part of the value

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.870
in a college education lies
in communicative skills,

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.599
networking skills, and so on.

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:48.890
And if you think about the
cost of a college education,

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.020
both in terms of dollars or
pounds, and in terms of hours,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.940
which are very, very,
very substantial.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.670
The people who make the argument
that a lot fewer people should

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.690
go to college, people who make
that argument, their argument

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.090
is that the opportunity
cost is huge.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.470
So let's say you take
10 students in the UK.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.430
And in terms of
academic ability,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.154
you take numbers 4 through 7.

00:29:12.154 --> 00:29:14.320
8 through 10, you say they're
going to a university.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.366
1 through 3, maybe they're
going to trade school

00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:17.490
or going straight to a job.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.420
Let's say we take
4 through 7, and we

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.890
have to decide what we're
going to do with them,

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.750
or what would be the
best outcome for them

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.440
personally and for society.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.030
There are those who would
argue that the opportunity

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.630
cost of college is so huge that
if you took two years or four

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.650
years and the amount of dollars
that are spent and invested

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.000
them in that person, or that
person was able to invest

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.010
him or herself in
a small businesses

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.590
or in other training, that could
far, far increase the output.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:48.100
So basically the most nuanced
argument that I think is valid

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.240
is that the way that
college is pitched to

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.880
and positioned for
all students is

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.640
pretty poor for all students, in
that there should be a lot more

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.102
segmentation than there is.

00:30:01.102 --> 00:30:02.060
That's the bottom line.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.480
So I think you could argue
that for a lot of people

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.760
who go to college expecting
the skills and knowledge

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.740
acquisition to be the thing
that makes them more successful,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.650
it doesn't happen-- absolutely.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.930
But we don't know.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.790
I've never seen
great data on that.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.099
Even the data, honestly,
on the ROI in college

00:30:20.099 --> 00:30:21.140
are very hard to come by.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.030
Because if you think about
it, you can't randomize that.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.490
What you'd want
to do is you want

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.730
to take like 10
cities in the UK,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:35.400
and pick 1,000 graduating
students from those cities,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.340
and randomize them all, right?

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.550
And maybe just do two
groups, maybe do four groups,

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.290
but you send some to
great universities, some

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.390
just out to get
a job, and so on.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.310
And then you'd
measure the effect

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.670
of the university itself.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.460
But we can't do that.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.310
So the best studies
that have been done

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.050
are these natural
experiments, one

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.155
having to do with the military
draft during the Vietnam War

00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:58.530
when there were
a bunch of people

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.110
who would have gone to
college but didn't, and then

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.560
other observationally equivalent
people who did go to college.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.590
And from that one study and
from some other similar ones,

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.470
the conclusion has been had
that the ROI is gigantic.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:18.880
But even then, the answers
are not nearly as foolproof

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.595
as we might wish.

00:31:19.595 --> 00:31:21.678
AUDIENCE: If the alternatives
are going to college

00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:24.105
or going to war, I guess, yeah.

00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:25.480
STEVEN J. DUBNER:
Agreed, agreed.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.189
Yeah.

00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:28.262
Next, please.

00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:29.845
AUDIENCE: What were
your proposed book

00:31:29.845 --> 00:31:30.710
titles that got rejected?

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.600
STEVEN J. DUBNER: Oh, OK.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.430
So I'll tell you.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.388
It's probably not
interesting to anyone but me.

00:31:34.388 --> 00:31:36.950
And Penelope, who's
with the publisher

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:40.610
might prefer that I not tell the
story, but it's not a big deal.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.030
So titles with us have
always been a bit of a thing.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.330
So our first book,
we'd written it,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:51.940
and it was just this heap of
unrelated stories about baby

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.930
names, and crack dealing, and
sumo wrestlers, and cheating

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.980
teachers, and nonsense.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.830
And so it was very hard
to think of a title.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.690
We just thought of it
as a book about nothing,

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.820
but that wouldn't work, exactly.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.380
So we and the
publisher we're trying

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.950
to come up with all kinds of
things that were horrible.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.720
One was "It Ain't
Necessarily So,"

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.770
which is a wonderful old
song but a bad title.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.130
One was "E-Ray Vision,"
like x-ray vision,

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.140
but E for economics, which
is really quite-- yeah.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.900
Right, so even when you
get it, it's pretty bad.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.490
And then Steve Levitt's
sister, whose name

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:37.320
is Linda Jines, who had been
in publishing and advertising

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.750
for a bunch of years, we
gave her the manuscript

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.250
and asked her to
come up with names.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.770
And she came up
with "Freakonomics."

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:47.170
And here's what
Levitt maintains.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.730
Levitt maintains that he loved
it initially and I hated.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.022
I maintained that I thought
it was so bad that it might

00:32:53.022 --> 00:32:54.980
be good, but I wasn't
quite sure if it was just

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.230
so bad that it was purely bad.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.984
But anyway, we presented
to the publisher,

00:32:57.984 --> 00:33:00.400
to the American publisher, and
they dismissed it entirely.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.914
Said it's just too weird,
said freak is going

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:04.080
to make people think of sex.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.240
It's going to be
weird sexonomics.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.160
That can't work.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.200
It's too long.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.284
It doesn't mean anything.

00:33:10.284 --> 00:33:11.200
That's what they said.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.720
It doesn't mean anything.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.390
And I said, have you ever
heard of a portmanteau?

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.380
People make up words.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.150
They even make even
make up titles.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.820
So I made up a word one time.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.000
I think this is the only
good word I ever made up.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.270
You know you run into someone
that you used to date,

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.054
and they got married afterwards?

00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:35.720
And you realize you
were the last person

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.282
they dated before they married?

00:33:39.282 --> 00:33:40.490
So what you call that person?

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.950
There should be a
word for it, right?

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.639
OK, try this-- penultimore.

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:46.138
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:46.138 --> 00:33:46.637
Right?

00:33:49.346 --> 00:33:51.310
So I thought "Freakonomics"
was pretty good.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.490
And it took the
publisher-- it was

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.827
right up to the 11th
hour of publications,

00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:57.910
and they finally said, OK.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.080
We'll go with "Freakonomics."

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.293
Then the book came out,
and it did very well.

00:34:00.293 --> 00:34:02.001
And they immediately
claimed total credit

00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:03.485
for having come
up with the title.

00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:04.610
So that was "Freakonomics."

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:05.840
Then we did "Super
Freakonomics,"

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.010
which was not that
controversial,

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.759
although the publisher,
again, was worried

00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:11.159
that the estate of Rick James
was going to come after us,

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.170
which they did not.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.711
And then we did
"Think Like a Freak."

00:34:13.711 --> 00:34:16.090
That was actually
pretty agreed upon.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.730
But this one, think
about the signal

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.572
you're trying to send
with a title, right?

00:34:20.572 --> 00:34:21.280
it's interesting.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.310
We make the argument that
names don't matter, right?

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.280
But the argument that
titles don't matter

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.310
is much harder to make.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:33.030
And the reason is that
the name of a person

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.710
is not marketing in the
same way that a product

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.290
title is marketing, right?

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.330
So if you name something
Google or even ESPN,

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.260
there are people who are
going to hear it repeatedly

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.050
before they start to use
it and learn whether it's

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.510
any good for them and so on.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.239
But a name is a
little different.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.098
You hear the name,
you meet the person,

00:34:52.098 --> 00:34:53.139
and you know that person.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.730
And name becomes secondary.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.420
It doesn't continue to
serve a marketing function.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.357
So a book title name
seems to be important.

00:35:01.357 --> 00:35:02.940
Again, it's very
hard to tell. there's

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.200
not a lot of A/B
testing in this realm.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.580
And for this one, the
book title we came up with

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.560
was drawn from one of the
posts that's in this book.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.510
And it was called "Hurray
for High Gas Prices."

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.400
So we liked that
because we're American,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.430
and we talk about gas
prices all the time.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.070
And there was a
post about peak oil

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.640
this, peak oil that, gas
price is too high, too

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.177
low, the gas tax-- whatever.

00:35:25.177 --> 00:35:27.260
There's a lot I could talk
about with gas and oil.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.580
But this one posted said
high gas taxes are great,

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.550
because what they
help do is capture

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.860
the cost of this activity
that otherwise isn't

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.560
taxed very well, like water.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.940
When water is free
for farmers, of course

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.400
they're gonna use it all and
not leave any for downstream.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.440
So when gas is cheap, of course
people are gonna drive a lot.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.530
And then that causes congestion,
accident risk, pollution,

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.600
et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.470
And unless you can
raise the gas tax, which

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.260
federal officials in DC won't
for a variety of reasons,

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.460
then people just drive a lot.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.150
So the post was called
"Hurray for High Gas Prices."

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.730
So that, our American
publisher said, yeah, great.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.405
And than the British publisher,
excellent publisher, Penguin,

00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:08.030
got hold of it.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.280
And they say, well, gas doesn't
mean here what it means there.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.110
So it'd have to be
"Hurray for High Petrol

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.810
Prices," which
doesn't work at all,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.000
or it's gonna sound like it's
a book of gastroenterology

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.850
of some kind.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.490
So then they said,
can you come up

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.096
with a different title
for the British edition.

00:36:25.096 --> 00:36:28.240
And so I say yeah, but
we don't like the idea

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.630
because it's not
fun to write a book

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.220
and want it be called different
things in different places.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:39.180
But then we came up with
a title that we absolutely

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.320
loved, which I thought
would be the perfect title

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.550
for the book, which is called
"We were Only Trying to Help."

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.050
Right?

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:46.930
Isn't that good?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.460
Because a lot of the
blog posts in this book

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.220
are basically where we just
run an idea of the flag pole.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.690
Maybe it's about paying
politicians more.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.230
Maybe it's about gas prices.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.195
Maybe it's about
proposing a sex tax.

00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:01.570
All these different kinds of
things, knowing that they're

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.590
either not fully enactable
at all, or even a little bit

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.550
enactable, or just
a question to ask

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.550
to get a different kind
of conversation started.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:14.380
Because my frustration is that,
politics being what they are,

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.080
institutional
inertia being what it

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.470
is, institutional habits
being what they are,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.730
it's really really, really
hard to make any real change.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.390
I mean, change in
most institutions

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.150
is two degrees this
way, when really

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.340
if you look at health
care, education, sometimes

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.510
you need like 90
degrees or 180 degrees.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.110
So a lot of what we
do is just proposing

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.260
these kind of outlandish ideas.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.200
One post was Steve
Levitt wrote one

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.400
saying that terrorism
is a concern in the US,

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.400
even though incidents are
very, very, very rare.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.720
But we're spending a lot of
money, a lot of mindshare

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.290
on it.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.789
So if we're really
serious about it,

00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:50.780
we should try to think
of all potential ways

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.180
that a terrorists could attack.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.160
So on the blog, he wrote
asking, dear readers,

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.539
if you were a terrorist,
how would you attack?

00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:59.580
Which seemed like a really
good idea at the time.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.800
We were only trying to help.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.550
But as it turns out,
"The New York Times,"

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.270
which was then running
our blog, immediately

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.400
panicked, and shut down
comments, and, I think,

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.469
called the FBI on us.

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:09.052
It was brutal.

00:38:09.052 --> 00:38:10.757
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.757 --> 00:38:12.590
So "We Were Only Trying
to Help" was a title

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.920
that we proposed to
the British publisher.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.960
And the immediate response
was yeah, perfect.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.255
And that's why I love our
British publisher so much.

00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:21.630
And then I said to the American
publisher, you know what?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:26.090
We got a better title than
"Hurray for High Gas Prices."

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.340
"We Were Only Trying to Help."

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.429
And our editor said, yeah.

00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:28.970
That's great.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.960
That's awesome.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.160
And then like three weeks
later, on the same day,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.990
I get a call from
both publishers.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.310
Because the way it works now in
publishing, the editorial team,

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.300
and even the marketing team,
and the PR team, no offense,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.300
they have zero leverage.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.925
It's a little bit like probably
around here where the engineers

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.260
have all the juice, right?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.390
So in publishing, sales
has all the juice, right?

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.010
So it's the sales team
will take a book, title,

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.580
and cover out to the
book stores, the chains,

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.997
and Amazons, and so on.

00:38:55.997 --> 00:38:58.080
And they'll say, this is
a new book by these guys.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.245
And then one person at
the book chain will say,

00:39:01.245 --> 00:39:02.510
I don't like that.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.740
That sounds stupid.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.390
Or that sounds like they're
being self-flagellating

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.150
or something.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.358
So on the same day, I got
a from both publishers that

00:39:10.358 --> 00:39:12.880
said sorry, "We Were Only
Trying to Help" won't work.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.330
So then we just had to
go looking for a title.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.650
And we went looking
in the posts that we'd

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.310
selected for the book.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:23.610
And one post that we
liked a lot was this one

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:24.830
called "When to Rob a Bank."

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.788
And the reason we liked
it was because it's not

00:39:26.788 --> 00:39:29.505
about how to rob a bank,
which is kind of procedural.

00:39:29.505 --> 00:39:31.630
It's not about why to rob
a bank, which is obvious.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.600
It's about when.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.140
And that's the kind of
question that we like to ask,

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.210
which is if you're gonna do
this, this thing that turns out

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.410
to be pretty stupid.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.150
So it turns out the
biggest point of this post

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.290
is that the ROI on bank
robbery is just dreadful.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.609
In Britain, you take
home about, I think,

00:39:48.609 --> 00:39:50.650
two and a half or three
times the amount of money

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.780
you get from an average
bank robbery in the States,

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.655
which is interesting.

00:39:53.655 --> 00:39:56.000
I think it has to do with
just more cash on hand.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.130
But the rate of arrest, the risk
of arrest is about the same.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.420
So you're likely to get
arrested after just three bank

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:01.940
robberies.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.192
So even if you take
on 10,000 pounds,

00:40:05.192 --> 00:40:06.650
you get arrested
after three times.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:12.000
So for 30,000 quid, you're going
to spent a few years in prison.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.930
And so the ROI is dreadful.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.890
If you really want
to rob a bank,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.320
mornings are much
better than afternoons.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.410
And yet, the vast
majority of bank robbers

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.560
work in the afternoons,
which indicates clearly they

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.790
haven't looked up the data.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.260
Because if they had,
they'd be working mornings.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.320
But maybe they just can't
get up in the mornings.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.310
Maybe they're not
morning risers,

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.351
which is probably why
they're having to rob banks

00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:33.384
in the first place.

00:40:33.384 --> 00:40:35.800
And the very most interesting
part of "When to Rob a Bank"

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.570
for me was that this
was all inspired

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.680
by the story of a woman
in Iowa who was embezzling

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.500
from the bank where she worked.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.480
And it turned out to be a
bank owned by her father,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.920
or run by her father.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.070
So if you're gonna rob a bank,
rob it from inside, right?

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.300
They said the best way to
rob a bank is to own one

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.665
or at least to work at one.

00:40:55.665 --> 00:40:57.540
But what was interesting
about this woman was

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.310
she had been working at
this bank for many years,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.980
15 or 20 years.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.070
And she was finally
caught because she

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.850
got so burnt out and
exhausted that she

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:09.940
had to take some time off.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.300
And then they discovered
that she'd been keeping

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.539
two sets of books all along.

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:15.580
And she's embezzled, I
believe, about $2 million.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.570
And this was in the
1960s, so that was a lot.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.900
Again, from her father's bank.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.557
And as it turns out,
the way that she

00:41:21.557 --> 00:41:23.140
had covered it for
all these years was

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.040
by keeping two sets of
books, but by never taking

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.750
a single vacation day,
which is how she got so

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.850
exhausted that she
finally broke down.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.240
So after she served
her time in prison,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.530
her parents took her back.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.920
They were very forgiving.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.990
And then the FBI or some
law enforcement agency

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.879
said do you want to come
help us catch embezzlers?

00:41:41.879 --> 00:41:43.920
And one of the things that
she introduced them to

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.310
was the notion that
one of the best metrics

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.220
to identify in looking
for embezzlement

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.849
is extraordinary vacation
or sick time pay.

00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:57.390
Because if you're not taking it
either when everybody else is

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.070
taking it, or not
taking it all, it's

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.710
almost certainly because you're
doing something with your books

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.168
that you don't want
anybody to see.

00:42:03.168 --> 00:42:06.184
So that's when to rob a bank.

00:42:06.184 --> 00:42:06.850
Other questions?

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:07.610
Yes, please.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.420
Oh, you have a mic?

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.382
Yeah.

00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:13.030
AUDIENCE: On the
turkey story, the thing

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.071
I found most astonishing
was that the same

00:42:15.071 --> 00:42:16.070
wasn't true of chickens.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.291
Why wasn't the same
true of chickens?

00:42:19.291 --> 00:42:21.290
STEVEN J. DUBNER: So short
answer, I don't know.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.980
If I had to guess, I would
say it's one of two things.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:31.250
So one would be that
physiologically,

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.800
even if we want
to breed chickens

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.280
to have as a large
breast as possible,

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.620
that their breasts
don't get large enough

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.100
to the point of interference.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.010
Two is there's some artificial
insemination in chickens.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.590
So it could be that there is
a segment of chicken breeding

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.770
where the breasts are
protrusive to the point

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.520
that it requires
artificial insemination.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.010
And I would think
that's probably true.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.150
Now that you mention it,
that's an obvious question

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.720
that I should ask and
find out, because it

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.928
would be interesting to know.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.960
We did a podcast once called
"Weird Recycling," which

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.640
I really liked.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.840
It was about three
different stories

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.360
about where people
took something

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.410
that was of no value
or even negative value,

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.800
and reused it in a way that they
gave it great positive value.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.070
So maybe we didn't even
include horse manure.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.420
Horse manure was one
that used to be that.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.990
Horse manure in the olden,
olden days was worth something.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.570
In cities that were
growing, they'd

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.150
have a lot of horse manure.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.858
In the cities, they'd
sell it to farmers,

00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:32.200
but then there was a horse
manure glut as cities grew.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.420
So London and New York were
paralyzed by horse manure

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.736
because of the economic glut.

00:43:36.736 --> 00:43:38.860
There was so much of it
that they couldn't sell it.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.860
But then the car came along.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.390
There are many fewer horses.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.100
And now horse manure
is quite expensive.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.640
So that's a case.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.422
The other instances, there
was spent nuclear fuel.

00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:51.880
So there are some
nuclear engineers

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.963
who figured out how to
make nuclear power by using

00:43:53.963 --> 00:43:55.310
what we call spent fuel.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.060
And then one example
was chicken feet,

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.150
or what they call in the
industry chicken paws.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.790
So in the States, almost nobody
eats the feet of chicken.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:04.030
Do you eat them here at all?

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.904
So if you go to certain
Chinese restaurants--

00:44:05.904 --> 00:44:09.807
and they look like
this, really clawy.

00:44:09.807 --> 00:44:11.640
And there's that one
spur that's right here.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.280
They look very much
like a human hand

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.940
was tortured-- a
little bit smaller.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.090
And they are definitely
an acquired taste.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.100
I mean, I guess they're
an acquired taste.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.225
And very few people in
the States eat them,

00:44:24.225 --> 00:44:25.540
and obviously here.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.440
But in China, they're huge.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.240
So it used to be that chicken
producing firms in the US

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.610
would throw away
billions of chicken feet

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.350
every year at great cost.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.200
And then as they begin to
do more global business,

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.320
it turns out that they would
sell a whole lot to Asia.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.330
And now big chicken producing
companies like Purdue

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.760
tell me that they
would not be profitable

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.940
were it not for the
sale of chicken paws,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.200
that that's how close
the margins are,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.130
and chicken paws put
them over the top.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.980
That said, in the States
and here, the taste

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.030
is plainly for the white
meat of chicken as well.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.654
So I'm guessing that
what you would see

00:45:06.654 --> 00:45:10.426
is that there are some chickens
that are bred for that,

00:45:10.426 --> 00:45:11.800
and that among
those, there might

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.925
be artificial insemination.

00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:16.380
But I don't know enough about
bird reproductive-- I should

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.142
now, but yes, I don't know.

00:45:18.142 --> 00:45:19.500
That's a good question.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.794
Yes, anyone else?

00:45:21.794 --> 00:45:24.550
MALE SPEAKER: Could
you pass the mic over?

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.900
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.655
So why are politicians
so resistant

00:45:27.655 --> 00:45:30.390
to evidence-based policymaking?

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.830
STEVEN J. DUBNER: Why are
they so resistant to what?

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.413
AUDIENCE: Evidence
based policymaking.

00:45:34.413 --> 00:45:35.760
STEVEN J. DUBNER: Oh.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.810
Well, before I join with
you in accusing them,

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.430
let me defend them for a minute.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:47.792
Why is everybody averse to
evidence-based decision making?

00:45:47.792 --> 00:45:49.625
I'll just give you two
very quick parallels.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:55.544
I'm just going to guess here.

00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:57.710
A bunch of people sitting
here are Google engineers.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.974
I'm guessing probably
at least 5% of you

00:46:00.974 --> 00:46:04.730
have a parent who's
a doctor, an MD.

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:07.570
raise your hand if you
have a parent who's an MD.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:08.070
OK.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.870
That's about right.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:14.633
So medicine is fascinating.

00:46:17.789 --> 00:46:19.830
There's so much be grateful
for and thankful for,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.780
but it's also very,
very frustrating.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.580
Because even though there's
a lot of science in it,

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.600
most doctors aren't
remotely scientific.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.760
And it turns out that
most doctors are also

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.510
terrible with data, that they're
unbelievably bad with the most

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.130
basic sets of probabilities.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.544
Many doctors are, at least.

00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.710
And then when they communicate
it to their patients,

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.840
it gets even worse, because it
becomes a game of telephone,

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:50.960
whereas you have a 2% chance
within 10 years of developing

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.250
a potentially fatal condition.

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:56.500
And many people hear that
in many different ways,

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.080
but a lot of people
hear it in a way

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.335
that nobody who knows any
statistics would ever embrace.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.680
So doctors, I always
grew up thinking,

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.072
were scientific in the way
that we think of scientific,

00:47:09.072 --> 00:47:10.780
meaning the scientific
method, and things

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.170
are tried and proven.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.090
There are hypotheses.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.230
There's data gathered and so on.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.230
And it turns out that
most medicine isn't really

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:17.060
built that way.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.518
And the only medicine
that's really

00:47:18.518 --> 00:47:22.100
build that way these
days is pharmaceuticals

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.800
and some forms of
medical interventions,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.140
actual treatments.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.400
But the vast
majority of it is not

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.710
what you would really
call evidence-based.

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:34.320
And that's a pretty scary
thought at the end of the day.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.460
And so we've done stories
recently in our podcast,

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.960
again, where even when there are
evidence-based proofs of sorts

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.200
of treatment or in the
realm of medical health care

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.400
delivery that's known to
be efficient, even then,

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.980
policymakers aren't
crazy about adopting it.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.140
So there's this one case we
did a podcast about in Camden,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.590
New Jersey that's a very,
very labor intensive,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:02.170
cost intensive intervention,
where turns out it in this area

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:06.400
but in many geographical areas,
roughly 5% of the medical

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.330
patients are responsible for
consuming about 50$ of all

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.110
health care costs
of all health care.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.810
So it's a huge,
huge, huge problem.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.590
You've just got
massive concentration

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.810
among people who are going to
the emergency room 100 times

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.900
a year, just consuming
all kinds of cost.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.160
So these people came
up with the thought

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.260
what if we, instead of
treating things the way

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.050
we are now, which
is terribly, what

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:34.230
if we come up with a new plan
to invent a social services

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.100
multifaceted network where
we offer medical care

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.350
but we also offer counseling
so people actually understand

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.259
what drugs they're
supposed to take and when,

00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:44.050
so we actually help
them get to the doctors

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.350
they're supposed to go to.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.170
So if they need to go to drug
rehab, they're doing that,

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:47.870
and so on.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.820
So an expensive,
hands-on project

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.270
that ended up being very
effective and very cost

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.240
effective, considering
what it saved.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.300
So even after this kind
of thing is proven,

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.690
no one in the federal
government associated

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.620
with Medicare and
Medicaid, I'm told,

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.990
really wanted to have
anything to do with it.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.510
Because the
constituencies are just

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.550
so large and ingrained that
they really couldn't make any

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:10.180
persuasions.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.660
So in health care,
evidence-based medicine

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.170
is still more of a dream.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.550
In education,
evidence-based curricula

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.660
are only beginning
to come online.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.860
So for politicians,
I would argue, yeah,

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.540
they're particularly
visible in the way

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.220
that they fail to
embrace evidence,

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.820
but I don't think they're
very unique at all.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.950
And why they don't do it is
because, I think, that most

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.210
politicians--
unfortunately, it's

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.130
a principal agent
problem in a way.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.790
They're the agents and
we're the principals.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.082
So we're the voters.

00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:48.540
We want to problems solved that
we think government is best

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.360
suited to solve.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.240
And these are typically
long term, complex scenarios

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.870
with a lot of different
players-- transportation,

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.580
health care, education-- things
like this-- geopolitics--

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.430
that individuals can't do,
that businesses, private firms

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.740
don't necessarily do that well.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.115
So we think, well, this is
what governments are gonna do,

00:50:04.115 --> 00:50:06.924
and that's what we want
our politicians to do.

00:50:06.924 --> 00:50:08.340
And that's what
we elect them for.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.715
But then once they
get in office,

00:50:09.715 --> 00:50:13.140
the way the system is set up
in democracies at least is that

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.500
they are encouraged to respond
to different incentives,

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.720
which is short term
self-interested incentives

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.676
of getting elected, raising
money, consolidating power,

00:50:21.676 --> 00:50:24.050
getting on the right committee,
consolidating more power,

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.180
raising more money in order
to perpetuate their own--

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.600
So even though we don't
like it-- We hate that.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.760
We all hate that.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.900
But for me, it's hard
to blame them for it,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.600
because that's the
set of incentives

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.360
that they walked into.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.770
There are a few maybe
idealistic people who buck it,

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.765
but very few people's
ideology is really

00:50:40.765 --> 00:50:43.056
as strong as the incentives
that they're responding to.

00:50:43.056 --> 00:50:45.410
So one solution to this
that we've proposed,

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.730
I think, in this book,
in "When to Rob a Bank,"

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.771
and I've talked about this
with many politicians.

00:50:49.771 --> 00:50:51.730
And they always nod and smile.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.530
They say, oh yeah.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.190
Great, great, great idea.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.300
But at the end of
the day, they hate it

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.400
because it's totally possible.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.520
The idea would be A,
we should probably

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.830
try at least, we should
experiment with paying

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.660
politicians a lot more.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.812
So how many parliamentary
districts are there in the UK?

00:51:09.812 --> 00:51:10.960
AUDIENCE: 625.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.099
STEVEN J. DUBNER: 625?

00:51:12.099 --> 00:51:14.140
So it would be really fun
to take that, divide it

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.280
in two or four, randomize,
and raise the sal-- what's

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.100
an MP get paid?

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.270
100,000 a year or something?

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:20.042 --> 00:51:21.250
STEVEN J. DUBNER: OH, really?

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.510
AUDIENCE: About 80, I think.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.410
STEVEN J. DUBNER: 70,000 pounds?

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:24.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:24.035 --> 00:51:27.750
STEVEN J. DUBNER: So $100,000--
70,000 pounds, we'll say.

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.050
It would be really fun
to take an experiment.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:33.560
So for five years, in two
districts, we leave it.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.530
In one district, we have it.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.530
In one set of districts,
rather, we do this.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.390
And in one set of
districts, we double it.

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:41.540
All you're really
looking for, initially,

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.410
is do higher salaries attract
a different kind of person

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.630
to go into politics?

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.320
So some empirical work that
has been done on this already.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.650
The answer's yes.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.550
So in some place
in South America,

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:55.970
I believe in Mexico--
in Singapore,

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.180
they pay politicians a lot.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.846
There's a lot of
things that some people

00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:00.010
don't like about Singapore.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:01.760
Most political
observers, however,

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.220
argue that it's easily
one of the most efficient,

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:09.520
uncorrupted, and practical
federal governments out there,

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.780
one reason being-- not
all-- being that they make

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.100
the job incredibly attractive.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.770
So rather than maybe coming
to Google for a career,

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:18.510
the same person
might actually want

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.550
to go into council election
or a parliamentary election.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:22.740
So that's one.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.440
You could explore
the idea of changing

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.510
the status of
political jobs, just

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.886
the way we explore changing
the status of teachers,

00:52:30.886 --> 00:52:32.760
which we haven't done
yet either, by the way.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.470
But that's one idea.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.050
But then here's the
bigger, bolder one

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.360
that will never,
ever, ever happen,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.151
but what I think could
really, really work.

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.550
If the problem is
as I described,

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.130
which is that their incentives
are not aligned with ours,

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.380
because they have short
term, self-interested ones,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.600
we have long term
public-interested ones.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.840
Well, what if we try
to align them better?

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.550
And one way to align
them better would

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:57.130
be to remunerate them based
on their achievements,

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.880
merit-based pay, right?

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.450
So right now, if
think about it, how

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:04.690
does a politician build
up capitol, or build up

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:05.870
value in their careers?

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:10.809
By being more visible, by
being usually safe, right?

00:53:10.809 --> 00:53:12.850
So that they're gonna turn
their political career

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:18.094
into a lobbying, or consulting
career, or whatever afterwards.

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.510
But what we really
want them to do

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.765
is be working on those
transportation, and education,

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:24.040
and health care problems
that we sent them to do.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.880
So what if we were to pay
them for doing those problems,

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.470
and pay them a lot?

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:32.070
So let's say that there's
a Department of Education.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.965
And we decide that-- I saw that
your British math students,

00:53:35.965 --> 00:53:37.340
you're even worse
than Americans.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.840
You're terrible, right?

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.270
Where do you find
engineers in this country?

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:42.060
Right?

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.769
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] British.

00:53:43.769 --> 00:53:45.560
STEVEN J. DUBNER: So
your math scores-- OK,

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.860
so let's say that the
goal for the next 20 years

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:55.210
is for British school math
scores to rise 15% or 10%

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:57.849
against international
averages, whatever.

00:53:57.849 --> 00:53:59.390
AUDIENCE: Make the
tests easier then.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:01.514
STEVEN J. DUBNER: OK, well,
that's a good solution.

00:54:01.514 --> 00:54:04.060
That's a very political
solution, certainly.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.029
So immediately I know you'd
be an excellent politician,

00:54:07.029 --> 00:54:09.570
because you would have a very
cheap, effective solution right

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:10.280
out of the gate.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.720
So let's say that
that's your goal.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.790
Then let's set up
a project to try

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:17.040
to figure out how to get to
that goal with measurables

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.998
with all along the way.

00:54:17.998 --> 00:54:21.307
And you declare somebody
the arbiter of these goals

00:54:21.307 --> 00:54:22.140
and the measurables.

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.970
So maybe it's an
accounting firm, whoever.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.170
We know how to do that.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.210
We now how to set up
projects with measurables.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.050
And let's say that you've
got a Secretary of Education

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.650
and 100 people working
on this project who

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.920
do all kinds of
experimentation, who

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.770
put into effect all kinds of
curricula, changes, blah, blah,

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:40.539
blah.

00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:42.080
And then let's say
20 years from now,

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.360
those goals are met, right?

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.460
So if you raised the test
scores of British schoolchildren

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.730
by 15% in 10 or 20
years, whatever,

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.660
what's that worth to society?

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.030
A lot, a lot.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.960
It's worth a lot
to individuals too.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.470
And so what would be wrong with
therefore paying the people who

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.670
worked on that in politics to
make it happen a share of that?

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.820
So I'd love to write a
check for a million pounds

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.470
or two million pounds to
the Secretary of Education

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:12.600
as a kind of vested stock
option 10 or 20 years from now

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.190
if their plan worked out.

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.960
So basically, it's merit pay
in the form of stock options

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.740
for elected and appointed
political officials, which,

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.072
I think, is a no-brainer.

00:55:22.072 --> 00:55:22.780
I think it works.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.946
Because that's the way the
whole world works, right?

00:55:24.946 --> 00:55:26.580
If you do well,
you get rewarded.

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.960
If you do poorly, you're gone.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.751
The other thing I think
is really important

00:55:29.751 --> 00:55:33.685
to do in politics that I
would steal from football

00:55:33.685 --> 00:55:35.220
is I would relegate.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.710
So every year, I would
relegate the bottom 15%

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.850
of all politicians in
every political system just

00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:43.440
to flush them out the bottom.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.900
So that's how I
would fix politics,

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.985
but as you can imagine, we were
only trying to help, you know?

00:55:48.985 --> 00:55:51.069
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.860
Are we out of time?

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.400
MALE SPEAKER: We're out of time.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.000
STEVEN J. DUBNER: OK, thank you
very much for having me today.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:54.600
I appreciate it.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.100
Thank you.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:59.150
[APPLAUSE]
