a lot of people are scared about the eye

a lot of people are scared about the eye
 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.650
a lot of people are scared about the eye
and the reason is I think we've seen too

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
and the reason is I think we've seen too
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.380
and the reason is I think we've seen too
many Terminator movies so we're mixing

many Terminator movies so we're mixing
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.339

many things up so it is true Terminator

is not a scenario we are planning for
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.769
is not a scenario we are planning for
but when it comes to artificial

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779

we're effectively afraid of robots that

will move and are stronger and smarter
 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.150
will move and are stronger and smarter
than we are like terminator so that's

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160
than we are like terminator so that's
 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.830

not our aspiration that's not we're not
