00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's say I have a bucket of
aqueous solution, and it

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.440
contains some weak acid in it.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.550
And so weak acid.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.080
We've done this multiple
times.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.620
It's in equilibrium with
its dissociated state.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.585
So it would be in equilibrium.

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:15.980
Let me write the aqueous.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.540
So it's a weak acid, where the
A could be any other kind of

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.000
molecular group.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.480
That could be the conjugate
base of the weak acid.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:33.810
So that's in equilibrium with
some hydrogen ions, so it'll

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.670
produce some of them, but
some of this is going to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.190
be around as well.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.900
Plus its conjugate base.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.150
A minus.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.740
Aqueous.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.680
And just like we did with the
strong acid titration, let's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.900
measure it's pH.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.226
So I'll do that right here.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.430
Actually, I want to do
it a little higher.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.340
So let's do it right there.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.670
Let me make a little
scale here.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.520
So this is 0.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.920
Let's say that right
there is 7.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.210
That this right here is 14.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.620
So our first measurement of the
pH of our solution-- we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.920
have a maybe a liter of it.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.370
Let's say we have 1 liter
of our solution.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.680
We don't know the concentration
of this thing.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000
But let's say our first
measurement, we go and we say

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.470
OK, it's got a pH of--
I don't know.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.650
Something here.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.470
Let's say it's got a pH of 3.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
So it's acidic, not ultra
acidic, but it's acidic.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590
So it's got a pH of
3 right there.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.180
This whole scale on the
left-hand side.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.000
This is all pH, just like
in the last video.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.695
This is pH.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.390
The pH is going up as
you go up the scale.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.740
That's our first measurement.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.790
Now we're going to titrate this
weak acid, just like we

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.110
titrated the strong base.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.870
And normally when you do this--
I mean, you can, in

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.320
theory, titrate with anything.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.580
But you normally titrate-- if
you're titrating an acid,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.040
whether it's weak or strong--
you always titrate with a

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.530
strong base.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.260
And if you are titrating a
base, whether it's weaker

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.980
strong, the reagent, or the
thing that you're going to

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.640
add, is going to be
a strong acid.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.460
So in this case, even though
we're going to drop some drops

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.480
into a weak acid, we're
going to drop

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720
drops of a strong base.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.250
So let's use sodium
hydroxide again.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.520
NaOH.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.420
And just to make things
interesting, to make the math

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.052
a little interesting, let's say
it's a 0.5 molar solution.

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:32.620
And we're going to add it
in increments of little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.460
100-milliliter increments.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.050
A tenth of a liter.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.600
But the interesting thing is
really the shape of the curve

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.800
that forms, or the titration
curve, or the pH curve.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.140
Let me write what the
reaction of NaOH.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.340
Just so you have that
in your head.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.010
NaOH, sodium hydroxide,
and I did this in

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.700
the previous video.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.900
It disassociates completely
in water.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.520
And so it turns into Na plus--
all this is aqueous, of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.410
course-- plus OH minus.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.870
So when you throw even
a little bit.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.175
Let's say you throw in-- this
is 0.5 molar solution-- 100

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:12.425
milliliters.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.180
That's equal to one
tenth of a liter.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.850
This 0.5 molar, that's
its molarity.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.680
So it says hey, I'm going
to have half a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.580
mole of this stuff.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.120
Or really, of this stuff.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.100
I'm going to have half
a mole of hydroxide

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.060
ions for every liter.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.690
So in one tenth of a liter,
that means that I'm

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.330
going to have what?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.980
I'm going to have
half of that.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.480
So I'm going have 1/20,
or 0.05 moles.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.030
So let's say this point right
here's is 100 milliliters.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.510
I've added 100 milliliters
of our solution.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.770
That's going to have
0.5 moles of OH.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.950
Because remember, we could say
it's 0.5 moles of this, but

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.870
whenever this is in solution,
it disassociates

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.720
completely into this.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.010
So if you have 0.5 moles of
this, you really have 0.5

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.220
moles of this.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.860
This will be in this form
completely, because it's a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.280
strong base.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.280
So if I have 0.5 moles of this
and I throw it into the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.040
solution, what's
it going to do?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.769
It's going to start sopping up
some of our hydrogen ions.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.690
So it's going to increase the
pH, and it's going to keep

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.440
increasing.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.910
Right?

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.310
And this is a buffer.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.470
And this is a key thing
to remember.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.730
This is going to sop some
of this thing up.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.690
But this is a buffer.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.740
This is a weak acid.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.730
So it's in equilibrium.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.930
So it has this reserve over
here of the acid form.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.830
So when you start lowering this
by adding a strong base

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.640
to it, to sop this up, what's
going to happen?

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.320
The reaction is going to move
in this direction to kind of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.520
backfill, to fill or
to almost replace.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.170
It won't get quite to where it
was before, but it's going to

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.560
dampen the stress on
the equilibrium.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.170
So what's going to happen is the
concentration of your weak

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.440
acid is going to go down.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.770
It's going to try to backfill
this stuff.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.980
But every time the reaction goes
in this direction, this

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.630
is going to go up.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.900
Right?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.140
Remember, nothing is sopping
up the conjugate

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.240
base up here, right?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.410
We're just sopping up
the hydrogen ions.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.840
As we sop up more and more
hydrogen ions, this reaction

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.560
goes more and more in the
rightward direction.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.380
But as it goes more and more
in the rightward direction,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.550
we're just adding more
and more to this.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.770
And the base just takes more
and more of this out.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.940
So essentially when the base
is taking this out, it's

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.160
really taking this out-- or it's
taking half of this out.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.330
It's taking the H part
of this out.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.200
Because that converts to that,
and it gets sopped up by the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.430
by the reagent.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.000
The strong base.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.450
And all of this ends
up on this side, as

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.210
the conjugate base.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.640
So at some point, when we have
added the exact same amount of

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.370
OH as there is of this stuff, as
there is of this stuff plus

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.230
the hydrogen.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.900
When we've sopped up all
of the hydrogen,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.590
what's going to happen?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.720
Well, right when you get above
that point, when you start

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.650
adding even more, you're going
to start getting very basic.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.750
It's just going to skyrocket
up the pH.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.880
Because then you're adding OHs,
and they're not being

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.250
canceled out by any hydrogen
over there.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.460
And there's nothing to kind
of backfill the hydrogen.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.140
So you're going to get to
a very high reaction.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.560
When we add enough of the sodium
hydroxide that this

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.970
completely neutralizes this
and this, and all we

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.070
have left is that.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.055
Well, you might say, oh, we have
a pH of 7 because all of

00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:54.905
the acid is neutralized.

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:57.560
But we don't have a pH of 7 like
we did with the strong

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.990
base, because here, as we
sopped up stuff, we kept

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.180
adding conjugate
base over here.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.830
Remember, and it's
a real base.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.180
It actually has basic
properties.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.690
If this is a strong acid, if
this was hydrogen chloride,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.070
I'd still have the chloride
over here.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.900
But chloride, even though it's
the conjugate base, it has no

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.820
basic properties.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.290
It does not increase the
pH of a solution.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.360
But this stuff right here does
increase the pH of a solution.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.460
And we've done that in
previous videos.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.750
So once all of this is sopped
up, your equivalence point, or

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.900
the point at which the number
of moles of this is equal to

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.190
the number of moles of this,
is going to have a high pH.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.050
So it's going to be like
right over there.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.380
And then as you add more and
more of your reagent, or your

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.420
strong base, your pH is going
to get higher and higher and

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.440
approach 14 or even
go above it.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.060
So your titration curve
is going look

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.310
something like this.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.690
And once again, you look
at the steepest

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.940
point on the curve.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.626
It's right there.

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:03.480
And you say, OK, that's
the equivalence point.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.580
That's the point at which
I had an equal amount of

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.920
hydroxide having sopped up all
of the hydrogen, and I've run

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.800
out of all of this stuff to
backfill the hydrogen.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.210
So you look at your
equivalence point.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.910
And you say, OK, if that
equivalence point was when I

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.170
added, I don't know.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.500
Maybe that's when you added
2 liters of your reagent.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.900
So you added 2 liters
of your reagent.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.800
Your basic reagent,
right here.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.360
Or your titrant.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.490
Or titrator.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.270
I think that's another
word for it.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.720
How many moles have you added?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.600
Well it's 2 liters, it's 0.5
molar, so you've added 1 mole.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.530
So here you've added
1 mole of OH.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.250
And when you added 1 mole of OH,
you sopped up all of the

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.060
whatever mole you had of this.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.980
So you clearly had
1 mole of that.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:02.660
So over here, your original
concentration of your-- I

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.850
mean, you really could say your
concentration of your HA

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:10.550
plus your initial equilibrium
hydrogen is equal to 1 molar.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.580
Now in most chemistry classes,
this number is way bigger than

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.610
this number for most
weak acids.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.460
And you could look at that.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.230
Because if you look at some of
the pKa's for some weak acids,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.590
you'll see that this is some--
well, I won't go into the

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.900
math, but this number's
a lot lower.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.010
So this is an indication,
essentially, of your initial

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.960
concentration of
your weak acid.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.590
So you essentially just keep
titrating it, figure out the

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.070
inflection point, you say, the
inflection point happened when

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.330
I added 2 liters of the
titrator to it, which

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.170
corresponded to 1 mole.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:46.000
So therefore I must have had 1
mole of my original acid in

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.060
the equation.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.060
Another interesting thing.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.800
So if you said OK, I had 1 mole
of my original acid in

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.430
the equation.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.250
So you say, this was 1 molar
originally, before I started

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.520
titrating it all.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.695
And if I said that this is a 1
liter solution-- this is 1

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:04.990
mole, not 1 molar.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.410
But if I know it's a 1-liter
solution, now I know that

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.060
originally I had 1 mole
in 1 liter, so I had

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.550
a molarity of 1.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:18.020
Now, let me go over something
else that's interesting about

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.350
a basic reaction.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.810
Actually, let me do that in
the next video, because I

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.960
think this one's getting
a little long.
