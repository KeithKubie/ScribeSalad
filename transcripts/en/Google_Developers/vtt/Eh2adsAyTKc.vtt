00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.570
Hi, I'm Shazia Makhdumi from the
Google Play for Education team.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.320
I work with developers
like yourselves

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.580
who are building great
Edu apps and help

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.740
them be successful in Android.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.970
So you know that idea you have
for an amazing educational app,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.060
the one that will
change how kids think,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.950
empower them to build
totally new things,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.140
or even revolutionize how
a school is structured?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.470
I've got some good news about
your idea-- its time has come.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.760
So in this video, I want
to share learnings and best

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.820
practices from other
Edu app developers that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.870
will help you get
started on building

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.810
a great educational app.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.570
Today, we're in a
disruptive moment

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.510
in the evolution of education
content in schools and tools

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.630
as you know well.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.350
It used to be nearly
impossible for small developers

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.590
to get an educational
app into a school,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.770
no matter how amazing or
transformative it was.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340
But with the Google Play
for Education marketplace,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.920
we've actually
made it easy to get

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.180
your app into the hands of
educators that want to use it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.930
and for those
educators to get it

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.850
into the hands of
their students.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.840
And for the record, that's a lot
of hands we're talking about.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.790
Currently, over 30 million
teachers and students worldwide

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.700
use Google Apps for
Education, which

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.600
means that Google can help
you have a huge presence.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.230
So as you can tell,
our team is really

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.670
excited about this opportunity,
but more importantly educators

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.250
are really excited
about what we're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.210
doing with Google
Play for Education,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.270
especially about the access to
enriching content for students

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.220
as well as the tools
that help them be more

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.195
productive in the classroom
so they can focus on teaching.

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:29.570
Google Play for
Education already

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.170
includes thousands of apps
ranging from curriculum

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.200
supplements to help students
learn math and English

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.240
and science, as well as how
to create videos, make a book,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.690
annotate notes.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.200
Teachers find tools that
help support students,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.570
create presentations, and even
manage classroom behavior.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.890
So thousands of apps in
Google Play for Education

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.840
means thousands
of developers have

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.770
built great educational
apps on Android.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.720
And they have a lot
of nuggets to share.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.650
So what we did was, we distilled
those into the top five tips

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.240
that developers consider
the most important

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910
when building an education app.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.300
Their experience
is your advantage.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.150
Tip number one-- users
will pay for quality,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.589
so get testers to submit
ratings and reviews early.

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.880
One of the primary metrics
that users judge an app with

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.970
is quality.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.320
And they use app star
rating to measure quality.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.340
When the star rating increases,
the purchase rate increases.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.450
And as you can
see, four star apps

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.940
earn almost three times what
three star apps are earning.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.270
So to make sure that your
app's quality is reflected

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.860
in the rating, ask
early evaluators

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.500
of your app, especially
the educators,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.880
to submit their ratings
and reviews for it.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.520
Teachers really care about what
other teachers specifically

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.400
think about an app
because that is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.000
a big factor in their
purchase decision.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.970
Tip number two-- alpha and
beta test groups as well as

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.890
staged rollouts help you
collect user feedback quickly.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.600
So instead of simply
publishing your newest app

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.750
to the entire world,
Google Play allows

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.000
developers to test the
app with small groups

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.446
of alpha testers
or beta testers.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:00.070
And this is a great
opportunity for you

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.060
to get feedback on
your app without it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.900
affecting its current rating.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.920
The folks who built Book
Creator invited 20 teachers

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.210
to try the beta app
in the classroom.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.150
This gave them early
visibility into issues

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.720
and also allowed them to test
on a wide variety of devices

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080
but within a
classroom environment.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.340
And they recommend for
paid apps like theirs,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.240
create a separate free version
just for the beta phase.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.910
Why?

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.230
So that teachers don't have
to pay to test your app.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.280
Also, consider using staged
rollouts in Google Play

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.260
to gradually push new features
and updates to a slow percent

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.445
of the user base and
get their feedback.

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:36.820
So if your rating
stays the same,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.620
great, roll it out to
more users and repeat.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.610
But what this does, it helps
you catch problems early

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.050
before they can have a huge
impact on your ratings.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.460
Tip number three-- we've
all heard the expression,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.420
you only have one chance
to make a first impression.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.340
So optimizing for
tablets from the start

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.860
helps you make a good first
impression with your users.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.330
Given the growth of
tablets in schools,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.450
it's really important that
educational apps work well

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.830
on tablets since that directly
impacts user experience, which

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.960
then impacts purchase rates.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.060
For instance StudyBlue, an
online flash card creation app,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.890
did not initially test the
app on 10 inch devices.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.519
And what they found
was they had a lot

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.420
of bugs especially related
to tablet specific issues

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.480
around orientation and rotation.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.100
And usability was poor.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.670
So now that they
know that, they're

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.180
actually using responsive layout
techniques such as fragments

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.460
to build a multi-pane layout
for their tablet app, which

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.200
allows them to
make additional use

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.970
of the additional
tablet real estate,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.600
to minimize the
number of screens,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.550
and also to improve usability.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.440
They wish they had
known this and done this

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.360
from the beginning.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.100
So learn from their mistake.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.540
Use core tablet guidelines
early and often.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.040
Make sure that your
app is optimized

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.430
for tablets from the start.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.280
Tip number four--
designing for Android

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.940
allows you actually
to stay engaged

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.600
with users even when
the app is not open.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.270
So Google Play offers a lot
of Android specific design

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.720
elements such as
rich notifications

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570
and widgets and live wallpapers.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.280
And what these do
is allows a user

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.140
to be engaged with your app
even without them opening it.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.790
It's unlocking marketing
channels for your app,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.920
but without spending a dime
on expensive marketing.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.150
ClassDojo, which is a
classroom management app,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.400
actually took advantage
of notifications

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.860
for ClassDojo messaging.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.930
And they found an increased
number of read messages.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.660
And now they're experimenting
with Jelly Bean's expanded

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.340
notification and actions
to make the app even

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.380
more useful to their core
audience, teachers, students,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.440
and parents.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.190
Similarly, developers at
Wunderlist for Education,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.120
which is an app for managing
to-do lists, integrated

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.530
location reminders
to remind students

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.830
to do their homework when
they're getting home.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.720
Not sure how much students like
that, but what they had found

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.860
was reminders help keep the pace
of work and location reminders

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.950
especially adapt to
a student's routine.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.870
Tip number five, something that
you probably know, but your app

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.390
listing is really
important, maybe

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.100
even more important
than you realize.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.940
Because remember,
your app listing

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.310
is what helps attract
users and helps

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.240
them understand how
to use your app.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.900
So create a compelling
listing with a clear title

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.150
and descriptions.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.710
Use high-res shots and previews.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.390
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.460
Use a great icon, because
that's what users will see first

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.740
and remember about your app.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.470
It helps build your brand.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.820
But if a picture is
worth a thousand words,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.530
a video is actually worth
a thousand screenshots.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.200
StudyBlue found using
good videos in the listing

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.220
to demo your app
features actually

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.380
leads to better conversions,
since these days users are very

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.560
attuned to watching videos
to learn how an app or a game

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.240
works.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.010
So where possible, include
a video, especially one

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.944
of your app being used
in a classroom setting,

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.360
because that's
what's going to get

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.560
students and educators
excited about your app.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.200
OK, I know I said
five tips, but I

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.490
have a bonus tip or
self-evident truth.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.350
Be patient and be prepared
to dig in for the long haul.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.600
And as most of you have
probably discovered,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.660
the Edu app space is not
for the faint of heart.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.030
Agnitus, which is an adaptive
learning system for kids,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.140
cautions that Edu
app development

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.390
needs time and resources
and stamina and commitment.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.820
Understand your customer, both
the one paying for the app

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.770
as well as the one
consuming the app.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.160
Understand curriculum,
data, and analytics.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.730
Think about scalability, both
in the data structure side

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.260
and on the database side.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.430
Intellijoy, a company that makes
math and English apps for kids,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.350
says to developers, resist
the temptation to "appify"

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.610
a lot of textbook content.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.940
Instead, focus on making a
quality app or game because

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.105
as tablet penetration ramps
up in schools, quality apps

00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.410
will rise to the top.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.630
So building a solid Edu app
will take significant planning,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.980
multiple types of resources
including education,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.544
engineering, domain, and design.

00:07:43.544 --> 00:07:45.210
But we've given you
all this information

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.470
to make it as easy
as possible for you

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.304
to bring your idea
to fruition sooner.

00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:52.720
So now that you know what to
do, what are you waiting for?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.380
Get started now.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.830
Visit developer.android.com/edu
to get more information

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.000
on the program as well as
access to helpful resources.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.670
We're really excited to
see how the apps you build

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.690
will help educators and
students and really enable

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.640
this next generation
of learning.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.650
Thank you.
