00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.390
Hi. My name's Andy. And I work at Udacity and your instructor, Yoren. Well, he

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.870
lives in Germany. And so he couldn't be here today, but we're really lucky to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.570
have Leonard Suskind here with us today.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.560
And Leonard Suskind is a theoretical physicist at

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.510
Stanford. Can you just give a little bit

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.190
of, of information about your background. Well, [LAUGH]

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.230
I'm a human being. I come from earth. I

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.750
I came from New York City. I am a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.580
Theoretical Physicist by profession. I think about things like black

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.670
holes and quantum field theory and elementary particles. In

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.990
cosmology and I spend most of my day doing that.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.530
&gt;&gt; A differential equation?

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.420
&gt;&gt; Every single field of physics used differential

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.590
equations. There is nothing that doesn't differential equations.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.050
so, yes I think a lot about differential equations. I, I, I don't

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.120
solve them very often. They are kind of hard to solve. And the,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.230
I don't do a lot of numerics with it, but the mathematical structure

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.900
of differential equations is terribly important

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.060
to every branch of physics, every branch.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.270
&gt;&gt; what do you mean when you say mathematical structure?

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.850
&gt;&gt; Well, there are different kind

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.410
of deferiential equations. They behave differently.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.030
There are wavy equations that describe waves

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.590
moving along. There are diffusion equations. A diffusion

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.170
equation describes how a, a drop of ink that falls into some water. Okay, how

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.160
does the drop of ink diffuse throughout

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.744
the water? It doesn't make waves. It just,

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:40.445
grows and becomes a blob. Those are two

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:44.330
[NOISE] very, very different kinds of differential equations.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.490
There are differential equations. That describe electrostatic

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840
fields for example. Then electrostatic fields don't change

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.050
with time, so those are differential equations

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.530
that don't have to do with time, they

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.790
just tell you how things vary in

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.160
space. All these various differential equations, these different

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.530
kinds of differential equations have different kinds

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.380
of mathematical structure. If an experienced person looks

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.710
at an equation, a differential equation.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.360
In a partial differential equation, usually you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.200
can tell very quickly is that describing waves or does, does it describe

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.260
diffusion, or is it describing the electrostatic behavior of something? And you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.600
get a pretty good feel by looking at the equation by its mathematical structure.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.270
What kind of phenomena is describing. So, yeah, different equations

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.550
have different kind of structure and the structure is mathematical.
