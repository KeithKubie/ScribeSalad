Now, let's watch the end of the clip, and see what happens. [SOUND]. Greg still

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.964
flinched even though I didn't shoot the gun, but I hit the bill. We see that

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:14.546
Greg still flinches, even though I didn't shoot him with the toy gun. He's

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:18.110
learned to flinch after hearing the bell, because we classically conditioned

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.544
him. To have a startle response to the sound of the bell. This is a learned

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:25.444
association. I'm going to have Susan explain to you, what classical

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:27.159
conditioning is all about.
