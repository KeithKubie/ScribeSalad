be a certain area and I think I've

be a certain area and I think I've

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
always worked in many different areas so
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
always worked in many different areas so
I<00:00:23.130><c> i</c><00:00:23.460><c> think</c><00:00:23.910><c> was</c><00:00:24.029><c> quite</c><00:00:24.240><c> hard</c><00:00:24.449><c> for</c><00:00:24.689><c> them</c><00:00:24.779><c> to</c>

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 align:start position:0%
I i think was quite hard for them to
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410 align:start position:0%
I i think was quite hard for them to
find<00:00:25.460><c> one</c><00:00:26.460><c> area</c><00:00:26.760><c> that</c><00:00:26.820><c> went</c><00:00:27.060><c> right</c><00:00:27.210><c> back</c><00:00:27.359><c> to</c>

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
find one area that went right back to
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.429 align:start position:0%
find one area that went right back to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
the beginning so I was certainly
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980 align:start position:0%
the beginning so I was certainly
surprised<00:00:29.090><c> you</c><00:00:30.090><c> know</c><00:00:30.210><c> I</c><00:00:30.240><c> think</c><00:00:30.510><c> that</c><00:00:30.689><c> in</c>

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 align:start position:0%
surprised you know I think that in
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.889 align:start position:0%
surprised you know I think that in
science<00:00:31.590><c> you</c><00:00:32.489><c> hardly</c><00:00:32.759><c> ever</c><00:00:32.850><c> have</c><00:00:33.210><c> a</c><00:00:33.360><c> Eureka</c>

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
science you hardly ever have a Eureka
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330 align:start position:0%
science you hardly ever have a Eureka
moment<00:00:33.930><c> you</c><00:00:34.590><c> have</c><00:00:34.680><c> lots</c><00:00:34.829><c> of</c><00:00:34.950><c> little</c><00:00:35.160><c> Eureka</c>

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
moment you have lots of little Eureka
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 align:start position:0%
moment you have lots of little Eureka
moments<00:00:35.940><c> like</c><00:00:36.630><c> I've</c><00:00:36.750><c> just</c><00:00:36.899><c> found</c><00:00:37.050><c> an</c><00:00:37.200><c> error</c><00:00:37.380><c> in</c>

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
moments like I've just found an error in
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 align:start position:0%
moments like I've just found an error in
a<00:00:37.590><c> program</c><00:00:38.040><c> or</c><00:00:38.250><c> will</c><00:00:38.850><c> that</c><00:00:39.000><c> leave</c><00:00:39.120><c> my</c><00:00:39.300><c> keys</c><00:00:39.570><c> or</c>

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
a program or will that leave my keys or
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.979 align:start position:0%
a program or will that leave my keys or
whatever<00:00:40.290><c> but</c><00:00:40.770><c> I</c><00:00:40.829><c> think</c><00:00:41.100><c> that</c><00:00:41.480><c> it's</c><00:00:42.480><c> much</c><00:00:42.690><c> more</c>

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 align:start position:0%
whatever but I think that it's much more
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.529 align:start position:0%
whatever but I think that it's much more
so<00:00:43.230><c> science</c><00:00:43.530><c> it's</c><00:00:43.620><c> sort</c><00:00:43.770><c> of</c><00:00:43.829><c> a</c><00:00:43.860><c> mixture</c><00:00:44.160><c> of</c>

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 align:start position:0%
so science it's sort of a mixture of
 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.299 align:start position:0%
so science it's sort of a mixture of
ideas<00:00:45.539><c> and</c><00:00:45.780><c> lots</c><00:00:45.960><c> of</c><00:00:46.020><c> hard</c><00:00:46.260><c> work</c><00:00:46.320><c> and</c><00:00:46.680><c> you</c><00:00:47.190><c> know</c>
