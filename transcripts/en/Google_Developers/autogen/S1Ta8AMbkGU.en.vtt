00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.600
 Varvara and Mar 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
 &lt;i&gt;(Barcelona)&lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.960
 We use technology and code as art materials 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.800
 Just like the sculptor uses clay as a material 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080
 In fact, this intangible material is extremely powerful. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.680
 Recently we used the phrase "we are creators" 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.960
 Our strange ideas 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.080
 Ask us to create a tool that didnâ€™t exist before 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000
 The reason we started to cooperate 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 Because it can make our creativity more complete. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.320
 Sometimes I will get inspiration 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.720
 But the inspiration is primitive and incomplete. 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.120
 So we worked together to shape the inspiration 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 We have different skills 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.960
 For example, I am very obsessed with electronics and welding. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.760
 Also like to use philosophical methods 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 And Marr is a programming genius. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.680
 I love the code very much. 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.880
 Think of the code as a craft 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.400
 One day without writing code, it will be uncomfortable the next day. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280
 Code can do everything 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.400
 Because the code is the soul of the computer 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.160
 Cooperation allows us to look at it from another angle 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.520
 Examine our work 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.440
 We use a lot of different brain-computer interfaces. This is called neural structure. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.560
 Is to create directly through the ideas in the mind 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.640
 In fact, through collaboration 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.520
 You will open your own world and open a new audience. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.480
 May even open new areas 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.520
 To us 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 The DevArt project is our first use of speech and interaction 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 The core concept is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 The interaction process is amazing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.040
 You just need to say your wish system and you can hear it. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.720
 Then a butterfly will magically appear 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 Just like making your wishes come true 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 After being appointed 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.960
 You will be working side by side with Varvara and Marl of the Barbican Art Centre in London. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.200
 The art of code creation
