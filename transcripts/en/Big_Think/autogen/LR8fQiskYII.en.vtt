oh boy that's a really tough question

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649
oh boy that's a really tough question
 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.940
oh boy that's a really tough question
it's kind of like asking one of what are

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
it's kind of like asking one of what are
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.199
it's kind of like asking one of what are
the five countries you should know about

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209
the five countries you should know about
 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.959
the five countries you should know about
if you're not interested in geology or

if you're not interested in geology or
 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.590
if you're not interested in geology or
geography or politics and the answer

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
geography or politics and the answer
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.940
geography or politics and the answer
varies depending what your actual

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950
varies depending what your actual
 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.860

and people learned a lot from those but

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
and people learned a lot from those but
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.799

these days it might be more important

that but managers kind of like it
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.969
that but managers kind of like it
because it looks like you're getting a

though in a different language it might
 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.619
though in a different language it might
only take five lines you know it's it's

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
only take five lines you know it's it's

a greater sense of accomplishment after
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.910
a greater sense of accomplishment after
the shoe leather but you know maybe

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
the shoe leather but you know maybe
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.280
the shoe leather but you know maybe
there's some downsides but it also

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
there's some downsides but it also
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.540
there's some downsides but it also

like it for that reason and for that
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.000
like it for that reason and for that
reason a lot of Java jobs have been

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
reason a lot of Java jobs have been
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.720

coming more from academia we have a

coming more from academia we have a
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.650
coming more from academia we have a
language like Haskell which we call a

language like Haskell which we call a
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080
language like Haskell which we call a
functional programming language that

functional programming language that
 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.860
functional programming language that
means function in a mathematical sense

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
means function in a mathematical sense
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.660
means function in a mathematical sense
not in the sense the other language that

is this kind of like Haskell and if so
 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.699
is this kind of like Haskell and if so
then you know you have to hire some

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709
then you know you have to hire some
