new developer features that we've added
 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.160
new developer features that we've added
in the webview on Android so more

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
in the webview on Android so more
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920
in the webview on Android so more
specifically Android 4.4 also known as

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
specifically Android 4.4 also known as
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.620
specifically Android 4.4 also known as
KitKat introduced an updated webview

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
KitKat introduced an updated webview
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.540
KitKat introduced an updated webview
which is actually built off the chromium

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
which is actually built off the chromium
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.119
which is actually built off the chromium
webview now and that brings a whole

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129
webview now and that brings a whole
 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.520
webview now and that brings a whole
range of new features for developers

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
range of new features for developers
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680
range of new features for developers
that's right anchor in fact what we've

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690
that's right anchor in fact what we've
 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420
that's right anchor in fact what we've
built now into the webview is all the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
built now into the webview is all the
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.580
built now into the webview is all the
functionality of Chrome so what that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
functionality of Chrome so what that
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350
functionality of Chrome so what that
means to you as a developer is that you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
means to you as a developer is that you
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.960
means to you as a developer is that you
have all the html5 capabilities that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970
have all the html5 capabilities that
 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.600
have all the html5 capabilities that
exist in Chrome shifted into the webview

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
exist in Chrome shifted into the webview
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.010
exist in Chrome shifted into the webview
so you can take advantage of modern

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
so you can take advantage of modern
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010
so you can take advantage of modern
html5 and all its API is just kind of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
html5 and all its API is just kind of
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.400
html5 and all its API is just kind of
nice

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
nice
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740
nice
absolutely so let's have a look at a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
absolutely so let's have a look at a
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.819
absolutely so let's have a look at a
demo

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
demo
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.319
demo
well before we should go into the demo I

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
well before we should go into the demo I
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.760
well before we should go into the demo I
just wanted to point out something that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
just wanted to point out something that
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380
just wanted to point out something that
one thing that's been really hard for me

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
one thing that's been really hard for me
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569
one thing that's been really hard for me
as developer is actually debugging stuff

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
as developer is actually debugging stuff
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340
as developer is actually debugging stuff
in a webview like I mean how do you do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
in a webview like I mean how do you do
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.600
in a webview like I mean how do you do
bug normally when you're building

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
bug normally when you're building
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.430
bug normally when you're building
Android applications I use Android

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440
Android applications I use Android
 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.890
Android applications I use Android
studio or eclipse right like I used to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
studio or eclipse right like I used to
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570
studio or eclipse right like I used to
as well but you know when I'm developing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
as well but you know when I'm developing
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789
as well but you know when I'm developing
on the desktop I use you know chrome dev

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
on the desktop I use you know chrome dev
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.320
on the desktop I use you know chrome dev
tools which really makes my life simple

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
tools which really makes my life simple
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.810
tools which really makes my life simple
and now you can actually do it from the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
and now you can actually do it from the
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370
and now you can actually do it from the
webview so why don't we just have a look

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
webview so why don't we just have a look
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.550
webview so why don't we just have a look
at how we actually go about doing that

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
at how we actually go about doing that
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.870
at how we actually go about doing that
what I have here is we have like a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
what I have here is we have like a
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270
what I have here is we have like a
little full you know full screen game

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
little full you know full screen game
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710
little full you know full screen game
and it's you know you hit the start

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
and it's you know you hit the start
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.750
and it's you know you hit the start
button here and what you have is like a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760
button here and what you have is like a
 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.190
button here and what you have is like a
ball that you can roll around okay so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
ball that you can roll around okay so
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990
ball that you can roll around okay so
it's a kind of a standard thing but what

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
it's a kind of a standard thing but what
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969
it's a kind of a standard thing but what
I'd like to point out here is that we're

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
I'd like to point out here is that we're
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460
I'd like to point out here is that we're
actually using the motion in the device

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
actually using the motion in the device
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.289
actually using the motion in the device
to control the ball we couldn't do that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
to control the ball we couldn't do that
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300
to control the ball we couldn't do that
before could we anchor no so this is now

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
before could we anchor no so this is now
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.130
before could we anchor no so this is now
the accelerometer and the the chromium

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
the accelerometer and the the chromium
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.490
the accelerometer and the the chromium
web view is is mapping that Hardware

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
web view is is mapping that Hardware
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.039
web view is is mapping that Hardware
accelerometer on your Android device

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049
accelerometer on your Android device
 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.330
accelerometer on your Android device
straight through to the webview itself

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
straight through to the webview itself
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.609
straight through to the webview itself
so this is a demo that that Alex you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
so this is a demo that that Alex you
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.539
so this is a demo that that Alex you
built and we're now this app here is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
built and we're now this app here is
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670
built and we're now this app here is
effectively it's a web app it's it's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
effectively it's a web app it's it's
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980
effectively it's a web app it's it's
just a thin wrapper of an app that drops

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
just a thin wrapper of an app that drops
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.460
just a thin wrapper of an app that drops
in a webview and it's a just logged into

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
in a webview and it's a just logged into
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.350
in a webview and it's a just logged into
your site isn't it exactly and so the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
your site isn't it exactly and so the
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.330
your site isn't it exactly and so the
beauty of this is that you know now we

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
beauty of this is that you know now we
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770
beauty of this is that you know now we
have this webview and in the old days

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
have this webview and in the old days
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.870
have this webview and in the old days
prior to KitKat you'd be thinking how do

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
prior to KitKat you'd be thinking how do
 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.240
prior to KitKat you'd be thinking how do
i do bug this it's really hard but

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
i do bug this it's really hard but
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.650
i do bug this it's really hard but
what I can do is and come over here to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
what I can do is and come over here to
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.590
what I can do is and come over here to
Chrome and I can just go over and have a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
Chrome and I can just go over and have a
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.540
Chrome and I can just go over and have a
look at chrome inspect if I go and have

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
look at chrome inspect if I go and have
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.340
look at chrome inspect if I go and have
a look at that you'll suddenly see the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350
a look at that you'll suddenly see the
 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.160
a look at that you'll suddenly see the
devices that are connected to my laptop

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
devices that are connected to my laptop
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.110
devices that are connected to my laptop
visible and here we actually see we've

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
visible and here we actually see we've
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.370
visible and here we actually see we've
got a nexus 10 running this application

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
got a nexus 10 running this application
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.650
got a nexus 10 running this application
at the moment and you can see the actual

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
at the moment and you can see the actual
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.260
at the moment and you can see the actual
webview itself so you know for Android

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
webview itself so you know for Android
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.610

developers you'd be familiar with this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
developers you'd be familiar with this
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.410
developers you'd be familiar with this
you know kondal Alex roller so that's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
you know kondal Alex roller so that's
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.449
you know kondal Alex roller so that's
the namespace my apps been developed in

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
the namespace my apps been developed in
 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.310
the namespace my apps been developed in
so all I have to do is click this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
so all I have to do is click this
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.830

identical to what happens on a desktop

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
identical to what happens on a desktop
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130
identical to what happens on a desktop
but now it's actually talking into the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
but now it's actually talking into the
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.990
but now it's actually talking into the
device and I can look at the Dom I can

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
device and I can look at the Dom I can
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.479
device and I can look at the Dom I can
break point JavaScript I can modify the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
break point JavaScript I can modify the
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.729
break point JavaScript I can modify the
Dom on the fly so then this is not a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739
Dom on the fly so then this is not a
 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.470
Dom on the fly so then this is not a
special build of your app right nice

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
special build of your app right nice
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420
special build of your app right nice
when you drag and release builds exactly

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
when you drag and release builds exactly
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.830
when you drag and release builds exactly
that's the beauty of it this is for any

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
that's the beauty of it this is for any
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.810
that's the beauty of it this is for any
app that uses the chrome webview now

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
app that uses the chrome webview now
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.720
app that uses the chrome webview now
which is fantastic so I can drill down

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
which is fantastic so I can drill down
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.000
which is fantastic so I can drill down
look in the Dom here and of course I can

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
look in the Dom here and of course I can
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.410
look in the Dom here and of course I can
see the start button but there's no

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
see the start button but there's no
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.420
see the start button but there's no
there's no game content you can see

the holes that the ball falls into
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.900
the holes that the ball falls into
they're a bit dark for me what do you

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
they're a bit dark for me what do you
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.360
they're a bit dark for me what do you

Alex I think you're right so why don't

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
Alex I think you're right so why don't
 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.819
Alex I think you're right so why don't
we do that why don't we actually change

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829
we do that why don't we actually change
 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.560
we do that why don't we actually change
the color that we're seeing so if I go

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570
the color that we're seeing so if I go
 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.810
the color that we're seeing so if I go
back up the top since I actually wrote

this I know what to look at but there's

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
this I know what to look at but there's
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.610
this I know what to look at but there's
my Senses SVG that's also a newer

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
my Senses SVG that's also a newer
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.740
my Senses SVG that's also a newer
feature of the chromium webview right

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
feature of the chromium webview right
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.870
feature of the chromium webview right
exactly right Viji support that's right

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
exactly right Viji support that's right
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.490
exactly right Viji support that's right
well we brought brought enos SVG support

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500
well we brought brought enos SVG support
 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.220
well we brought brought enos SVG support
I think it was honeycomb was the first

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230
I think it was honeycomb was the first
 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.270
I think it was honeycomb was the first
version that supported it but now the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280
version that supported it but now the
 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610
version that supported it but now the
webview actually has it and it has a you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620
webview actually has it and it has a you
 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.140
webview actually has it and it has a you
know and it flies so I've got these

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
know and it flies so I've got these
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.849
know and it flies so I've got these
gradients here that are used for the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859
gradients here that are used for the
 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.500
gradients here that are used for the
holes so if you have a look that he's

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
holes so if you have a look that he's
 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.120
holes so if you have a look that he's
this gradient that's black and gray

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130
this gradient that's black and gray
 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.460
this gradient that's black and gray
I might just decide that I'd prefer the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470
I might just decide that I'd prefer the
 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.529
I might just decide that I'd prefer the
holes to be blue you know start is blue

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539
holes to be blue you know start is blue
 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.240
holes to be blue you know start is blue
so if you actually watch as I change

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250
so if you actually watch as I change
 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.250
so if you actually watch as I change
that all the holes suddenly

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260
that all the holes suddenly
 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.440
that all the holes suddenly
change to blue so we're actually

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450
change to blue so we're actually
 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.690
change to blue so we're actually
modifying the live DOM and this is like

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700
modifying the live DOM and this is like
 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.060
modifying the live DOM and this is like
an incredible feature so the ball itself

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
an incredible feature so the ball itself
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.590
an incredible feature so the ball itself
let's go down to the ball let me have a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600
let's go down to the ball let me have a
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.170
let's go down to the ball let me have a
look you'll notice we have a chrome logo

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180
look you'll notice we have a chrome logo
 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.390
look you'll notice we have a chrome logo
there on the on the ball right see

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
there on the on the ball right see
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.710
there on the on the ball right see
that's a chrome logo spinning around

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720
that's a chrome logo spinning around
 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.140
that's a chrome logo spinning around
which is controlled by this image here

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150
which is controlled by this image here
 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.610
which is controlled by this image here
now I could actually just select it and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620
now I could actually just select it and
 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.880
now I could actually just select it and
delete it and lo and behold our ball has

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890
delete it and lo and behold our ball has
 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.320
delete it and lo and behold our ball has
become a blue ball because I've taken

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330
become a blue ball because I've taken
 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.910
become a blue ball because I've taken
away that image and this is like really

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920
away that image and this is like really
 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.040
away that image and this is like really
bad because now we can't tell the ball

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050
bad because now we can't tell the ball
 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.170
bad because now we can't tell the ball
from the holes so we can actually change

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
from the holes so we can actually change
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.060
from the holes so we can actually change
the color of that circle that is the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070
the color of that circle that is the
 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.040
the color of that circle that is the
ball and it becomes red and we can again

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
ball and it becomes red and we can again
 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.110
ball and it becomes red and we can again
see what it looks like so there you have
