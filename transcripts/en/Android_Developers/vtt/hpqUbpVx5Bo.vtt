00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.890
ROMAN NURIK: Let's
start that again.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.490
And for those of you watching
live, pardon the interruption.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
And for those of you that are
watching on YouTube after,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.430
during the recording, we
had a little kerfuffle.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.790
And it is now fixed.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.420
So anyway, thanks for joining
Android Design in Action.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.080
Once again, I'm your host,
Roman Nurik, joining from

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.280
Chelsea Market, our wonderful
new little recording studio

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.950
here in New York City.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.050
I'm joined today by
Nick Butcher.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.840
NICK BUTCHER: Hello,
from London.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.160
ROMAN NURIK: Hailing all
the way from London.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.220
And today we're going to talk
about football apps.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.090
And you know, the Super
Bowl just happened.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.130
So everybody's probably
thinking

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.570
American football apps.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.900
No, we're going to be talking
about the other kind of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.020
football, soccer or European
football, if you call it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.130
something else.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.630
NICK BUTCHER: Or if you're
anywhere in the rest of the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.570
world other than America,
just football.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.890
ROMAN NURIK: Right.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.380
Well, the Australians apparently
call it something

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.890
else, right?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.170
Oh, they call it
soccer as well.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.720
I don't know.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.820
Never mind.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.190
So we're going to talk about
football tracking apps.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.480
But we're really going to
talk about one app.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.412
We're going to look at an app
called Live Score Addicts.

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:02.180
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe
we should--

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.970
just to interject
a little bit--

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.350
I think, change from our regular
format, where we

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.630
normally work with the app
clinic, so the App Clinic will

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.790
take a look at a bunch
of applications

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.820
within a given topic.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.060
And then we'll turn our
attention to why and try and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.870
re-envisage how it might look
with the application of the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.360
Android design principles.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.330
We're mixing it up a
little bit here.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.300
And we're actually going
to go first.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.890
We're looking at one application
which has come

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.330
from the suggested topic
from the App Clinic.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.180
And then those guys are going
to take it from us and run

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.570
with some of our suggestions,
and go a little bit deeper

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.740
into some of the implementation
steps for the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.970
more developer crowd
out there.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.700
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.690
Good catch, Nick.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.670
So it is kind of a new format.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.060
If you're looking to nominate
your app to be reviewed at

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.950
some point on the App Clinic and
Android Design in Action,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.760
please still keep using the
Trello board for now.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.470
We're going to keep sourcing
stuff from there.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.840
And also, if it is a
self-nomination, if you're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.600
nominating your own app, please
make sure to state

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.520
that, because we want to make
sure that folks that are

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.680
nominating their own
app get precedence.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.280
So with that, we're also going
to talk about launcher icons,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.120
specifically the icons that
represent your application in

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.080
both the Play store on under
the Google Play client, as

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.860
well as on the web, as
well as on the device

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.910
once you install it.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.670
So with that, let's
get started.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.320
Wow, this tablet keeps
shutting off.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.480
So like I said, we're going to
talk about football apps, and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.150
specifically Live
Score Addicts.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.530
So let's get started.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.350
Nick, do you want to introduce
Live Score Addicts?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.490
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.450
So for anyone who is a football
or soccer fan, this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.780
is one of those applications
which lets you keep on top of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.460
fixtures and results,
essentially.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.820
It's quite a focused
application.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.500
It doesn't do the whole
gamut of news and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.520
everything around that.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.450
It's very much about keeping
track of what's just happened

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.070
or what's coming up, as well
as having quite a strong

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.440
during the game focus as well.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.260
So you might want to have this
application open, be receiving

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.600
notifications, and see what's
going on with the other teams

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.780
playing at the same time.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.100
And it's worth noting, actually,
the developers have

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.590
just put out a re-design.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.030
And I hear it's a great
improvement on the previous

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.120
look and feel of the
application.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.900
And I think they've done
a pretty decent job.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.980
But we've kind of done a little
deep-diving on some of

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.430
the fit and finish and polish
aspects of the application to

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.570
really make it shine, we feel.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.650
ROMAN NURIK: And just to
reiterate, any time we look at

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.170
an app and we provide
re-designs, we're not saying

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.280
that the app is currently
designed poorly or

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.250
anything like that.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.300
We're just exploring other ways
in which to present that

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
information.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.920
We do sometimes look at apps
that are worse, I guess,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.630
generally worse from an
aesthetic and UI standpoint.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.470
But we definitely don't mean to
say your app sucks, here's

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.810
a better version.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.190
It's purely just here are some
thoughts that they can use to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.440
improve the app.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.890
This is the first screen that
we're going to take a look at.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.400
We're going to take a look at
about three or four screens.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.620
This is basically the
onboarding process.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.530
And it's kind of a wizard, where
it takes you through the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.640
different leagues, and lets
you customize what are the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.969
things you want to see
in the app, what are

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:20.780
you interested in?

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.880
I'm guessing if you're a
football fan, you're not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.260
interested in every single
league out there, because

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.160
there are millions.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.520
Even just within the UK, there
are probably hundreds or

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.720
thousands or something.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.240
So you can really customize what
specific leagues you're

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240
interested in.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.565
And then in the later steps, you
actually get to customize

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:39.700
the notifications, which things
you want to be notified

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.070
of in the status bar.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.880
So we took a look
at this screen.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.850
And we thought, how can
we make it feel

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.960
a little more Androidy?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.760
And so we came up with a version
that's using a more

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.110
common wizard-like UI.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.360
And I posted some sample code
for this a few months ago.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.740
It was called wizard pager.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.220
So this is using some hints
from that wizard pager,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.570
including things like
having a bottom bar

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.970
for Next and Previous.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.640
It's worth noting here that
some folks think, there's

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.340
already a back button on the
device, why wouldn't

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.460
you just use that?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.680
Well, I actually had a talk
with our design team, our

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.750
Android User Experience team,
and they felt that, in this

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.590
case, this is actually one of
those really weird edge cases

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.000
where you don't actually want to
overload the back button to

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.160
go back in the wizard, since
you have a very apparent

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.980
onscreen next affordance.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.390
So Previous and Next at the
bottom, very similar to an OK,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.520
Cancel presentation
in dialogues.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.900
And then for indicating which
step you're looking at,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.910
there's this little strip at the
top that indicates you're

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.120
past step one, and now you're
looking at step two.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.170
And step two is highlighted
in green, which is

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.090
your current step.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.780
Additionally, we bumped up
the size of the imagery.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.010
And again, in general, we love
to make image concept larger,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.890
because it's a little
more engaging.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.100
And so we made the country
logo a little larger.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.790
We made the text a
little larger.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.060
And then we also used more
hollow style elements for the

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.340
check boxes and things
like that.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.760
So some very basic stuff.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.320
But overall, we kind of tweaked
the screen to more

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.060
prominently highlight
the content.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.880
Actually we had added an action
bar at the top that's

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.750
using a different palette, an
inverted palette, so that it

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.930
fades away and feels more like
the part of the system,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.290
Chrome, the system UI, rather
than part of the application

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.740
in this case, and a couple
things like that.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.750
Before we move on, Nick, is
there anything you wanted to

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.120
add to wizards or
onboarding flow?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.600
NICK BUTCHER: No, I just think
while it might seem like

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.940
there's very small changes in
the screen, for me it really

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.320
works, because the use of more
standard controls really makes

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.620
it a lot easier to appreciate
what's going on on this page.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.140
And that's very important when
you're talking about the very

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.410
first thing the user's going
to see when they first run

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.130
this application.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.200
You've got this small window of
time to convinced the user

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.480
that your application's easy to
use, and they want to keep

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.940
it, and it's going
to be useful.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.030
So I think the little bits
like using the standard

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.460
controls and making it
immediately obvious and easy

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.190
to pass the screen, as it were,
and understand what it's

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.610
offering you, really,
really help here.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.320
Better than this might
even be to offer some

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.440
kind of sensible defaults.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.500
So you might want to detect
which country they're in and

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.150
help them into some sensible
defaults, and then allow the

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.660
user to go through this
customization flow at a later

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.010
point, because it really is this
very, very crucial time,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.400
the first time a user
runs an app.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.160
So the visual changes here
for me are really great.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.170
I mean, the bar at the top on
the original, showing which

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.610
step you're currently on, didn't
really speak to me.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.535
It's a quite low contrast.

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.780
You're in the current step, and
there's repeated icons.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.580
ROMAN NURIK: Right, there's just
a little white sliver.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.210
And it's white on a tan
background, so the contrast is

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.750
very poor there.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.630
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and having
to move your thumb all the way

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.100
to the top corner to
hit Next and so on.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.310
So I think the small changes
that we've made really, really

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:07.210
make this screen much easier
to understand and to use.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.980
ROMAN NURIK: And one other thing
I wanted to mention is,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.930
in general, we actually have
a very good document in the

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.320
design guide that talks about
help as well as tutorials.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.280
So in general, the guidance
there is actually if a user

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.270
doesn't need to make a decision
immediately, if you

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.730
can just stick with a default,
and that's OK for 60%, 70% of

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.800
people, let them skip
the tutorial.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.380
You don't want to force them
to go through something.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.100
In this case, you could argue
that the user has to choose

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.730
what they're interested in,
because otherwise you won't be

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.220
able to present them any
sort of useful data.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.560
But as soon as you're done, as
soon as you're done specifying

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.050
the one thing you're
interested in,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.230
let the user skip.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.630
So find some way to
provide a skip or

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.550
get started now function.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.390
So let's move on to the next
screen which we looked at,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.570
which was the list of matches.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.350
And so on the left here, you
see the list of matches.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.560
And you'll notice that there's
actually a number of different

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.530
ways you can sort this.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.390
You can sort this
by the league.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.700
You can sort is by time, and a
number of different things.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.300
We'll show this on the next
screen, but there's also the

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.640
navigation drawer on the left.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.680
And we'll talk about
that in a bit.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.250
There is also this button here
that filters by only live now

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.540
matches, so only matches that
are currently live.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.860
And then you can swipe left and
right between yesterday

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.615
and tomorrow, as
well as today.

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:34.020
The issue I found with this is
that there's not actually a

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.980
yesterday minus 1 and a
yesterday minus 2 and so on.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.750
You can only see those
three days.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.520
It may be because of some sort
of policy thing, or maybe they

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.070
just don't have the data.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.210
But in that case, do you
really need a set of

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.790
scrollable tabs?

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.440
So what we decided to do here
was we kind of re-imagined

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.730
what it would look like with
just tabs in a slightly

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.810
different color scheme.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.400
We actually tweaked the color
scheme from a very deep

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.210
orangey brown to a slightly
more subdued brown.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.240
And then we used, I call it a
turf green, as the highlight,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.620
as the single accent that's
used throughout.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.970
So this darkish desaturated
brown combined with the green

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.180
gives it a more earthy,
a little more

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.600
simpler feel, I'd say.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.760
And then we also switched over
to the fixed tabs to show

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.990
yesterday, today,
and tomorrow.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.190
And again, you should
still be able to

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.120
swipe between the three.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.180
We also removed the navigation
drawer and switched to an

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.910
action bar spinner.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.980
And I'll talk about that
on the next slide.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.250
And then we used a slightly
different presentation for the

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.010
actual content, the actual
matches themselves.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.710
We slightly made the
live matches a

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.480
little bit more prominent.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.500
In that left column here, you'll
see that live matches

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.390
are kind of highlighted
in green.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.410
And then any time you have set
up notifications for an

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.930
individual match, if you decided
that I really want to

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.890
follow what happens in this
match, you see a little green

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.220
tick at the very top right.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.680
And it's not interactive.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.520
It's probably worth mentioning
that if you wanted to make

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.010
this interactive, have a
notification button right in

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.500
line with the list item, this
should look very different.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.820
But this is a very clear
signal that it's not

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.180
interactive, it's purely
an indicator.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.970
Again, we bumped up the country
flags a little bit,

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.460
just to make that pop a little
more, since that's probably

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.830
something that's going to get
your attention fairly quickly.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:40.270
And we used Roboto Light here,
as well as a Roboto Bold

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.460
Condensed to show the actual
current scores.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.480
So I know that was a whammy.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.750
Is there anything else you
wanted to mention, Nick, on

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.460
the screen?

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.680
NICK BUTCHER: It's got some
room to breathe now.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.680
I think that the last screen,
the before version, as it

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.620
were, tried to stuff a lot of
content into the screen.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.490
And in doing so, made it
less [? plausible. ?]

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.860
I find it quite hard to find
the individual event I'm

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860
looking for.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.370
So in the re-imagining, I really
like the way that you

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:14.640
used space and color and
contrast to really give a

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.240
hierarchy to the information,
so it's really easy to find

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.810
the section you're looking
for, then the game you're

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.120
looking for, or things that
are important, like a goal

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.930
that's just scored, or a game
that's on now really jump out.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.680
So I think the information
hierarchy is really what

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.380
stings here for me.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.720
ROMAN NURIK: And I think one of
the biggest contrasts here

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.980
is the information density.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.560
You'll see on the left in
the current screen, the

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.470
information density
is very high.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.290
You can see a lot of matches
all at once.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.570
But I mean, my guess is, in
general, if you're a fan

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.340
following just a few games that
are happening now, you

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.750
probably don't really care about
all that information.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.690
You probably do you care about
the two or three current

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.840
games, as well as maybe
a specific league

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.200
that has games today.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.570
So don't be afraid of letting
your content breathe by

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.670
increasing margins, increasing
spacing, and slightly lowering

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.060
information density.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.730
It'll make things a little more
readable, as well as make

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.770
your content a little more
consumable, and just overall

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.610
improve the aesthetic
in general.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.440
So let's move on to the
next screen which I

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.140
wanted to talk about.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.690
And this is the navigation
drawer versus

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.920
the action bar spinner.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.730
So the navigation drawer here
provides you access to things

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.640
like matches, competitions, and
teams, which are the three

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.590
top level structural elements,
as well as settings and more.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.020
And this is something that we
pointed out in the last

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.960
episode in the Hangout.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.150
Things like Settings or Help
or About, or even just more

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.140
stuff, they generally don't
belong immediately on screen

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.660
or in the primary
navigation area.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.350
And we've specifically outlined
that things like

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.310
Settings, Help, About, Terms
of Service, Privacy Policy,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.680
those should really belong in
the action bar overflow.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.030
So when you press this action
bar overflow here in the

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.020
action bar, you should see
things like Settings

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.770
and Help and About.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.350
So we would probably move things
like that to there.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.620
So if you remove Settings and
More, you're just left with

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.220
three items.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.100
And with only three items
to choose from, three

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.020
navigational components, the
navigation drawer becomes a

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.890
little bare.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.390
And so what you could do instead
is you could either

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.550
use tabs or an action
bar spinner.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.860
In this case, we're already
using tabs to switch between

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.300
yesterday, today,
and tomorrow.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.990
And so we decided to switch to
the action bar spinner as the

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:44.070
top level core structural
navigational component.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.300
And so there you can switch
between matches,

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.195
competitions, and teams.

00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:52.640
And it makes clear the three
main sections of the app.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.330
So let's move on to the next
screen that we looked at,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.730
which was the match
detail screen.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.210
And in the match detail
screen, we

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.240
looked at a couple things.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.120
Specifically, we looked
at the Statistics tab.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.870
We also looked at just the
presentation of the current

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.440
game state.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.080
So on the left you'll notice
that you have the position

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.780
title strip, or the scrollable
tabs at the top and then the

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.090
content at the bottom.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.460
And then somewhere in the middle
is actually a fixed

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.080
pane, or I guess a fixed UI
element, that indicates the

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.510
current state of the game.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.220
And so as you're swiping left
and right on the content or on

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.310
the top scrollable tabs, the
middle part stays fixed.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.740
But the top and bottom actually
slide together.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.560
And so it kind of loses that
feeling of connectivity, or

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.710
almost like this tactile feeling
that you're actually

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.030
moving a single surface.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.280
And so what we decided to do
is actually flip the two.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.840
And we moved the scrollable
tabs below that

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.000
fixed pane at the top.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.630
We also tweaked the presentation
to, again, kind

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.700
of fall in with our
color scheme of

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.880
that brown and green.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.330
And we also used basic text
contrast, like dark on accent

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.530
or white on accent to, again, I
guess, more prominently show

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.330
the visual hierarchy
of the information.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.890
The most important thing on the
screen right now is the

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.530
current score--

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.290
2 to 1--

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:28.200
as well as ulterior elements,
such as the names of the

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.120
teams, as well as the
current time.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.970
And then we took a look
at statistics.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.440
How can we make statistics
look better in general?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.270
Not much to say here.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.080
We just, again, used the
same color scheme.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.210
We simplified everything into
a single row of information.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.580
You'll notice that on the left
you have a row indicating the

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.370
details, and then a row
for the progress bar--

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.640
not really the progress bar,
I guess the stats bar.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.276
We simply integrated the two
into a single row, so that

00:16:55.276 --> 00:16:58.140
it's much easier to scan.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.710
So that was a doozy.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.620
Nick, anything you
want to add here?

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.650
NICK BUTCHER: No, you summed
it up pretty nicely.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.230
Yeah, I think the presentation
really works much better.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.670
It's a lot more glanceable.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.380
You can just kind of have a
glance at it and see which way

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.310
the game is going
by the stats.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.910
As well, yeah, I completely
agree about connecting the

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.119
pager title script to the
actual view pager.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.740
It felt quite disconnected
before on the before version

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.819
when you're moving the body of
the content, and there's a

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.300
stationary bit between you
and the tab strip moving.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.104
It felt disconnected.

00:17:28.104 --> 00:17:30.600
So it's a good change there.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.930
ROMAN NURIK: Another thing I'll
mention is that in the

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.350
previous, or in the current
details for the game, like

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.110
what's the current game state,
you'll see that there's a

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.610
little notification icon.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.860
It's not interactive, so
it's not really useful.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.550
It's just an indicator saying
that, yes, you have

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.320
notifications turned on
for this game or not.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.130
So we actually made that an
action bar icon, so that when

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.680
you touch that it toggles the
state of whether or not you

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.930
want notifications
for the game.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.920
So let's move to the
next screen, which

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.270
is the tablet mock-up.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.210
And Nick, do you want to
talk about this one?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.590
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.720
So here we've really focused
on the in-game experience.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.720
We figured that tablet is mostly
going to be used if you

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.910
sat at home, you're watching the
game already, and you're

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.440
wanting to have a second
screen experience.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.020
So what we've tried to do here
is float up all the different

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.750
sections on the phone version,
or in a view pager type setup

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.600
onto a single, kind of
[? higher ?] single dashboard.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.000
So as Roman pointed out, the
most important thing on the

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.120
screen is the current score,
what's going on.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.020
So we've made that very, very
big and bold, and very clear,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.170
exactly what's going on.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.130
You can't really miss
the current score

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.130
on this screen here.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.200
And the rest of the information,
we have this

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.050
horizontally scrollable.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.200
So you can actually flick
around and see

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.890
what's going on.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.690
Are some new videos
being posted?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.810
How has the live
table changed?

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.740
I didn't quite finish
the line-up here.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.640
But you can click in to see
some of the line-up, who's

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.300
playing in the roster.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.940
So we've really tried to use the
extra real estate to kind

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.660
of make the information easier
to get at, and a bit more

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.168
playful and visual than the
phone view pager set-up, but

00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:14.632
while retaining the most
important information on the

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:17.080
screen the whole time.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.040
ROMAN NURIK: And I think that
the addition of the logos for

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.160
the teams is also another way
to use visual elements to

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.660
better hint at what's
going on.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.880
So you could do even
more here.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.420
You could do things like take
the team logos and use them in

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.810
the background, like
in a blurry state.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.400
You could really make this
really immersive.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.750
And I think this is
a great start.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.160
This is a great way to start
showing all the different

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.840
pieces, almost like a game
dashboard all at once on a

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.090
tablet when you have
a larger screen.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.660
All right, so in the interest of
time, let's move on to rich

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.580
notification.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.070
And this is something that
Chris Banes put together.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.640
And unfortunately, he
wasn't able to join,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.375
which kind of sucks.

00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:01.200
He should definitely
join next time.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.270
But this is an example of
expanded notification.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.930
Let's say you turn on
notifications for a specific

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.100
game and something happens.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.410
And let's say you
then expand it.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.930
So here's what it
can look like.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.880
And this is using the
custom layout.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.980
Again, you have different
options for each

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.610
notifications.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.600
You can just show photo
or more text.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.570
But you can also provide a
custom layout entirely.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.670
And so this is an example of
what that can look like.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.750
You still use the app icon, to
some degree, to indicate that

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.790
you're looking at the Live
Score Addicts app.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.190
And so that's what that little
soccer ball icon means.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.010
But you also show the most
important information first,

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.300
which is the current score,
as well as what

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.970
was the latest score.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.520
In the 20th minute--

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.750
I'm going to butcher
his name-- is

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.650
it Popescu or Popeshu?

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.450
In the 20th minute, this guy
scored a goal, which is great

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.200
information to see as soon as
you expand that notification.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.150
NICK BUTCHER: This is
a great start to it.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.900
There's a lot of potential for
the rich notifications in

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.610
things like sports updates.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.330
You want to have the information
quickly.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.120
But if you can have that much
richer visual way of

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.160
delivering it, I think
users are going to be

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.910
delighted by that.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.570
I think that's something they're
going to see and

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.420
really, really jump on about
your application.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.440
So I think there's a lot of
stuff you could do here.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.940
And we're playing around
with some ideas.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.740
And we talked about maybe having
a freeze frame of the

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.818
goal or a celebration as the
[? picture ?] payload for the

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:28.360
rich notification.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.680
There's a lot of things that
you could do with an

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.840
application here, which I'm
quite excited about.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.460
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.570
Any time you can use photos,
any time you have access to

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.710
photo content, showing it there,
or even a thumbnail

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.820
still from a video
is really useful.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.600
And if you show a video, you
can even do something like

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.460
overlay a fake play icon to
indicate that this is a video.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.180
So definitely use all
the content that you

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.020
have to your advantage.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.730
And rich notifications,
it's really easy.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.560
All you need to do is use
notification compat, provide

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.630
some intent, and you're set.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.140
So there's no reason
not to do it.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.940
Let's move on in the
interest of time.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.500
So that was it for football apps
and Live Score Addicts.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.910
Let's jump into Launcher
Icons.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.120
And I think we're running a
little low on time, since we

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.420
had that little kerfuffle
in the beginning.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.240
But we'll try to zoom
through this.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.850
So Launcher Icons.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.310
Basically the Android Design
Guide has a little bit about

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.510
icons in general.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.650
So an icon is a graphic that
takes up a small portion of

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.650
screen real estate, provides a
quick intuitive representation

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.960
of an action, a status,
or your app.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.000
So really in the space of 48 by
48 dips, you have to make

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.120
the best use of that space to
represent what your app does,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.170
what it means.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.350
And whether that's an icon
representing your brand, if

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.070
you have an existing service,
or if it's a utility app in

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.570
that space, try as best as
possible to represent what the

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.180
user will benefit from once
they use your app.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.210
So one example is there was a
little side project that I

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.810
worked on that was
just basically a

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.610
single text box notepad.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.560
And the icon was literally
just the text box.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.880
It showed a little cursor, and
it showed the text box.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.170
So you can do things
like that.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:04.350
You don't necessarily have to
use this synecdoche to take

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.940
this very abstract idea and
compress it down into a single

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.450
little object.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.260
But certainly that's
one possible way.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.470
So let's look at some guidelines
on Launcher Icons.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:21.630
Again, the actual asset size
is 48 by 48 dips In XHDPI,

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.370
that's 96 by 96.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.890
For tablets, for Nexus 10
specifically, you should

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:33.420
provide an XXHDPI icon, and
that's 144 by 144 pixels.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.850
Also, when you upload your app
to Google Play, it requests a

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.620
large app icon so that it can
show it in all its beautiful

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.930
glory on tablets and
phones and so on.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.240
And that should be 512
by 512 pixels.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.760
And generally what we've found
is you can probably start by

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.750
designing a 512 by 512.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.050
I actually use 576 by 576,
for some reason.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:58.990
But you can start with that,
and then slowly scale down.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.420
It's generally a good idea to
start large and scale down,

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.820
rather than vice versa.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.000
And then in terms of padding,
this is something that's

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.890
definitely changed over
the years for Android.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.620
We used to request a fairly
large padding region.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.350
But these days, you should
really just use either the

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.110
full image size, meaning no
padding, or if you have a

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.830
very, very square icon, then try
to use about three dips of

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.550
padding, give or take.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.360
It's really up to you.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.800
But in general, try to make it
fit in nicely with the rest of

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.250
the system icons, as well
as third party icons.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.450
And those are generally going
to take up the full image

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.400
size, or have about one to
three dips of padding.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.140
Before we move on and fly
through this, Nick, any other

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.980
comments on launchers?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.062
NICK BUTCHER: No, you're
nailing it.

00:24:44.062 --> 00:24:44.530
Go for it.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.010
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
let's do it.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.820
So a couple more guidelines.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.120
Try to use a distinct
silhouette.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.540
So don't just stick some
graphic inside of

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.720
a square or a circle.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.450
That can work for now.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.610
It can work as a default.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.350
But try to really use a
distinct silhouette.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.070
And we'll show good examples
of that in a bit.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.330
Also, keep it simple
at the top.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.420
Make sure that your icon, when
it's scaled down, it still

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.730
means something. it
still makes sense.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.610
But at the very micro level,
feel free to add details, like

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.330
noise or subtle drop shadows,
and things like

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.270
that, as you see fit.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.970
And then, very important,
don't try

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.450
to mimic other platforms.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.310
So if you have an existing app
on Windows Phone, or an iPhone

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.310
iOS, don't just simply
copy over your icon.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.990
It's OK to copy over the general
idea for the icon.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.640
But make sure that it fits
well with the rest of the

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.750
system and fits in with
the guidelines.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.400
Actually, before we look at
some examples, we recently

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.010
made changes to the guidelines
in the sense that it used to

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.480
be just facing forward.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.100
You should make your icon
facing forward.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.825
But now there's a slight
3D prospective.

00:25:44.825 --> 00:25:46.540
And you'll see some
examples here.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.010
There's just a few dips of
perspective that you see at

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.900
the very top.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.400
And here's the rough kind of
camera angle you can use to

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.140
achieve that.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.970
We don't have any numbers or
dimensions or anything.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.720
But somebody asked
for the numbers.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.500
This is the best we
could do for now.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.110
But here's roughly what it
should look like if you're

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.685
doing this in a piece of
3D editing software.

00:26:05.685 --> 00:26:08.220
And here's some not
good examples yet.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.550
We're not there yet.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.950
Some tools that can help you
with icon generation, there's

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.960
the Android asset studio, which
I'm sure many of you are

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.800
familiar with.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.260
It could actually just generate
icons for you, just

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.140
to start with.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.810
You should probably, when you're
ready to ship your

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:25.790
product, definitely hire a
designer and have them do a

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.610
custom icon for you that has a
distinct silhouette that is

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.340
very, very unique to your app.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.170
That's going to really make it
pop when users are scanning

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.940
Google Play.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.260
As well as the boiler plates
that are provided for free by

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.680
androidicons.com.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.880
So they also give you circle
and square icons.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.600
But using those basic shapes,
you can change it to whatever

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.730
silhouette you need.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.140
The good thing about these is
that it actually has that

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.710
correct perspective and correct
styling, actually

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.700
correct example styling, that
you can use, as well as

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.700
different sizes.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.980
They actually provide the 512
by 512, as well as all the

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.180
different smaller sizes that
are shown on the device.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.240
And finally, here we're at a
few examples of icons that

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.930
follow our guidelines.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.860
So Falcon Pro is an example.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.310
And they show a slight
perspective above the kind of

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.700
futuristic bird-like creature.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.900
Pageonce uses a very
basic circle.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.950
But that's their app icon.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.580
That's their branding.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.900
It's very circular.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.400
Pocket, which does something
interesting with the

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:30.725
prospective.

00:27:30.725 --> 00:27:33.130
They actually show their
brand colors in the

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.820
depth of that square.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.820
Expedia, which is one
of my favorites.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.710
And this is, again, a very
distinct silhouette.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.090
It's a briefcase, effectively.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.850
But it shows their branding
really well.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.420
And that briefcase, again, is
tilted at just the right

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.150
perspective.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.450
We also have some good examples
from a Google I/O

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.450
app, which we've open-sourced,
as well as Solid Explorer,

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.600
which is a file explorer app.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.310
And again, it's a folder
that's slightly open.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.010
And has that very slight
perspective at the top.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.490
All right, so I think that was
it for launcher icons.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.290
NICK BUTCHER: I just--

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.030
And I think this is one of the
most important assets that you

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.420
put in your entire application,
users will judge

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.360
your application when you're
scanning a list of

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.200
applications in the Play store
on your icon, almost, alone.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.790
So if you do, definitely work
with a designer, and make sure

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.920
they understand these guidelines
that we put out,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.710
because this is such
an important asset.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.110
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we probably
should have mentioned that at

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.850
the very beginning.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.940
But if you have to
hire a designer

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.380
just to do your icon--

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.830
and a lot of designers are
actually just icon designers.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.090
They don't do UI and
things like that--

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.750
it's definitely worth
the investment.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.040
This is something that users
will see immediately.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.890
If it stands out in the store
listening, in the search

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.050
results, if it stands out, then
that's going to be well

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.890
worth the conversions
that you get.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.070
So moving on to Design News.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.750
And again, we're
way over time.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.890
But I think this is actually
pretty good for our scheduling

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:00.670
kerfuffle--

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.480
not a scheduling kerfuffle,
but the kerfuffle that

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.520
happened with our technology
in the beginning.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.590
So for Design News we have
only a few things.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.760
So speaking of Launcher Icons,
Michael Cook has actually

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.700
provided some PSDs of a
couple example icons.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.827
And it's very similar to the
boiler plates, in the sense

00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:21.340
that you can drop in your
stuff and tweak it in

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.290
Photoshop as you see fit.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.700
And that's the link there.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.900
You can download it, and I'm
guessing it's free of charge

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.710
and all that.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.640
Next, we have--

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.720
NICK BUTCHER: Thank you,
Michael, yeah.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.910
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, thank
you, Michael.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.870
Next actually, I wanted to
highlight one of the designs

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.770
from the Google+ community, the
Android Design community.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.900
So Rajesh Handa, sorry if I
mispronounced your name.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.600
But Rajesh actually has been
posting a whole bunch of

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.760
different examples,
design concepts,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.670
to the Google+ community.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.150
And I think some of them
are really wonderful.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.040
This specific one has a really
unique color palette.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.030
And I think it's just
really well done.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.290
The information that you're
currently looking at, the most

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.480
important information, the unit
conversion, converting

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.790
between kilometers and meters,
for example, that pops

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:06.270
immediately.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.660
Nothing else has as much
contrast as that.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.830
And I think that's just one of
the better designs we've seen

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.650
from the community.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.255
And also, there's a little drag
handle on the left, so

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:19.250
you could switch between
converting from kilometers to

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.500
meters very easily.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:28.450
And I think the last piece of
Design News is we talk a lot

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.590
about apps on the show.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.590
But we don't really
talk about games.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.500
And that's because usually games
have their own very,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.130
very custom bespoke UI.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.050
And this is an example of a
puzzle game that uses lots and

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.100
lots of hollow elements.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.690
And it even uses the hollow
color palette in a really

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:46.850
successful way.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.860
So I just wanted to point out
that if you're building a

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.540
game, especially a puzzle game
or a brain teaser, things like

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.720
that, you don't have to have
your own custom UI.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.980
You can definitely succeed
still with hollow.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.080
So I just wanted to point that
out and put it out there for

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.160
you all to check out.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.580
Anything else that we missed,
Nick, before we sign off?

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.710
NICK BUTCHER: No, no, I think
that's covered it.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.150
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.800
So thanks again for joining.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.410
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.490
NICK BUTCHER: And bye from
me, Nick Butcher.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.780
ROMAN NURIK: And we will see you
hopefully next week, where

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.490
Adam will join us once again.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.600
Adam actually couldn't make
it today, because of

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.080
some stuff at home.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.240
Oh, wait, he's on vacation.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.700
That's right.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.600
But yes, so hopefully we'll
join in next week.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.180
As always, see you next time on
Android Design in Action.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.430
NICK BUTCHER: And remember to
tune in to the App Clinic this

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.660
Friday, as well, to see what
those guys do with some of

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.280
these football score
apps as well.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.660
ROMAN NURIK: That's right.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.430
See you all, thanks
for joining.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:46.867
