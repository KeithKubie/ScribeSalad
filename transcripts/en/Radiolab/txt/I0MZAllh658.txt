Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab, radio lab from w.N y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Alright, so for this podcast I want to talk about my kid. Uh, his name is a meal. This is him right here. Oh by the way, I do plan to make this interesting to people who don't have kids cause I was just one of those people two months ago. So bear with me. But uh, OK. A meal, he's two months old,

Speaker 2:          00:33          he still in the Munchkin phase and he's just starting to tune in the world. So there are these moments like yesterday for example, where he gets real quiet and he just stares at me. It's kind of amazing actually, but it also kind of presents an interesting question which I want to explore right here. In fact, you can't avoid it. You're just staring at this thing and you're like [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:04          what is this little creature experiencing? Like here is a little human being that is brand new in the world. What does the world look like to a tiny baby? What does it smell like? What does it sound like? And I have to find somebody who could help me or at least begin to answer these questions. Okay. Hello. Hi Jad. Hi. Is this Charles? Yes, that's right. Good to talk to you. Charles. Before we get started, can I just have you introduce yourself so I can get your name right? Okay. Hi, my name is Charles Fernie Ho on a writer and developmental psychologist from Dharma University. And back when Charles had his first child at Dina, he decided to tackle that question of what is it like, what's going on for this little person as a dad, you know, as a, as an Austrac new dad, but also as a scientist.

Speaker 1:          01:52          So he wrote a book called a thousand days of wonder. Scientists Chronicle, if his daughter's developing mind, amazing book where he basically goes through what we do and don't know about what's happening in the minds. A little babies when they're brand new. So I put the scenario to him. Okay, meal's brand new. Oh, when I'm sitting there holding him and we're staring at each other, what exactly is he seeing? One difference that does relate to their visual system is that they're, the lens of their eye is absolutely crystal clear. Whereas your Lens, my Lens is because they're of a certain age, they've become slightly yellowed, so they filter out some of the blue frequencies of the light that we see, so we paint the picture out. What would that be like for them? I mean this is my, my stab at imagining what this would be like. If you can imagine being in a Greek village in the summer

Speaker 3:          02:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:43          that name Sun is directly overhead and it's one of those villages where everything is white. You need the houses are all painted white, you're wearing sunglasses and you suddenly take off those sunglasses.

Speaker 4:          03:02          It's not bright. Yeah. I think light is a big as probably the biggest shock to newborn babies,

Speaker 1:          03:09          but it's interesting to consider did that blinding Hayes of whiteness might actually be how the world really is. We just don't see it in any case. Then I asked him about sound. Do babies hear things differently than adults the same way they see things differently? And he said, yeah, we think so. We think they hear Echo.

Speaker 5:          03:29          Yeah. The echoes are actually there.

Speaker 4:          03:31          Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          03:33          But our brains filter them out. But it takes some time for them to learn to do that. Um, I mean the science behind it, it's quite complicated and like, I don't think I could explain it now, but, um, it's to do with the relative times of arrival that the, that the sound makes on the, uh, the two years. But the brain basically has to, has to learn to make this adjustment. They can't do it straight away. And so a newborn baby's hearing, we guess, we don't know for sure, again, because we can't know what it's like, but we guessed that babies hear things in a very echoey way,

Speaker 1:          04:12          but it gets even stranger. Tell me about the, uh, the experiment with the babies and the brain cap.

Speaker 5:          04:16          Yeah. I described the study that was done with, um, babies where they were taking EEG measurements and these are the kind of measurements that you get when you put a net of 16 or so electrodes over the scalp. And these electrodes pick up the very small electrical changes that go on as your brain works and it's a perfectly safe, harmless procedure which you can do with very young babies. Well, usually when you do these studies, you can see the way c see the way in which particular parts of the brain respond to different kinds of stimulus.

Speaker 1:          04:50          In an adult brain he says if you show someone a picture, you will see a little bit of electricity towards the back of their brain.

Speaker 5:          04:58          If on the other hand you heard a sound, then the bit of your brain sort of slightly further forward from that, the auditory cortex would fire and you wouldn't see any in the

Speaker 1:          05:07          visual cortex because different parts of the brain have different jobs. But what happened with these babies is that things got very strange like the researchers with show them a bunch of pictures like boop, here's a circle, boop, here's a cross. And often things would work as they were supposed to. They would see like a little spark in the back of the baby's brain where vision is processed. Sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes when they showed them, most say a cross division part would be silent, but they'd see a spark in the auditory cortex, the hearing part of the brain. So the picture would trigger a sound in their head. We don't know what it triggered in their head for them subjectively, but we do know that a part of the brain that shouldn't have fired did fine. They were hitting me w w what you're saying, but not quite allowing to pass through your list. It they were hearing

Speaker 5:          05:58          the picture but we don't, we don't know what they heard but it's a good basis for saying that when a newborn brain is developing these different wirings that lead information into different parts of the brain, it's still taking shape.

Speaker 2:          06:16          It might be, he says it inside a meal's brain right now at two months. All of his senses are in a big synesthetic, not so that when he hears my voice, maybe he sees flashes of color or maybe when he looks at the wall he hears tones or maybe when light comes in through the window he tastes it like salt or something. I don't know. I mean that's the thing. We can't, and I mean there's really strong philosophical grounds for being skeptical there. I mean, actually I can't know that anybody is conscious.

Speaker 3:          06:49          Wait,

Speaker 5:          06:50          what does that mean? I can't know that you're conscious but, but I'm talking to you. Sure you are. But you know, you could be a really smart Zombie. You could be a robot. You know, I can't see you. You're 5,000 miles away. I mean, it may be that I'm the only person in the University of his conscious. Huh. We tend to, you know, the vast majority of us tend to say, well, he looks like me and he talks like me and he thinks like me and he perceives like me, so he's going to be like me. But it is a leap of faith.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Then I told him about the, uh, the stair, how, you know, just in the last little bit, and Emil has started to really stare at us and we stare back and it's, that's not a leap of faith. That's for real. And he, um, you told me something really depressing

Speaker 5:          07:36          in those first couple of months. The visual system is controlled by the subcortical regions and they're kind of the old bits of the brain. The cortex is the relatively new evolution. You're only speaking the relatively new part of the brain that surrounds the whole thing and there's a switch between one kind of control system, the sub-cortical system and the cortical systems, but as the handover happens, and this is happening at about two months, it's probably there's, it'd be interesting to know if he's doing this now. As the handover happens, there is a kind of struggle for power and the subcortical regions which were controlling vision can have, don't immediately want to cede power to the cortical regions so the baby loses control, temporarily loses control of where he or she is looking because of this struggle for power, really the scientists called a sticky fixation and it's where a baby will just keep staring at you. It's as if the baby can't take his eyes off.

Speaker 1:          08:32          Yes, this is what's happening now you're telling me this is a brain glitch.

Speaker 5:          08:35          She's quite a well-documented phenomenon and it's bad news for the parents who think that their babies get gazing. Gazing at them. Adore and Ah, cause actually they just kind of, they don't know where to look. They can't control where they're looking. They don't know how to look away basically. Ah, depressing. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:49          this might actually be one of those cases where ignorance really is bliss because the truth is you have to, you

Speaker 2:          08:56          have to make that leap of faith, or at least you have to believe whatever it is. You have to believe so that when he looks at you and you look back at him, you smile. Because eventually that will teach this little dude how the world works, that humans operate on relationships, which are these feedback loops, which, okay, at this moment in time for him or not real,

Speaker 6:          09:21          they will be soon.
