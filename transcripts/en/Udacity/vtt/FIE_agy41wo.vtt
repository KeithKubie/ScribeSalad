00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.020
One single letter variation can be the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.680
sole difference, from two people consuming the same

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.270
amount of alcohol. The same input, but

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.070
only one person shows the alcohol flush reaction,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.260
while the other person doesn't. We have

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.550
the same input, but a different output. And

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.210
all due to a difference in the genetic

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.540
code. In theory, this phenomenon exists for virtually

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.130
any drug that humans interact with not just

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.390
alcohol. While pharmacology is defined as the science of

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.570
drug, that deals with their composition uses and

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.780
effects. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how a person's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.340
genome affects the way they respond to drugs.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.940
The goal of pharmacogenomics is to learn ahead of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.490
time, what the best drug, or the best does of a drug would be for a person.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.380
To better catalog new information that

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.110
is uncovered all the time. The pharmacogenomics

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.100
knowledge base or pharmGKB was founded and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.220
created as an interactive tool for researchers

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.200
to investigate how genetic variation affects drug

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.910
response. Both with regards to pharmacodynamics and

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.320
pharmacokinetics. Simply type in the name of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950
a gene that affects the pharmacokinetic or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.340
dynamic effect of a drug. And pull up the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.110
entry describing what is known about it. Here you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.260
can see right here, the very allele that we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.700
just learned about. Position 1510 of the coding region

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.600
that changed from guanine to adenine. We can even

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.010
see the SNV varient with the SNV ID, rs671.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.780
And we can click on that variant and see

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.275
exactly what the change is. Glutamate to Lysine. We can

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:46.920
even use PharmGKB to search for drugs. We should have a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.780
lot more information for us about the drug and its affects on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.430
the body. As well as all the alleles that affect its pharmacokinetics

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.010
and pharmacodynamics. We'll learn more about Warfarin later in the lesson.
