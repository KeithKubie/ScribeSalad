00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.520
"The laws of nature are but the
mathematical thoughts of God."

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.900
And this is a quote by
Euclid of Alexandria,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.570
who was a Greek mathematician
and philosopher who

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.230
lived about 300
years before Christ.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.080
And the reason why
I include this quote

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.220
is because Euclid is considered
to be the father of geometry.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.450
And it is a neat quote.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.340
Regardless of your views of
God, whether or not God exists

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.250
or the nature of God,
it says something

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.130
very fundamental about nature.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.080
The laws of nature are but the
mathematical thoughts of God.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.760
That math underpins all
of the laws of nature.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.440
And the word geometry
itself has Greek roots.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.600
Geo comes from Greek for Earth.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.736
Metry comes from
Greek for measurement.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:45.110
You're probably
used to something

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.680
like the metric system.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.620
And Euclid is considered to
be the father of geometry

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.350
not because he was the first
person who studied geometry.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.240
You could imagine the very
first humans might have studied

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.920
geometry.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.170
They might have looked at
two twigs on the ground that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.880
looked something
like that and they

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.320
might have looked at
another pair of twigs

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.460
that looked like that and
said, this is a bigger opening.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.710
What is the relationship here?

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
Or they might have
looked at a tree that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.529
had a branch that
came off it like that.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:14.320
And they said, oh
there's something similar

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.970
about this opening here
and this opening here.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.630
Or they might have asked
themselves, what is the ratio?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.320
Or what is the relationship
between the distance

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.640
around a circle and
the distance across it?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.970
And is that the same
for all circles?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.960
And is there a way for
us to feel really good

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.200
that that is definitely true?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140
And then once you got
to the early Greeks,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.240
they started to get even
more thoughtful essentially

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.800
about geometric things when you
talk about Greek mathematicians

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.710
like Pythagoras, who
came before Euclid.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.520
But the reason why
Euclid is considered

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.200
to be the father of
geometry, and why we often

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.695
talk about Euclidean
geometry, is around 300

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.520
BC-- and this right over
here is a picture of Euclid

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.471
painted by Raphael.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.470
And no one really knows
what Euclid looked like,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.090
even when he was
born or when he died.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.680
So this is just
Raphael's impression

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.770
of what Euclid might
have looked like when

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.700
he was teaching in Alexandria.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
But what made Euclid
the father of geometry

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.550
is really his writing
of Euclid's Elements.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.985
And what the Elements
were were essentially

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:21.200
a 13 volume textbook.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.520
And arguably the most
famous textbook of all time.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.320
And what he did in
those 13 volumes

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.490
is he essentially did a
rigorous, thoughtful, logical

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.700
march through geometry
and number theory,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.120
and then also solid geometry.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.840
So geometry in three dimensions.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.010
And this right over here
is the frontispiece piece

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.770
for the English version,
or the first translation

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.330
of the English version
of Euclid's Elements.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.840
And this was done in 1570.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.560
But it was obviously
first written in Greek.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.620
And then during much
of the Middle Ages,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.510
that knowledge was
shepherded by the Arabs

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.200
and it was translated
into Arabic.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.900
And then eventually in the
late Middle Ages, translated

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.970
into Latin, and then
obviously eventually English.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.540
And when I say that he did a
rigorous march, what Euclid did

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.914
is he didn't just
say, oh well, I

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:10.519
think if you take the length
of one side of a right triangle

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.810
and the length of the other
side of the right triangle,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.840
it's going to be the same as the
square of the hypotenuse, all

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.440
of these other things.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.770
And we'll go into depth about
what all of these things mean.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.500
He says, I don't want
to just feel good

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.280
that it's probably true.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.520
I want to prove to
myself that it is true.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.300
And so what he did in Elements,
especially the six books that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.340
are concerned with
planar geometry,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.970
in fact, he did all of them,
but from a geometrical point

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.970
of view, he started
with basic assumptions.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.260
So he started with
basic assumptions

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.615
and those basic assumptions
in geometric speak

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:43.300
are called axioms or postulates.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.730
And from them, he proved,
he deduced other statements

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.750
or propositions.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.920
Or these are sometimes
called theorems.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.750
And then he says, now I know if
this is true and this is true,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.520
this must be true.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.190
And he could also prove that
other things cannot be true.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.047
So then he could prove that this
is not going to be the truth.

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:02.630
He didn't just say,
well, every circle

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.796
I've said has this property.

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:05.850
He says, I've now proven
that this is true.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
And then from there, we can go
and deduce other propositions

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.990
or theorems, and we can use
some of our original axioms

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.825
to do that.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.450
And what's special
about that is no one

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.100
had really done that
before, rigorously proven

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.370
beyond a shadow of a doubt
across a whole broad sweep

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.220
of knowledge.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.290
So not just one
proof here or there.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.179
He did it for an
entire set of knowledge

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:30.220
that we're talking about.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.400
A rigorous march
through a subject

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.890
so that he could build
this scaffold of axioms

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.439
and postulates and
theorems and propositions.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.980
And theorems and propositions
are essentially the same thing.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.980
And essentially for
about 2,000 years

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.100
after Euclid-- so this
is unbelievable shelf

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.090
life for a textbook-- people
didn't view you as educated

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.760
if you did not read and
understand Euclid's Elements.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.680
And Euclid's Elements,
the book itself,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.530
was the second most printed
book in the Western world

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.540
after the Bible.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.950
This is a math textbook.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.652
It was second only to the Bible.

00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:05.360
When the first printing
presses came out,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.660
they said OK, let's
print the Bible.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.720
What do we print next?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.070
Let's print Euclid's Elements.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.050
And to show that this is
relevant into the fairly

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.830
recent past-- although
whether or not you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.790
argue that about
150, 160 years ago

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.850
is the recent past--
this right here

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.460
is a direct quote from
Abraham Lincoln, obviously

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.486
one of the great
American presidents.

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:26.110
I like this picture
of Abraham Lincoln.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.660
This is actually a photograph
of Lincoln in his late 30s.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.630
But he was a huge fan
of Euclid's Elements.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.506
He would actually use it
to fine tune his mind.

00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:36.880
While he was riding
his horse, he

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.860
would read Euclid's Elements.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.660
While was in the White House,
he would read Euclid's Elements.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.420
But this is a direct
quote from Lincoln.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.340
"In the course of
my law reading,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.250
I constantly came upon
the word demonstrate.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.490
I thought at first that
I understood its meaning,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.190
but soon became
satisfied that I did not.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.830
I said to myself, what do
I do when I demonstrate

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.040
more than when I
reason or prove?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.850
How does demonstration
differ from any other proof?"

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.050
So Lincoln's saying, there's
this word demonstration

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.680
that means something more.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.870
Proving beyond doubt.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.870
Something more rigorous.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.660
More than just simple
feeling good about something

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.040
or reasoning through it.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.830
"I consulted
Webster's Dictionary."

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.620
So Webster's Dictionary
was around even

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.850
when Lincoln was around.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.846
"They told of certain proof.

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.200
Proof beyond the
possibility of doubt.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.390
But I could form no idea of
what sort of proof that was.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.870
"I thought a great
many things were

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.900
proved beyond the possibility
of doubt, without recourse

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.290
to any such extraordinary
process of reasoning

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.450
as I understood
demonstration to be.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.320
I consulted all the dictionaries
and books of reference

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.890
I could find, but with
no better results.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.590
You might as well have
defined blue to a blind man.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.270
"At last I said, Lincoln--"
he's talking to himself.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.350
"At last I said,
Lincoln, you never

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.360
can make a lawyer if
you do not understand

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.960
what demonstrate means.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.980
And I left my situation
in Springfield,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.820
went home to my father's
house, and stayed there

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.260
till I could give any
proposition in the six

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.900
books of Euclid at sight."

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.640
So the six books concerned
with planar geometry.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.340
"I then found out what
demonstrate means and went back

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.340
to my law studies."

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.080
So one of the greatest
American presidents of all time

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.060
felt that in order
to be a great lawyer,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.610
he had to understand,
be able to prove

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.320
any proposition in the six books
of Euclid's Elements at sight.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.080
And also once he was
in the White House,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.370
he continued to do this
to make him, in his mind,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.799
to fine tune his mind to
become a great president.

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:35.340
And so what we're going to be
doing in the geometry play list

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.629
is essentially that.

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.920
What we're going to study is
we're going to think about

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.440
how do we really tightly,
rigorously prove things?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.700
We're essentially going to be,
in a slightly more modern form,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.390
studying what Euclid
studied 2,300 years ago.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:57.209
Really tighten our reasoning
of different statements

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:59.500
and being able to make sure
that when we say something,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.660
we can really prove
what we're saying.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.900
And this is really some
of the most fundamental,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.940
real mathematics
that you will do.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.440
Arithmetic was really
just computation.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.740
Now in geometry-- and what
we're going to be doing

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.860
is really Euclidean
geometry-- this is really

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.550
what math is about.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.790
Making some assumptions and
then deducing other things

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.607
from those assumptions.
