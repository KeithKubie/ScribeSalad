00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:11.497
The Earth intercepts a lot of solar power:

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:14.579
173 thousand terawatts.

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.300
That's ten thousand times more power
than the planet's population uses.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.950
So is it possible that one day

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.447
the world could be completely 
reliant on solar energy?

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:25.698
To answer that question,

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:31.959
we first need to examine how solar panels
convert solar energy to electrical energy.

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:36.263
Solar panels are made up of smaller units
called solar cells.

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.183
The most common solar cells
are made from silicon,

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:43.297
a semiconductor that is the second
most abundant element on Earth.

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:44.589
In a solar cell,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.567
crystalline silicon is sandwiched
between conductive layers.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:53.776
Each silicon atom is connected
to its neighbors by four strong bonds,

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:58.077
which keep the electrons in place
so no current can flow.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:00:59.203
Here's the key:

00:00:59.203 --> 00:01:03.886
a silicon solar cell uses
two different layers of silicon.

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:07.036
An n-type silicon has extra electrons,

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:12.289
and p-type silicon has extra spaces
for electrons, called holes.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.223
Where the two types of silicon meet,

00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:17.922
electrons can wander across 
the p/n junction,

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:19.979
leaving a positive charge on one side

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.063
and creating negative charge on the other.

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:26.785
You can think of light 
as the flow of tiny particles

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.125
called photons,

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.185
shooting out from the Sun.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:34.131
When one of these photons strikes
the silicon cell with enough energy,

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.529
it can knock an electron from its bond,
leaving a hole.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.321
The negatively charged electron and
location of the positively charged hole

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.734
are now free to move around.

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.752
But because of the electric field
at the p/n junction,

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:51.355
they'll only go one way.

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:53.376
The electron is drawn to the n-side,

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:56.362
while the hole is drawn to the p-side.

00:01:56.362 --> 00:02:01.995
The mobile electrons are collected by
thin metal fingers at the top of the cell.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.750
From there, they flow through 
an external circuit,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.065
doing electrical work,

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:07.606
like powering a lightbulb,

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:11.974
before returning through the conductive
aluminum sheet on the back.

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:15.067
Each silicon cell only puts out
half a volt,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.658
but you can string them 
together in modules to get more power.

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:22.763
Twelve photovoltaic cells are enough
to charge a cellphone,

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:26.364
while it takes many modules 
to power an entire house.

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:29.478
Electrons are the only moving parts
in a solar cell,

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:31.854
and they all go back where they came from.

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:33.882
There's nothing to get worn out
or used up,

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:37.057
so solar cells can last for decades.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:42.874
So what's stopping us from being
completely reliant on solar power?

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.970
There are political factors at play,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.954
not to mention businesses that lobby
to maintain the status quo.

00:02:48.954 --> 00:02:53.065
But for now, let's focus on the physical
and logistical challenges,

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:54.482
and the most obvious of those

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:58.852
is that solar energy 
is unevenly distributed across the planet.

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:01.219
Some areas are sunnier than others.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.859
It's also inconsistent.

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.228
Less solar energy is available 
on cloudy days or at night.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.638
So a total reliance would require

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:14.102
efficient ways to get electricity 
from sunny spots to cloudy ones,

00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:17.087
and effective storage of energy.

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:20.393
The efficiency of the cell itself
is a challenge, too.

00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:23.444
If sunlight is reflected 
instead of absorbed,

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:28.130
or if dislodged electrons fall back into
a hole before going through the circuit,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.893
that photon's energy is lost.

00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:33.241
The most efficient solar cell yet

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:38.634
still only converts 46% of 
the available sunlight to electricity,

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:43.642
and most commercial systems are currently
15-20% efficient.

00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:45.529
In spite of these limitations,

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.204
it actually would be possible

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:50.618
to power the entire world 
with today's solar technology.

00:03:50.618 --> 00:03:52.984
We'd need the funding 
to build the infrastructure

00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:54.971
and a good deal of space.

00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:59.440
Estimates range from tens 
to hundreds of thousands of square miles,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.976
which seems like a lot,

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:06.312
but the Sahara Desert alone is over
3 million square miles in area.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.039
Meanwhile, solar cells are getting
better, cheaper,

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.986
and are competing 
with electricity from the grid.

00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:16.967
And innovations, like floating solar farms,
may change the landscape entirely.

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.956
Thought experiments aside,

00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:21.018
there's the fact 
that over a billion people

00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:24.481
don't have access 
to a reliable electric grid,

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.567
especially in developing countries,

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.842
many of which are sunny.

00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:30.096
So in places like that,

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:34.979
solar energy is already much cheaper
and safer than available alternatives,

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.579
like kerosene.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:38.646
For say, Finland or Seattle, though,

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:42.041
effective solar energy 
may still be a little way off.
