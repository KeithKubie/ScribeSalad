00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.960
I'm now going to do a
few classic problems that

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.940
show up a lot at
math competitions

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.110
and sometimes on
standardized tests,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.697
and they seem like very daunting
and intimidating problems.

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.530
But hopefully over the
course of this video,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.370
you'll realize that if you kind
of see what they're asking for,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.760
it's really not that bad.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.593
So let's try this first
one right over here.

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:21.900
They tell us a plus b
plus c is equal to 7.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.380
And then they ask us, what is
5a plus 5b plus 5c equal to?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.040
And the first
reaction's like, well,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
they just gave me one
equation right over here.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.479
One equation with
three unknowns,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.010
how do I solve for a, b, or c?

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.190
Don't I have to be able
to solve for a, b, or c

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.830
in order to figure out
what 5a plus 5b plus 5c is?

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.120
So I'll let you think
about that for a second.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.540
So the big idea
here is to realize

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.200
that 5a plus 5b
plus 5c, that's just

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.760
the same thing as 5
times a plus b plus c.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.610
If you distribute the 5 here, 5
times a, 5 times b, 5 times c,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.150
you get 5a plus 5b plus 5c.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.000
Another way you could think of
it is we are factoring a 5 out.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.030
If you factor a 5
out, you're left

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.010
with 5 times a plus b plus c.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.060
Now, how do we evaluate this?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.540
Well, that first equation
gave us all the information

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.720
that we needed.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.140
They told us that a plus
b plus c is equal to 7.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.474
So 5 times a plus b plus
c is the same exact thing.

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.140
I think you see where
this is going now.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.120
It's 5 times 7, and now this
becomes pretty straightforward.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.280
That's going to be equal to 35.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.440
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.220
And this is going to be a
little bit more involved,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.810
but hopefully you
see the same idea.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.660
So we're told a plus b plus
c is equal to negative 1.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.650
And we have two
more variables here.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.605
We're told that x
plus y is equal to 7.

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.230
Then they ask us this
big, hairy thing.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.141
What is this equal to?

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:06.890
And I'll give you a
few seconds to give it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.330
a little bit of thought.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.340
Well, you could imagine.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.610
They've given three
variables with one equation

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.420
up here, another two variables
with another equation.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.610
We have five unknowns
with two equations.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.276
There's no way we're going to be
able to individually figure out

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:22.620
what a, or b, or
c, or x, or y is.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.690
But maybe we can use what
we saw in the last example

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.071
to solve this.

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:29.570
And so what we might want do
is rearrange it so that we have

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.616
the x's and the y's kind
of grouped together,

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:34.740
and the a's, b'c, and c's
kind of grouped together.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.060
So let's try that out.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.350
So let's focus first on
the a's, b's, and c's.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.070
So we have negative
9a, negative 9b--

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.010
I'll go in order, alphabetical
order-- negative 9b,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.530
and we have negative 9c, and I
think you see what's emerging.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.570
And then let's work on
the x's and the y's.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.770
And then we have
negative 7x, minus 7x,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.340
and then we have a minus 7y.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.530
So all I have done is
rearranged this expression here.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.140
But this makes it a
little bit clearer

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.050
of what's going on here.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.440
These first three terms, I
can factor out a negative 9,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.950
and I get negative 9
times a plus b plus c.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.170
And these second two terms,
I can factor out a 7,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.551
minus 7 times x plus y.

00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:28.800
And just to verify, if you
wanted to go the other way,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.130
multiply this negative 7 times
x plus y, you'll get this.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.550
Multiply negative 9 times a
plus b plus c, distribute it,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.790
you'll get this right over here.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.760
And so this makes it
a little bit clearer.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.999
What is a plus b
plus c equal to?

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.540
Well, they tell us
right over here. a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.885
plus b plus c is
equal to negative 1.

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.740
This whole expression
is negative 1, at least

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.990
in the parentheses.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.400
And what is x plus y equal to?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.670
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.020
What is x plus y equal to?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.400
Well, they tell us right over
here. x plus y is equal to 7.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.680
So this whole thing
simplifies to negative

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:18.480
9 times negative
1 minus 7 times 7.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.200
And so this is equal to--
we're in the home stretch--

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.970
negative 9 times negative 1.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.260
Well, that's positive 9.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.210
And then negative 7
times 7 is negative 49.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.840
So it's 9 minus 49, which
is equal to negative 40.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.068
And we are done.
