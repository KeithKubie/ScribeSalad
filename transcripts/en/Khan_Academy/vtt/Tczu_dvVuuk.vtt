00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.730
In the last video, we
talked about pensions

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.880
and how they're
defined benefit plans

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.310
and how they could
to get underfunded

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.910
or how there could be temptation
for people to underfund them.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.160
In this video, I want to
make things a little bit more

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.190
concrete by looking
at actual numbers,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.150
especially at the state level.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.560
So right over here is a map of,
obviously, the United States.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.100
And what it shows is how funded
the pension liabilities are

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.610
in the different states.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.040
So for example-- actually,
Texas, for example,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.740
83% of their pension
liabilities are funded.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.330
They've set aside 83% of
the right amount of money

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.170
to fund their pension
obligations, not 100%.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.790
It is underfunded,
but it's not crazy.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.619
California, pretty high, 78%.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.910
But one of these states is
probably jumping out at you,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.990
probably because it
has been shaded in red.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.090
And that is the
state of Illinois,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.100
and Illinois is in
trouble because it's only

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.030
funded 45% of its
pension obligations.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.767
And Illinois really jumps
out because it's in red,

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:07.350
but there's a lot of states that
are pretty close to Illinois.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.080
Louisiana, 56%.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.550
Oklahoma, 56%.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.380
Kentucky, 54%.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.952
West Virginia, 58%.

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:16.910
And this is an issue
because they've set aside,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.272
in the past, very little
money for the pension

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:20.980
obligations that are
starting to hit now,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.450
especially that you have
a retiring baby boomer

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.390
population.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.520
And in order to meet
those obligations,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.300
those promised
obligations, they're

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.680
going to have to dig into
money that was being spent

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.650
other places, that
going in the past when

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.520
they were underfunding
the pension,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.570
they were able to fund
other things nicely, but not

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.690
fund the pension and kind of
kick the can down the road.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.924
But now that the can can't
be kicked any further,

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:46.840
it's going to have to
go the other way around.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.006
You're going to have to
take money from other things

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.330
to fund your pensions.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.550
And to make it clear, let's
focus on the state of Illinois.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.090
So this right over here.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.890
There's a couple
of things going on.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.110
In this kind of yellow ochre
color-- and I'll circle it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080
in yellow ochre--
they were talking

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.514
about the total liabilities.

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:05.930
And just to make
this graph clear,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.471
it's not just the yellow ochre
part that's total liabilities.

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:10.789
The entire height of
each of these bars

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.990
is the total
liabilities, and you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.070
see how it has just
completely blossomed here.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.350
And there's a lot of things that
go into the total liabilities,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.240
the same things that we talked
about in the last video.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.075
There are things like
return on investment.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.420
If you are in a low
interest rate environment,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.250
like we are now-- for example,
my money in my savings account,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.020
I think, is getting
like 0.4% interest.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.870
It's getting pretty
much no interest.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.330
If you're in a low
interest rate environment,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.890
if you're not getting good
returns-- and a lot of pensions

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.800
tend to go into
very safe assets,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.720
but those are getting
very low returns.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.670
You're going to have to
set aside more money,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.930
and so you see these
obligations essentially just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.950
growing dramatically.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520
On top of that, you
have things like cost

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.320
of living adjustments.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.779
These are attempts at kind
of factoring in inflation,

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.570
how much things are
costing in that region.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.195
But they are also
sometimes negotiated.

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:13.670
And sometimes, and especially
in the case of Illinois,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.580
they've grown faster than
the rate of inflation.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.130
And so you have
these liabilities,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.700
and you see that they're getting
less and less well funded.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.560
So if we go right
over here, this

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.990
is what this green line
is, the funding ratio.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.220
So how well funded
are these liabilities?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.210
Say the red part of the bar is
the part that is not paid for.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.430
And the green is
the ratio of the red

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.680
or is the ratio of what
is funded, essentially

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.170
this higher part.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.820
It's the ratio of
this part right

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.230
over here to the entire bar.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.170
And you see right over here,
Illinois is in a bad situation.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.860
Their total liabilities
are 138 billion.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.560
This is in millions, so
it's 138,000 million.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.390
So it's 138 billion.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.780
This is for one state.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.719
And 85 or 86 billion
of that is unfunded,

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.260
that they have to
figure out some way

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.920
to get the money because
the right amount of money

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.010
was not being set aside.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.860
And to do that,
they're going to have

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.350
to dig in into other things.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.839
So this right over here, this
is the pension contribution.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.269
Let me circle this.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.850
So in this yellow
color, once again,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.790
this is the pension
contribution.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.640
And now the state, they're
going to have to-- in order

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.270
to get to a funded
position, they're

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.160
going to make up for all of
the underfunding of the past

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.300
and also the other factors that
are making this obligation even

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.990
larger.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.070
They're going to have to
dig into other things.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.324
So you see right
over here in yellow,

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.990
these are the
contributions that they're

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.930
going to have to
make for the pension.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.250
And you see that growing.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.900
It's growing to in excess by
2018 of $6 billion a year.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.510
But what's really
fascinating about this graph

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.260
is it's passing up total
education funding in the state.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.200
So the cost of
funding retirements

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.714
for people who have already
done service for the state

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:07.380
but aren't in service
to the state right

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.450
now is going to pass up-- and
this is happening very soon--

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.220
is going to pass
up actual spending

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.320
on a state-wide
basis on education.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.310
And at the state
level, education

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.687
is a major, major,
major expenditure.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:24.020
So it's going to be passing
up a major expenditure, very

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.680
important expenditure for
the future of the state

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.720
based on past obligations.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.060
And to understand
where this is going--

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.360
and just to understand
Illinois' situation,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.700
there's 750,000
Illinois-- I don't

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.190
know how to say this--
Illinoians, Illinoisians,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.500
who are members of the
state's five pension system.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.760
So this is the Teachers
Retirement System.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.760
This is the State Universities
Retirement System.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.280
This is the State Employees
Retirement System.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.900
This is the Judges
Retirement System.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.880
You see there's a lot
fewer judges than that.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.930
There's many more teachers
who've been retired,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.479
many who have been in
the state universities.

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.520
And this right over here
is the General Assembly.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.650
Very few people who are in
the Illinois state assembly.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.700
And you can see kind
of comparable salaries.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.510
This is the retirement
benefit, not just the salaries.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.570
This is how much on
average these folks

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.350
are getting once they
retire on an annual basis.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.100
So you see that they're
pretty reasonable,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.420
especially for the
judges, although they

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.690
are a small fraction.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.370
But in all fairness, this
was promised to these people.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.020
They planned.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.070
The probably took
lower compensation

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.560
while they were working
with the expectation

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.510
that they would be able to
get these benefits once they

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.440
retired.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.840
They also probably stayed
in the jobs longer.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.470
This is a way of
retaining employees,

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.420
because they knew that they
were going to get this benefit.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.020
So you might say, oh, these are
really, really great benefits.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.910
But at the same time,
these people probably

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.630
sacrificed other things in
order to get these benefits now.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.570
But it's a very hard question.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.980
When you look at this, you say,
well, these people, they've

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.780
done service.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.144
They put these expectations.

00:06:57.144 --> 00:06:58.560
But at the same
time, you're like,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.277
well, this is
really cutting in--

00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:02.110
and this is just one
thing that I'm showing.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.120
It's really cutting into
very important areas

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.410
of investment for
the entire state.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.285
So the whole reason of
really just surfacing

00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:11.905
this, this whole pension
issue, is just to put this in.

00:07:11.905 --> 00:07:14.270
And hopefully people
understand what the issues are,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.180
because that's the only way that
fairly hard decisions are going

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.000
to have to be made, decisions
on cutting necessary investment

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.500
or restructuring or who
knows what it might be.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.990
I don't envy the people who
have to make these decisions.
