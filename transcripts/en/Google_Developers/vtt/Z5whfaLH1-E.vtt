00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.467
Soderstrom:
I'm Gustav Soderstrom,

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.334
and I'm here to demo
Spotify for Android.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:11.133
So Spotify is
a streaming music application

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.667
that lets you access basically
any song in the world

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.801
just as if it was
on your desktop.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.167
So basically you can
just pick a song, play it,

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.801
and if you like it
you add it to your playlist,

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:22.968
and you keep building
these playlists.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.734
You don't actually
have to download music,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.667
which also means you can
share music very easily.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.300
So let me
show you quickly.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.567
Here's a Spotify client
for Mac.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:34.467
I'll just type in K.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.267
Search for any track
that starts with a K.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.367
Let's see...

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.701
So I'll type anything
from maybe Superchick.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:46.634
I can see, you know, all the
albums that Superchick ever did.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.133
They're in Spotify.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.267
Now I can listen to a song here,
like "Courage," for example.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:53.300
[Superchick's "Courage" plays]

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.067
You can see
it started very fast.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:57.067
I can seek
within the song.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.133
Go to another place
in the song.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.467
I can switch songs.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.567
Like that.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.400
So it's almost as fast
as if you had

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.868
all the music in the world
on your desktop.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.801
And this application
is available,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.901
not in the U.S. yet,
but it's available in Europe.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.334
And let me just
pause the music for you.

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.701
You can use it for free;
it's an ad-funded version.

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:22.100
That means you will hear ads,
like, every 20 minutes.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.200
Audio ads, actually,
and visual ads.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.534
Now, by far the most common
request from our users is,

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:29.300
you know, they think this
is great, they use it a lot,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.734
but they want--

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.167
they want the music
in their mobile, right?

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.534
So this just doesn't cover
all the use cases.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.501
So what we did
was we sat down and we--

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:37.968
instead of just
quickly building

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:39.534
a streaming application
for mobile,

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.234
which would have been
sort of the easy way out,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.734
we just sat down
and figured out, you know,

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.801
what should mobile music
really be like?

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:48.334
And what we came to
was a few things.

00:01:48.334 --> 00:01:50.100
So there were two things
we wanted to do.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.901
Of course we wanted to give you
access to any song in the world

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.234
at any time,
anywhere.

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:56.701
And we do that.

00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:59.434
If you have a good, you know,
3G, Edge, or Wi-Fi connection,

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:01.868
you can just search for a song
and stream it wherever you are.

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.300
But there was another use case,
you know, the use case--

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.400
You're in the subway,
you're on a train,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.167
you're in an airplane,
or you're roaming,

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.734
where, you know, this just
wouldn't be very useful, right?

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.968
So what we did,

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:14.133
which is unlike most other
streaming applications,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.400
is we also allow--

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.801
We built
a synchronization paradigm,

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.968
which means that you get
the same playlists

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:21.701
on the Android phone
that you get on the PC, right?

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.133
Of course.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.567
And you can stream it, but you
can also highlight playlists

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:27.100
on the Android phone
for download.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.200
And actually it downloads
these playlists

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.801
locally to the memory card;
it encrypts them,

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.667
and then you can listen to them
in flight mode, right?

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.501
And you get, like, 10,
12 hours' worth of battery life

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:37.868
because it's actually
local on the device.

00:02:37.868 --> 00:02:39.334
It doesn't
use the Network.

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:41.634
And what happens
is if you do changes

00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:43.567
to these playlists
on your desktop,

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.400
as soon as the device
comes back into connectivity,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
you know,
wifi, 3G, et cetera,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.234
it's just gonna synchronize
silently these changes,

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:51.868
and download
all the new tracks, right?

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:54.501
So let me
show you that, actually.

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.934
So this is
the Spotify client for Android.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:00.701
Now, as I said, obviously
I can go into search here.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.501
I'll type in,
maybe, you know, L.

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:08.501
Search for any song
with an L.

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.000
So...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.634
Actually, I like this one.
L'Amour Toujours.

00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:17.567
So I click it, and you see
it starts really fast, actually.

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:21.367
I can do seek
within a track like this,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.167
and just let it go.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:24.734
And it continues
from there.

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:26.767
I guess you can't
hear it very well.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.033
But it is streaming.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.400
I can just go
to the next one in the list.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.567
You can see it's almost as fast
as the desktop client, actually.

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.434
So we have
that use case

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.534
if you happen to have
decent connectivity.

00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:43.601
Now what I think is really cool,
and a defining feature,

00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.267
is actually
this use case.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.868
So you see
my playlists here.

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:49.367
And if you look
at the desktop down here,

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:51.334
you can see
the same playlists here.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:56.267
So what I'll do now,
if you film the phone, there,

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:59.634
you can see, for example,
like the Gustav playlist there.

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:02.067
Actually on the desktop,
I'm gonna move that around--

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:03.534
and you can keep
filming the phone--

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:06.901
I'm gonna move
the Gustav list up top.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:08.367
And you can see
it just pops up there.

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:09.667
And now, actually,

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:11.934
I'm gonna change the name
of the Gustav playlist.

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:14.434
I'll just type in,
like, maybe...

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.968
I'll just type in
some crap.

00:04:16.968 --> 00:04:19.167
And you can see
it updates to that.

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:22.300
So it really is
wirelessly synchronized, right?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.367
So this is
connected to the cloud,

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.200
and the phone
is connected to the cloud.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.467
So the other thing
you'll notice here,

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.300
there's a button
saying "Offline Sync"

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.701
And if I press that button,
you can see I have checkboxes.

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:37.300
So I've already checked a few,
here, like a good chef.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.000
I pre-prepared
a few playlists here.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.567
They are locally synced
to the memory card, right?

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:43.234
So what happens now--

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.734
If I add a song
to one of these lists

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:48.234
that are checked
for offline sync--

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:51.000
So I'll go to my PC here.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.033
I'll...

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:57.667
I'll do a search for whatever.
I'll find a song here.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:00.300
Let's see if I find
something interesting.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.100
So I'll take this song--

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.300
A Front 242 song,
which I like,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.167
and I'll drag it and drop it
under this playlist.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.901
Actually, I dragged it
in the other playlist.

00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:11.834
I'll drop it
in the top playlist.

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.868
And I drop it now.

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.501
And what you can see
happen here now

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.133
is it got a push message
that there was a change,

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.267
and it starts
downloading it.

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:20.400
And this happens
in the background,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.300
when the phone
is in your pocket, right?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.033
So it takes
a few seconds to download.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:26.167
I can--In the meantime,
you know,

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:30.000
I can actually
go and play other music.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.467
I can go around
the application.

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:34.834
I can go and check out
what's new.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.400
These are recent albums
that we launched.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.467
I can actually play music
in other playlists.

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:47.400
Just to show you
the speed of this.

00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:56.801
And what happens
is, you know...

00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:01.801
Yeah, you have settings
and stuff here as well.

00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:05.400
Now...

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.868
So now it's finished.

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:08.667
You have 14 songs
instead of 13.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.667
So what I can do now,
which is really cool--

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:14.634
I'll just go
into airplane mode here.

00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:17.467
And you can see here
it's not connected anymore.

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.701
And I can still
play these songs.

00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:21.133
So I'll go in here,

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:23.834
and I'll play
this Front 242 song

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:26.367
that we just
added, right?

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:30.934
And I can go back and forth
through this playlist.

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.634
Just as, you know--

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:34.234
Just as your
regular mp3 player.

00:06:34.234 --> 00:06:36.334
So it's kind of
the best of two worlds.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:37.734
It's the best
of streaming,

00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:40.434
but it's also the best
of the synchronization paradigm.

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.267
The big difference is, you know,
unlike your current mp3 player,

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.567
you don't have to carry your
laptop and USB cable with you.

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:46.934
You can leave that
at home.

00:06:46.934 --> 00:06:48.534
'Cause it doesn't sync
towards your computer,

00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:53.834
it syncs towards the cloud,
which is a big difference.

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:56.734
So a few things
about Android.

00:06:56.734 --> 00:06:59.734
The reason we chose
to develop for Android was...

00:06:59.734 --> 00:07:01.133
It's--Instead
of everyone else,

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:03.901
it's an open platform
that we like.

00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:05.567
We did some
investigation,

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:08.834
'cause actually this application
requires a lot of performance.

00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:10.501
It--you know, it downloads
music in the background

00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:13.300
at maybe 10 megabits per second
if your wifi is good.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.734
It encrypts that
to your memory card.

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.901
At the same time,
you're streaming music

00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:18.300
that should not
be interrupted.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.567
At the same time
you want to have

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:21.601
smooth scrolling
through long lists.

00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:23.167
It's quite
a challenge to do.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:24.434
So we investigated
Android,

00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:26.834
and were really pleased
with the performance it got,

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.801
so we decided
to do this for Android.

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:31.033
And what we've done,
which is pretty--

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.434
pretty unique
for this project,

00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:37.000
is we actually used
our C++ core libraries,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.634
using a native development kit
that is open source

00:07:39.634 --> 00:07:41.567
that Google released
a few weeks ago.

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.801
So we built
the UI in Java,

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.067
but the core library
is actually C++--

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.501
the core
performance libraries,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.200
so all the encryption and all
the playback and all that stuff,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200
which is why we got
such a good performance.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.234
So the other thing
that I like about Android,

00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:57.601
which is
pretty obvious,

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.167
it allows you to play
in the background,

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.934
so it really gives you the full
use case of this device,

00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:05.400
and it transitions nicely
between, you know, wifi and 3G.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.067
So it really supports--
supports the--

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:11.501
the use case of the application
when it did really well.

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:12.501
cameraman: Excellent.

00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.567
Well, thank you, Gustav.

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:14.834
That was a great demo,

00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:16.934
and a lovely explanation
of the Spotify application.

00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:18.100
Soderstrom: Thank you.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.133
cameraman: All the best.
Enjoy the conference.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.067
Soderstrom: Thank you.
