1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,680
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:06,020
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,100
July 3rd,

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,900
2017 a day before July 4th

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,870
when you guys do own it. Jesus Christ.
When are you guys doing it? Yup.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,490
Partying tonight. You got to go tonight,
right? You got to go tonight and tomorrow.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,910
You like a fat fuck. But tonight
is tonight to night to night.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,750
Tonight's tonight. If you want to
go out and get fucking hammered,

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,320
you know tomorrow's for the kids.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,520
You know today you scare your children
tomorrow you wake up with them.

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,250
That's how it works.
When July 4th is on a Tuesday,

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,110
you know your wife will give you dirty
looks, but you know by the weekend,

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:49,160
as long as you're mulching up the
fucking Yad, she'll be happy. So what do,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,280
what do you want from me?
I was celebrating the birth of the nation.

15
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:56,010
They're not the movie.
You're fucking racist. Dot.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,570
Well, you made me curse. You know, you
get involved in those stupid things. Um,

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,270
anyways. Uh Oh man. Oh Billy.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,260
No Fund was Billy bad boy this week.
I completely just fucking,

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,850
I just, I don't know what happened. I
went off the rails, I went off the rails.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,710
I was flying out. I was doing the
Capitol Theater in Port Chester,

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,380
which is one of most amazing venues.
I don't know what it is about it.

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,250
It's just one of those places. It's got
the fucking magic in it, you know, and uh,

23
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:33,170
it's been around forever and according
to the people that ran it, um,

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,881
yeah,

25
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:39,881
he was saying that Janis Joplin played
there and in a bar nearby or something,

26
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,630
she wrote that song.

27
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:46,631
Mercedes Benz tried it out for the first
time at that venue than went out to la,

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,700
recorded it, and then overdosed.
That was it. And I was like,

29
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:53,870
that's great. Well, you know what,

30
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:55,700
I'm not going to be trying
any new material this weekend.

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,460
Bill Bird tried out a new Dick joke,
uh, recorded it onto his iPhone.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,470
Um, went back into the city, had two
slices of pizza in three in the morning,

33
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:12,170
followed by four shots of fucking whiskey,

34
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,200
and then went to bed and died on
a futon. Yes, he was alone. Um,

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,440
oh my God, I just don't happen.
I was flying out there. Um,

36
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,280
I think I was stressed. I don't know
what it was. And then the guy, you know,

37
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,360
asked me if I wanted to drink,
you know, I wasn't on a plane,

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,210
it was just this die came up to me. He
says, excuse me, can I buy you a drink?

39
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:39,890
I was like, well, certainly you can
know that was on a plane in the steward.

40
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,770
The male stewardess came up to
me. He said, do you want it?

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,280
You want anything to drink? Right.
And the devil in me went, oh.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,810
And I went, um, quivering
voice maybe later.

43
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,823
Yeah.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,980
So, you know, I've been eating great edge
salads and all that shit and I'd done,

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,590
you know, I'll just have
one, I'll just have one.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,660
He comes over with some Jack on the
rocks, you know. Nice fucking poor, right.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
Gave me the old mile high
pulse, you know what I mean? If

48
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,920
he fucking give me like gave me like
three fingers and fucking booze. So,

49
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,243
um,

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,570
that's with a little bit of pepper and
some cheese and I fucking drank the thing

51
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,230
and I was like, all right,
that's it. I gotta I gotta uh,

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,900
I gotta get waters after this
cause that's the big thing.

53
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,700
After I have the first one, I just
switched the waters and then, then I,

54
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,550
I get my bearings again
of like, oh yeah, okay,

55
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,430
cool. Okay, cool. We had a buzz. Now
we're coming back. We'll come back.

56
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,240
This is a good thing.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,760
But if I go to that second
drink for get it and um,

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,490
he just fucking, what
did he say? Do you want?

59
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:56,020
And I think he just brought me the next
one and then I was just like, well,

60
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:00,010
I'm not going to be rude. And then
I drank that one and then, uh,

61
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:04,360
then we landed and that just set me off
on the wrong, the wrong fucking way,

62
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,700
the wrong fucking road.

63
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,650
Then I got into the city and then
I got two slices of fucking pizza.

64
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,670
Not even from a place that I liked place
that I wanted closed because they have

65
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,100
great pizza and they already
made their money. So like,

66
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,590
well we don't need to be open all
night. Go Fuck Yourself. See Ya.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
So then I walked down the street
to these other guys, you know,

68
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:27,640
the one that all the drunks
is stumbling into and uh,

69
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,540
I got not one,

70
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,400
but two slices of pizza went back fucking
shoved them down my throat the whole

71
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,070
time. Go, you know, this is way better
than anything that I'd get in La.

72
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:41,071
But this is not a good example of how the
east coast became legendary with their

73
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,520
pizza making. No disrespect
to Chicago, by the way,

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,110
okay?

75
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,890
I'm not saying you guys don't make you
make a different type of Lasagna pizza

76
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,310
out there and most New Yorkers,
people from Boston, Philly,

77
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,720
we go out there and we don't know where
to go and we just get some average slop

78
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,440
and we'll like this fucking pizza
stinks. Right? The same way you guys,

79
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,080
I know so many fucking people should
categorize. Do I want to know gay?

80
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,100
You'll get pizza and good. Did you
even look to see where to go? You Dope.

81
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,350
New York has a great reputation for,
for making great pizza.

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,770
That's why there's so many shitty once.
You know what I mean?

83
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:21,070
Because everybody's living off
of that fucking reputation.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,990
There's like a half dozen,
probably,

85
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:30,340
maybe eight in the fucking all
the boroughs. How many boroughs?

86
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:34,540
I was at Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten
Island, man of five fucking boroughs.

87
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,040
There's probably probably eight.
Okay.

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,840
Brooklyn's got a couple.

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,140
New York has a couple and everybody
else has like fucking one may be too.

90
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,320
I don't know enough about it, but I'm
just telling you there's only a few.

91
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,610
However, in New York City you can buy
pizza every fucking 10 feet down the road.

92
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,690
Same way in Chicago.

93
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,650
Some fucking cunt is out there waiting
for someone like me to walk down the

94
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,660
street with my fucking Chicago,

95
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,870
the windy city windbreaker that
I just bought at the airport,

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,500
a genuine,
authentic fucking Chicago deep dish pizza.

97
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,670
Then they're going to bring me in there,
so can we end the fucking pizza debate?

98
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,970
Everybody, you know, has
their own way to do it.

99
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,520
Up in Boston, they had the little bar
style pizzas, which are fucking amazing.

100
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,530
And every New York content
goes, oh, I went up day, folk
with tastes like fucking,

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,700
we'll ghoulies over the again,
folk in feet days, you know,

102
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,390
those fucking morons when you travel.
Okay.

103
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,080
You got to fucking hang with local people
and they'll tell you where to go to

104
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,570
fucking walk into a place
and think that everything,

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,800
there's sucks and people there just
accept it is probably one of the dumbest

106
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,180
ways to travel. However,
that's how most people do it.

107
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:49,860
Okay.

108
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,250
Or you go there and you try to get what
you can get down the street from where

109
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:55,950
you live and when, then when you
can't, you say, this place sucks.

110
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,870
Yeah.

111
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,800
And was just, I can't, you know,
fuck it. I was in The Bahamas that

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,370
[inaudible]. Um, anyways,

113
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,210
I don't know why I'm making
everybody Italian, but I'm a joiner.

114
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
I am a joint it. So, uh,

115
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,370
so I hit the Shitty fucking pizza and I
was taught to finish my food as a kid.

116
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:25,950
So I'm fucking even just non
my way through the crust.

117
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,220
I mean I could have whittled something
like fuck piece of wood with this crust.

118
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,670
Tough like fucking shoe
leather over there. Um,

119
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,030
that's was the first night. And then
I did well during the day, you know,

120
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,830
I did really well.
But then just at night,

121
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,450
the next night I ended up staying up.
We went to a fucking oh,

122
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:48,780
right down the street from the
port Chester capital theater.

123
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,590
It was this great Italian
restaurant and uh,

124
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,800
it was all part of partly
owned by Mario Batali.

125
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,570
Um, who's the best. All this fucking
restaurants are awesome, right?

126
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,570
So I go down there and I know I
should order the fish, but I can't,

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,060
can't go to Italian out here. So I
ordered, I ordered some pasta. Right?

128
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,140
I get the fucking go fuck yourself.
Bolin h right. So I get that.

129
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,370
And then we say we don't want dessert.

130
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,820
They still brought some stuff over cause
they're Italian. I mean, just, you know,

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,330
if you say, I don't want
any of this, still going to
bring you over a half order.

132
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,320
That's how it fucking works.

133
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,390
So they brought over the oldies
canolas and all of this shit

134
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,213
and then

135
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,310
didn't drink too much that
night, but definitely, you know,

136
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,110
not trigger that much to
me. It was like, you know,

137
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,590
five or six over a fucking nine hour
peer stayed out till like four in the

138
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,240
fucking morning.
Smoked a cigar.

139
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,710
Fucking stupid. I had all this shit
to do the next day. Right. If fucking

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,910
get out of the fucking Uber.
Right.

141
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,390
I get out of the Ober and um,

142
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,250
I know I told you guys I Uber,
I had somebody call

143
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,030
it for me
cause I couldn't get a cab

144
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,150
and uh,
I get out of the,

145
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,030
and the second I get out of it I walk
over to the door and go, well wait,

146
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,470
where's my phone?
Where's my phone?

147
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,830
And I left it in the fucking Uber
and then I didn't have, I had no,

148
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,230
no way to call.
And I was like,

149
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,200
you gotta be fucking kidding me
cause I had my bag of shit with me.

150
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,230
So I grabbed my bag and I got this thing.
Once I grabbed something,

151
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,840
I never look for anything
else. And also, you know,

152
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,720
I had like fucking four or five drinks,
so I left my fucking phone there.

153
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,800
So I was just like, all right, extend
a mental check. Everything's backed up,

154
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,590
everything's on the computer. Who gives
a fuck? I'll just buy a phone tomorrow.

155
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,100
Fucking moron. Right? So
I get up the next day,

156
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,080
I go over to the fucking Verizon store
and they go, okay, what's your apple id?

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm like, I dunno, you got
my phone number, here's my
license. And they're like, oh,

158
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,360
that's not good enough. You
need your Apple Id. I go,
well, I don't have it. He goes,

159
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,660
can you guess a Zodiac and fucking
standing all day? I don't know what it is.

160
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,820
And he basically tells
me that he can't get,

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,510
he can't get into my account
without my apple id. I go,

162
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:01,920
you're telling me if the FBI came in
here right now, that's what you'd say.

163
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:06,240
And he was like, absolutely. And I was
like, dude, I don't know what it is.

164
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,990
Are you telling, she's telling
me I can never get a phone again.

165
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:13,050
This feels like a Tom cruise movie.
Did you just shut off the microchip in me?

166
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:17,460
Can I you can I get a phone please?
I business to do. The guy says, no,

167
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,970
I haven't been meditating.
My temper starts going up
and up and up and up and up.

168
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,430
I didn't curse at him. I
started, you know, okay.

169
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,400
He goes,
well,

170
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,910
you're gonna have to go to our main store
and that's going to take like fucking

171
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,070
two to three hours. So it's like,
you've gotta be fucking kidding me.

172
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:35,071
So I walk out into the streets
in New York and I said,

173
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:37,900
I fucking hate technology.
But I said,

174
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I really quietly in technology
really quietly, but fuck.

175
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,620
I said at the top of my
lungs, fucking, I just went,

176
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:47,950
I fucking hate technology.
This lady fucking whipped
her head around. I was like,

177
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,240
oh my God. I'm like, I like,

178
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm literally the Guy Walking
in the street in New York,

179
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,020
making people nervous right now.

180
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,700
So I walk up to try to find
where this fucking places,

181
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:00,940
I don't know what you said. It's on like
fucking 50 [inaudible] and sixth avenue.

182
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,470
I'm looking for the thing and I'm like,
wait,

183
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:05,620
is it on sixth avenue
and 57th I have no idea.

184
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:08,170
This took me back to the nineties when
I was in New York when you didn't have a

185
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:13,060
map and you just fucking walked
around head on a swivel, right.

186
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,560
Finally find the place.

187
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,370
And I walked in there and I got
an absolute angel at the store,

188
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,100
old school customer service,

189
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,250
completely fucking hooked me up and she
was like in her mid twenties it halfway

190
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,800
through I just finally was just saying
like, you know, I forgot what I said.

191
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:33,790
I said something you basically see effect
that you know you don't get customer

192
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,820
service like this anymore.
Your parents raised you right?
She said, thank you. I go,

193
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,830
did you come from a big family? And she
was like, I was like said something like,

194
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,670
um, like one of seven. I was like,
I know it, I know it, I know it.

195
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,280
I don't know what it is. Kids would come
from like fucking with a bunch of kids,

196
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,220
families with a bunch of kids there.
They, they, I dunno, they learned that.

197
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,970
I don't know what to do. I know what
you learned, but you're, you're, uh,

198
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,100
I dunno. Everything is about you when
you keeping all the fucking toys.

199
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,410
So she totally hooked me up. And then, uh,

200
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,360
then I was able to call my
buddy who called the Uber,

201
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,780
who called the Uber Guy and then
the Uber Guy still had my phone.

202
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:16,140
He brought it back to me the next night.
You know,

203
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,500
I gave him a nice tip for doing
that and I got two phones.

204
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:21,090
I guess I can bring the other phone back,

205
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:23,850
but I just don't want to go back into a
story. I'm not rolling the dice again.

206
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,840
Then I'm going to get a good customer
service person. I know I'm not. Um,

207
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:30,120
so I'll just fucking eat.
It was my own fucking fault.

208
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,540
If I didn't go out till fucking four
in the morning, like an asshole,

209
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,370
none of that shit would have happened.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,300
I apologize to the lady that I made her
fucking probably fucked up her neck when

211
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:44,301
I screamed fucking when I was
out in the street and a buddy,

212
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:48,090
you know,
I don't apologize to the guy at the bank,

213
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,260
I owe taxes, right? I owe
taxes up in fucking Canada.

214
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,190
Okay?

215
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,320
So they may count goes,
you have to go to the bank,

216
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,290
I'm going to send you an email with
all the fucking account information.

217
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,100
They can wire it up. They have bing,
Bang, boom, done. So I say fine.

218
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,250
So I go up to, I download
the thing, I bring my laptop,

219
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,780
I fucking get this David
Blaine looking dude, you know,

220
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:17,550
at the bank to help me out. Right? So he
walked into his cubicle area. We sit down,

221
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,640
I have all the information on the
computer screen. He's such go, I read,

222
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:23,520
read me the Vin number. I know it's
not that, but you know what I mean?

223
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,670
And I'm like, what? What? He's like
that number there. Read that to me.

224
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,070
So I read it to me. He goes, all right,
read me. The next time I go watch them.

225
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,860
He goes was me that number and then I
just find looking at my, Whoa, I go,

226
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:36,460
what do I work here? He's
like, excuse me? I go,

227
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,900
I go, I feel like I work here
right now. I'm like, I look, just,

228
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,980
just turn it around here, here's all
the information, type it in and he goes,

229
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:49,350
what's going to go quicker or something
like then they just kind of got quiet,

230
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,140
right?
I'm just fucking sitting there

231
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,770
and then after a couple minutes he
just kind of goes like, you know,

232
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:59,010
I don't understand like why you got
upset there? I go out. I'm not upset.

233
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:01,830
I'm just calling you out on the fact he
started treating me like your secretary.

234
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:04,950
I don't work here. He goes,
I'm not treating you like
get sick. Tick. Yeah, you,

235
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:08,340
why are you going to be like reading
off numbers and stuff? He goes,

236
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:11,010
I'm just doing that cause it'll be
faster. And I go, well I disagree.

237
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,620
Well what the fuck am I you you,
you want to stay and you work at the bank.

238
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,540
You're at the bank,
you work at the bank,

239
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,300
you get paid to work at the fucking bank.
I'm the customer.

240
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,630
This is what I need you to do.
Do the fucking transaction.

241
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,480
Jesus fucking Christ. Fucking God the,
I'm going to say it these kids today,

242
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,050
everything about them is, it's
interactive. Hey man, like, hey, you know,

243
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:38,220
fucking reach out through the fucking
innerweb man. Fuck off and do your job.

244
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,470
But I'd say to that, I just said, I
disagree. That's the best I could do,

245
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,160
but I just couldn't.
He was like the cues.

246
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,630
What kills me is he's walking around
and saying that I'm a Dick, which I am.

247
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
I admit to that,
but I'm fucking right.

248
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,250
I got to sit there and read off
fucking numbers to you. He goes,

249
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:59,420
can you read the CT? We say, please,
you such talking to me like I'm like,

250
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,250
and I was like, I'm done. I just get
hired as your assistant. You fucking cunt.

251
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,983
Okay.

252
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,950
I don't even know what he was
talking about. All of those numbers.

253
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,570
I'm not a fucking banker. Okay. Every
time he told me to read off a number,

254
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:16,390
he had explained what the number is
like. How was that, how has that quicker?

255
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,173
Oh Jesus.

256
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,850
So I meditated for the first
time in about six weeks.

257
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,570
Um, I'm just trying. Yeah, I
know. I know. I know. I just,

258
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,890
uh, I'm back, we're back in the writers'
room. I got all of that shit to do.

259
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,460
I'm building my new fucking act right.
My,

260
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,100
my daughter is finally sleeping
through the night. You know,

261
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,140
she still wakes up once or twice,
but it's just something,

262
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:48,490
just a quick little one. Um, maybe needs
a diaper change or something like that.

263
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:52,720
And I'm just feeling like it's just,
it's building up again, you know?

264
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,950
So for me now to like stop
drinking, you know, to add that,

265
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,860
that extra stress of like,
you know,

266
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,600
okay,

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,910
you know,

268
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,970
to not have the fucking thing to take
the edge off at the end of the God damn

269
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:09,410
day like that, it just starts building
up. So up to the guy at the bank,

270
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,270
maybe I could have
explained it a little nicer.

271
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:15,310
Maybe I couldn't just flipped out
here. But you know, know this, uh,

272
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,900
that's what I wanted to say in
the bank, but I didn't, okay.

273
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:21,140
I just fucking kept my cool. But
like you work at the bank, I don't,

274
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:25,100
I need you to do this transaction. I
have money in your bank. Back in the day,

275
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:29,150
you guys used to give like 10%
8% on fucking money in the bank.

276
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:32,360
You now give like 0.0001%.

277
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,300
Okay?
So now you don't give me any money on it.

278
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,320
You've alone 10 times out on what I
fucking have there. You guys invent money.

279
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:43,260
You're literally counterfeiters.
And now I have to go in there.

280
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,380
You guys nuke the fucking economy every
eight fucking years building housing

281
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,280
bubbles at whatever and you
don't go to jail for it.

282
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:54,340
And you leave Americans upside down in
their houses. You don't give a fuck.

283
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:57,960
And then on top of that, I got to go in
and read the fucking numbers off to you.

284
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,203
Fuck off.

285
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,340
I know this is childish for me to be
sitting here alone, losing my mind. But I,

286
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,510
I cannot lie to you and not tell you how
fucking good this feels to get this out

287
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:15,570
of me.
You know,

288
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:20,571
part of my meditation today is I'm
actually doing this series on patients

289
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,670
swear to God.
And the guy said,

290
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,580
um, Oh God, what the fuck did he say?
It almost made me mad when I was like,

291
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,310
I wanted to debate with the guy,
but I can't cause it's just a recording.

292
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,200
He basically said that when
you lose your patients,

293
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,970
it's because you have expectations
of other people. Okay.

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,270
And then when you react to that,

295
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,150
it's like your fault for reacting to it,
for having your,

296
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,580
you're wrong to have these
expectations of people.

297
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,950
MMM.

298
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,020
And I'm thinking in my head like,

299
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,230
like does that doesn't make
it, I like, I'm at this point,

300
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:11,231
I'm wrong that I expect people to put in
an effort at the job the way that I do

301
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,560
and the way that I did.
And I'm not patting myself on the back,

302
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,830
but when I fucking, I
always, any job I had,

303
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,010
I fucking killed it unless I just
literally didn't have the talent.

304
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:24,440
Like construction. I just, I
mean I could bring you the shit.

305
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,930
I just didn't have that gift.

306
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,990
Well I tried to sell health insurance.
I just wasn't good at it.

307
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,831
And you know what I did?

308
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:35,460
I had the decency with both of those
jobs to quit within a week and a half.

309
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,290
I didn't fucking sit there and torture
people and just suck at my job as they

310
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,830
came walking in or worse,
try to make them do part of my job.

311
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,970
So I'm listening to this guy and he's
Casey's talking in a very soothing voice

312
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:55,900
like this, some sort of British
accent. When we walk in there,

313
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,490
we have ted space. Hello
again. Welcome to headspace.

314
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,360
When we have expectations of other people,

315
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,500
gives us a tendency to, he tries to
like let loose, these are patient.

316
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,200
I get it. Don't get all
fucking jolly cause you know
that. You know what he does?

317
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,110
He's doing that because he knows is an
angry cunt like me laying on the ground

318
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:23,430
going like, okay, so now you're,
you're defending this guy at the bank.

319
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,270
You weren't even fucking there.
You know?

320
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,110
So now basically what you're saying is,

321
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,580
in order for me to have patients,

322
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,240
I have to basically treat people
the way I treat my daughter,

323
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,740
which is I understand that she's a
baby and doesn't know anything yet,

324
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,123
you know,

325
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,720
so I have to have
100% patients with her,

326
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:55,440
which I do,
but that's because she's a baby.

327
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,370
So now I'm supposed to walk in and sit
across from a 27 year old guy and his,

328
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:05,280
you're gonna like the way you look.
I guarantee it fucking suit.

329
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,190
And as he tells me to do what, uh, how,

330
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,880
how could I have done that better?

331
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,340
I guess what I should've said is,
sir, I don't mean any disrespect,

332
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,110
but I'm not going to read
those numbers to you.

333
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,150
I feel that you work at the bank and
I am the customer and I feel that that

334
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,750
crosses a boundary that I'm,
I'm not comfortable with.

335
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,300
Well, I guess I could
have said that. Right.

336
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,800
And like when he exhales, I probably
shouldn't, like when he exhaled, like I,

337
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:42,740
it was like someone's fucking twisted the
knife in my back. I wanted to fucking,

338
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:47,680
she's like, did you just fucking
exhale? Yeah. Once again,

339
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:51,610
I guess I had expectations that this guy,
you know,

340
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,260
I had the ability to fucking look at a
paper with all the answers to the test on

341
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,590
it while typing at the same
time. I mean, I can do that.

342
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,550
I could do that for half a page and I
only make a couple of mistakes and I

343
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,620
taught myself how to do it.
What the fuck,

344
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,600
how much more easier does life have
to be? And then not, well, you know,

345
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,460
I was also thinking when I left,
it was like, you know something,

346
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,260
my wife would have just read
the numbers off to them.

347
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,900
She would have read the numbers off to
them and then afterwards I would have

348
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,630
said like, why did you just do that? You
did your job. She goes, well, you know,

349
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,820
you're right. You're right. You know,
I probably shouldn't have done that.

350
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,010
But you know, it got it
done quick. You know,

351
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,560
I just didn't wanna have the argument
blow bunch continues on, you know,

352
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,610
and she's a way,
way happier person on paper.

353
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:40,420
I think on paper,
I know,

354
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,670
did you know something to
think about women is the, the,

355
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,280
the big red flag is the level of,

356
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:52,270
of shopping that they do and the amount
of shit that they buy. Like that's,

357
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,540
I dunno, yeah. Does this,

358
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,310
there's a fucking unhappiness there.

359
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:01,160
There's something psychotic
going on with just the amount,

360
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:06,161
the sheer amount of clothes and shit
that they buy and just stuff that they

361
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,840
fucking by.
Um,

362
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,450
I don't see tranquility in it.

363
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,020
I just feel like that's like eating
fucking, you know, see's candies. Just,

364
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,570
they just love having that
ups drivers showing up in, Oh,

365
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,950
it's a little package for me.
You know,

366
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,990
I actually judge how well
my relationship's going by
how often the fucking ups

367
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:32,820
driver comes through the door.
If he's coming a lot,

368
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,030
then I need to take her out to
dinner or something. If, you know,

369
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,310
if he's coming every once in awhile,

370
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,270
they're not just her doing the woman
thing of basically a, you know,

371
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,700
fucking kicking our retirement right in
the seats. All right. I didn't need to go.

372
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm okay. Whatever. I
apologize to everybody.

373
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:54,060
I apologize that first guy to
fucking Verizon store. I, uh,

374
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:57,510
I apologize for the way I conveyed
what I was trying to say to the,

375
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,070
to the David Blaine looking
dude at the bank. You know,

376
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,760
I don't know. Maybe it's a new world.
Maybe I'm just a fucking old guy.

377
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,540
Maybe that's why I don't fucking
know. I don't, I don't know.

378
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,400
I still think I'm right,

379
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,230
but I'm going to learn in the future and
our tab expectations of people and just

380
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:19,770
sit there is that sense of my life.

381
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,270
Slip away waiting for somebody to do their
fucking job that they get paid to do.

382
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,360
Um, anyways, anybody wants some moto
GP fucking motorcycle race yesterday.

383
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,640
Another great one. Back to back. Fucking
great races. Congratulations to them.

384
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,183
Ah,

385
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,170
Marcus. Oh my God. Did you hear his
fucking interview afterwards? Oh,

386
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,400
it was fucking hilarious. First of all,
it's all these guys can speak English,

387
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:51,320
but he searches for the English
words while go in the air.

388
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,380
He did two fucking one's so
fucking long. They go, mark,

389
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,940
congratulations. Great victory,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

390
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:03,390
I didn't fill out dead today is I uh,
it was that,

391
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,883
uh,

392
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,400
[inaudible] minded me. Taylor Negron.

393
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,570
Greg rested piece is great joke when he's,
you don't want carpets.

394
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,060
You want an og. Remember
the area rug joke?

395
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,880
Um, anyways, bought a fucking race and
a, I got to look at the standings here.

396
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,910
I think that that put mark mark has,
she sees on top.

397
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,370
He's on top of the leader board.
I'm the lead of Ford Board.

398
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,630
Sorry. Um, Mark Marquez.
Fucking, oh, come on.

399
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:40,390
You don't have expectations.

400
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:44,950
Don't have expectations of the Internet
that it's actually going to work.

401
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,870
Why would it work? Why would it
work when you would need it to work?

402
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:52,870
Just laugh.
Make a note of it.

403
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,660
Make a note of a difficult
time in your life.

404
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,300
Put it on the clothes line and send
it on down and stay. Just remember,

405
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,900
you're not reacting. You're
observing. You're just

406
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,830
take you sitting on a park bench watching
traffic go by except the trafficker or

407
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,500
your thoughts.
Oh look,

408
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,560
the requested URL cannot be retrieved.

409
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,950
I'm going to have no reaction to this.

410
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm just going to sit here and let
my podcast slowly sink into the abyss

411
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,780
if something completely not even
remotely funny. Alright, here we go.

412
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,930
Where the fuck are we by the way?
You know

413
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,210
this fucking website stinks.

414
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,170
Can you think of these guys are fucking
putting their lives on the line.

415
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,620
It'd be a little easier to navigate.
Weighted wait,

416
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,690
does that mean having fucking ex
expectations again? All right.

417
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,800
Mark Marquez is in the league.
Hundred 29 points.

418
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,880
Was this what the points that
they got from yesterday? Oh,

419
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:02,390
this looks like from what
they got yesterday. Um,

420
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,250
congratulations to that kid. Maverick.
Venal Bill Nez. Is that the guy though?

421
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,170
I thought he was German.
I don't think I have the wrong guy.

422
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:11,840
This might be the wrong list.
It says GP world standing.

423
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,480
There was some guy that
came in second place.

424
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:18,530
It was the first time he's ever been on
a podium this year. Hold on a second.

425
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,090
This is so fucking irritating.

426
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,503
Where is it?

427
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,690
Oh, they haven't done that one yet. I
bought this one every day is Deutschland.

428
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:29,030
There we go.
See I had the wrong one.

429
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,720
I add the word now where the fuck is,

430
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:36,730
he thought there was some German guy
that came in second yesterday says Danny

431
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,970
Pedrosa from Spain came in.

432
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:46,430
So wherever the fuck the guy was that
came in second congratulations and

433
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,380
actually learned something when I
was watching the race as far as,

434
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,093
mmm.

435
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,570
Just how amazing that these guys come
flying down the straightaway there in the

436
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,670
Tuck and I love when they all,

437
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,940
they fucking pop up and they stick
that God damn leg out. Right.

438
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,520
I always feel like they're going
to fall off the bike at that point.

439
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,820
And then it's all when you
break how you take the turn.

440
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,490
And this kid who was in
second place came into the,

441
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:13,480
I think it was turn one and
he just came in too hot,

442
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:17,650
which caused him to go wide and Mark
Marquez did it perfectly and he just went

443
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:20,080
right underneath them.
And uh,

444
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,380
but I guess you guys said something to
the effect that he heated up his tires

445
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,560
when you break that heart or something
and then you don't get as good a grip.

446
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,650
And that was basically,
what did they say something he,

447
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm not create space or something
but broke away from her.

448
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,200
He broke them or something.
I don't know.

449
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm still learning the terminology
but they're fucking amazing.

450
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,340
You guys got to get into this moto GP
consisting is literally it's 28 fucking

451
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,940
laps and you watching people
on motorcycles driving
200 miles an hour or 320

452
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:51,790
kilometers, which I've learned every 50
miles an hour is about 80 kilometers.

453
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,120
So always I always have to do the fucking
math but it's easy because they're

454
00:27:55,121 --> 00:28:00,121
basically doing what like like I dunno
like a 240 to 320 kilometers except when

455
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:04,840
they're in the turns obviously. So they
basically go on about 150 miles an hour,

456
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,460
140 all the way up to like 200 the
Italian wants to crazy one with this,

457
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,570
the straightaway where they actually
get up over 200 miles an hour.

458
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:18,130
I mean I just,
and their ability to fall,

459
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:18,941
how they fall,

460
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:22,360
even fall off the bikes gracefully
unless the high side him and then the

461
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:26,740
technology of the soup with is like
an airbag in the suit that immediately

462
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:30,430
detects that you fallen off your bike
and inflates it, protects you vitals.

463
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,120
And then the leather is just such
high quality or whatever they got.

464
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,490
They just slide down the
track and they get up.

465
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah.

466
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,270
Do they stay fucking wipe out at 200
miles an hour and they get up like they

467
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:45,690
fell off a tire swing at a cookout.
That's fucking unreal.

468
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,970
So congratulations to Mark Marquez.
Um,

469
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm a big Ducati fan, so I like,
uh, I root for the fucking, uh,

470
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,730
I wrote for the Italians,
you know, I liked that guy.

471
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,450
A what's in it, you know, it was
great. Is that guy from Britain though?

472
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,590
Who is actually going to Honda?
That cal crutch low.

473
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:07,220
He fucking rides like a maniac.
I also like Johan Zarko.

474
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,120
He's from France. He
rides a Yamaha, but uh,

475
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,440
divisio so I like, I just love Ducati's.
I think they're a fucking work of art.

476
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,360
But if you ever wondered
how much those bikes,

477
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,950
because I think they were like the
worth like two, $2 million, those bikes,

478
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,900
I'm like that million,
2 million bucks. Um,

479
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,160
I love when they're going
down the straightaway and
they fucking given so much

480
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,320
throttle that the front
tire comes up a little bit.

481
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,620
You gotta understand at that point you're
going 200 miles an hour and you don't

482
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,880
have the urban that split second.

483
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,881
You don't have the ability to steer when
your tire was off to be on the fucking

484
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,440
balls that those guys have. I stopped
riding a bike because I couldn't ride,

485
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,280
you know, but actually know something.
Probably riding the streets of La

486
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,240
in your fucking dad jeans with
your leather jacket on. That's way.

487
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,730
And that is way more dangerous.

488
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:59,540
I don't have a fucking airbag
Fiverr get a motorcycle again.

489
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,600
I want to buy one of those
moto GP fucking suits.

490
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,710
But the thing about it is,
is even if you fall off,

491
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,150
even if the fucking thing like
inflates and all that shit,

492
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,610
the differences is that the track,

493
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,760
you don't have to worry about somebody
coming in from the left or the right

494
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:21,680
driving a bus or an SUV and running
you over and crushing you. Um,

495
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,720
that's basically it because I have to say,
I would love in a perfect world,

496
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,830
in a perfect world, I would love,
I would love to have a Ducati.

497
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,370
I've never written one, but everybody
I know that ever rode, wants to do.

498
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:37,130
You never ride anything else. I need
saline. Like, um, uh, like I said,

499
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm a big fan of fucking machines and uh,
there's this one on,

500
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,800
there's a out here in la on last Sienna
got this one and write that right up the

501
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,970
street from this vegetarian place when
I'm not being a fucking Moron and eating

502
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:54,971
shitty pizza and drinking booze and
smoking cigars like an asshole from eating

503
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,890
right when every time I go there,
I always got a pop in there

504
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,550
and then the guys away. Can I help
you? I just want to be like, Nah,

505
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:08,470
I'm just as scared married guy with too
much to lose. Just drew. I'm, you know,

506
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:09,850
I'm going to say that
next time I come in there,

507
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,970
gone in this so many times. The guy
probably knows me. Um, all right,

508
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,470
let me read some of these.

And lastly,

530
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:51,740
but not leastly movement watches.

531
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,080
Talk about your personal experience
with your watch. Um, I liked it.

532
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:01,730
My Watch listens to me. I feel like
for me when I put on a movement,

533
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:06,590
watch people respect me more.
The company started by the company,

534
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:09,320
started by two broke college kids
I always loved that were broke.

535
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,490
Let's start a company. How does that
work? Uh, they wanted to wear stylists,

536
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,550
watches, but couldn't afford them. So
they started their own watch company.

537
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,740
Cause God knows starting your own company
is cheaper than buying a fucking watch.

538
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,630
How is it this like your, how is this
like how you started build a following,

539
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,140
launched into a podcast,
youtube, radio, etc.

540
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,660
I'd say exact same way except I didn't
eat anything other than gas money.

541
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,370
I commend these two broke college kids
that were able to start their own fucking

542
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,730
company. I don't know
how you did that. Um,

543
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,110
how I've started everything in my
business is I always worked for free for a

544
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:48,980
long fucking time and then
eventually made some money. Um,

545
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,960
and I had some shit thrown
at me on the way up.

546
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,100
A movement watches start at just start
at just $95 at a department store.

547
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,600
You're looking at four to 500 bucks.
You know why?

548
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,030
Cause they got paid for
the overhead of the store.

549
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,480
Mood figured out that by selling online
they were able to cut out the middleman

550
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,260
and retail markup providing the
best possible price. Classic design,

551
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:12,170
Quality Construction and style.
The minimalism.

554
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:26,300
I've been getting compliments ever
since I put it on. Why do they do that?

555
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,300
I guess I'm supposed to read it
beforehand. I don't even know I am.

556
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,170
I don't have a movement. Watch on
me right now. I gave it to Andrew.

557
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:37,130
He fucking loves it on a bed. He's getting
complex, right? Compliments right now.

558
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,520
I have a watch. I don't
know where it is. All right?

559
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,340
So I'm not getting any compliments
on my fucking freckled wrists.

560

Now it's time to step up your watch game.
Go to movement.com and v

561
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,830
empty.com join the movement. Oh slash
birth joined the movement. All right.

562
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,720
Okay. Uh, all things comedy. Oh, here we
go. All things comedy. My comedy network,

563
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:01,550
which is producing its
first standup special,

564
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:06,170
starring a Trenton New Jersey Zone,
Paul Versey.

565
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,770
It's going to be taping August 13th.
All right,

566
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,770
tickets are going fast.
You're going to want to be there,

567
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:15,440
me and Pete Davidson and going to come
out and do a little smothers brothers

568
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,120
shit up front.

569
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,700
I think we're just going to go up with
a notebook and try out new material and

570
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,350
just shit on each other as new jokes where
everybody's going to have a good time

571
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,350
and then Paul's going to come
out and absolutely crush it.

572
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:25,130
And I have to tell you,

573
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,540
he killed so fucking hard
this weekend up at um,

574
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,580
uh, what the fuck is it called? A
port Chester the Capitol Theater.

575
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,980
I told them on the first night,
I said,

576
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,270
you're officially not a
fucking opener anymore.

577
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,140
The level of laughs that you're getting
and the quality of material that you're

578
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,190
doing, it sets it, you know, I'd sit,

579
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,250
he's going to be a fucking nationally
fucking selling out headliners soon and

580
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,394
I'm going to miss them.

581
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,513
Ooh.

582
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:56,701
Um,

583
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:01,440

00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,190

You got a c p a t r e o n
patrion.com/all things comedy.

590
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,620
I did a Sunday vlog before Monday video.
I actually had a great time doing it. Uh,

591
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,150
Al Madrigals, new podcasts, secret
of my success and the first episode,

592
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:44,180
a features Philippe as Rza. Um, all right,

593
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,090
so I talk about everything I
wanted to talk about. Okay.

594
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:51,900
Talk helicopters for a second.
So I got back into flying those fuckers.

595
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:56,610
I fly once a week. I have a great time.
And, uh, last week I flew great. You know,

596
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,390
I just, you know, I didn't really
have to look down at my altitude.

597
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,740
I was just able to maintain it,

598
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:05,880
pull in 19 inches on the
fucking a fucking inches gauge.

599
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,810
They would have the fuck you call it.
Um,

600
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,880
so I'm getting ready to solo again and um,

601
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,650
you know, it's, it's the fucking
hobby costs the God damn fortune.

602
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:23,850
So I was sitting there thinking like, you
know, buy a helicopter with a fucking,

603
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:28,560
I could just, you know, it can get really
good at this because I love it. So um,

604
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,260
oh my daughter's crying.

605
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,630
She wants to just woke up.
Anyways. Um, so the one,

606
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,130
I'm not going to say the name
of the one that I've flown,

607
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:42,630
even though I've said
it before, okay. This,

608
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,790
this certain things with
the design of that thing,

609
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:47,130
it's a two bladed main rotor system.

610
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,640
It's over slung and semi articulate it
all this fucking ground school shit.

611
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:56,400
But basically because of that, if you
were for whatever stupid fucking reason,

612
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:01,401
if you slam the stick forward and
got yourself into a low g situation,

613
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,230
which is basically you'd feel
like you are light in the seat,

614
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:09,030
like there's a chance that you risk mass
bumping, you risk sharing off the tail.

615
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,470
You risk fucking with the mass bumping
the main rotor, literally spinning off.

616
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,760
You watch it a, there's that thing
that's producing lift. Right?

617
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,650
And then you just crash to the ground.
Or if you get into a low g situation,

618
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,130
literally the fucking thing could just
start rolling to the right because the

619
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,430
rear tail rotor is now compensating
for the fucking main rotor that,

620
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,140
that the helicopter is not loaded
underneath anymore. So when,

621
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,140
when you go to the right,

622
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,350
rather than think all my God
go to the left with the stick,

623
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:43,120
you're actually supposed to go gentle,
gentle as you fucking rolling over. Like,

624
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,430
Holy Shit,
am I going to be upside down in a second?

625
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,170
You rather than go back to the left,

626
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:52,171
you're supposed to fucking override that
intuitive move and you're supposed to

627
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:57,280
go gentle aft cyclic so you don't
share your fucking Goddamn tail off.

628
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,210
And, uh, you know,

629
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,720
people with very little hours all the
way up to people with a ton of fucking

630
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,670
hours have died in those fucking things.

631
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,770
And the company that makes them rather
than fixing that fucking problem has just

632
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,460
basically told people what to
do when that problem arises.

633
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:16,120
And if you don't do it correctly
and you fucking die, they blame you.

634
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,990
You know? So it's a lot like being
in a relationship with a woman

635
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,040
in that it's always going to be
your fault. It's not what they did,

636
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:34,270
it's how you reacted to it.
So you know,

637
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,610
in order to get the a fully articulated,
uh,

638
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,930
main rotor system where you can fucking
basically is my instructor said fly like

639
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:47,470
an Asshole, which is stabbed
the thing forward. You know,

640
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,230
I don't think on any of them you really
should be doing any sort of quick

641
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:51,070
fucking movements.

642
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:54,640
I don't think quick movements in any
aviation has never fucking good unless

643
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:57,030
you're getting shot at and
you're in a fucking [inaudible].

644
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,850
But any sort of mass bumping,
low g, none of that bolt,

645
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,440
like that's all taken off the table.
But the problem is is to buy one of those.

646
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:10,030
They're like, well over a million
dollars. So that kind of bugged me.

647
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:14,320
So I just kept doing my research
and I found this French helicopter,

648
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm going to say it wrong.

649
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:21,070
It's G U I M B A l gamble Cabri g two
and it's a little more expensive than the

650
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:28,120
one that I fly. It has a fully
articulated main rotor system.

651
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,210
And then all these other
features, I forget what you
call it, when, when the, uh,

652
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,760
the tail rotor is completely enclosed.
You don't,

653
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:41,200
one of the major causes of deaths is
like people walking into the fucking rear

654
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:45,710
tail rotor. You, they just, I don't
know. They just don't see it. So this,

655
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,780
see why you have a passenger,

656
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:49,450
you have to tell them to stay in the
fucking thing until they shut it off.

657
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:54,451
Because I still don't know how you
walk into a fan that's making that much

658
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,170
noise, but they do it.
Um, they solve that.

659
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,820
They got like these,

660
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,510
I don't have these rubber fucking
bushings and all this shit that, you know,

661
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,570
like if you land, you're not
going to turn your fucking spine.

662
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,440
If you have a hard landing, you're not
gonna turn your spine in the Goddamn, uh,

663
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,420
you know, gunpowder. Um,

664
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,800
I really just wish I had the article here.

665
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,710
All of this shit that they had.

666
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,160
It's basically they looked at what I
flew in, they addressed everything.

667
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,930
And then for an extra, you
know, half a bag of cash,

668
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,690
you can fly this thing
and not have to deal with,

669
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:37,550
with any of these fucking safety issues.
And um,

670
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,220
I looked it up and basically the only
problem with it is because it's so safe

671
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:47,750
now. People are flying like assholes
and they've had three of them crash.

672
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,600
And one of this,
one of the guys that crashed,

673
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,850
and I don't want to laugh cause
I don't know if they died or not,

674
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,910
but what they did still a carborated
engine, right? So you can deal,

675
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,690
you know, you always have to
pull your carburetor. He had,

676
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,980
cause you don't want the fucking, if it
freezes up on you, the engine shuts off.

677
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:04,814
And you know,

678
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,550
you don't have to know a lot about
aviation that that's not a good thing.

679
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:10,910
So with this fucking guy did,
was to show somebody that this,

680
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,340
you can fucking stab the stick forward.

681
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,790
He stabbed it forward and
started like nose dive and down.

682
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,580
And because of the way the fuel line was,

683
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:22,580
it caused not enough fuel to be going
through the carburetor and he fucking

684
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,110
stole.
But why do people do that?

685
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,370
If I ever got one of those things,
I would still fly it the way I fly,

686
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:34,370
the fucking thing that I fly now.

687
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,280
And I would just feel lucky that,
you know,

688
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,930
God forbid if I was ever flying and
I hit some turbulence that caused,

689
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,100
you know, the helicopter to fucking
nose over or something like that,

690
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:50,150
I don't have to worry about me rolling
to the right and having to remember to

691
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,560
slowly go aft cyclic to
fucking reload the thing. Um,

692
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,890
I mean that actually affects like
where I fly out here the time of year.

693
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:00,860
Like I won't go out until like the fucking
desert or something like that during

694
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:05,060
the summer because I don't need all
that fucking turbulent air throwing me

695
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:07,910
around knowing at any second I
could start rolling to the right.

696
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:12,320
I just don't want to deal with that
shit. So I find this fucking thing. Now,

697
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:16,400
the only downside that I've found,
there's always a downside, right? Um,

698
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,700
is that this thing,
because it's European,

699
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:22,520
the main rotor actually
spins the other way,

700
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,220
which I didn't think would be that big
a deal. But what it actually does is,

701
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,300
is all my muscle memory is
for a main rotor that goes
counterclockwise, suspense,

702
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,180
clockwise. All of times when I think
left pedal, it's now right pedal.

703
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,590
But I talked to my instructor,

704
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:39,650
he said it's about three hours and you
start getting it down and then you find,

705
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,280
but then, you know, three hours, I mean,
three hours. I get to fly in a helicopter,

706
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:44,330
I have a great fucking time.

707
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:48,800
And then I just keep flying
the same one every time.

708
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,280
Then I get it down and then I have
this really safe thing that I could fly

709
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:52,520
around.

710
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,280
It's got a little compartment you can put
stuff in and it's a little fucking two

711
00:43:55,281 --> 00:44:00,140
seater. Check it out. G u.
I. M. B. A. L. Cabrice, g. A.

712
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,370
B. R. I. G. Two. I mean, I
think they're the shit. Um,

713
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,360
there's always concerns with any
fucking new helicopter, whatever.

714
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:11,810
But I just feel like it addressed
all the safety issues that fucking,

715
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,030
you know, anytime I solo,
I'm just thinking about that,

716
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,180
which is good because I had, you know,
the guys that trained me were great.

717
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:23,540
So I'm always thinking
about that shit and um,

718
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,221
but you know,

719
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,390
you read up on it a lot and yet it
becomes like this fucking terrifying thing

720
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:33,180
that I really don't feel like, uh,
I don't feel like dealing with. So,

721
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,590
um, I dunno. I just want, you know,
you don't want to really wish,

722
00:44:39,591 --> 00:44:41,730
I just wish fucking school's around here,

723
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,440
start buying those things so I can
rent those instead. Because I mean,

724
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,333
okay,

725
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,110
it's still too much money. There's so much
fucking money, but I'm just saying it,

726
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,780
you know,
in a fantasy world,

727
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:55,500
I would have one of those and I'd ride a
Ducati to it with an airbag suit on and

728
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:57,930
they'd be no bus to run me over a five.
A fucking laid it down.

729
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,880
But we all know that that's
not the case. So, you know,

730
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,080
maybe I'll just get a poster and
put it on the wall and my girls,

731
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,160
Roger,
that's what

732
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,650
it's a been a married guy.
Is he in your garage?

733
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:10,870
You have a poster of all this shit
you'd buy if you didn't have the

734
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:14,610
responsibilities? Um, Oh God, that's that.

735
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,840
That actually made me a little sad.
All right.

736
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:20,950
F I know this is some people up in Oregon
that sell them. I believe they finally,

737
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,360
uh, they got, I guess rated over here,
whatever the terminology is, but, um,

738
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:30,190
I fucking love him and it's a great look
and helicopter too. I fucking love him,

739
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:33,970
man. I'm hoping more so. I'm just
giving them free advertising open.

740
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:38,320
More people start to use them. All
right. F one eight s Billy boy,

741
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,900
uh, Mercedes has 1500 people
working on two cars simultaneously.

742
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:49,290
1,498 of which probably
went to prestigious colleges
and graduate schools of

743
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,720
none of which get to race these cars.

744
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:56,890
The two employees that raced
these inverted rocket ship cars,

745
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,930
hated school. His kids, at least Lewis
Hamilton admitted to it. Your thoughts.

746
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,140
Um, oh, what did the Tom Brady gets
all the fucking credit. Well, yeah,

747
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,490
okay.

748
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,910
Absolutely. This is, this is
like white hidden figures.

749
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,980
The end of the day, the person
that gets in the fucking rocket,

750
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,470
you know,
be it the monkey,

751
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:25,820
the dog or a fucking human being who
gets in the thing and actually fucking

752
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:29,930
rides it.
You know,

753
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:33,890
what do you want to those 1,498 people
of Lewis Hamilton had a fatal fucking

754
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:34,670
accident.

755
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,050
They have the luxury of walking around
away from it feeling bad that had

756
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:42,440
happened. Where is
Louis would be dead. So,

757
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,363
okay.

758
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,360
That's why he gets to Bang Rihanna. I
mean, I don't know what to tell you. Um,

759
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,460
I thought you were going to explain why.

760
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,100
Uh,
yeah,

761
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,320
the Mercedes team and the
Ferrari team are so much,

762
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,060
you know, better than everybody else.
But in the more I read about f one,

763
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:04,730
it seems like people go through phases.
Like I said,

764
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:08,450
red bull won three years in a row.
Mclaren used to be the shit.

765
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:13,070
A Martini. Williams had
their run. So I don't know,

766
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:16,220
maybe this is just the era of,
of the Mercedes and funny all Ferrari's,

767
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:19,730
but doing shit for a long time obviously
got us the biggest understatement ever.

768
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,810
I'll never forget the look on that guy's
face when I said when I said good race

769
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:28,700
after Montreal when uh, they came in like
eighth or no, he came in like fourth.

770
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,410
Just the guy go from a vet will go from
the back all the way up to almost a

771
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,920
podium is what I was trying to say.
And this guy fucking looked at me.

772
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,380
MMM [inaudible]

773
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,970
I thought it was a dead man. Anyways, he
goes, lots of luck at count Basie theater.

774
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,670
Hope you kill it will not be in attendance
to do you guessed it. School. Ciao.

775
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,970
All right. Father and son circumnavigate
navigating globe in a helicopter.

776
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,770
Well,
how the fuck do you do that?

777
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,530
You'd have to go up to
Alaska crossover to Russia.

778
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,250
Oh,
I got to see this.

779
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,063
Hey Bill

780
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,180
thought you might find this interesting.

781
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,450
Canadian father and son
are circumnavigating the
globe in a helicopter.

782
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:16,560
Here's a link to the article. Oh,
that's nothing about that helicopters.

783
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,770
It can fly up to like five
hours where the one I fly,

784
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,730
I mean two and a half hours and then
you put it on the ground. So, um,

785
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,480
I dunno. It's fucking amazing.
Oh No, I would look at this.

786
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:33,020
I got to copy and paste this.
Let's stay patient. Let's just,

787
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,880
just note this thought here. You're
sitting on the bus watching the trend,

788
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,390
not on the bus.
I'm sitting on a bench waiting for a bus,

789
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,450
watching the traffic going.

790
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,900
Bye. Oh, come on. You fucking cut.

791
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,330
So that difficult.

792
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,150
All right. Take off a
helicopter. Father and son,

793
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:57,710
team begin global odyssey to look at
their fucking helicopter. Holy Shit.

794
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:00,420
Wow.

795
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,840
Yeah. These guys are the real
deal though. Do they get sponsors?

796
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,640
They have fucking flight suits.

797
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,630
Bob and Steve Dangler embark on a 39,000
kilometer trip around the world to

798
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:17,990
celebrate Canadian history
and support charities.

799
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,710
That's kind of annoying. Flying through
your country and the celebrating Canada.

800
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,480
Go Fuck Yourself. Celebrate the world of
fly around us. Um, for a year and a half,

801
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:28,171
my father,

802
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:32,580
Bob and I have been planning
and organizing a journey
we call c one 50 global

803
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:33,630
odyssey.
It was,

804
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,920
it's the first Canadian circumnavigation
of the globe by helicopter and the

805
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:41,130
world's first ever father,
son aerial circumnavigation.

806
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,060
I don't give a shit about all of this
other than you and your plan. Oh,

807
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:46,110
here we go.

808
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:47,880
Okay,

809
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,180
here we go. Oh, you know what? I
guess they're cool with Russia.

810
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,180
They're cool with Russia. So there, I
don't know where they're going. Okay.

811
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,680
They start the start.
Finish.

812
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,133
Okay.

813
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,320
Uh, but looks to be somewhere
in the Toronto area. All right,

814
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:10,620
so they're going to zigzag across.
Oh, they're going the other way.

815
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,450
They're going to zig over to the fucking
maritimes up to fucking Greenland.

816
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,770
Jesus.
That's fucking scary right there.

817
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,750
Over that fucking ice cold water.

818
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,610
Then Greenland of fucking Iceland.
How long is that flight?

819
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,280
Iceland over the fucking Ireland down into

820
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:37,030
Perry Cross Europe. Uh, Christ fucking,

821
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,740
oh, I'm sorry. England. That's
England there. Okay. Yeah.

822
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,800
And they go across to Eastern Europe,
then right through Moscow to Russia.

823
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,750
Right back over to fucking,
anybody can crossover to Alaska.

824
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:54,330
And then they come back down to Vancouver,

825
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,730
up to fucking yellow knife
for whatever fucking reason,

826
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,200
I guess to celebrating Canada.

827
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:03,050
You have to go with those fucking
rocky mountains too. That's scary. Uh,

828
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,890
we start in Vaughan and our first stop
is the Canadian aviation and Space Museum

829
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:10,310
in Ottawa where a grand send
off his planned from there.

830
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:13,940
We fly east along St Lords
to Newfoundland. I guess
I could have read this.

831
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,920
Instead of trying to guess with their map

832
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,560
north along the coast of Labrador tea
equals

833
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:27,370
equality,
eat east and through Greenland and Iceland

834
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,840
and the Faroe Islands to the UK.
Then through Europe and into Russia,

835
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,620
a full third of our trip is
through Russia. Exclamation point.

836
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:41,170
They're excited because they're Canadian.
They get along people.

837
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,300
We returned to northern North America
via Alaska and then Zig Zag and Canada to

838
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,150
visit as many places as possible.

839
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,020
We finish up back in Vaughan
taking 35 to 40 days in total.

840
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,370
We'll be flying some of the far most
far flung and beautiful places in Canada

841
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,730
and drinking deeply from
its diverse beauty. Oh,

842
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,590
I thought it'd be booze and I was like,
these guys are nuts. Urban skylines,

843
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:09,400
Arctic seas. When sa you
modify it. God bless these two.

844
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,010
What a great fucking thing to do.
More importantly,

845
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:17,510
what kind of helicopters at that's
a fully articulated rotor system.

846
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:23,360
No, fucking rolling over the
writers. Your Dad's slide in India.

847
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,290
Um,
Holy Shit.

848
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,400
That's fucking amazing.
I want to keep up on them.

849
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:35,580
When did they say they're doing it?
Starting July 1st.

850
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,740
They're already off on their way going.
Can I follow it?

851
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,030
Do like a dad and son
Amelia Earhart,

852
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,210
except they're gonna make it right.
All right, well good for them.

853
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,590
What a helicopter talk this
week. All right, here we go.

854
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,610
Weird new new coworker. Uh,
hey Billy, hold your nuts.

855
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:02,070
I might've gone over the line at work
and want to know your or Nias input,

856
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,380
uh, would be, uh, would be on
this. Okay. Long Story Short,

857
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,390
I essentially quit my job today because
a coworker was taking pictures of me

858
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,300
before you jump to any conclusions here.
Me Out,

859
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:15,800
and you might agree with me in the end.
I already,

860
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,880
I don't like that somebody's taken,

861
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,540
it sounds like you didn't
want your picture taken. Uh,

862
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,330
this Monday we got a new employee that
basically acts like she's in a reality

863
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,080
show.

864
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,290
The first day I thought she might be
joking around by doing the classic go from

865
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:32,280
one person to the next and
whisper turning around,

866
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:36,030
talk about the other
employees in the room.

867
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:43,130
Okay. Go from one person to the
next and whisper turnaround.

868
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,530
Talk about the other employees in the
room because she's already talking shit

869
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,930
about everybody.
But then I realized she's just crazy.

870
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,200
She's taking pictures and videos of
all the men at work and share them with

871
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,100
their snapchat or Instagram or whatever
crap it is she's uses to communicate

872
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:58,200
with other people that are on her level.

873
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,550
It sounds like she's trying to get a
reality show herself and become famous or

874
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:04,140
something.
The first time she did this,

875
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,800
she was standing a few feet away from
me and did a one 80 jump spin that

876
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,380
would've made Dennis Rodman
proud and with a phone,

877
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,870
took a picture and said
that one was for Instagram.

878
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,070
It startled the hell out of me and I
plainly said, don't take pictures of me.

879
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:17,911
Over the day.

880
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:21,360
She continued to take pictures of the rest
of the guy without consent, of course.

881
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,070
And I got to see a couple of them.

882
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,460
One was of my bosses asked
with the texts over it.

883
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:31,620
That's said debt booty
though. Oh God, this is,

884
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:34,140
yeah, this is, somebody just spends
too much time on the Internet.

885
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,090
I don't know why you quit your job.
You should just go into,

886
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,060
don't you guys just go to HR?
Um,

887
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:43,440
so the only thing that got finally got
me was when I was restocking the shelves

888
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:47,100
and realized after walking across the
store that I felt I was being watched.

889
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,640
I looked up and saw her grinning while
holding her phone and I asked her if she

890
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:51,840
had taken a video of me.

891
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,920
She said she was taking a video of the
rain outside and I happened to walk

892
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,410
across the path,
obviously bullshit.

893
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,550
I called their bluff and asked her to
show me the video from the beginning,

894
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,830
and it's clear that it
starts and ends with me.

895
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,590
20 seconds of me wheeling
merchandise around.

896
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:12,360
You can barely see a window on the back
where you can't even tell it's raining.

897
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,070
Uh, she's standing 60 feet away
from the fucking window. All right.

898
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,530
Now before you say, Oh,
maybe she likes you to do it,

899
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:24,870
I'm on your side and wants to
see you. Uh, let me be clear.

900
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,900
No one is touching themselves to a
video of a guy with the dad bod wheeling

901
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,670
around merchandise.
It's not that,

902
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,150
and she knows I'm happy in my
relationship with my longtime girlfriend.

903
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:39,030
Regardless. I complained to
my boss who have to two days,

904
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:43,560
finally talked to her about it
and then she told me, she said,

905
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:46,650
I walked in front of a rain
video she was making. I said,

906
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,190
if it was the other way around and
it was a guy taking videos of women,

907
00:55:50,191 --> 00:55:52,800
I'm sure that would've been
grounds for dismissal. Absolutely.

908
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,090
I also forgot to mention that she went
through my boss texts when he wasn't

909
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:59,610
looking to see which
women were talking to him.

910
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,660
It pissed me off that he was more than
willing to believe that she was suddenly

911
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:08,661
a parttime media allow meteorologists
than just believing me that it was the

912
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:11,150
40th video of that kind
she was taking of us.

913
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:15,180
So I kind of snapped and told them not
to bother insulting our intelligence by

914
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:17,370
trying to believe his excuse.
And he said,

915
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:21,660
if she tells him the picture of his ass,
wait.

916
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,381
And I said,

917
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:26,500
if she tells him the picture of his ass
she took was intended to be a picture of

918
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,180
morning fog until he got in the way to
just keep it to himself. And I quit.

919
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,410
A dude just snapped. You
snapped. You know why?

920
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,400
Sorry Dude, I got the volume up
too high. You know why you snapped?

921
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:40,091
Because like me,

922
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:44,860
you had expectations and you lost your
patients and that caused you to lose your

923
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,830
fucking mind. And you know what?
You're 100% in the right. At least I'm,

924
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:52,150
I'm hearing your side of the story
here. Um, so what do you think?

925
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,040
Did I go too far?
Should I have given her time to adjust?

926
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,070
I'm sure you deal with unwanted
pictures of you every day,

927
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:05,050
but I'm not famous and I haven't done
anything to deserve this. Uh, yeah,

928
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,690
I mean, exactly. That's it. I mean,

929
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,930
you're not jumping around
like a monkey on stage. Um,

930
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:16,830
I feel like I'm being followed by
the worst Pi and I can't help it.

931
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:19,570
It gives me anxiety.
As far as I know,

932
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:23,220
she's already has pictures of me
with the eyes cut out at home. Uh,

933
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:24,101
the way I see it,

934
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:27,940
I'm not wasting time waiting until a
coworker grows up to learn the difference

935
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:30,940
between right and wrong.
She happens to be 19,

936
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:33,970
but I'm talking about mental maturity,
uh,

937
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:37,390
because I've worked alongside as teenagers
before who know perfectly well what

938
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:40,810
the appropriate way to
believe to behave at work is.

939
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,100
And this shop pays lousy enough that
it's no big loss as far as I'm concerned.

940
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:49,660
Thanks and help you and Nia have a little
and the little one have a good 4th of

941
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,150
July. You guys are a plus families as far
as I'm concerned. Thank you very much.

942
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,260
Um, I agree with you want to
present. The only thing is she's 19,

943
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,250
so I think they just need to talk to her.
I wish you didn't quit your job,

944
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,900
but it sounds like you're
not really worried.

945
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,970
So I don't think it was your dream job.
I mean,

946
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:06,010
maybe her behavior opened
the door to for something.

947
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,910
You got to turn it into a positive.
Um, and you also have to learn,

948
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,120
like I'm trying to learn
with my behavior in Verizon,

949
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,540
in the fucking bank this week.
Uh,

950
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,870
you know, I, you know what it
was, was you asked her nicely,

951
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,820
she ignored what you, what you,
you, you asked her not to do,

952
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:32,320
you went to the person of authority and
he swept it under the rug and then that

953
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:36,370
was enough to make you fucking snap.
I completely understand that. Um,

954
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,650
I think your behavior
is completely normal.

955
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,050
I'm surprised you didn't tell your
boss to go fuck himself. And, um,

956
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,880
but at the end of the day, you
know, you don't have a job now, so,

957
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,210
and you're actually a
good guy. I mean, I want,

958
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,680
what are the guys say when you quit?
He was all right with that.

959
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,083
MMM.

960
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,650
I think kids grow up today and they,

961
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,100
because they so overshare
on all of these things,

962
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,540
their boundaries with privacy
is pretty much nonexistent.

963
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:12,830
I mean,

964
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,250
there was like a famous woman took video
of an older woman naked in the locker

965
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,890
room going, oh my God, look at her
old ass. And she got him to like,

966
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,800
and like she had no idea though.

967
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:24,410
Like that's why would you do that to
somebody and somebody's mom or their

968
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:26,990
grandmother, but I dunno, people are uh,

969
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:28,920
yeah,

970
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,810
spat and I,
I gotta be honest,

971
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,660
it gets bad enough when someone comes
up to you and just takes a picture you

972
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,730
don't want, but people walk
up with the video already on.

973
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,150
Um, yeah, I I, yeah, I don't like that.

974
00:59:42,151 --> 00:59:43,990
And even with what I do,
cause you know,

975
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:49,150
they usually are extremely selfish person
and the whole moment is about them and

976
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,450
you know, that whole whoa man,
Yolo, look at my life right now.

977
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,350
Have shaken my head. Whatever the
fuck dumb shit that they're doing.

978
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,000
It really is funny though,

979
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:02,250
when you watch these fucking kids
on like Instagram and everything,

980
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:05,640
everybody's acting like they have like
a hit show and that they're like these

981
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:09,210
celebrities themselves, like
always taking like, you know,

982
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,330
snapchat is fucking pictures of
like the food they're eating,

983
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:15,510
the car that they're in,
the fucking view that they have.

984
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,190
Everybody's like acting like a,

985
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,580
I dunno if that they're flying every
trying to act like that flying around in a

986
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:23,670
fucking private jet. I don't
understand it, but I'm also,

987
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:27,870
I'm realizing that I'm fucking old
so, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I think,

988
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,270
I think you reacted in
a normal fucking way.

989
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:34,900
I wish you didn't quit your job though
because I think you're 100% right. Um,

990
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,590
in the future I would just go to HR
and when your will go to your boss,

991
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,270
when he does it, I would make a formal
complaint and that would stop it.

992
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,630
And um,
but I know,

993
01:00:46,631 --> 01:00:50,170
I would know at that point that I
would hate that 19 year olds so much.

994
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,230
That would be hard to even be
around her. Like, I have a big,

995
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,670
I have a big issue with forgiving people.
Like once you're in,

996
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,210
in the con column, it's, you know,

997
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:06,250
it's kind of a life sentence.
Um, so there you go. Yeah.

998
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:08,230
Move on with your life and just
kind of learn from the ship.

999
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,930
But a good for you for speaking up.
But I don't do anything else.

1000
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,790
Don't go back to the fucking business
like a lunatic and fucking keys,

1001
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,620
somebody's car or anything that just
fucking walk away from it. All right.

1002
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,690
Girlfriends, Opportunity.
Um, hey Billy Redwings. Uh,

1003
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,250
so my girlfriend is
really doing well at work.

1004
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,800
She's been offered a job in Switzerland.

1005
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:29,620
She would rather move in with me
and stay in the United States.

1006
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,680
I feel that she's missing out on a
great career opportunity in Chicago.

1007
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,900
I love her,
but I'm not in love with her yet.

1008
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,360
She's also considering leaving your
job too. I like our relationship,

1009
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,400
but I'm more practical.

1010
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,100
You should take advantage of things
that's come across your life.

1011
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:42,934
What are your thoughts?

1012
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,600
My thoughts are you don't have the
balls to break up with her and she's

1013
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:49,690
committing to you in a way that you're
not prepared for and you need to break up

1014
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:52,300
with her and tell her to go to
Switzerland and not quit your fucking job.

1015
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,740
That was an easy one. I love her,
but I'm not in love with her yet.

1016
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:57,371
And you're going to fund,

1017
01:01:57,371 --> 01:01:59,980
she's going to quit a job and move in
with you because she's head over fucking

1018
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:02,950
heels. Yeah, boy do. Yeah.

1019
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:08,380
Tell him to go to Switzerland and
fuck some blue eyed fucking specimen.

1020
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:13,240
A blue eyed blonde in specimen
and forget about you. All right.

1021
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:15,940
Girlfriend wants me to change
my name. Dear Bill, I'm to,

1022
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,340
I'm a huge long time fan of yours
from the younger generation.

1023
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,163
Um,
F one

1024
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,200
F ones for family is o.F is for family.
God, I can't read my name on my own.

1025
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:32,310
Fucking that's an eyeF is for
family is fucking awesome.

1026
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:35,400
Can't wait for season three to come out
to see what happens next. Well thank you.

1027
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,250
I was hoping you could give me
your 2 cents in this situation.

1028
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:42,120
I've been in a relationship
with a wonderful young lady
for over two years now.

1029
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:46,800
We met at a community college in my
state and hit it off really quickly.

1030
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,310
She's smart, outgoing, beautiful
community, college, easy. Hey,

1031
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,380
I don't know what the smart thing
there. All right. No, I'm kidding.

1032
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,110
A lot of smart people go to
community college. They do.

1033
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,600
They just fucking scatter brained. A
lot of dopes go there too. She's smart,

1034
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:04,230
outgoing, beautiful, has and has a
great sense of humor. She's tall,

1035
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:07,710
slim black girl.
While I am a greasy hair to Italian,

1036
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:09,390
white guy and we get along great.

1037
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,880
The problem first started with my dad.
He's a total racist and since we can't,

1038
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:17,760
you can't, we can't afford to
put me in a real university.

1039
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:21,870
I have to live with them.
I've tried to get him to change his ways,

1040
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:25,200
but it's like you said in your act, old
men like him come from a different era,

1041
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,240
so there's probably zero
chance I'll ever change as my,

1042
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,190
you can't change somebody's mind.
They got, they have to want to,

1043
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,880
I told my girlfriend how frustrating is
with them and she understands that even

1044
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:35,790
though my dad hates her and
doesn't want us to be together,

1045
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,820
then I'm nothing like him,
at least where it counts.

1046
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,100
Even though I can't
stand my dad's attitude,

1047
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:43,320
I know that he only wants to
only wants the best for me.

1048
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:47,010
So I try to be a good boyfriend and a
good son while keeping my father and

1049
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,300
girlfriends separate from each other.

1050
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:53,540
We also spend time out at her po or out
at her place and Shelly comes over to my

1051
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:57,210
place and my father is on a business
retreat. Jesus crisis is complex.

1052
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,770
It's really inconvenient,

1053
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:02,100
but we've been making it work for over
two years in spite of the tribulation and

1054
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:07,170
we're still going strong. Uh, it seems
like I got everything figured out.

1055
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:12,030
All right. Jesus, this is
a fucking long one. Um,

1056
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,370
it seems like I got
everything figured out, Bill.

1057
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:18,330
But here's where things get tricky.
Since I'm his first born son,

1058
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:22,890
my dad named him after
himself since same first name,

1059
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,030
middle name,
and last name.

1060
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:29,010
My girlfriend hates that the guy she's
been in a serious relationship with for a

1061
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:33,720
long time has the same name as it can
tanker old races. Daigo I like it.

1062
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:38,160
You being racist about about yourself.
Greasy Italian Daigo anyways,

1063
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:42,360
who hates her sexy black ass
for no justifiable reason.

1064
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,820
Jesus Christ. It sounds like
bad fucking dialogue in a porno.

1065
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,710
She wants me to legally change
my name completely first,

1066
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:53,190
middle and last so that there is no
connection to my father whatsoever.

1067
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,760
When I asked her what name she
thinks I should have through this,

1068
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,010
like I don't believe this,
you gotta be shitting me.

1069
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,260
She said I could change my last name
to the same as heard her own name.

1070
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,880
Last name.
Uh,

1071
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,530
Prince sees what the fuck I told
her that if it would make her happy,

1072
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:14,010
I would be willing to change my name.
But if I did that,

1073
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:18,400
my dad would feel betrayed. He would
hate her even more for stealing away,

1074
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,450
stealing only son away from him and the
rest of the family think I'm a total

1075
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,100
trying to disassociate myself from them,
which is totally not the case.

1076
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,600
She got upset with me and has given me
regular reminders since then that she's

1077
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:34,390
serious about wanting me
to go through with this.

1078
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:37,330
This isn't the first time I've
considered changing my name.

1079
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,470
Even before I started dating this woman.
It's a very Italian sounding name.

1080
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,130
So what?

1081
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:46,660
You're very Italian that people always
made fun of me for throughout schools.

1082
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:49,270
So I've come to dislike
it myself. Yeah, dude,

1083
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:52,480
you got a lot of self loathing
going on here. Tines of the shit.

1084
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:57,980
Who makes better food than
you? AH, Japanese. Uh,

1085
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,730
no. There's you guys make like the
best food in the fucking planet.

1086
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,080
The Ferrari did du Cati

1087
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:05,480
yeah,

1088
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,420
you fucking women to Mediterranean
lifestyle. Dot. What do you,

1089
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:12,320
what are you walking away from here? So
bill, what the fuck should I do here?

1090
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:14,990
How can I make things right with my
girlfriend as well as my dad without

1091
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:16,460
accepting one party or the other?

1092
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:20,330
She stopped introducing me to people
using my name and show your first to me is

1093
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,530
my boyfriend.

1094
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,910
I've been able to and circumvent
hostility between my dad and my girlfriend

1095
01:06:25,911 --> 01:06:29,180
before. But I've totally, I'm
totally lost with this one.

1096
01:06:29,181 --> 01:06:32,060
Any advice would be very much appreciated.
Thanks.

1097
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:36,680
And Go fuck yourself sincerely. That's
funny. Any fucking leaves his name.

1098
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:41,480
Um, is it deal to eat? First of all, um,

1099
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,840
this isn't about your dad and
this isn't about your girlfriend.

1100
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:49,040
This is about you. Okay? You date.
Who the fuck you want to date?

1101
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:53,870
And your name is your fucking name and
your heritage is your fucking heritage.

1102
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:59,710
All right? Like what?
What of her fucking her,

1103
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,500
her parents didn't like you because
you were white and you said, okay,

1104
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,840
you're named after your mom.
I can't stand your mom.

1105
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:09,490
Change Your fucking name and I'm going
to pick the name and it's not going to

1106
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:10,660
sound like,
you know,

1107
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,590
I guess black people don't have their
fucking ethnic names anymore. Do they?

1108
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,490
Thank you white people. But you know
what I mean? Yeah. Fuck that dude.

1109
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:22,210
You can't do that shit. You
can't do that shit. Fuck that.

1110
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,780
Your name is your name and your Italian
and you should be fucking proud of it.

1111
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,141
Okay.

1112
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:29,290
And you're not your dad and she needs to
fucking accept that you're not changing

1113
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:32,950
your fucking name and she has a problem.
She can fucking walk away.

1114
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:37,270
She can fucking walk. All right?
You know what you really need to do?

1115
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:40,090
You need to get out of your fucking house
and you need to fucking build your own

1116
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:44,020
life. Okay? Anything you need to be
with somebody like this is fucking nuts.

1117
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,450
Like I got to tell you,
dude like that.

1118
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,420
If you thought about shifts that
came from you, that's one thing.

1119
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:55,720
But the fact that she fucking wants
you to do that, that's fucking insane.

1120
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,240
Don't do it.
You know your,

1121
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,180
you're given into everybody
else and you're not,

1122
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,980
you're not staying true to yourself.

1123
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:08,730
You've got to figure out what the fuck
you want. And you have to be yourself.

1124
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:14,930
Jesus fucking Christ, man.
Your Dad is who the fuck he is.

1125
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,900
Your girlfriend is who she is
and you are who you are. Okay?

1126
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:19,700
And you should be proud
of who the fuck you are.

1127
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:25,410
Work on the stuff you need to work
on and be proud of your heritage.

1128
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,130
And I don't, I don't, I don't fucking
get that at all. You know? I know.

1129
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:30,610
I know number of people like Italians,
they always asked us to,

1130
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:33,680
to Italian sounding name.
Who fucking gives a shit?

1131
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,770
Well, I don't understand. Like I don't,
I don't know. I wouldn't do that.

1132
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,530
I miss all the fucking ethnic names.

1133
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:45,540
Everybody's like homogenize
their fucking names. Um,

1134
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,930
I think it's interesting when you
meet somebody that's like that. So I,

1135
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:56,750
I think you need to pump the
brakes here, sir. All right.

1136
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,690
Is now was getting fucking crazy and um,
yeah,

1137
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:05,680
don't do that to your dad. Don't change
your fucking name. Who gives a shit?

1138
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:10,240
He's an old crabby fucking racist. This is
a deal, dude. He's going to die someday.

1139
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,700
All right? And you're going
to continue on. So what you,

1140
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,330
what you haven't done yet is you
haven't created your own life.

1141
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:20,080
You still living at home with this guy,
so you have to fucking move out.

1142
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,320
All right? The name he gave you is
the name that he fucking gave you.

1143
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:27,970
Don't change it because of his
stupid fucking thoughts. Okay.

1144
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:32,450
Embracing the fuck you are. And if this
woman, you can't fucking deal with it,

1145
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,570
tell it a walk.
Tell her to fucking walk you young.

1146
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,390
There's plenty of fish in the fucking
seat. You know, you get Jesus Christ,

1147
01:09:40,391 --> 01:09:44,680
you're gonna fucking bend over that far.
You're bending over backwards.

1148
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:47,350
Flip you like you're fucking Jim is, you
know when they do those things to hands,

1149
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,370
foot, hand, foot, hand, foot,

1150
01:09:48,371 --> 01:09:52,360
all the way across the fucking
diagonally across the Goddamn Mat.

1151
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,810
Fuck that. Fuck all of that. You know

1152
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,060
I liked your girlfriend at first.
By the end of this fucking thing,

1153
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:02,130
I didn't like her.
Okay.

1154
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:07,340
Cause she's waging war with your
dad threw you and you're innocent.

1155
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,120
All right? You're the guy taking
her out for fucking ice cream.

1156
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,800
Why do you gotta do all this shit?
Yeah.

1157
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:16,221
With no,

1158
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:20,570
I mean Jesus Christ that without her
telling you to change your fucking name

1159
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:23,600
would be you to tell her to go get a
go. Can you get like a week, a week,

1160
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,790
like a blonde weave or some
shit like that? I mean,

1161
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,450
what the fuck you gotta be able
to fuck you are. God bless you.

1162
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:32,790
You tell [inaudible] son of a bitch,
stay Trudy average.

1163
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,190
Stay true to your fucking name.

1164
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,290
Continued not to be racist
and fucking just be yourself.

1165
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:45,150
Change your fucking name. Ah,
Jesus Christ. Anyway. All right.

1166
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:48,720
That's the podcast for this week.
