00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.848
We've now found out that if Grant sets his price per wiper blade set equal to

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:09.971
$46, he will earn the maximum profit he can of $290,000. But, of course, there

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:15.074
may be factors that prevent him from setting his price exactly equal to this

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:19.614
amount. And he wants to rule out a few other prices that would lead to the worst

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:24.233
case scenario, or at least one of the worst case scenarios, no profit at all. If

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:28.493
Grant wants to know what he would need to set his price per wiper blade set

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:32.895
equal to, to have his profit equal 0, what point or points on our graph are we

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.405
interested in? Do we want to know about the vertex, the maximum, the minimum,

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:40.459
the c-intercept or intercepts, or the p-intercept?
