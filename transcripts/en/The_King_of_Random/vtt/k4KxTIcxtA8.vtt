00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.919
What's up guys welcome back it is summertime and that means summertime grilling so for this video

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.468
I thought it might be fun to try messing around with barbecue charcoal and high voltage electricity now for this experiment today

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.009
I'm bringing back my neon sign Transformer this lovely little unit converts house power to Twelve thousand volt 30 milliamps

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.359
Which isn't a whole lot of power?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.209
But it is very high potential which will definitely make you squirm

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
If it touches you the wrong way now if you've ever really studied your charcoal briquets

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.689
Oh, probably realize that they're just pyrolized wood of course there are a few other components added in to help with your barbecue experience

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
But for the most part this is just compressed pyrolized sawdust now since we have access to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.160
12,000 volts of electricity and a piece of wood

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to show you something kind of interesting

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.389
If we take our two high voltage electrodes and touch one to the piece of wood and then bring in the other one you'll notice

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.198
Absolutely nothing happens at all that's because wood is not conductive or should I say it's not very conductive everything has a dielectric breakdown

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.749
But wood is very difficult to toss an electric current through if I bring the electrodes themselves close enough together

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.819
They'll eventually strike an arc on their own and the heat produced from the arcs will actually scorch the wood and begin to Char it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.500
As that char develops and the carbon goes deep enough eventually it will develop an electrically conductive

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.349
Path that when I bring the two electrodes close to that

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.130
It lights up a path that kind of resembles Lava flowing down the side of the volcano

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.879
The only difference is this is electricity flowing through the wood not Lava

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.309
Let's keep this going a little bit and see how far we can push it

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.649
And I can actually draw that pathway out all the way to the side of the wood

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.130
There, that's pretty cool

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.269
That's pretty cool wood by itself is not conductive

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.639
But once you burn it a little bit you can actually conduct electricity through it or at least through the carbon path that you created

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.099
within it

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.419
And this is actually a well-known fact hundreds of years ago back when Thomas Edison was developing the light bulb because he actually used pyrolized

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.929
Bamboo as the filament for his light bulb so here's the question

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.810
I have today if we can get burnt wood to conduct electricity so well then what would high voltage electricity do to charcoal

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.220
I mean theoretically this stuff is basically just carbon, so it should be conductive, right?

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.230
so for this first experiment

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.789
I'm going to take this piece of charcoal set it down on these paver stones and first of all just see if we can even

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.170
Run electricity through it at all. All right here we go. So we're going to touch one side here

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.539
So that's connected and then theoretically this electricity should just arc out and straight into the charcoal oh

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.789
I actually had to get kind of close there, but you can see that is conducting

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.910
Very cool bring one close the other close

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.879
and now it makes contact because that

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.159
Has just established a route now if I hold it here and try it somewhere else. Maybe up here I

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.359
Have to get within about a quarter of an inch right to spark up

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.079
But then once that connection is made I can draw the arc out about two inches

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:41.000
[Music]

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.660
Now if I prop these things up and leave them electrically connected to the charcoal long enough

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.389
I'm pretty sure we can build up enough heat to get these things to ignite

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.380
But before we do

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.939
I just want to try another experiment with a few more bricks of charcoal to see if we can get the electricity to hop from

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.320
One to the other. All right

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.599
So I've got a second charcoal briquette set up the question now is will it jump the gap between the two let's find out

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480
three two one contact

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.349
Nope, it doesn't so we apparently have to start this one off

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.260
Let's go ahead and bring this close so we can develop a path, right?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.160
There and then once that's developed let's see what it does now

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.429
Boom it actually does jump the gap. That's cool

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.119
And now we can move these all over the place wherever we want, and it's going to stay right there in that middle point

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.120
That's been established

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.749
Cool, so apparently two works. Let's try four

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.339
I'm guessing we're going to have to start these off individually so get that one going there

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.600
That one going there going this way. This way

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330
and this way

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990
Oh look at that

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.319
That was cool, right there

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.650
So you can see that even though we're using four different

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.699
Briquettes once we started them all they connect very well together with electricity I could just bring it close and they all connect they all

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.960
Turn on they all turn off

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.769
they all turn on they'll turn off and starting to smell like really good barbecue because

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.370
While we've been playing with electricity these briquettes have absorbed enough heat that they've actually started themselves in fact at this stage

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.149
We could really just take these briquettes put them in a grill and get ready to start cooking hot dogs and hamburgers

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.420
Which is really cool because we started these things with electricity

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.900
Not just any electricity though high voltage electricity and that my friends is how you start your barbecue like a mad scientist

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.820
But here's one more trick now

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.559
If you want to see an even more fun and slightly dangerous approach try stacking your briquettes down in the bottom of your grill

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.949
Take one of your high-voltage electrodes and connected to the frame but at this point

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.200
You don't want to touch it because if you do it will shock you

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.229
Then if we take the other electrode and put one hand behind our back

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.069
We can stick it down inside draw an arc and ignite the rest of the briquettes as well

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.999
It's certainly not an efficient way to start your barbecue, but you got to admit

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.070
It's pretty cool there you have the guys while my grill is warming up and getting ready for hot dogs and hamburgers tonight

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.940
Let's Recap what we learned here today

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.300
We start off this experiment today playing with high voltage

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.220
Electricity and a piece of wood and what we learned was that wood by itself is not naturally conductive

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.650
but if we strike an Arc and use that Arc to burn the wood

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.640
Eventually the char will go deep enough to run a carbon Arc through the wood itself

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.689
Carbon is conductive and since charcoal briquettes are basically just carbon

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:17.420
We tried an experiment to see if they'd conduct electricity as well, and they did now with a fresh charcoal briquette

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.400
We brought our high voltage electrodes to the sides almost to the point of touching but once they actually struck an arc

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.469
We could stretch that Arc a couple of inches long

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.199
fascinating one piece of charcoal worked pretty well

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.180
So we brought in another one to see if we would jump the gap

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:35.000
and it did so we brought in two more and made a cool little pattern hopping electricity between them all and in playing with the

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.570
different designs

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.379
We watched the briquettes absorb so much heat from the electricity that they actually started

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.280
Themselves to the point where we could transfer them to our grill and use them to cook our food

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.330
So there you have it guys that's how to use high voltage electricity to start your grill this summer

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.210
Not a very practical or efficient method by any means, but definitely a lot of fun. Thanks for joining me for this experiment today

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.210
We look for the next one talk to you then

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.660
So cool right on

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.570
You hear my finger's shocking that's dangerous
