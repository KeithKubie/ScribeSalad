SPEAKER: Please welcome to
the stage two time record

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.230
holder and all around
cool guy, Colin O'Brady.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.138
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.350
COLIN O'BRADY: Word for
word how I asked for it.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.849
Thank you.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.370
I appreciate it.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.620
Thank you guys for being here.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.949
It's fantastic to be here today.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.990
I'm going to take you guys
on a bit of a journey.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.230
So last year I set
two world records,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230
something called the
Explorers Grand Slam.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.280
So I climbed the
tallest mountain

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.530
on each of the seven continents
to go to the north and south

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.220
pole.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.410
This is from Carstensz
Pyramid, which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.740
is the tallest mountain in
the Australasia continent.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.900
We'll get into that, obviously.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.990
Going over a tiny little
piece of rope with 2,000 feet

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.960
drop offs on either side
is enough to get the heart

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.460
pounding right away.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.541
But before we get
into all of that,

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:54.290
I want to take you
guys back a little bit.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.600
Because about 10, 11
years ago, my life

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.060
looked nothing like any of this.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.040
Just after I graduated
from college in 2006,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.950
I took a backpack
and a surfboard

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.900
and decided to head off in
the world for an adventure

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
with no itinerary
and found myself

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.720
on a beach in rural Thailand.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.130
And of course, because I was
22 years old and invincible,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.680
this looked like a great
activity to partake in.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.870
Yes, that's a flaming jump rope.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.070
And as you can probably tell,
it did not go very well for me.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.070
So the rope wrapped
around my legs,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.320
lit my body completely
on fire to my neck.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.900
The ocean was a few
steps away, so kind of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.070
with one last breath and ounce
of courage, I ran to the ocean,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.780
dove into the ocean to
extinguish the flames,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.790
but not before this happened,
which is I had been severely,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.750
severely burned.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.780
I won't make you stare
at that for too long.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.550
But what must have
been at least,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.320
I don't know, 24
hours or so later,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.560
I awoke leaving a small ICU.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.890
And there was placed in
the surgery room in ICU

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.810
where there was a cat
running around my bed

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.180
and across my chest, which
was certainly hammering home

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.720
the fact that I was
very, very, very

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.210
far from home and in a
dire set of circumstances.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.935
Certainly this unsanitary
hospital could kill me.

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:13.310
And I don't know,
but even worse,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.780
they were giving me a ton
of morphine at the time.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.330
But I don't know if anyone has
had morphine in a hospital?

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.830
Maybe?

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.670
It's not that fun.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.040
It kind of feels like there's
insects crawling over your skin

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.790
and it's horrible.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.790
So just a terribly
traumatic experience for me,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.560
and I was really
downward spiraling quick.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.976
And I was in the
middle of nowhere

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:30.860
on a small island in
Thailand, and they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.700
couldn't move me because it was
really too intense for that.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.310
So luckily for me, about
five days in this ordeal,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.690
I ended up having
eight surgeries

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.650
eight days in a row in this
small hospital, my mom arrived

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.740
to my bedside to
be my protector.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.620
And so I know now
that she was crying

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.280
every single day in the hallways
and pleading with the doctors.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.890
But she instead everyday
came into my hospital room

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.530
with a smile on her face,
an air of positivity,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.750
daring me to dream
about the future.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.591
Saying things to
me like, "Colin,

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:03.590
what do you want to do
when you get out of here?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.240
Let's set a goal."

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.240
And me being 22 years old
at the time, I was like,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.610
are you kidding me, mom?

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.450
I'm screwed.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.639
My life is over.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.180
The doctors every
day were telling me

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.120
that I would never walk again
normally because my legs had

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.610
been so badly burned over
the ligaments, the knee

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.100
and ankle joints, where
the mobility was really

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.909
never supposed to return.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.950
And so it was a dire set
of circumstances for me.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580
But she really kept at
me every single day,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.020
forcing me to think
about the future.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.100
So finally, kind of buying
into her positivity,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.800
I said all right mom, one
day when I get out of here,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.940
I'm going to one day
race a triathlon.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.936
So that was my big goal.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:42.560
And looking down at
my legs at the time

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.880
seemed rather unrealistic.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.816
I'd also never done that before.

00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:46.940
I'd never done a triathlon.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.731
But in my mind, that's
what's a strong sort

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.080
of able-bodied person could do.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.560
And so before I knew it, I
actually asked this doctor.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.490
He kind of has a crazy
coy look on his face

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.470
because I said, all right, I'm
training for a triathlon now.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.970
Here I am.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.560
I'm burned, I'm in Thailand.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.309
And I had them bring
in some weights

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.350
for me to start kind of
working my arms out, just

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.230
to get something
going on for me.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.094
But really that goal
gave me a purpose.

00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:13.760
And so it was several
more weeks until I

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.600
was released from
that Thai hospital

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.380
and flown back to Portland,
Oregon, which is my hometown.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.120
And I still hadn't even taken
a single step at that point.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.060
So I was carried on
and off the plane

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.770
and placed in a wheelchair
when I got home.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.600
And the next morning, I
awoke in my mother's kitchen,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.360
and my mom said to me, she
says, "All right, Colin, now I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.220
know you've got this
big triathlon goal.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.300
That's great.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.200
But today your goal is
to take one single step."

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.450
And so she grabbed this
chair and placed it one step

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.410
in front of my wheelchair.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.430
She said, you need
to figure out how

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.260
to get out of your
wheelchair and get

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.180
into that chair in front of you.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.150
It took me three hours that
day to work up the courage

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.410
and strength to do that.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.630
But somehow, someway, I
got out of my wheelchair

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.670
and sat in that chair.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.740
And the next day she moved the
chair five steps away from me,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.650
and the next day 10.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.440
Each day I could take
a few more steps.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.290
Ever present in my mind
was this triathlon goal

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.730
of getting back to my fitness.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.480
And a little shot of me.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.810
I was a swimmer as a kid and
I was a collegiate swimmer

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.242
at Yale before all this
burn accident happened.

00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:16.700
So I was just kind
of figuring, how

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.224
can I get back to being
able to move my body?

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:22.640
I remember the day after I
could walk a little bit, months

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.220
into this, and then
one day I could jog.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.080
Jogging felt like
flying that day,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.240
but it certainly was
a far cry from being

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.050
able to run any
sort of triathlon.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.550
So it took another 18 months
until I had a shot at actually

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.690
taking a shot at my goal.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.290
But about a year and a
half after my accident,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.350
I had taken a job in Chicago
in the financial industry,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.040
and I signed up for
the Chicago triathlon.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.230
So about a year and a half, like
I said, after my burn accident,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.470
I honored my goal by
diving into Lake Michigan

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.930
and swimming a mile for
the start of the triathlon

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.840
and then getting on my
bike, riding at 25 miles,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.550
and then putting
my running shoes on

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.350
and running to the finish line.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.590
Crossing that finish line for
me was a very joyous moment,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.080
having honored that goal that
I set in a Thai hospital to

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.490
not only walk again.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.437
Thank you.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.460
And then there was one
other crazy surprise

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.960
in store for me that day.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.360
I hadn't just finished
the race, but I actually

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.260
had won the entire
Chicago triathlon.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.190
Beating out about over 4,000
other participants on the day

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.730
certainly was a
crazy moment for me.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.520
And although the win was
certainly a nice cherry on top,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.130
the first thing I thought about
were those moments in the Thai

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.550
hospital and wondering
what would have happened

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.400
had my mom not forced me
to set a measurable goal

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.990
and to keep moving forward.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.480
And I had learned this, to
me, a really invaluable lesson

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.670
that I've taken with me through
the next decade of my life,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.630
which was that life
is going to test us

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.790
with setbacks, no
matter who we are.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.030
But we have every opportunity
to choose to keep moving forward

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.730
one step at a time.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.430
I'd also learned that we
all as humans, not just me,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.790
but everyone, has reservoirs
of untapped potential inside

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.220
of us, and can
achieve great things.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.560
But quite often, the biggest
thing standing in our way

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.660
is our own minds.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.170
And so this opened up a whole
new sort of pathway for me

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.620
in my life, which allowed
me to go quit my finance

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.687
job the next day and become a
professional triathlete, which

00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:26.770
is far less lucrative than
the financial industry,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.090
but it allowed me the
opportunity to race

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.360
in 25 countries on six different
continents over the next six

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.685
years, which was an amazing
period of life for me.

00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:37.310
And I'd always kind
of dreamed of being

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.320
a professional athlete.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.260
Not as glamorous as the
NBA or something like that,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.870
but amazing
experience nonetheless

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.380
that I really cherished.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.880
And then in the fall of 2014, so
I guess almost three years ago

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.860
now, I found myself
here, which was

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.730
at the summit of Ecuador's third
tallest mountain with a diamond

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.670
ring in my pocket, asking my
longtime girlfriend, Jenna,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.870
to marry me.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.160
And I joke with
her, I don't know

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.370
if it was the altitude
in her brain at the time,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.770
but luckily she did say yes.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.320
And we got engaged on
top of this mountaintop.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.290
And it was around the same
time that racing and triathlon

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.090
was going well for us, for me.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.450
But we are embarking on a
new piece of life together

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.270
and we really wanted to set
some new goals together.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.400
And we both love
this Emerson quote

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.430
which goes, "Unless you try to
do something beyond what you've

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.590
already mastered,
you will never grow."

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.200
So I'm sure a bunch of
Googlers in this room,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.330
you're very familiar
with that growth mindset

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.429
or thinking about innovation
and creative ideas.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.770
So I'm a big believer
in that as well.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.890
And so in this phase of
time, we said, what's

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.201
a big goal that we want to set?

00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:42.409
What do we really care about?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.789
What's meaningful to us?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.294
So I being an athlete was really
committed to pushing my body,

00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:48.710
but wanted to build
something that

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.180
had a larger arc
to it that could

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.080
have a great impact
in the community.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.260
So we decided that
I would attempt

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.870
to set the world record for
something called the Explorers

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.000
Grand Slam, with
the larger purpose

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.430
of founding a nonprofit
to inspire kids everywhere

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.070
to move their bodies, to
dream big, to set goals,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.777
to live active
and healthy lives.

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:07.610
So I mentioned it when
I first started this,

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.030
but I'll review quickly what the
Explorers Grand Slam entails.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.520
But that entails climbing
the seven summits.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.950
So that's the tallest
mountain on each of the seven

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.250
continents, as well as
completing expeditions to both

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.590
the North and South pole.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.200
Fewer than 50 people
in history have ever

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.610
completed the Grand Slam.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.252
Most people take
five or 10 years

00:09:27.252 --> 00:09:29.460
to train for a big expedition
like Everest or Denali,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.037
then come home, plan and
train for the next one.

00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:34.120
I was going to attempt to
break the world records,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.930
so be the fastest to
consecutively do all of that.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.160
So from start to finish, no
breaks, no rest in between,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.210
climb one mountain, fly to the
next place, climb the next one.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.450
So that was our bigger purpose.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.730
And like I said, we
founded a nonprofit.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.220
So our nonprofit is by
the name of Beyond 72.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.020
So for the seven peaks
and two mountains,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.220
but that this whole idea
was beyond me in this,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.310
but using sort of the
media and story around this

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.520
to tell stories and get early
in the curriculum of classrooms.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.190
Today's kids are the
least active in history.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.940
I was fortunate to
grow up around parents,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.697
my dad's an organic
farmer and my mother

00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:11.530
works in the natural
foods grocery industry,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.410
so I had some great influences
in terms of health and wellness

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.630
in my life.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.350
I'm sure everyone in
this room is aware

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.911
that's not true of a large
amount of our population.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.910
So really trying to spread
that positive message

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.130
around wellness and how
wellness can contribute

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.800
to positive growth in
any aspects of life,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.720
not just being an
athlete, but in terms

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.940
of academic pursuits,
career, anything

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.060
like that in the long run.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.816
So we really brought our
message all around to schools.

00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:36.940
And it started as a small
thing, but as you'll see,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.590
it grows and grows throughout
the course of this journey.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.450
Similar to many of you
who are, of course,

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.040
thinking of great,
exciting ideas

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.930
here at Google, which
are probably well

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.340
beyond my capacity to even
dream up, we had this big dream,

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.956
but we didn't have any
funding to do the project,

00:10:53.956 --> 00:10:55.330
we didn't know
anything about PR,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.716
we didn't know anything
about branding, marketing.

00:10:57.716 --> 00:10:59.840
We didn't know anything
about founding a nonprofit.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.010
So this really started as
just that, simply an idea.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.500
And so for the next 18 months,
before I even started out

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.100
on any of the mountains,
I remember the moment

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.550
when we Googled, what is
the difference between PR

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.270
and marketing?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.400
It's a very
rudimentary question,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.860
but we actually didn't
know the difference.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.920
But again, as we'll
see, this does grow.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.520
And we learned along the
way, after a year and a half,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.120
we finally did raise this
necessary sponsorship.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.344
We founded a nonprofit, kind of
turned this dream into reality,

00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:32.260
trying to figure out all
the different nuances

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.230
of all the many places
we need to go to.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.470
And Jenna was a huge
part of all this.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.490
So really a team effort, not
just me doing this at all,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.410
but this was her full
time thing as well.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.617
So the first place that I left
for was Antarctica, and Jenna

00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:47.200
was ever steady at
the helm of running

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.620
our nonprofit and expedition
logistics in the background.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.830
So this is the first
step on the journey.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.780
I remember this small
plane landed me down

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.622
on the frozen continent.

00:11:57.622 --> 00:11:59.080
And as you can see
from this photo,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.760
the landscape out
there is crazy,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.160
just desolate and
surreal, just white

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.840
in every single direction.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.570
I describe it best as it feels
like standing inside the belly

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.680
of a ping pong ball.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.390
Just really disorienting and
white everywhere you look.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.464
And of course, I
had read about this,

00:12:14.464 --> 00:12:15.880
but the extreme
cold was something

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.250
that I had never been privy to.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.650
So it was so cold that
the average temperature

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.320
in Antarctica is
minus 40 degrees.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.970
And what this picture
is, I've actually

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.790
taken a cup of boiling
water from my dinner

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.710
and thrown it into the air.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.080
And it instantly turns into ice.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.650
So that gives you a sense of
what minus 40 degrees feels

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.832
like on your body.

00:12:36.832 --> 00:12:38.290
And as you saw from
the last photo,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.831
I actually have all
my gear behind me

00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:41.920
and I'm dragging in
a sled day by day

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.950
till I reached the South Pole.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.140
On many of these journeys.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.150
I was completely alone.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.010
But on this journey,
I had a team with me

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.580
of a few other people.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.930
So this is us inside of our
tiny little shelter of a tent,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.120
kind of keep warm, put
a smile on our face.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.940
And this next video shows kind
of the importance of teamwork

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.530
in such a hard and
harsh environment,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.000
which is when you get out
of your tent in the morning,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.706
it's minus 40.

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:02.830
There's no standing around.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.450
Of course, this is a time
lapse, but over the course

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.574
of about five minutes,
we're packing everything up.

00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:08.920
Everyone has a role,
putting it in our sleds,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.180
and then quickly moving along.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.690
Because if you stand around even
for a minute or two in minus 40

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.650
degrees, you can immediately get
hypothermic or get frostbite.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.350
So having a really well oiled
machine of a team working.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.450
And that's a theme throughout
this entire project.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.890
Even in moments
when I was alone,

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.348
there was a team
in the background,

00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:28.270
Jenna, et cetera, working
to make sure this all

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.320
somehow would hopefully work.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:37.690
So I arrived on the middle of
January 2016 to the South Pole.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.114
And when you arrived to
the first pole or mountain,

00:13:40.114 --> 00:13:42.280
that's actually when the
official clock is starting.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.989
So I'm now on the clock for the
world record going from here.

00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:48.280
And so I'm going to run
through a few of the mountains.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.863
Of course, not enough
time to tell you

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:51.490
stories about all
of them, although

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.460
every single expedition
itself has many stories.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.400
But I'll tell you some longer
stories about Everest and stuff

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:57.970
after that.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.010
But next up was
Mount Vinson, which

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.860
is the tallest
mountain in Antarctica.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.650
This was me taking my mask
off for literally 10 seconds

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.877
to get a photo to
prove that I was there.

00:14:07.877 --> 00:14:09.460
I'm trying to smile,
but it's actually

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.000
minus 70 degrees wind chill
on the summit of that peak.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.240
And you can see my eyebrows
and eyelashes immediately

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.300
are iced up as I try to take
just one quick photo to prove

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.410
I was there.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.650
Next up was Aconcagua,
the tallest mountain

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.480
in South America.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.120
So forgive me if this is
review for some of you.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.200
This is very smart room.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.130
But on mountains, of course,
as you get to higher altitudes,

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.096
the oxygen remains the
same, but the pressure

00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:36.970
being less dense, you
can breathe in less air

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.499
as you get up there, which means
your body needs to get used

00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:40.790
to the thinner air to climb up.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.400
If we got dropped off at
the top of Mount Everest,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.480
for example, right
now from sea level,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.400
we would die in about
two to three minutes,

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.800
because we would not be
able to breathe up there.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.190
So that process of getting your
body used to higher altitudes

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.574
is called acclimatization.

00:14:56.574 --> 00:14:57.990
But still at these
high altitudes,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.790
so Aconcagua is the
tallest mountain

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.750
outside of the Himalayas
in the entire world,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.470
or outside of
Asia, I should say.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.704
22,874 feet.

00:15:06.704 --> 00:15:08.120
So at the top of
there, I actually

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.350
was on this expedition
completely alone.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.290
A random guy who I met climbing
down took this photo of me.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.180
But as I'm up
there, I'm literally

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.290
walking at the pace of
one step every 15 seconds.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.570
And even that up there
is you're cruising.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.030
You're Usain Bolt up there
when you're moving like this.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.470
It's pretty crazy what
it feels like to be

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.550
up at that high altitude.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.850
But the one benefit of
climbing these mountains

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.160
as quickly as I was
was that I could be

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.840
acclimatized from one mountain.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.540
Of course, I was getting more
and more tired fatigue wise,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.387
but I'd be more acclimatized
going into the next mountain.

00:15:42.387 --> 00:15:44.970
So it allowed me to climb some
of these mountains a little bit

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.940
quicker, which brings
us to Kilimanjaro.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.070
Anybody in here
climb Kilimanjaro?

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.090
Couple of people.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:51.780
All right.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.016
What route did you come?

00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:55.147
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:55.980
COLIN O'BRADY: Nice.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.380
Nice.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:56.879
Very cool.

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:59.430
So as the couple of
you who have climbed

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.470
this mountain in this room
know, Kilimanjaro is generally

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.830
climbed in about a week.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.090
It's 19,341 feet.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.180
And that's very high, again, if
you're coming from sea level.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.830
But I had just come
from Aconcagua,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.730
and Kilimanjaro was the one
mountain that I had previously

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.850
climbed in the years past.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.780
So in 2013 Jenna and I
climbed Kilimanjaro together.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.596
And we climbed the Machame route
in about six days, I believe.

00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:26.220
But I decided since
I was on the clock,

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.210
I wanted to see if I could climb
Kilimanjaro faster than that.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.080
So I actually set
myself the goal

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.000
to see if I could climb
Kilimanjaro in a single day.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.919
One single push from
the base to the summit.

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:38.835
And so Kilimanjaro has
some interesting rules,

00:16:38.835 --> 00:16:40.418
because it's inside
of a national park

00:16:40.418 --> 00:16:41.730
inside of Tanzania.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.430
And so you're required,
even though I didn't really

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.110
need a guide per
se, you're required

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.180
to go with a local
guide, which is actually

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.100
a really great way of
creating jobs over there

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.240
and everything like that.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.112
So we kind of went
back and forth dialogue

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:55.070
and I said, yeah, well
we've got a guy for you.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.070
And I was like,
well make sure he

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.490
understands that I want to
try to climb this mountain

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.030
in one day.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.250
Enter Frank.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:01.969
Great guy.

00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:02.760
I'm put with Frank.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.218
I said, Frank, how many times
have you climbed Kilimanjaro?

00:17:05.218 --> 00:17:07.710
He says, "I've climbed
Kilimanjaro 115 times.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.780
You're in good hands."

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.529
You look at him, he's
a really strong guy,

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.880
super friendly, amazing guy.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.130
We're having a blast together.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.379
And I said, we're going to
try to climb it in one day.

00:17:15.379 --> 00:17:17.369
What's the fastest you've
ever climbed it in?

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.460
And he said, "Out of 115
times, the fastest I've

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.660
climbed it is three
days, but I've always

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.700
wanted to see if I
could climb it one day."

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.358
So we set off and we're.

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:28.254
We're going super hard.

00:17:28.254 --> 00:17:29.670
And the bottom
part is the jungle.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.060
So it gets cold up high,
but you start at 5,000 feet,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.620
so there's a significant
change of altitude

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.000
as well as temperature, climate.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.930
Everything changes.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.388
It's kind of a jungle to start,
with monkeys and everything

00:17:39.388 --> 00:17:40.560
down the bottom.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.420
And he takes off.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.170
And before the first hour,
two hours, I am so exhausted.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.190
I'm like, oh my
gosh, I'm an idiot.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.520
I obviously bit off more
than I can chew here.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.310
I thought I was super
strong, but this guy

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.360
is way stronger than me.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.540
I'm trying to keep up, but
I'm sweating profusely.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.250
And I'm finally
thinking to myself,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.440
I'm going to have to
tell him, I don't know.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.380
I'm not sure.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.000
So we take a break.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.020
We drink some water, eat
a little bit of food.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.590
And I'm like, I'm not
going to say anything yet.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.730
We're going to power
on for another hour.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.500
Another hour goes
by and again, I'm

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.090
really kind of on
my last little rope.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.490
I'm like, wow, this
guy is so strong.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.280
I really overestimated
my abilities.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.490
We get to the next break
and he says, oh hey,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.010
can I borrow some of your water?

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.280
And I was like, all right.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.738
We're three hours
into what I think

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:27.799
is going to be about a 12 or
15 hour day at the shortest.

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.340
And I was like, are
you out of water?

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.650
He's like, yeah, I
drank all of mine.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.070
So I got to tell you something.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.670
What's that?

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.420
He goes, so there's the
bet back at the hotel

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.430
that there's a 0%
chance you're going

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.560
to be able to climb
Kilimanjaro in a single day.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.190
And they all paid me
to try to tire you out

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.717
as hard as I could in
the first few hours.

00:18:49.717 --> 00:18:50.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.880
I actually didn't bring
enough food or water,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.710
but you seem pretty determined.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.140
I keep expecting you to
say we're going to stop,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.230
and you're still chugging along.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.660
And I was like, oh god.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.220
Made me feel a
little bit better.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.410
But then I was like,
wait, no water, no food?

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.930
Luckily I had thrown a
couple of extra energy gels

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.110
and bars in my backpack and
had a little bit of water.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.360
The cat was out of the bag.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.150
But unfortunately for him
and his betting buddies,

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.980
we did continue
onward to the summit

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.560
and made it to the
summit in 11 hours

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.980
from the base to the summit,
arriving at the night,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.570
as you can see here.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.960
So that was a funny chapter.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.430
But Frank is an amazing guy.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.350
We still stay in touch.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.640
So after that, I went
off to Carstensz Pyramid,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.390
which is the tallest
mountain in Australasia.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.430
So there's sort of
somewhat of a controversy

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.140
whether Australia
the continent itself

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.027
or the sort of larger
region, depending

00:19:45.027 --> 00:19:47.110
on where the tectonic
plates were, is the tallest.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.602
So I actually climbed eight
instead of seven summits,

00:19:49.602 --> 00:19:51.310
just because there's
two different lists.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.100
So I climbed the tallest in
the Australian continent, which

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.680
is called Kosciusko, as
well as this mountain, which

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.360
is the tallest in
the larger region.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.660
And as you can see
from that first video,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.910
I think I'm trying to smile
here, but I'm very scared.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.650
Let's be honest.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.090
And then next up
was Mount Elbrus,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.940
the tallest mountain in all
of Europe, which is in Russia.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.460
That was a winter ascent,
almost always climbed in summer.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.668
But I climbed it in winter
so that I could stay ahead

00:20:13.668 --> 00:20:15.420
of the curve for the record.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.880
The next place that I went
to was the North Pole.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.550
And it's a little bit
counter intuitive.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.490
So it's not something
that everyone is aware of.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.180
Of course, when you think
about it, it's obvious.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.550
But the North Pole,
of course there's

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.966
no land underneath
the North Pole.

00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:29.970
It's just the Arctic
sea ice floating around

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.530
in the middle of
the ocean up there.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.830
And so you're literally
walking around on ice.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.110
Right below it is the ocean.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.331
There's these cracks
in the sea ice

00:20:38.331 --> 00:20:40.330
and it's getting worse
and worse, unfortunately,

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.871
because of climate
change, of course.

00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:45.490
So much so that I was crossing
the last degree of latitude

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.880
and I had to arrange for
this Russian helicopter

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.680
to drop me off at my
starting point for me

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.110
to cross to the North Pole
and then come pick me up.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.760
And for an extra
eight or nine days,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.968
they couldn't find anywhere
to land because they kept

00:20:55.968 --> 00:20:58.184
seeing this cracked sea ice.

00:20:58.184 --> 00:20:59.850
And my partner who I
was out there with,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.170
a guy by the name
of Eric Larson,

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.590
he actually fell through
the ice at one point

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.230
when we were there and had
to pull them out and keep

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.920
moving forward.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.960
So it's a really
crazy environment.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.320
And again, it's about
minus 40 degrees.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.930
And why that's actually
particularly challenging

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.850
is that this brings
us to the final third.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.760
So the last three
mountains or expeditions

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.820
where the North Pole, Everest,
and Denali, which a lot of ways

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.110
are the three most
challenging expeditions.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.570
And then the North
Pole is at sea level.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.290
And so me being delayed at
the North Pole at sea level

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.330
right before Everest
did the reverse of what

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.430
I was talking about
before being acclimatized,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.100
and all of a sudden, I was
back acclimatized to sea level,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.900
having been delayed,
and I needed

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.970
to climb next Mount
Everest, of course,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.839
the tallest mountain in the
world, coming from sea level.

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:46.380
And because of that
delay and the way

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.870
the weather windows
overlap, I was actually

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.600
the very last person to
arrive to Mount Everest base

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.020
camp on the entire season.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.456
So I arrived at
the end of April.

00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:55.830
People normally
arrive to Everest

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.050
base camp, which
is at 17,000 feet,

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.054
around the first week of April.

00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:01.720
And it's not like you
can say, oh great,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.349
I showed up a month late.

00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:04.640
I'll just summit a month later.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.890
There's a very specific
weather window on Everest,

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.862
it's usually the second
or third week of May,

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:11.820
that it's even possible
to summit the mountains

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.202
when the jet stream
diverts from the peak

00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:15.660
and you get this
tiny little moment

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.820
of lighter, I should say, winds.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.057
Not light winds, lighter winds.

00:22:20.057 --> 00:22:21.640
To try to get to the
top of the world.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.750
So I was really
up against it now.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.820
I'd been going 100 plus
days, hadn't taken a rest.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.580
I was exhausted, and I
had now only three weeks

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.800
to climb Mount Everest rather
than the customary eight weeks

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.840
that it normally takes.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.270
But this is what the
mountain looks like.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.576
This is me standing
up around camp one.

00:22:38.576 --> 00:22:40.200
So basically there's
base camp and then

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.840
four progressive camps
above that, aptly named

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.850
camp one, camp two,
camp three, camp four.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.010
Very exciting names.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.930
And then from camp four,
you go to the summit.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.970
Again, the reason these
camps is at each camp

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.428
you get your body
a little bit used

00:22:52.428 --> 00:22:55.009
to a little bit more thin air.

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:57.300
Some of you might know just
a little bit about Everest,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.510
or read about it, but this
is the famous khumbu icefall.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.640
In 2014, unfortunately about
15 or 16 sherpas, I believe,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.400
died right here in this
spot due to an avalanche,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.290
and that closed the
entire climbing season.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.180
So no one summited
Everest that year at all.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.800
And then in 2015,
of course, there

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.110
was the huge earthquake
in the country of Nepal

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.130
that devastated the country
as well as closed the climbing

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.630
season.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.840
So in 2016 when I
was there, no one

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.109
had summited Everest from
Nepal in a couple of years.

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:27.150
And you can imagine as I
was going out and trying

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.733
to get people to
support this project,

00:23:28.733 --> 00:23:30.540
people would say to
me, so wait, no one's

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.304
climbed Everest in
2014 or 2015 and you

00:23:32.304 --> 00:23:34.470
think you're going to try
to climb Everest this year

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.790
and all these other mountains?

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.330
Good luck.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.120
So it was very hard for me to
get support for this project

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.100
initially because
of the challenges

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.619
that Everest had had.

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:45.660
This is what it looks like
crossing one of these.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.310
This is me with my
GoPro facing down.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.310
So there is not just one
or two of these ladders

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.680
like this spanning crevasses.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.740
But that's about a 300 or 400
foot drop off into an icy grave

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.670
down there.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.450
And there's about 50 or 60
of these ladder crossings

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.260
throughout the khumbu
icefall, depending

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.320
on how it's all moving around.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.240
So strangely, you
try to get sort

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.320
of used to this feeling of
crossing across this precipice.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.310
But as you'll see,
I cheered every time

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.580
because I was just
excited to make it across.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.370
Not above hooting and
hollering every time

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.960
I crossed one of those.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.062
And so next up, the
challenge was something

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.020
called the lhotse face.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.680
It's about a 5,000 foot, very
steep section of the mountain.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.130
So I was climbing without
any guides, just myself

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.080
and a guy by the name
of [INAUDIBLE] who

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.480
was a sherpa who I had met
climbing in Nepal the year

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.680
previously.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.230
And we realized that it
looked like there was

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.490
going to be a weather window.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.869
So we thought there's a
very small weather window,

00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:46.160
but let's see if we can skip
from camp two to camp four

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.487
directly, and then go up
to camp four and from there

00:24:49.487 --> 00:24:50.070
to the summit.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.557
And so this is us arriving
to camp four, which

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.640
is supposed to be our
summit day the next evening.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.059
You climb through the
night to reach the summit.

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.600
And as you can see
here, I'm starting

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.350
to wear supplemental
oxygen at this point.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.340
So I did use supplemental
oxygen for my summit

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.716
push, which about 98% of
people who summit Everest do.

00:25:06.716 --> 00:25:08.590
And of course, with my
condensed time period,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.480
there was definitely
no opportunity for me

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.850
to try to climb without
supplementary oxygen.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.379
So this is called
the Geneva spur.

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:17.920
And it looks like it's a really
beautiful day, as the weather

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.240
window had predicted.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.330
But in an instant, the
weather shifted, and about 50,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.130
60 mile per hour
winds blew in on us

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.159
right after we took this photo.

00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:27.700
There's no photos
of this, because it

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.589
was such a bad storm.

00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:30.880
It took us two and a half
hours just to set up our tent

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.280
and get inside and try
to survive the night

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.640
at 26,000 feet.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.540
Which 26,000 feet and above is
actually called the death zone.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.920
And it's aptly named, because
the human body cannot survive

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.380
for very long above 26,000 feet.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.630
And so we got in our tent
just to survive the night,

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.500
knowing full well that we
had no shot for the summit.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.250
And this video I'm
going to show you is us

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.616
the next morning getting ready
to go down from the mountain.

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:56.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:57.532 --> 00:26:02.500
- I have to descend now because
I'm stuck in this wind storm.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.626
[INAUDIBLE] clear sky.

00:26:06.626 --> 00:26:08.950
The summit feels like
it's just right there,

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.420
but we're just getting blown
around way too much here.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.060
Way to dangerous to risk
climbing up to the top right

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.030
now.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.890
Just come down from
camp four after having

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.220
to turn around due to weather.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.680
A lot of people, if they got
to four and they come down,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.060
there's no going back for sure.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.000
That's it for them.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.774
That's a one way ticket.

00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:38.100
But not for me.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.080
Disappointing.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.943
Really, really disappointing.

00:26:40.943 --> 00:26:42.350
It appears I still have Everest.

00:26:45.724 --> 00:26:50.550
I'm going up there soon, soon.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.050
Yeah.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.245
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:53.870
COLIN O'BRADY: So
trying to give myself

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.460
a pep talk, as you can see.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.370
I don't know how
convinced you are by that.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.520
I'm not sure I am either.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.660
And what I don't
realize actually

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.400
when I'm taking this video,
but I realized quickly

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.740
as I get back to my tent, is
that what you see on my cheek

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.198
there is the
beginning of frostbite

00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:07.400
on my cheek from being
in that wind storm.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.530
And so I'm actually in
even worse circumstance

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.960
than I realized at this point.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.300
It's very rare that people
make more than one attempt

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.410
for the summit on Everest.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.140
After weathering a
night at camp four,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.132
generally that's enough to kind
of, obviously fatigue wise,

00:27:20.132 --> 00:27:21.590
but also because
I showed you I was

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.457
starting to use
supplemental oxygen.

00:27:23.457 --> 00:27:25.040
So you're using some
of your supplies,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.664
which I've cached
high on the mountain,

00:27:26.664 --> 00:27:29.270
and so it gets harder and
harder to go up there.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.450
But luckily, a few days
later, another weather window

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.990
presented itself.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.990
And because of
some people that we

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.570
knew having to
abort their climbs

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.960
due to their own sickness, there
were some extra oxygen bottles

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.010
cached on the mountains.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.530
And so had to get
a little bit lucky,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.720
but it gave me the opportunity
to at least give it

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.410
another shot.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.217
And I felt like I put
so much into this.

00:27:50.217 --> 00:27:52.550
I didn't know, again, if I
was going to able to make it,

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.800
but I owed it to myself to
give it my absolute best

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.010
shot to go back up there.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.710
So again, climbed
back up to camp four.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.744
This is camp four right
around 10 o'clock.

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:04.160
And those [INAUDIBLE]
are actually

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.490
other people's headlamps
going up towards the summit.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.970
And honestly, the weather
window looked exactly the same

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.040
on the Doppler and
everything as the last one.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.998
It looked like it could
be good, but I had also

00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:17.130
just seen how fast the
weather had shifted.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.127
And so I was in my tent
at this point, terrified.

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:21.710
And really doing the
only thing that I

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.499
could think to do
to calm myself down

00:28:23.499 --> 00:28:25.790
is I reached for my satellite
phone and I called Jenna.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.070
And I said Jenna, what
do you think I should do?

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.900
I saw how fast this can change.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.180
I'm afraid people might
die up here tonight.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.039
At the very least, there's going
to be significant frostbite

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.830
that occurs on the
mountain tonight because

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.710
of the extreme cold and
winds that were predicted.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.820
And in an incredible
moment of bravery,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.920
she really set aside her
own justifiable fears

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.086
and said to me what I needed
to hear in that moment.

00:28:48.086 --> 00:28:51.130
She said to me something along
the lines of, Colin, people

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.880
are going to summit
Mount Everest tonight

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.880
and there is no reason that
you can't be one of them.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.280
Go inside your body and listen.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.510
Face your fears.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.380
I know you can do it.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.860
And that really gave me
the courage and strength

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.070
to get outside of my
tent and give it a shot.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.710
As you can see, on
Everest, there's

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.320
one rope that goes up Everest
that all the teams together

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.130
have pooled together to help
put on the mountain which allows

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.820
people to be clipped
in and connected

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.670
to the mountain in
relative safety.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.650
But the problem with
that is that it also

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.312
can create some traffic jams.

00:29:23.312 --> 00:29:24.770
Which if you've
read about Everest,

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.360
you've probably
heard about that.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.790
So as I said, no one had
climbed Everest in 2014,

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.710
no one had climbed
Everest in 2015,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.570
and somehow I end
up on a summit day

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.550
the most crowded
day the mountain has

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.967
seen in over three years.

00:29:35.967 --> 00:29:38.300
So there's about 100 people
going for the summit because

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.341
of these weather windows
that all condense people

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:42.270
onto this one day,
this one time.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.240
It was certainly my last shot.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.790
And so it [INAUDIBLE] and I
decided to get out of our tent

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:47.850
and go for it.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.880
But we actually decided
that the safest option

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.680
is to not be clipped
to the rope at all,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.210
but instead to walk
beside of these people.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.990
So if we fell, we would be in
a dire set of circumstances.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.160
But actually walking behind
in this slow line of people,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.710
I demonstrated before how slow
I was walking on Aconcagua,

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.001
Everest is a whole other thing.

00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:08.700
One step per minute is not
uncommon on the summit day,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.050
even with supplementary oxygen.
And so to keep ourselves warm,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.875
we felt like we
needed to keep moving.

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:15.500
And so we get up to
the top about where

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.110
those headlamps end, and we've
been unclip this whole time.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.780
We safely climb up
there without any ropes.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.620
And finally, we get to a
section where people are still

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.250
in front of us, but it's
too unsafe to be unclipped.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.985
And so I take out
my last jacket,

00:30:29.985 --> 00:30:32.110
actually I have one more
bigger layer to put on me,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.020
I'm adjusting my
gloves a little bit.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.990
And I look down and my right
hand is completely black.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.810
Just black as
black can be, which

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.380
is a very telltale sign
of severe frostbite.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.910
And I'm at about 28,000 feet
in altitude at this point,

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.400
much higher than I've ever been.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.850
Brain's not working pretty well.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.030
It's still a little
bit dark outside.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.894
And I decide, I had this
very strange thought process,

00:30:55.894 --> 00:30:57.560
which is, I'm not
particularly proud of,

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.320
I suppose, but I look at my
head and I'm like, well, I

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.230
guess my right hand is gone.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.150
Is Jenna still going to love me?

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.120
And I thought,
well, maybe she'll

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.490
love me, even though I'm
going to lose my hand anyways,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.920
if I at least get to
the summit of Everest

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.730
and then lose my right hand.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.314
And so I decide to continue
onwards towards the summit.

00:31:20.314 --> 00:31:22.730
And I don't tell [INAUDIBLE]
because he's a great climbing

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.530
partner, and if he had told
me his hand was like this,

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:25.970
I would have turned
him around immediately

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.011
and he would have certainly
done the same for me,

00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:30.629
being a very smart and
savvy climbing partner.

00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:32.420
And so we end up, again,
these are the kind

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.560
of lines that we ended up.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.100
We're moving slowly and
the daylight finally rises.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.110
And I decided, well
I should probably

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.510
capture this a little bit.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.560
I'm trying to capture
this footage and things

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.540
for all the people following
along, particularly the kids.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.748
They're using this inside
of their school curriculums

00:31:46.748 --> 00:31:50.520
and interacting with us over
social media this entire time.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.500
And so I get out my GoPro
to shoot this video, which

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.930
gives you a sense of what it
looks high up on the summit

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.740
ridge of Everest.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.580
It was about 30 minutes
away from the summit.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.040
That's [INAUDIBLE] there in
red and a few other climbers

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.150
in front of us near a section
called the Hillary Step, which

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.028
is maybe not there anymore.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.010
And as you can see, it's
an incredible place.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.840
Despite the situation
with my hand,

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.430
I was just inspired by the view
and everything I could see.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.696
And because I'm messing
around with my camera

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:25.570
and I've got these big
huge mitten and gloves

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:29.110
on, I should say first, the
one other thing that I had done

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.250
is I have heated foot
warmers inside of my boots.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.080
And so when I saw
my hand like this,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.530
I turned my heated foot
warmers up as high as possible

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.280
because I'm thinking, I didn't
notice my hand being this cold.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.480
Who knows what my
feet look like?

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.938
But I just cranked
those up as high

00:32:41.938 --> 00:32:45.550
as possible to at least be like,
well, they're at least warm.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:50.050
And as I do this with my camera,
I adjust my gloves around again

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.610
and I look down at my hand.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.220
And all of a sudden, I'm
like, my hand's back.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.720
My hand's back!

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.970
And [INAUDIBLE] looks back
at me from that ridge.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.910
He's like, Colin,
premature celebration.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.310
The summit is still just there.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.670
And I was like, no
man, my hand's back.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.649
He's like, what are
you talking about?

00:33:07.649 --> 00:33:09.190
Because I hadn't
told him, of course.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.410
And it just so happened
that I had chemical hand

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.720
warmers in my gloves
and they had broken open

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.840
and the charcoal and copper
from the chemical hand warmers

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.330
had dyed my hand black.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.250
But my hand was completely fine.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.810
And so thank god I
didn't find that out

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.720
back down at camp four,
having descended off

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.386
the mountain in the
middle of the night,

00:33:27.386 --> 00:33:30.490
but instead I found it a few
steps away from the summit.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.020
And so my celebration
was slightly premature.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.110
But about 30 minutes
later, we ended up

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.510
at this moment, which is an
unforgettable moment for me.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.334
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:38.334 --> 00:33:43.228
- I'm on the summit of Mount
Everest, top of the world.

00:33:43.228 --> 00:33:46.265
No words can describe.

00:33:46.265 --> 00:33:51.215
These two guys right
here [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.135
Top of the world!

00:33:59.135 --> 00:34:00.640
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.330
COLIN O'BRADY: So full of
elation in that moment.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.640
And I mentioned the
social media before.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.719
And as you know, I set two
world records ultimately.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.310
But there's another record that
I don't get enough credit for.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.889
I think Guinness
should add this one.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:16.900
But I was actually also
the very first person

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.330
to Snapchat from the
summit of Mount Everest.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.236
So there that is.

00:34:21.236 --> 00:34:21.902
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:25.213
- Summit of Mount Everest!

00:34:25.213 --> 00:34:28.060
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.780
COLIN O'BRADY: And
that was pretty fun,

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.639
but all jokes aside,
that actually ultimately

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.321
was the most viewed Snapchat
story of all of 2016.

00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:38.320
And because of the work
we were doing with kids,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.010
they were able to see a look
into it in real time, which

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.840
is a really fun way,
one of the many ways

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.285
we were sharing this story,
but actually using technology

00:34:46.285 --> 00:34:48.159
on the summit of Mount
Everest to give people

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.010
an eye into it in real
time was super fun for us,

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.639
particularly with the age
demographic that uses Snapchat.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.100
So anyways, we make
it to the summit.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.350
And that was just an incredible
moment for me and a childhood

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.850
dream, really, a mountain I'd
always dreamed about climbing.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:08.370
So safely descending back down
the mountain back to camp four,

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.211
I crawled back into
my tent at camp four

00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:11.710
and I reached for
my satellite phone

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.600
to call Jenna again
to tell her the news.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.364
And she was like,
how are you doing?

00:35:15.364 --> 00:35:16.030
Did you make it?

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.740
I was like, yes, I made it,
no frostbite, no injuries.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.260
I'm exhausted, but I'm good.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:28.360
And then I said, well actually,
I actually burned my feet.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.012
And she said, what?

00:35:30.012 --> 00:35:31.720
We've actually been
getting some reports.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.800
She'd been following
on social media

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.180
that there's a lot of frostbite.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.090
And actually about 25 people
over the next three days

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.940
were evacuated off the mountain
with extreme frostbite.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.220
And two people, not whom I
knew or were climbing with,

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.928
did pass away that
night on the mountain.

00:35:43.928 --> 00:35:48.130
So unfortunately, my
premonition had been correct,

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.550
really putting into perspective
how intense it can be up there

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.060
and the risks you're taking.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.476
But she said to me, wait, I
thought you said no frostbite?

00:35:55.476 --> 00:35:58.360
I said, yeah, no, I
actually burned my feet.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.670
So I had turned my
boot warmers up so warm

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.520
that I had actually burned
two little small circles

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.170
in the bottoms of my feet.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.120
And she was like,
you're an idiot.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.675
Your feet, fire.

00:36:08.675 --> 00:36:11.050
You're the only idiot that
goes and climbs Mount Everest,

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.770
doesn't get frostbite, but
actually burns your feet.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.320
She then said something that
I will never, ever in my life

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.820
forget.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.855
She says, so Colin, I actually,
despite the burnt feet

00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:26.186
and everything, I need you
to put your boots back on.

00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:27.235
And I was like, what?

00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:29.110
It just took me an hour
to take my boots off,

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.120
crawl in my tent [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.320
What are you talking about?

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.770
She goes, well, we've been doing
some calculations back home,

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:36.300
and it just so
happens that if you

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.270
can summit Denali
in the next week,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:44.610
you have a chance to set not
one, but two world records.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.190
So she goes, so I need to
put your boots back on,

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.417
climb all the way back down
to base camp right now.

00:36:49.417 --> 00:36:51.000
I've arranged for a
helicopter that'll

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.822
pick you up in base camp and
it will fly you to Kathmandu.

00:36:53.822 --> 00:36:56.280
There's not enough time for
you to spend a night in a hotel

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.410
or take a shower or anything,
but an evening flight

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:01.200
would take you from Dubai
to Seattle to Anchorage,

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.714
and then you'll have about
three days to climb Denali.

00:37:03.714 --> 00:37:05.380
I know normally takes
about three weeks,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.660
but I think you can do it.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.840
And maybe I just know well
enough to not say no to her,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.840
or the competitive juices in me
were flowing sure nonetheless.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.920
But somehow, just 100
hours after standing

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.750
on the summit of
Mount Everest, I

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:27.510
arrived to Alaska to attempt
my final mountain, Denali.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.910
And so Denali in itself is
an incredibly hard mountain

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:31.410
to climb.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.820
It's 20,000 feet high.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.340
Alaska is known
for extreme weather

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.420
and there's no support
on the mountain.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.480
So you're dragging huge,
heavy amounts of weight.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.910
I'm dragging a sled and a
huge full backpack here.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.400
And my old friend
Tucker Cunningham,

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.070
who was a friend of mine who
I grew up with in Portland,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.447
met me to be my climbing
partner on the last mountain.

00:37:49.447 --> 00:37:51.780
So it was great to see him,
and he was at least a little

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.700
bit more energized than
I was, having just flown

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.408
across the world.

00:37:54.408 --> 00:37:56.580
And I've been going 130
some days at this point.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.910
I'm pretty worked.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.490
So we get up about
halfway on Denali.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.239
We have 24 hours left
to try to get to the top

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:03.780
to set the second
world record, which

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.120
is the record for the Seven
Summits, not the Explorers

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.680
Grand Slam.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.960
But I was two months ahead
of the Explorers Grand Slam

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.350
at this point.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.440
And we get up and
all of a sudden,

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.354
we're putting our
tent up, and then

00:38:15.354 --> 00:38:16.770
this is what the
weather turns to.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.560
That's Tucker.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.190
That's Tucker.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.460
I was filming, but
my thoughts exactly.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.620
Pretty well sums
it up right there.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.500
And so we say, OK, we've
got to go to bed and wake

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.310
up in the morning.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.184
We've got this one shot
to get to the summit.

00:38:43.184 --> 00:38:44.940
Maybe the winds will die down.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.880
Alaska historically is
known for these storms

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.190
coming in and lasting
not just a day,

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.780
but usually a week or 10 days.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.591
And so we said, well, maybe
we'll get lucky this time.

00:38:54.591 --> 00:38:56.340
Let's go to sleep,
wake up in the morning,

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.756
and see what the
weather is doing.

00:38:57.756 --> 00:39:00.060
Maybe we'll have one
Hail Mary pass to go.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.090
So this next video is
me filming myself inside

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.574
of my tent the next morning.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.558
The audio is not great, but
it's subtitled, so bear with me.

00:39:10.558 --> 00:39:12.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.827
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:45.827 --> 00:39:47.535
COLIN O'BRADY: Now
there's a pump up talk

00:39:47.535 --> 00:39:49.600
if you've ever seen one, right?

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.840
Let's go to the summit.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.650
Let's go.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:55.180
So I'm thinking, OK, I'm not
hearing too much wind outside.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.900
I think it's died
down, whatever.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.305
I get outside of my tent and
this is what it looks like.

00:40:01.305 --> 00:40:03.835
I think there's snow
over my tent or something

00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:06.470
and I'm not hearing this or
I've got my ear plugs in.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:11.840
But basically, the snow and
wind have not died down at all.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.720
And so it's decision time.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.730
And at this point, I said,
Tucker, what do you want to do?

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.720
And he said, hey,
I'm here for you.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.520
You tell me what you want to do.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.327
And there's a quote that
I love, which is often

00:40:31.327 --> 00:40:33.410
contributed to Confucius,
although some people say

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.202
Henry Ford said it.

00:40:34.202 --> 00:40:35.743
I like to think that
it was Confucius

00:40:35.743 --> 00:40:36.800
long before Henry Ford.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.159
But a paraphrase of both.

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:39.950
It's a quote goes
something along the lines

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.500
of, "He who says he
can and he says he

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.650
can't are both usually right."

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:47.690
And so I said to
Tucker, do you think we

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.510
can climb for 15 minutes today?

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.910
And he says, yeah, I mean
we're at least 12 hours

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.682
below the summit, but sure,
let's put our stuff on.

00:40:55.682 --> 00:40:56.390
I'm here for you.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.887
Let's go out in the
storm and see how we go.

00:40:58.887 --> 00:41:01.220
So we put all of our stuff
on, we're hiking out of camp.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.680
A guy from another camp
actually unzips his tent,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.690
sticks his head outside,
and he says, hey,

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.816
are you guys bailing off,
getting down the mountain

00:41:07.816 --> 00:41:08.440
from the storm?

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.860
I hear it's going
to last 10 days.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.234
We're thinking
about leaving too.

00:41:11.234 --> 00:41:14.350
And we're like, no, no,
we're going for the summit.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.766
And the guy's like,
get back in your tent.

00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:19.250
No one's climbing today.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.140
And sure enough, we
were the only people

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.139
that even tried to move
anywhere on the mountain

00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:24.902
this entire day.

00:41:24.902 --> 00:41:26.360
15 minutes goes by
and we check in.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.140
I said, how are your hands?

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.530
How are your feet?

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.070
How are you feeling?

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.591
He says yeah, I'm
still pretty good.

00:41:29.591 --> 00:41:30.090
How are you?

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.506
I'm like, I'm
exhausted obviously,

00:41:31.506 --> 00:41:32.490
but I can keep going.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.950
Let's go another 15.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:35.130
15 turns 30.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.380
Another 30 turns into an hour.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.546
You see where this is going.

00:41:37.546 --> 00:41:39.770
About three hours in
the day, this happens,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.140
which is that my pants
that I've been now wearing

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.420
for about 139 days straight,
these GORE-TEX pants,

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.870
the zippers completely
get blown off of them

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.850
and now my leg is
exposed to about 50,

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.200
60 mile per hour winds, minus
60 degree wind chill ish.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.820
And so we're on the side of
this mountain, trying to duct

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.380
tape my pant leg up.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.810
And my watch, which I haven't
taken off in four days,

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.820
the watch strap breaks
and falls on the ground.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.490
And so literally the wheels
are just falling off the bus.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.592
My equipment is breaking.

00:42:05.592 --> 00:42:06.800
I don't know what's going on.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.258
But I'm like, we
got to keep going.

00:42:08.258 --> 00:42:09.380
This is our one shot.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.870
I don't even know if I
have another attempt in me.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.750
And we keep going, hour
by hour, hour by hour,

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.890
and after 12 hours after leaving
in a huge storm on Denali,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.530
we reached this moment,
which is my finish

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.880
line, the summit of Denali.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.360
That's me in yellow there,
taking the last few steps

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.325
after 139 days.

00:42:31.325 --> 00:42:32.315

[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.783
COLIN O'BRADY: I think his line
after that was something like,

00:42:46.783 --> 00:42:48.610
and he's modest too, ladies!

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.990
But I'm a little bit
delirious, as you can tell.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.206
I'm trying to express
my elation in some way,

00:42:54.206 --> 00:42:55.705
but you can see
this look in my eye.

00:42:55.705 --> 00:43:00.100
It's mostly just pure and utter
exhaustion, complete fatigue

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.390
after all of this, but a moment
that I will absolutely cherish

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.470
for the rest of my life.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.570
Just a special
moment to celebrate

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.310
not just my hard work,
but the hard work

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.350
of so many other people
that went into this.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.960
Jenna supporting
this with every ounce

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.390
of her being throughout
this entire two year process

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:17.830
at this point.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.240
And really reaching that moment
was a special thing for me

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.530
personally.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.640
But really this project,
like I said before,

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.430
and to kind of bring us back
in this room a little bit,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.890
was so much more than just
me going out into the world

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.710
and trying to pat myself on
the back for setting two world

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.850
records.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.300
The media arc of all
of this was exciting.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.260
300, 400 or 500
million earned media

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.900
impressions by at this
point around the story.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.340
And this was covered widely.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.740
But the reason that was
mostly important to me

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.100
was it gave us a vehicle to
speak at schools, to talk

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.000
to kids about setting goals.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.020
And it's really been amazing
to see this grow honestly

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.240
beyond my wildest
dreams, from just an idea

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.600
that Jenna and I had in
our apartment in Portland,

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.020
and grow into this global feat,
which was somehow successful.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.690
I still kind of can't believe
that we actually pulled it off.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.310
But it has allowed
us this opportunity

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.950
to speak and share this
story with you and in many

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.529
different of these forums.

00:44:10.529 --> 00:44:12.070
And one of my favorite
things that we

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.462
did with the kids that was a
great part of this project,

00:44:15.462 --> 00:44:17.920
Jenna actually came up with it
while I was climbing Everest

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.320
and it has lived on now
in our nonprofit work,

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.470
is asking kids this question,
which is, what is your Everest?

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.096
Asking this gymnasium
room full of kids

00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:27.511
and they all raise their hand,
because they're so excited.

00:44:27.511 --> 00:44:29.540
I love kids, because
they love to participate.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.669
It's a little harder
with adults sometimes.

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:34.960
But they raise their hands
and they say amazing things.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.610
And that was not just
in person, but actually

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.930
while I was climbing
Everest, you

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.096
saw that I was Snapchatting.

00:44:39.096 --> 00:44:41.500
They were sending us videos
and it was a two way dialogue

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.000
while I was out
there that was being

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.424
brought into these curriculums.

00:44:44.424 --> 00:44:45.840
And kids would say
amazing things.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.100
They'd say, my Mount
Everest is to be

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.740
the first person in my family
to graduate from college.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.107
Or my Mount Everest is to
be a doctor or an engineer.

00:44:54.107 --> 00:44:55.940
Or one of my favorites
was, my Mount Everest

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.390
is to make sure that the
snow leopards stay off

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.610
the endangered species list.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.620
Just the different
ways that kids

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.110
would imagine asking and
thinking about big goals.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.380
And so I want to close
this by something that's

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.824
a metaphor that
really sticks with me,

00:45:10.824 --> 00:45:13.240
and because I think although
I do a lot of work with kids,

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.800
I think this is a pertinent
example to everyone.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.809
It's certainly pertinent to me.

00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:18.850
And the metaphor is this.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:23.020
So I carry this small rock
with me every single day.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.970
And it's a small rock from
the summit of Mount Everest.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.830
And for me, this rock stands
for that moment in the hospital

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.860
when I chose to keep
pushing forward.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:37.240
And this rock also stands
for my untapped potential.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.400
Because as I said,
set goals in my life

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.230
and ultimately
encounter obstacles,

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.830
this rock reminds me that even
Mount Everest, the biggest

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:46.780
mountain in the world,
can be broken down

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.520
to its smallest parts.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.710
A bunch of small rocks
stacked on top of each other.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.824
Many steps leading
to the summit.

00:45:55.824 --> 00:45:57.490
Maybe right now in
your day to day life,

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.560
you're just feeling
overwhelmed, it's too much.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.341
Or maybe here at Google you're
creating some incredible ideas

00:46:02.341 --> 00:46:04.090
or thinking about
innovations, but there's

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.173
people around you saying,
oh, that's not possible,

00:46:06.173 --> 00:46:08.014
that's not going to work.

00:46:08.014 --> 00:46:09.430
Or maybe you've
been badly injured

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:11.138
in an accident at some
point in your life

00:46:11.138 --> 00:46:13.490
and you're feeling like
you can't make it forward.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:16.410
You're not going to be
able to fully recover.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.270
Tragedy and other great
obstacles befall all of us.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.969
I don't care who you are.

00:46:20.969 --> 00:46:23.260
And in those moments, our
minds are flooded with doubt.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.320
We ask ourselves these
questions like, why me?

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.820
Is this even possible?

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.820
Should I give up?

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.256
And our mindset,
of course, shifts

00:46:31.256 --> 00:46:32.880
to this negative
moment, the same as me

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.467
in that Thai hospital.

00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:36.300
But what I learned from
that and what we all

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.720
know is that those
negative mindset,

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.590
we do not have to stay there.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.160
The only question that matters
when facing great obstacles

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.990
is how will you respond?

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:48.880
You have a choice.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.900
And when you shift your
mindset towards the positive,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.500
you will realize that all
of us have these reservoirs

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.010
of untapped potential
waiting to be released

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.400
by us switching that mindset.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.370
I don't think that I am any sort
of superhuman athletic freak

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:05.630
or anything like this.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.060
I think I'm just a
regular guy from Portland.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.310
But I can confidently
tell you this.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.470
Achievement is not
for the select few.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.150
Achievement is just simply
for those who never quit.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.670
It is for those who
set goals and it

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.430
is for those who put the most
steps in front of the others.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.640
Achievement is for those who
overcome the biggest obstacle

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.350
of all, their own minds.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.240
So in closing, I
would say, set a goal.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.160
Take the first steps.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.010
The chair is right
in front of you.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.850
And when your steps get you
there, push the chair further.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.400
When you feel like giving
up, put your boots back on.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.340
Let go of fear.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.270
Remember this story
and remember this rock,

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.810
and watch as your rocks stack
up to the summit of your Mount

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.770
Everest.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.133
Thank you all very much.

00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:04.598
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.470
Any questions?

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:17.760
Happy to answer any questions.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.499
I really appreciate
you guys being here.

00:48:19.499 --> 00:48:20.540
AUDIENCE: First question.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.930
When it comes to
the polls, I mean

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.305
the mountain's pretty clear
where you start at the bottom

00:48:24.305 --> 00:48:25.370
and you end at the top.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.661
How does it work for the polls?

00:48:26.661 --> 00:48:28.320
COLIN O'BRADY: Yeah
very good question.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.760
So I don't make these
rules, obviously.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.134
But for the
Explorers Grand Slam,

00:48:31.134 --> 00:48:32.990
the way that the
record is measured

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.150
is that you need to cross
at least the last degree

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.720
of latitude by
your own manpower.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.970
And so I was dropped off at
the 89th degree at both poles

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:45.319
and crossed the last degree,
which is 69 nautical miles.

00:48:45.319 --> 00:48:46.610
AUDIENCE: What is next for you?

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.765
Because the chair is pretty
far ahead of you right now.

00:48:49.765 --> 00:48:51.785
So what are you going to do?

00:48:51.785 --> 00:48:53.660
COLIN O'BRADY: I have
a couple other projects

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.800
that I'm working on.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.200
I still think of myself,
of course, as an athlete.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.720
I'm 32 years old, and so
there's a couple other big world

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.130
record breaking
projects that I'm

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:03.505
going to have to be coy about
and not quite announce here

00:49:03.505 --> 00:49:06.320
on this stage, but very soon.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.450
Please follow along with
me, social whatever,

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.790
because I'll be announcing
that very soon what those are.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.300
But also it's been a
great joy for me, honestly

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.060
this project in terms of the
arc and the exposure of it,

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.590
has grown beyond
my wildest dreams,

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.464
and it's been amazing
to have the opportunity

00:49:20.464 --> 00:49:22.640
over the last year
to share this story,

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.890
both in a corporate
format like this as well

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.947
as with kids and the
nonprofit work that I do.

00:49:26.947 --> 00:49:28.280
And so that's been a huge focus.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.870
I'm working on a book.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.270
And I know sometimes people
come here on the Google stage

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.280
to promote their book,
so maybe I can come back

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.530
when my book is out next year.

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.210
But there's a lot of
things in the work.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:41.795
But with everything I do,
even these next world record

00:49:41.795 --> 00:49:43.640
big projects for me,
of course, there's

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.280
a huge piece of me that
loves pushing my own body.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.290
But the storytelling part
of it and the ability

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:51.190
to use that as a vehicle to
motivate and inspire others

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.630
will always be sort of
a bedrock of what I do.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:54.130
Yeah.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:54.972
Thanks.

00:49:54.972 --> 00:49:57.710
AUDIENCE: Are you planning on
trying for K2 or Annapurna?

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.950
COLIN O'BRADY: No.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:58.580
Great question.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.070
So a little
mountaineering backstory,

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.930
for those of you who don't know
what those two mountains are.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:08.300
But there are 14 8,000 meter
peaks, which are the 14 tallest

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.040
mountain in the world,
of course Everest

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.710
being the tallest of them and
K2 being the second tallest,

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:16.790
and Annapurna being the
most dangerous of them all.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.499
And so there is a kind of
a holy grail of climbing,

00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:21.290
only one American has
ever accomplished it,

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.430
to climb all 14
8,000 meter peaks.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.370
So I'd be lying to tell you
if I had never thought of it.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.150
It's certainly in
the back of my mind.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.710
I fashion myself
as a mountaineer

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.230
and I love climbing mountains,
but as these other projects,

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.880
as you'll see as
unveil, there's some

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.080
will have mountain
components, but there's

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.830
some that are completely
outside the mountain.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.680
So not just in the
mountains is what I do.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.252
Sort of endurance
sports and really

00:50:41.252 --> 00:50:43.460
finding my own personal
limits in many different ways

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.290
is what I'm passionate about.

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.009
All right, well thank
you guys so much.

00:50:47.009 --> 00:50:48.300
I really, really appreciate it.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.341
This has been a great
pleasure for me to be here.

00:50:50.341 --> 00:50:51.060
So thank you.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.810
[APPLAUSE]
