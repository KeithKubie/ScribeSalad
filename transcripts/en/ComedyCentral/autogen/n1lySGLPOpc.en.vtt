this and I think that the other thing
 

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.949
this and I think that the other thing
that people don't talk about is the

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959
that people don't talk about is the
 

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.150
that people don't talk about is the
highs and lows in marriage and

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160
highs and lows in marriage and
 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.829
highs and lows in marriage and
especially when you're in your when

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839

you're younger and our fifth year was
 

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.980
you're younger and our fifth year was
our hardest year it was because we

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:02.990
