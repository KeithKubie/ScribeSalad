seeing what what was happening there and
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.419
seeing what what was happening there and
that gave rise to a most extraordinary

that gave rise to a most extraordinary
 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.859

outpouring of generosity at the time and
 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.230
outpouring of generosity at the time and
it led to the establishment of an

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
it led to the establishment of an
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.059
it led to the establishment of an
organization called Africa concern which

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069
organization called Africa concern which
 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.789
organization called Africa concern which
was the forerunner of the organisation

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
was the forerunner of the organisation
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.739
was the forerunner of the organisation
which became concerned so that's the

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749
which became concerned so that's the
 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.980
which became concerned so that's the
story about how concern started it went

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
story about how concern started it went
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260
story about how concern started it went
on from there and this is for Bangladesh

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
on from there and this is for Bangladesh
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300
on from there and this is for Bangladesh
became important because Bangladesh was

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

create was just created as a state
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.559
create was just created as a state
couple of years later and then concern

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569
couple of years later and then concern
 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.389
couple of years later and then concern
was in there at the very beginning also

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
was in there at the very beginning also
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090
was in there at the very beginning also
and over the next few years a lot of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
and over the next few years a lot of
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219
and over the next few years a lot of
Irish young Irish Volunteers went to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
Irish young Irish Volunteers went to
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.010
Irish young Irish Volunteers went to
work in Bangladesh in and they I think

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
work in Bangladesh in and they I think
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.559
work in Bangladesh in and they I think
created the the you know the foundation

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569
created the the you know the foundation
 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.069
created the the you know the foundation
of support for the organization

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079
of support for the organization
 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.989
of support for the organization
throughout Ireland which you know which

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999
throughout Ireland which you know which
 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.720
throughout Ireland which you know which
remains to this to this day

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730
 
 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.480
 
I think the if

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490
I think the if
 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.860

act of the irish famine in the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870
act of the irish famine in the
 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.160
act of the irish famine in the
mid-nineteen 19th century from 1845

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
mid-nineteen 19th century from 1845
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.230
mid-nineteen 19th century from 1845
predict through to eighteen forty-eight

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
predict through to eighteen forty-eight
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.790
predict through to eighteen forty-eight
forty-nine the consequences it had a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800
forty-nine the consequences it had a

had a profound impact on the re psyche

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
had a profound impact on the re psyche
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.210
had a profound impact on the re psyche
and and I think it's one of the reasons

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220
and and I think it's one of the reasons
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.720
and and I think it's one of the reasons
why there's been almost an extraordinary

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
why there's been almost an extraordinary
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.450
why there's been almost an extraordinary
empathy on behalf of the Irish people

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460
empathy on behalf of the Irish people
 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.120
empathy on behalf of the Irish people
with poor people in other parts of the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
with poor people in other parts of the
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.460
with poor people in other parts of the
world and i think it is part of the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
world and i think it is part of the
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.040
world and i think it is part of the
reason why organizations like concern

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
reason why organizations like concern
 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.320
reason why organizations like concern
has had such support from the irish

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330
has had such support from the irish
 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.410
has had such support from the irish
people over the over the 40 years of its

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
people over the over the 40 years of its
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.290
people over the over the 40 years of its
existence i think the other factor

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300
existence i think the other factor
 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.360
existence i think the other factor
though which is important is the irish

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
though which is important is the irish
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.300
though which is important is the irish
missionary trans tradition and again

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
missionary trans tradition and again
 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.610
missionary trans tradition and again
that really started in really from the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
that really started in really from the
 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.590
that really started in really from the
from the second half of the 19th century

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600
from the second half of the 19th century
 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.000
from the second half of the 19th century
and over at the following hundred years

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
and over at the following hundred years
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.680
and over at the following hundred years
there were many many thousands of irish

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690
there were many many thousands of irish
 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.350
there were many many thousands of irish
men and women went to work on the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360
men and women went to work on the
 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.810
men and women went to work on the
missions and they would have brought

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820
missions and they would have brought
 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.570
missions and they would have brought
back stories they would have reflected

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
back stories they would have reflected
 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.270
back stories they would have reflected
back the realities of life in all over

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
back the realities of life in all over
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.130
back the realities of life in all over
the world not just Africa Asia Latin

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
the world not just Africa Asia Latin
 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.220
the world not just Africa Asia Latin
America and so on so there was I think a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230
America and so on so there was I think a
 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.340
America and so on so there was I think a
certain basic understanding on the part

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350
certain basic understanding on the part
 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.670
certain basic understanding on the part
of many are his people and basic

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680
of many are his people and basic
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.790
of many are his people and basic
sympathy for as a result of those

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800
sympathy for as a result of those
 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.160
sympathy for as a result of those
stories and so they that I think is very

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
stories and so they that I think is very
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.230
stories and so they that I think is very
key to understanding the the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240
key to understanding the the
 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.010
key to understanding the the
underpinning of support at for NGOs like

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020
underpinning of support at for NGOs like
 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.760
underpinning of support at for NGOs like
concern but also the fact that Ireland

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770
concern but also the fact that Ireland
 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.710
concern but also the fact that Ireland
is one of the relatively few countries

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720
is one of the relatively few countries
 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.260
is one of the relatively few countries
in the world this stage that has made a

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270
in the world this stage that has made a
 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.810
in the world this stage that has made a
formal commitment to reach the UN aid

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820
formal commitment to reach the UN aid
 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.080
formal commitment to reach the UN aid
target of giving 0.7 percent of its

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
target of giving 0.7 percent of its
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.370
target of giving 0.7 percent of its
national income by 2012 and that's based

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380
national income by 2012 and that's based
 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.850
national income by 2012 and that's based
on a very strong cross party political

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
on a very strong cross party political
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.430
on a very strong cross party political
consensus within Ireland and that in

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440
consensus within Ireland and that in
 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.350
consensus within Ireland and that in
turn I think goes back to the factors

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360
turn I think goes back to the factors
 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.000
turn I think goes back to the factors
that I already spoke about the famine

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010
that I already spoke about the famine
 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.190
that I already spoke about the famine
and the missionary tradition

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200
and the missionary tradition
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.260
and the missionary tradition
