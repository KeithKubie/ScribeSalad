[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.010
NAOMI MAKOFSKY: My
name is Naomi Makofsky

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.200
and I'm on our Global
Product Partnerships team

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.170
here at Google.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.757
And I focus on transactions
on actions on Google.

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:15.840
TARUN JAIN: And I'm Tarun.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.677
I'm a PM on Assistant
and Actions on Google.

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:21.010
NAOMI MAKOFSKY: Now if you
think about your typical day,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.380
it's probably full
of transactions.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.590
You're buying coffee.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.050
You're getting your groceries.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.850
You're paying for dinner
with your family and friends.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.730
And this week, we
spent a lot of time

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.190
talking about the shift
toward assistance,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.640
and how actions on Google can
help users get things done.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.070
So today, we're going to
dive into transactions

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.830
how users can buy physical
goods, services, and now

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.310
digital goods, from their
favorite brands, all of you,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.760
through the assistant.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.270
But before we jump
into what's new,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.510
we're going to take a step back
to understand the big picture.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.750
We're at an amazing
point in technology

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.390
where users are actually
turning to their devices

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.800
to get things done.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.620
And we can help them accomplish
their goals across the widening

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.080
landscape of these devices.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.720
They're turning to devices
in their, I want to know,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.370
I want to go, I want
to do, see, hear,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.010
understand moments, expecting
to get from point A to point B

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.990
or have a dinner
reservation booked for them.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.720
But it's not just
their mobile device

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.030
that they're turning to
in these moments of need.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.820
Users are turning to the
devices all around them.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.750
As they have smart speakers,
smart cars, smart TVs,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.560
refrigerators, ovens,
vacuums, this technology

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.200
is embedded in everyday devices
and it's more accessible

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.340
than it's ever been before.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.940
And as we've discussed
throughout IO this week,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.760
our approach at Google to
this era of digital assistance

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.200
is the Google Assistant.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.600
So we're seeing a
few things happening.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.260
So first, interactions
are more natural

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.420
than they've ever been before.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.240
The experiences with our
devices are far from the call

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.520
center menus of the
past, or even the chat

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.140
bots of yesterday.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.760
People are turning
to their devices

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.100
with queries that
are more natural.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.870
And they're querying
beyond the keyword.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.030
So they're asking
for things like, do

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.850
I need an umbrella today, as
opposed to weather, 10011.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.610
Secondly, the platforms where
these digital systems live

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.170
have become mainstream.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.760
And there's
increased familiarity

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.770
from the youngest
members of our households

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.810
all the way up to the oldest.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.030
You can take my parents'
house for example,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.090
where my 66-year-old father
cannot fall asleep without

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.300
the ocean sounds
from his Google Home.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.110
And my mom's thrilled as
you can probably imagine.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.150
But lastly, and
most importantly,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.340
it comes down to our users.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.900
Our users are more curious.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.010
They're more demanding.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.810
They're more impatient than
they've ever been before.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.510
And they turn to their devices
in their moments of need.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.510
So every time they want to
know something go somewhere,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.820
do something, and so on.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
And as a result of
their behavioral shift,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.370
so too have their expectations.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.280
Users want their experiences
on Google to be a few things.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.170
They want it to
be more personal.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.060
They want personalized
results just for them.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.450
In fact, queries
that end in 'for me'

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.740
have increased over 60% in
the last two years alone.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.380
They want their experiences
to be in real time.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.600
From brands, they want real
time response to current events.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.860
They want to be entertained.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.410
They want to be consoled.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.080
We see this on social
channels today.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.222
As they shop, they
want immediate results.

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:27.430
They want to know it can be
delivered to them in just

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.870
a couple of days.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.540
But more than that, they
want to know what's open now.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.190
What can be delivered now.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.740
What hotels they can
even book tonight

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.037
at a discount, of course.

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.620
And we've seen, in
fact, that same day

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.110
travel as an entire
category has increased

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.530
over 100% in the last two years.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.720
But more than just
the what and the when,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.550
it's really about the where.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.850
Users want their brands to
be everywhere there are--

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.030
in their home, on their
phones, in the car,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.689
everywhere they're going.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.730
So as we've been developing
the Google Assistant,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.020
we've thought a lot about
the when, the where and the

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.540
how users are already
interacting with Google.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.540
So when they wake up,
they're asking Google Home

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.060
what their day looks like.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.560
When they're on the go, they'll
turn to Google Maps for help

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.170
with driving directions
and navigation.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.610
They're searching on Google.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.320
They're watching
videos on YouTube.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.930
They're playing games on
their Android devices.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.780
There's already fluid
interaction across surfaces,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.550
devices and properties.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.560
And it spans from
information retrieval

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.457
to content consumption, all the
way through action completion.

00:04:31.457 --> 00:04:33.040
So we've been diving
into these areas.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.290
And we think about how actions
on the Google Assistant

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.270
can help a user
throughout their day.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.830
How can we streamline
their morning?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.070
How can we help the user do
more when they're on the go?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.590
And, of course, how can they
have a relaxing evening at home

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.480
when the day is done?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.090
The ability to transact
with your favorite brand

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.200
is key to task completion.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.000
And this is crucial for any
platform to be truly assistive.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.370
But more than that, the
user has to be able to do so

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.850
in an effortless way.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.040
So before we dive into
the exciting updates

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.480
I know you're all
excited to hear,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.146
we're going to talk a little bit
about the state of transactions

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:07.440
today.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.080
Last year, on a stage
very similar to this,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.140
we announced that transactional
capabilities were coming soon

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.410
to the Assistant via
our transactions API.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.390
And just seven months
ago, we launched

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.120
basic transactional capabilities
via our transactions

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.880
API in the United States.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.490
And now we're doing this
in even more countries.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.890
We're live in the UK,
France, Germany, Canada,

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.187
Australia, and Japan.

00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:33.270
And we're coming to more
countries over the course

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.730
of 2018 and beyond.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.940
Now, when we talk about
transactions on the Actions

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.470
on Google Platform,
we're talking

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.130
about the ability for a
user to purchase a good,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.390
hire a service,
book a reservation,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.820
with their favorite
brand on the Assistant.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.310
And now, no matter what type
of transactional experience

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.470
a developer builds, the
foundational elements

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.030
remain the same.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.770
The developer will
always guide the user

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.450
throughout the purchase process.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.240
And we have APIs and other
helpers, account linking

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.210
and location included,
to assist along the way.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.415
So we're going to break this
down a little bit further.

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:08.790
No matter whether you're a
developer building a flow that

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.670
supports the purchase of coffee,
or the booking of a cycling

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.930
class, it will still boil down
to three transaction types.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.720
First, there is a reservation
or appointment booking.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.280
Now, this could
be free of charge

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.710
or have a cost associated
at the time of that booking.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.220
The next two require payments.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.380
So the developer could
support a transaction

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.600
via the user's payment
method that's already

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.160
on file with their business.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.569
We call this Bringing
Your Own payment method.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.110
Now, this of course,
requires account

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.485
linking, since you need to
know who that user is in order

00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:40.680
to charge their card.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.170
But the developer could also use
a payment helper from Google.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.170
So if you want to support
a guest checkout flow,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.420
this is an excellent way to get
that information from Google.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.870
And we'll talk about
this one in a bit.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.330
Let's start with transactions.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.940
So it's a fairly simple flow.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.110
You build the reservation.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.830
You propose it to the user.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.060
The user confirms.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.565
And like any other
transaction on the Assistant,

00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:04.940
you're able to send them
updates throughout the lifecycle

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.190
of the order, to make sure
that that booking is always

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.000
top of mind.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.910
So it's been a great week at IO.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.620
I've had maybe a few
more french fries

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.450
than I'm used to eating
in my typical week.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.700
So I think I'm going to need
to book a spin class when

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.570
I get back to New York.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.390
So let's consider
a quick example.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.380
I tell the Assistant and I
talk to my favorite spin class

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.070
that I'd like to book a
class for Tuesday at 6 PM.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.650
Jay's Cycle Spot will
then confirm this booking.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.440
Sure, you want a
booking Tuesday at 6 PM?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.080
I say yes, and my
booking is complete.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.390
And then in the Assistant
app, I get updates

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.515
until that spin class to
tell me that this is still

00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:42.889
in progress because I haven't
quite made it to that class

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:43.490
yet.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.850
And I'm always reminded where
I'm going, what I've purchased,

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.939
and the stage of that order.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:52.230
Now let's talk about a case
where a payment is required

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.634
at that point of booking.

00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:55.050
Now remember, this
can mean you're

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.550
bringing your own
payment method,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.170
or you're using
Google to help you

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.000
facilitate that transaction.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.300
So first, you'll want to
check that a transaction is

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.370
enabled in the first place.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.120
And we can also help you with
some other basic settings

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.560
and information to
assist along the way.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.620
In fact, we have
an API where you

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.097
can check that transaction
settings are turned on,

00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:18.180
so you don't get the user
throughout the flow only

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.721
to find out that
they can't transact.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.420
If you're shipping
a good, you'll

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.460
probably need the
user's delivery address

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.440
so we can help with that too.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.924
When a user sets
up the Assistant,

00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:30.590
they choose the
information that they're

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.650
entering into the Assistant,
like payment information,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.960
delivery addresses, and so on.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.150
So should a user share
this information,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.620
and should you need
it, we can help

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.659
by passing you this
information, of course

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.679
with the user's consent.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.350
So if the user hasn't
already entered information,

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.260
like their delivery
address, we can also

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.420
help you by prompting
the user for the entry

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.930
and then resuming
the conversation.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.540
So great.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.340
We know the user
wants to transact.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.880
So it's time to start
building that cart.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.920
Our API has a taken
order object that's

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.710
flexible and easy to
adapt to your use case.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.870
And our client libraries
contain builders

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.870
to help you build quickly
and validate along the way.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.880
So you simply pass us
an order object that's

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.590
similar to what you
see here, and we'll

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.840
take care of presenting it
to the user in a way that's

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.000
clear and consistent,
so the user always

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.500
knows exactly what
they're buying

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.650
and how much they're
paying for it.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.250
Now we know friction can lead to
some drop off in the conversion

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.760
funnel.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.810
I'm sure a lot of you are
very familiar with this.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.430
And we know that it's not just
about creating a seamless cart

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.410
building process,
but getting that user

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.256
through the point of transaction
as easily as possible.

00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:38.630
So let's take a
look at what this

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.520
means when you bring
your own payment method,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.149
or when you use Google Pay.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:45.940
If you're bringing your
own payment method,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.100
you're using credentials
that the user already

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.900
has on file with you.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.180
And it will look
something like this.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.240
And we accept a variety of types
from credit card, all the way

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.380
to cash on delivery.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.982
It's really up to you.

00:09:57.982 --> 00:09:59.440
And we use the
information that you

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.200
pass to us to let the
user know exactly how they

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.599
will be paying.

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:05.140
So here, you'll
notice that the users

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.790
is going to be paying by card.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.460
And it's my gold
card to be exact.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.200
This is the display
friendly name

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.430
that the user is able to
see that matches the payment

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.840
profile that they
have previously

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.270
set up with your company.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.740
Now, if you choose to use a
payment helper from Google,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.820
we'll just need a
bit more information

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.830
about your processor.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.740
Users have already saved
hundreds of millions of cards

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.270
to their Google accounts.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.730
And we can securely pass
this information to you

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.990
during an Assistant transaction
with the user's permission.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.780
So you tell you Google
who you need to charge

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.060
and how much you need
to charge them for.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.070
Google then encrypts
the raw credit card

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.900
with your payment
processor's key

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.880
to generate an encrypted
payment credential

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.872
and passes you that token.

00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:52.330
You charge that
credential like you

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.310
would any other credit
card you have tokenized

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.930
on your app or your site.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.600
And this is already part
of the Google Pay API.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.360
It's the same data
that you provide

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.980
when you use Google Pay in
your Android app or site.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.180
One API that works everywhere.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.910
And Google Pay supports
the processors listed here.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.780
And we'll have more coming
soon to the platform.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.880
Now of course, a
transaction is not

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.890
complete at that
point of purchase.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.390
There are updates
that the user will

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.880
find useful, and follow
on actions to help them

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.330
with next steps.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.080
And with the
transactions API, you

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.930
can send updates to the user
throughout the lifecycle

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.100
of the order.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.690
For example, you
can let them know

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.540
when the orders is received,
when it's being processed,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.640
or even when it's complete.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.800
Also, you can follow on actions.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.630
So this enables the
user to do things

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.770
like modify their purchase,
place the reorder, contact you.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.140
The user can seamlessly
take this quick action

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.679
for that action
post transaction.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.580
TARUN JAIN: As you saw,
we made huge progress

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.950
on enabling transactions
under the Assistant platform

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.150
last year.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.070
During this time, we
worked with a lot of you

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.610
guys, got your feedback, what
works, what does not work.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.090
And that has really helped
us shape our roadmap.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.170
So thank you so much for that.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.690
Today we share a lot
more exciting updates

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.980
as we launch transaction on
more devices in more countries

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.960
and more Google platforms.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.890
We also talk about supporting a
lot more complex transactions.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.350
And then I'll end the talk
with my favorite topic,

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.030
on supporting digital
transactions on Assistant.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.780
So app developers like yourself
can start monetizing Assistant.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.820
Our growth on voice speakers
has been huge this year.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.960
And it's only
continuing to grow.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.540
As you saw through the keynote
and through all the I/O

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.430
sessions that we
have had so far,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.380
it's a big focus area for us.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.510
And we'll continue
investing in it.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.610
So starting this week,
we are announcing

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.210
the support for users to be
able to transact over voice.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.460
What that means
is, users can buy

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.200
physical goods,
physical services,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.430
make reservations, on Google
Home, on third party speakers,

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.610
and even the SmartScreens
that are launching in July.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.980
We talked a lot about
our vision and mission

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.170
to help users
accomplish their task.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.730
We want to go
beyond where we just

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.860
connect the user with
a service provider,

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.490
but also help our users
accomplish their tasks in ways

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.450
that are safe, that are
convenient, and that are fast.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.270
And throughout my session today,
and through some other demos

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.370
I'll do, you'll see
that theme resonating.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.400
So we will keep
touching base on that.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.930
Let's get back to
our user journeys.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.690
You've seen this slide before.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.940
And let's start with
the morning routine.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.910
If you are anything like me,
nothing gets done in the day

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.070
before that first cup of coffee.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.540
And most days a week, that is
my first transaction of the day.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.270
So we'll show you how
Assistant can help solve

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.220
for simple but essential tasks.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.800
So now the fun part,
which is the demos.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.810
As I walk through
the few demos today,

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.200
I have picked up user tasks
that are everyday use.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.170
You and me use that often, so
we can see the pain points.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.410
But also visualize the
opportunities associated

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.180
with each of these flows.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.210
The other thing I'll do is
after each of these demos,

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.380
I will pause.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.292
I'll walk you through
how we build this,

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:21.625
because there's a lot to learn
from each of these demos.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.914
Hey Google, order my
usual from Starbucks.

00:14:27.914 --> 00:14:29.080
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hi, Tarun.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.460
Starbucks here.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.560
That's one tall soy latte.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.180
Anything else?

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.810
TARUN JAIN: No.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.366
That's all.

00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:37.240
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: And
are you picking that up

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.754
at your usual Starbucks?

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.420
TARUN JAIN: Yes.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.795
That sounds good.

00:14:41.795 --> 00:14:42.670
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.280
That'll be $3.45.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.960
But the balance on your
Starbucks card is only $1.04.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.162
Do you want to reload your card?

00:14:52.162 --> 00:14:52.870
TARUN JAIN: Yeah.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.325
Put $20 on it.

00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:55.200
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.060
I've added $20 to your
Starbucks card with Google Pay.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.560
Your total is $3.45.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.420
Are you ready to
place the order?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.620
TARUN JAIN: Yes.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.540
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.190
I put your order in and
it'll be ready soon.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.095
Enjoy.

00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:11.470
TARUN JAIN: Can't
wait to pick up

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.970
my coffee after this session.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.826
So what you saw
here is something

00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:17.200
that our users
will be able to do

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.220
fairly soon, starting in a
week or a few weeks from now.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.320
There are two things that I want
to highlight from this demo.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.040
The first thing is
personalization.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.880
If you remember the experience,
Starbucks knows my name.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.470
Greeted me by my name.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.500
It even knew the drink
which is my usual drink.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.650
You don't have to jump through
hoops our conversational turns

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.170
as we call it in our
world, to figure out

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.790
which coffee you want.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.940
Starbucks even recommended
me a usual location,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.140
based on what my
current location is,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.630
where I've ordered in the past.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.880
So you don't have to
have a conversation

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.650
to understand where you
want to pick up the coffee.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.620
So don't you love a
barista who knows your name

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.203
and knows what drink
you want when you

00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:00.040
walk into the local Starbucks?

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.020
Those are the kind
of experiences

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.020
we want to build on Assistant.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.230
Personalization is very
important to drive user trust,

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.090
to drive user delight,
and loyalty on Assistant.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.180
The second thing I will talk
about is the payment piece.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.890
Now if you think
through the flow,

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.170
in the first couple
of conversations,

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.110
Starbucks knows
what coffee I want,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.830
they know what location
I'm picking it up for at.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.400
So for most users, that's it.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.010
That's all the
information Starbucks

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.920
needs to have a great coffee
waiting for you when you

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.660
actually enter the Starbucks.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.520
But I went through
a not so happy path

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.630
to highlight the point that
when it comes to payments,

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.420
when it comes to transactions,
seamless transactions are

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.560
important.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.700
But equally important is
clear transparency to the user

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.440
on what they are
buying, how much

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.200
they are getting charged for,
and what does their transaction

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.800
look like.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.920
So as we go through some
of these experiences,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.580
you'll see that resonating.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.950
So just to summarize, we
are opening up transactions

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.010
over voice this week.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.230
The devices we support are
Google Home, the third party

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.470
speakers, and the smart
screens when they launch.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.240
We are already live in the US.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.180
And over the next week, we're
opening up UK, Canada, Germany,

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.910
France, Japan and Australia.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.640
So you're thinking
as a developer,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.690
what does it mean for me?

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.670
Do I have to start from scratch?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.920
Do I have to build the
whole experience again?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.690
What do the new APIs look like?

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.720
What is the cost of doing this?

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.830
And every time when I
launch a new service,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.140
do I have to build
my actions again?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.330
The short answer is no change.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.580
If you already
had an action that

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.910
was using transactions
working on phones,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.870
it will work out of the box for
the Google Home devices too.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.640
For the SmartScreens
too when it launches.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.090
So there is no work
needed on your side

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.770
to light up new surfaces.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.420
We do the heavy
lifting to make sure it

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.282
works across all surfaces.

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:01.740
Sometimes as a
developer, you might

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.030
want to have a different
experience on voice

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.140
versus users on a screen.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.702
And that's fine too.

00:18:08.702 --> 00:18:10.410
You can actually build
those experiences.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.520
We support it.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.610
The underlying mechanisms of
transactions remains the same.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.810
So that does not have to change.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.230
So if you don't have an
app on Assistant yet,

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.630
you have double the reason
to go and build one.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.790
Because you get
every new service

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.350
that will launch free with
any of these transactions.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.750
The previous screen talked
about when you bring

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.970
your own transaction method.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.980
But even if you use
Google Pay, there

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.440
is no incremental work
to kind of light up

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.540
the transaction on
the voice surfaces.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.930
There are two other
things I'll talk about,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.740
which I think were in the demo.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.402
The first thing is
built-in intents.

00:18:47.402 --> 00:18:48.610
We launched built-in intents.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.660
This week.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.740
What this means is, when a
user says, order me my coffee,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.500
or get flowers for
Mother's Day-- by the way,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.120
it's Mother's Day this weekend,
in case you dropped the ball.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:05.530
But when you say get me
flowers or order me a coffee,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.010
this is how
Assistant knows which

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.050
action can fulfill one intent.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.540
That's what we use for
matching and ranking.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.270
So as a developer, it's
very important for you

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.370
to sign up for
the right intents.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.890
The second piece I'll highlight
is the conversation design.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.010
Use dialogue flow to
create great conversations.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.600
Stay succinct.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.540
It is very important to
have your brand reflected

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.170
in the conversation.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.200
Make sure you use
the brand tonality.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.440
When you talk to your
users, without seeing you,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.479
they should know that it
is your brand that they

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.770
are having a conversation with.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.750
So now when we talked
about the building blocks,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.800
I talked about
quite a few of them.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.920
The one which is one of
the most important ones

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.510
is account linking.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.420
And if a user starts on
phone, for the most part,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.470
we would send user over-- if
the user starts on Google Home,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.560
we will send the user over
to phone, to account link.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.780
And the drop off percentage
is very, very high.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.470
And no, we don't
like that number.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.370
We have a 90% plus
drop off when we

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.430
point a user over from
a Google Home device

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.180
over to the phone to
do account linking.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.360
So today, or this week, we are
starting a developer preview

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.300
for accounts linking over voice.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.290
So what does that mean?

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.150
What that means is users
can sign into an existing

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.490
account using voice.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.630
They don't have to be sent
over to a screen or a phone.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.750
A user can create a full
new account all in itself,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.490
over voice, without having
to go to any other surface.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.430
And if a user is already signed
into an existing surface,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.040
they will automatically
sign in when they come

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.140
to any of the voice devices.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.670
Sounds magical, right?

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.930
So I'll talk about
how it works as well.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.970
So the flow is fairly
straightforward.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.760
You ask the user for sign in.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.530
Their user gives their consent.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.170
Once the consent is
there, we shared with you

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.256
a Google token which has a lot
of details about the users.

00:21:08.256 --> 00:21:09.880
Think of it as the
user's Gmail address

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.950
and some additional information.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.710
You look for that
user in your user db.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.450
If you find that user,
you can link the account,

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.220
you can create the session, you
can create a token for the user

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.810
and send us their token.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.760
And we will use that
token for future use.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.612
If you do not find
that user, you

00:21:27.612 --> 00:21:30.070
can create that user with the
information that we give you,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.510
and send us a token.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.570
So the 90% drop off
number that you saw here

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:41.050
can come down as low as 0 with
some of these experiences.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.510
It's a straightforward
integration.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.130
I think I'll walk you through
what some of the APIs look

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.020
like.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.900
On the console, there
is a separate setting

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.260
that you have to sign up for.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.770
Do you want OAuth, do
you want Google Sign-in?

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.680
You can choose both, depending
on different surfaces

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.260
and what experiences
you want to build for.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.290
The sign-in API is
straightforward.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.320
It speaks for itself.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.810
Ask for sign-in.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.090
So when you ask for
sign-in, we prompt the user

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.930
to go through the flow.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.890
[INAUDIBLE] token I think
is the most important piece.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.660
So when the user
grants the permission,

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.610
we share all of this information
about the user with you,

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.360
which includes an
email, which includes

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.340
is this a verified email or not.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.560
We send you the
name, the given name,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.340
the last name, and much more, so
that you can create an account

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.630
on your side if you want to.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.510
Now that you are
really thinking,

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.520
voice and the beautiful
experiences voice

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.107
offers, let's talk through
some of the more things.

00:22:42.107 --> 00:22:43.690
So here is the summary
of the building

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.730
blocks that are
talked about on how

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.980
to create a great
transactional experience.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.420
Google Sign-In and the voice
experience we talked about.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.690
Built-in intents.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.530
That's how you identify and get
a lot more implicit traffic.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.670
Personalization.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.000
Needless to say, it's very
important to drive user trust.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.620
Conversation designs.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.080
And then the voice transactions.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.010
And for the friends
who are visiting us

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.300
from all the different
parts of the world,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.730
we are opening up over the next
few months in Mexico, Brazil,

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.845
Spain, Italy, and India too.

00:23:16.845 --> 00:23:18.810
And our pace of
adding more markets

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.020
will only grow through
the last part of the year.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.460
A lot of exciting stuff
happening on voice.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.320
And I'm sure you
guys will want to see

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.980
what those APIs look like.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.250
We'll share the link
toward the end of the talk

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.200
where you can go and see all
of this in a lot more detail.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.010
But let's continue
our user journey.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.870
So we talked about
the morning routine.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.300
Let's talk about
users on the go.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.210
You see, she already has
a coffee in her hand.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.430
So let's talk about some
of the users on the go.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.920
Well, users on the go, they
interact with many more Google

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.840
surfaces outside of Assistant.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.070
They are on search.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.510
They are on Google Maps.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.130
And much more.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.280
And we want to provide
a consistent experience

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.000
to our users when they move
from one surface to another.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.150
Why should users experience be
painful on any Google surface,

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.930
right?

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.960
So we are bringing our
transaction primitives

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.060
across all Google surfaces.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.920
When I talk about
transaction primitives,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.680
I mean identity, which
is the Google Sign-in

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.430
piece we talked about, payments,
receipts, and a lot more

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.190
helpers, like delivery addresses
and locations and so on.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.050
So these are now available
across multiple surfaces.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.600
So let me show you guys
a quick demo on how

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.760
this works on search.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.050
And we will go into a lot
more details with that.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.880
So as I talked about
the essential tasks

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.707
when it talked about
the coffee, here

00:24:41.707 --> 00:24:43.290
is another one of
the essential tasks,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.570
which is getting movie tickets.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.910
So movies near me.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.710
Avengers, everyone
knows, is actually

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.256
breaking every possible
record out there.

00:24:52.256 --> 00:24:53.380
They are doing fairly good.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.420
Let me try to book
a movie ticket.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.400
11 PM show after the
event sounds good.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.240
Fandango.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.850
They offer a fast check out.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.230
Let me try that.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.870
So the Fandango experience
on what we have built

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.490
is all on Amp.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.190
And if you know of Amp,
Amp is all about how

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.250
to deliver content fast.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.650
And now we're bringing
transactions into Amp.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.010
What that means is even the
transactional experiences will

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.011
get very fast.

00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:23.010
By the way, what I am
showing is all production.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.450
It is not a hacked up demo.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.920
So the speeds you will see
are very much what a user

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.920
sees when we take it live.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.950
I can zoom out.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.020
I can select two tickets.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.811
Next.

00:25:34.811 --> 00:25:38.260
The general admission
sounds good to me.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.850
Next.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.810
This is where we share the
payment information over.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.490
As a user, you don't have to
give your payment information,

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.140
your email and so on.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.160
Obviously, none of this
is shared with Fandango

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.399
until the transaction is done.

00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:55.440
I look through the order.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.510
Looks good.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.200
Complete purchase.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.550
And the transaction
goes through.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.470
I have two tickets booked
for me for the evening.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.370
And the other
thing with this is,

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.460
if you see at the
bottom of the screen,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.330
there is my order's experience,
where I can go, I can find,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.100
I can track, and I can
manage all of my orders.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.670
So if I want to find where
there is a receipt for this,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.140
I want to look for the tickets.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.840
A single place where
any user can go and get

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.630
that information.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.170
They can even ask Assistant
what time is the movie tonight

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.240
and Assistant would
answer it for them.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.740
One more thing I
wanted to show here

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.370
was, a lot of you guys
might be Fandango VIP

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.960
exclusive customers.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.640
Looks like I am not.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.344
Let me try to sign up, because I
don't want to lose the points I

00:26:42.344 --> 00:26:43.510
get on buying movie tickets.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.360
I probably watch one
a week by the way.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.960
This.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.900
Share and sign in.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.110
Looks good.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.630
Verifying.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.730
And this is account linking.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.900
I have an account created
on Fandango's site.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.850
It is linked to
my Google profile.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.970
So next time when I go in and
try to get Fandango tickets,

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.830
I don't have to go
through this at all.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.770
Its all linked through
my Google profile.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.732
So that's the demo that
I had for Fandango.

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.440
And this is not just
for movie ticketing.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.660
Our users can do so much
with these experiences,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.470
coming in from search or
Maps or from other things.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.470
The beauty is that users
get a fast checkout because

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.010
of these experiences.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.480
These flows are what we
call convenience optimized.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.694
Users almost never have
to fill out a form.

00:27:32.694 --> 00:27:34.860
And I'll show you a much
more complicated experience

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.695
in a bit.

00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:38.610
And there's a single
place for all our users

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.931
to track all their receipts.

00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:41.430
So they don't have
to think through,

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.870
which merchant
did I buy it from?

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.203
What does the receipt look like?

00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:47.580
Let me dig through my
email address and so on.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.380
And from a merchant's
perspective, think of yourself.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.740
You have full
control over the UI,

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.900
and therefore giving you
the ability to create

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.760
differentiated experiences
for your users.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.880
So there's a customer
coming to your website,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.940
there's a visitor that's
coming to your app experience.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.300
You convert visitor to a
customer, to a loyal customer.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.740
So I think that's one big value
brought by this experience.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.780
You get much higher
conversion rates.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.380
With Google Pay we
have partners who

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.380
have two times higher
conversion rates than what

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.280
they had earlier.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.950
With Google Sign-In we have seen
conversion rates go up by 20%.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.390
So that's a big lift for a lot
of our partners and developers.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.000
And then merchants
spend less time planning

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.560
on the transaction
primitives, which

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.320
lets you focus on what makes
sense for your business.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.240
And what I showed
with Fandango, you'll

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.680
see something like that
coming soon with AMC as well.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.320
So we're going big
in movie ticketing.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.940
One of my favorite activities.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.670
But let's now talk about a
way more complex experience.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.980
Doordash, which
is ordering food.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.920
When you order food, food
ordering uses a lot of nuances.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.852
There is massive menu browsing.

00:28:54.852 --> 00:28:56.310
Like if you go to
a new restaurant,

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.180
menus these days are
like 10 pages long.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.914
It takes you like 20 minutes to
see what all is being offered.

00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:03.330
So there's a lot
of menu browsing.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.820
On top of that, there's
a lot of customization.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.990
You want to see, or as a user,
you want something gluten free.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.965
I want extra spicy.

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:13.900
I want dressing on
the side and whatnot.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.791
So after you actually have what
you want to order figured out,

00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:19.290
then there is
delivery instructions.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.030
I want it delivered
at this time.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.240
I want it delivered in the
window of three to five.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.950
Or delivering instructions,
like three knocks on the door

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.866
and you're going to leave
the food at the door

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.640
or something like that.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.390
And then after that there is
the payment, the receipts,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.282
the tip you want for
the Dasher and so on.

00:29:35.282 --> 00:29:36.990
And then lastly, the
more important piece

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.350
is track your order.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.210
Kid me not.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.430
When you're hungry, you
want to know real time

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.150
where the Dasher is, right?

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.310
And you want that
experience to be fast.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.260
And it should just
work out of the box.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.340
So let's look like what the
Doordash experience looks like.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.590
I'll show a quick video.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.130
Here.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.180
Order delivery from Cucina
Venti with DoorDash.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.030
So this is the
Doordash experience.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.960
It comes up on Assistant.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.810
This is the menu browsing
piece I was talking about.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.660
This is the customization.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.010
All super fast,
built using Amp and

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.490
the transactional experiences.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.679
Add to order.

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:14.220
No order is complete
without dessert,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.770
so let's add a dessert too.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.660
And they have good
desserts by the way.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.020
They are around the street.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.760
So check out the same thing.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.450
There is a payment
already selected.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.140
Delivery address is
already on the file.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.200
And you can do the transaction.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.050
Place order.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.160
Order placed.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.460
So a very, very seamless
experience for our users,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.960
even without signing in.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.670
They can actually
complete transactions

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.503
coming from multiple
different entry points.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.490
So I think we talked
about food ordering.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:46.370
And so on.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.590
So let's talk about users' last
phase of the customer journey,

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.415
which is, have a
relaxing evening at home.

00:30:54.415 --> 00:30:56.290
Today we are announcing
the developer preview

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.620
for digital goods.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.250
What that means is,
our users can now

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.900
buy digital goods on Assistant.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.890
We want to support this
on Assistant, on phones

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.510
and on voice devices.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.400
When we launch this, this will
be across multiple markets.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.290
US, UK, Canada, Australia,
France, Germany, and Japan,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.620
the seven markets we
talked about earlier.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.880
So it's been a tiring day and
a tiring week for all of us.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.240
And when you go back to
your hotel or to your room

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.670
or to your house based
on where you are from,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.220
you might want to
unwind and relax.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.270
I prefer meditating.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.820
So let me walk you
through an experience.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.800
So this is a headspace.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.220
This is a basic session, the
free package from Headspace.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.650
You want to meditate
for a little bit.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.670
10 minutes.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.020
Two days in a row.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.210
And that's all Headspace
offers for free.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.811
So do you want to
subscribe to Headspace now?

00:31:48.811 --> 00:31:49.310
Yes.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.840
Makes sense.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.730
Subscribe to Headspace.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.810
The three products
Headspace offers

00:31:53.810 --> 00:32:00.760
are a $12 monthly, a $95
annual, and a $400 lifetime.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.270
I'm cheap.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.360
So I'll stick with the
$12 monthly package.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.880
Let me try that subscription.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.260
Subscribe to the
$12 monthly package.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.210
So here is a proposed order.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.520
Remember, when we
talked about, you

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.130
have to highlight to the user,
what product they are buying,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.010
what credit card is being used
and what the price point is?

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.250
You want to propose that to the
user before they say subscribe.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.380
Our user says subscribe.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.830
The transaction is done.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.230
You are on your way.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.930
The receipt is sent to you.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.770
You have this
experience enabled.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.020
Now the beauty of
this solution is

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.480
that users can consume
their digital goods

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.310
across Google surfaces.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.970
If a user bought something
on their Android experience,

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.950
like the Headspace
Android app, they

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.530
can access their digital
good on Assistant.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.230
And if a user buys something
using this on Assistant,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.070
they are able to access the
same experience on Android too.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.140
So from a user's
perspective, no matter

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.740
how they jump different
devices across Assistant,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.140
across the Google surfaces--

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.790
the purchases they make,
the experiences they have,

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.400
seamlessly flow.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.110
And from a developer's
perspective,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.540
digital goods on Assistant is
an Assistant Play integration.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.390
So if you already
are a developer who

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.490
sells digital
goods on Play, this

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.260
is a little bit of
incremental work

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.870
to light up transactions
on Assistant too,

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.810
or digital transaction
Assistant too.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.820
You continue using
your Play Console.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.650
You use your Play Console to
manage inventory and so on.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.100
High level, the flow
looks something like this.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.860
A user requests access
to a premium experience.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.100
Or you can upsell a premium
experience to the user.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.620
We check, does a user
have access to the SKU?

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.830
If yes, you can deliver a
premium experience to the user.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.470
If not, you call
the Google APIs.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.690
We tell you what
are the SKUs you

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.450
can sell to this user based
on any filtering criteria

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.780
that you might have.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.190
You propose the order with
the product to the user.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.010
The user confirms yes.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.850
We process the transaction.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.980
And we send you the purchase
token, saying, here is

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.280
the transaction confirmation.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.650
Here's a purchase token.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.020
And you will deliver the
premium experience from there

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.520
on to the user.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.610
So this is a great
opportunity for our developers

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.940
to monetize, be it the
gaming space or premium

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.380
content and experiences.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.230
So, for example, the
Headspace experience

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.580
was premium experiences.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.530
You could have
premium content too.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.900
In the gaming space,
a lot of you guys

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.050
might be aware of coins or
extra lives, extra turns, what

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.010
have not.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.139
And I think whatever you can
sell from a gaming perspective

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.469
works beautifully
in this experience.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.239
And also a la carte
digital media purchases,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.505
like rentals and so on
are all digital goods

00:34:38.505 --> 00:34:40.630
that you can start lighting
up with this experience

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.760
on Assistant.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.466
So just to recap,
with digital goods

00:34:44.466 --> 00:34:46.590
we are opening up the
ability to sell digital goods

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.250
on all Assistant surfaces.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.190
This is in-app purchases
and subscriptions.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.592
And we plan to light up
all Assistant surfaces

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:55.800
in all the markets that we
have transactions live in.

00:34:58.907 --> 00:35:00.740
NAOMI MAKOFSKY: And
over the last few months

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.960
since we've launched,
so many great brands

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.540
have developed apps to reach
their users on the Assistant,

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.720
and enable that user to transact
with them wherever they are.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.730
So you can buy your
pizza from Domino's, you

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.689
can order flowers for Mother's
Day from 1-800-Flowers.

00:35:13.689 --> 00:35:15.230
And pretty soon
you'll be able to get

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.563
your favorite cup of Starbucks
coffee from the Assistant

00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:18.750
as well.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.450
And as we launch
these new features

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.210
and continuously develop
additional functionality,

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.750
we're so excited to see what
you develop for your users,

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.980
and what we can
all build together.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.180
So thank you so much for joining
us on this third day of I/O.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.197
And we hope to
see you next year.

00:35:34.197 --> 00:35:37.882
