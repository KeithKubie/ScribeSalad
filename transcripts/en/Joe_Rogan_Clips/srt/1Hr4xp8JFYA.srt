1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,400
The Joe Rogan experience,
those algorithms, they, they,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,390
the real problem is people think that a
lot of those algorithms are essentially

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,770
designed to get you angry or pissed off.

4
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:17,430
So he wants the next thing take.
Yeah. [inaudible] our children,

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,060
what are they teaching our children next?
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,220
This is the problem with
illegal immigration. I knew
there's a fucking problem,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,180
you know, and then next thing you know,
you just more and more angry. Yeah.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,610
That's like, the argument with
Facebook too is that they're,

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,360
they're trying to figure out
what gets people to engage.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,460
And so the algorithm realize what you
engage with and then that's what they show

11
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,240
you more of and what gets
people to engage. It's shit
that makes him mad. Yeah.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah, totally. It keeps me wanting to,

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,700
I'll watch you fight videos on Facebook
all day. They really do well, just like,

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,820
you know, like brawls in the
schoolyard or like, you know, just,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,270
it just keeps going. I'm like, Oh man,
what's going to happen here? Let's get,

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,920
do they? Yeah, little bit. Yeah.
Well, you know, I'm not, uh,

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't do much of the fighting,
so when I see it it's like, oh,

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,610
this is interesting. Who's going
to win this one? And then the Ahca,

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,840
when the underdog wins. Yeah.
I enjoy watching it. Yeah.
I mean I will watch them.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,820
I want you to do sockets. Obviously
someone's about to die. Right.

21
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:19,680
That seemed like a good,
like couple of punches to the face.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Well the best ones are when
someone deserves it. Yes.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,740
So those are the ones you enjoy when
someone's being a real dick. Yeah.

24
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,490
Someone's like, listen man, you're
being a dick. Yeah. So I just saw one a,

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,550
there's a guy on there,
it was a,

26
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,690
I want to say like a old Middle Eastern
couple that are on a subway and this

27
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,270
dude's like smacking his
wife in the face like that.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,650
And there's this other guys he's across
from him and he's recording it and he's

29
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,260
like, no, not, not in front of me.
And he walked over there and say,

30
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:50,820
he told him like eight times to stop
and then just a punching the shit out of

31
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:55,560
him. So it's nice to see it,
you know? Yeah. There's one, uh,

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,590
of a guy, a, oh,

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,040
it's like a bus and some guys running
his mouth to this old white guy who's

34
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:06,540
obviously a like an x Vietnam
vet. And he's telling him
like, just leave it alone,

35
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,590
man.
Leave it alone.

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,790
And he comes down there and then he walks
up to the front and they just beat the

37
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,660
shit out of him and you just see blood
coming out of his face and it's like,

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,210
you know, he started this,
he engaged that whole thing.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,690
The guy was walking away and then
he goes, the backup ones. Yeah.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,850
Those are the best ones. Yeah.
When someone deserves it. Yeah.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,980
How many, like that's the thing about
like a guy smacking his wife and public.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,060
Yeah.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,140
Like how often does he smack her that
he's so confident that he'll just smack

44
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,230
her in front of everybody.
Right. That's be, um,

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,830
he must think it's acceptable and
everyone else was cool with it.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,890
I must think that he could just
get away with things. Yeah.

47
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,820
Sometimes people just think they can
get away with things. Yeah. It was a,

48
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,760
there was not many people on
that bus, uh, in this video.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,830
Mostly that guy wasn't even paying
attention to them or that most people just

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,490
going to be too scared to say anything.
[inaudible] yeah,

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,010
that's what I mean,

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,820
that this is where it gets real scary
because that is the best argument for the

53
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,600
end of all privacy is that no one would
ever be able to do anything like that

54
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:15,280
because the whole world will be
watching. Yeah, exactly. Honest like you,

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,940
you might, it depends on what kind
of action you could take. Yeah.

56
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,320
If you could literally see everything
that's happening at any time everywhere in

57
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,250
the world.
Yeah.

58
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,680
Well now that everyone's got cam, so it's
like it's close. It's close. Yeah. Right.

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,450
Then they're going to have those
fucking foldable things. Cops on us.

60
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,670
You're keeping a, yeah, the people on
us now it a little bit until too much.

61
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,000
Alcohol's involved something to it
because if you think about like,

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,090
like Dan Kennedy did a speech on secrecy,
it was like in 1961 or 62,

63
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:53,710
but how a boring secrecy is how
dangerous it is for a free society.

64
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,050
And uh, they're basically talking about
secret societies and secret, you know,

65
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:01,240
packs in the government.
And he was basically,

66
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,690
I think a lot of it was him talking
about some of the shady shit that you

67
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,720
experienced and intelligence
agencies and all,

68
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,150
but when you have like kings or when
you have people that are in power,

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,500
like how do they wield that power?
One of the ways they will, their PR,

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,560
it's all secrecy.
If they want to execute people,

71
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,030
they're going to kill people
towards, it's all secret, right?

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,200
No one's the world is not privy to
it. Like what happened to them? They,

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,310
they took them to a bunker, so I'm, yeah,
and they're beating the shit out of him.

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,390
Torturing them. Secret like North
Korea. Yeah, exactly. They are,

75
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,390
they're just isolated from
the rest of the world.

76
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,250
And who knows what the
hell he's doing over there.

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,410
So if we just know the stuff that
he allows us to know. Yeah. No,

78
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,500
that's the perfect example. Yeah.
Of Power and secrecy, right? Yeah.

79
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,540
They just take you in, make you disappear.
He's executed a bunch of people.

80
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,100
Oh yeah. The, we don't even know.

81
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,650
I'm sure that over close to
the tip of the iceberg on that.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,890
I'm sure that still goes on
here too. Well, yeah. I'm sure.

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm sure people are killing people
for someone right now, you know?

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,170
And some of them deserve it. Yeah.
Give him an extra one for me right now.

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,530
Stop being a traveler.
