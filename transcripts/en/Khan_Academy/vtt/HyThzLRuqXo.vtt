00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:02.927
- [Voiceover] What I'd
like to do with this video

00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:06.789
is use some geometric
arguments to prove that the

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.105
slopes of perpendicular lines are negative

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:10.910
reciprocals of each other.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.596
And so, just to start off.

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:14.315
We have lines L and M and
we are going to assume

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.276
that they are perpendicular.

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:18.095
So, they intersect at a right angle.

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:21.148
We see that depicted right over here.

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:24.566
And so, I'm gonna now
construct some other lines here

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.379
to help us make our geometric argument.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:31.014
So, let me draw a horizontal
line that intersects

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:32.733
this point right over here.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.675
Let's call that point A.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:37.474
And so, let me see if I can do that.

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:38.595
There you go.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:42.039
So, that's a horizontal
line that intersects at A.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.252
And now, I'm gonna drop
some verticals in that.

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:49.822
So, I'm gonna drop a vertical
line right over here,

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:54.544
and I'm gonna drop a vertical
line right over here.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:57.683
And so, that is 90 degrees,
and that is 90 degrees.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.338
And I've constructed it that way.

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.652
This top line is perpendicular horizontal.

00:01:01.652 --> 00:01:03.970
And then, I've dropped to vertical things.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.649
So, there are at 90 degree angles.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.872
And let me know setup some points.

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:10.499
So, that I already said, that's point A.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.165
Let's call this point B.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.723
Let's call this point C.

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:17.723
Let's call this point D.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.908
And let's call this
point E, right over here.

00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:28.075
Now, let's think about
what the slop of line L is.

00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:36.001
So, slope of L is going to be what?

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.904
Well, you view line L as
the line that connects

00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:46.987
point CA, so it's the
slope of CA, you could say.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.584
This is the same thing
as slope of line CA.

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:54.046
L is line CA.

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:57.242
And so, to find the
slope, that's change in Y

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.714
over change in X.

00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:02.684
So, our change in Y is going to be CB.

00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:05.419
So, it's gonna be the length of CB.

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.345
That is our change in Y.

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:10.889
So, it is CB over our change in X,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.686
which is the length of segment of BA,

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:17.883
which is the length of BA right over here.

00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:19.133
So, that is BA.

00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:23.471
Now, what is the slope of line M?

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:24.721
So, slope of M.

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:32.743
And we could also say slope
of, we could call line M

00:02:34.062 --> 00:02:34.895
line AE.

00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:37.696
Line AE, like that.

00:02:40.132 --> 00:02:42.890
Well, if we're going to go
between point A and point E,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.824
once again, it's just change
in Y over change in X.

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:48.622
Well, what's our change in Y going to be.

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:50.455
Well, our change in Y.

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:56.233
Well, we're gonna go from
this level down to this level,

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.238
as we go from A to E.

00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.461
We could have done it over here as well.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.005
We're gonna go from A to E.

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.394
That is our change in Y.

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:06.202
So, we might be tempted to say,

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:09.778
well that's just gonna be
the length of segment DE.

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:12.236
But remember, our Y is decreasing.

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:15.532
So, we're gonna subtract
that length as we go from

00:03:15.532 --> 00:03:18.091
this Y level, to that Y level over there.

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:20.424
And what is our change in X?

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.854
So, our change in X, as we go form A to E,

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:29.021
our change in X is going to
be the length of segment AD.

00:03:30.642 --> 00:03:31.818
So, AD.

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:35.481
So, our slope of M is
going to be negative DE.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.741
That's going to be the
negative of this length,

00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.116
cause we're dropping by that much.

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.029
That's our change in Y,

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:43.945
over segment A, over segment AD.

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.528
So, some of you might
already be quite inspired

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:47.778
by what we've already written,

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:49.746
because now we just have to established

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.829
that these two triangles,

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.190
triangle CBA and triangle ADE are similar,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.051
and then we're going to be able to show

00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.335
that these are the negative
reciprocal of each other.

00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.014
So, let's show that these
two triangles are similar.

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:11.280
So, let's say that we have
this angle right over here.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.609
And let's say that angle has
measure X, just for kicks.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.776
And let's say that we have,
let me do another color for,

00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:24.054
let's say we have this
angle right over here.

00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:26.384
And let's say that the measure
that that has measure Y.

00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:30.889
Well, we know X + Y + 90 is equal to 180,

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.353
because together, they are supplementary.

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:38.520
So, I could write that X
+ 90 + Y is going to be

00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:48.148
equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:53.472
If you want, you can subtract
90 from both sides of that,

00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:57.639
and you could say look, X
+ Y is going to be equal

00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:00.201
to 90 degrees.

00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:07.224
These are algebraically
equivalent statements.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.218
So, is equal to 90 degrees.

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:11.055
And how can we use this to fill out

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:13.304
some of the other angles
in these triangles.

00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:17.631
Well, let's see X + this angle down here

00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:19.430
has to be equal to 90 degrees.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.699
Or you could say X + 90
+ what is going to be

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:23.791
equal to 180.

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:25.629
I'm looking at triangle
CBA right over here.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.878
The interior angles of a
triangle add up to 180.

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:32.984
So, X + 90 + what is equal to 180.

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:36.567
Well, X + 90 + Y is equal to 180.

00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:39.173
We already established that.

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.632
Similarly over here.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:44.925
Y + 90 + what is going to be equal to 180.

00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:46.409
Well, same argument.

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.047
We already know.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.410
Y + 90 + X is equal to 180.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.827
So, Y + 90 + X is equal to 180.

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.873
And so, notice we have now established

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:01.790
that triangle ABC and triangle EDA,

00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:06.808
all of their interior angles,

00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:09.063
their corresponding interior
angles are the same,

00:06:09.063 --> 00:06:11.846
or that their three
different angle measures

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:13.268
all correspond to each other.

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:14.480
They both have an angle of X.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.060
They both have a measure of X,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.556
they both have an angle of measure Y,

00:06:17.556 --> 00:06:19.386
and they're both right triangles.

00:06:19.386 --> 00:06:22.216
So, just by angle, angle, angle,

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:26.224
so we could say by angle, angle, angle,

00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:28.073
one of our similarity postulates.

00:06:28.073 --> 00:06:30.156
We know that triangle EDA

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:39.416
is similar to triangle ABC.

00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:52.642
And so, that tells us that
the ratio of corresponding

00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:55.225
sides are going to be the same.

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:59.262
And so, for example, we know.

00:06:59.262 --> 00:07:01.816
Let's find the ration
of corresponding sides.

00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:05.566
We know that the ratio
of let's say CB to BA,

00:07:09.024 --> 00:07:10.396
so let's write this down.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:13.421
We know that the ratio, so this tells us

00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:15.473
that the ratio of corresponding sides

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:16.551
are going to be the same.

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.801
So, the ratio of CB over BA

00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:25.352
is going to be equal to...

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:29.084
Well, the corresponding side to CB,

00:07:29.084 --> 00:07:31.639
it's the side opposite the X degree angle

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.633
right over here.

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:35.551
So, the corresponding
side to CB is side AD.

00:07:35.551 --> 00:07:38.884
So, that's going to be equal to AD over,

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.787
what's the corresponding side to BA?

00:07:42.787 --> 00:07:45.037
Well, BA is opposite the Y degree angle.

00:07:45.037 --> 00:07:47.562
So, over here the
corresponding side is DE.

00:07:47.562 --> 00:07:48.479
AD over DE.

00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:52.530
Let me do that same color.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.363
Over DE.

00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:59.702
And so, this right over,
we saw from the beginning,

00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:02.762
this is the slope of L.

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:05.961
So, slope of L.

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:13.071
And how does this relate
to the slope of M?

00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:15.319
Notice, the slope of M is
the negative reciprocal

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.267
of this.

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.451
You take the reciprocal,
you're going to get DE over AD,

00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:20.721
and then you have to take
this negative right over here.

00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.287
So, we could write this
as the negative reciprocal

00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:24.454
of slope of M.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.298
Negative reciprocal of M's slope.

00:08:36.885 --> 00:08:37.989
And there you have it.

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:39.743
We've just shown that if we

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:42.493
assume L and M are perpendicular,

00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:45.508
and we setup these similar triangles,

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:47.427
and we're able to show,

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:50.817
that the slope of L is
the negative reciprocal

00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:52.317
of the slope of M.
