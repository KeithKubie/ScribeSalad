00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.800
All right, I'll make it super fast.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.510
It's me, Destin. Welcome back to SmarterEveryDay. When you're in a jet, if the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.709
cabin depressurizes, they drop this
little mask out of the top.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
What happens if you're in a depressurized
cabin and you're up above 15,000 feet [4,500m]

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.869
and you drop your mask? Something called
hypoxia takes effect and you got to do

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.039
something about that.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.239
Let's get smarter every day.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.260
You've heard the flight attendants say
this before,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.780
“Secure your own mask before helping others.” But why?

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.820
Why did they say
that? Is the 30 seconds it takes to put

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.739
on a kid’s mask next to me really that
important?

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.620
15 years ago I learned the answer to
this question when I was selected to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.040
participate in NASA’s Reduced Gravity
Student Flight Opportunities Program at

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.670
NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Before I got
to ride in the Vomit Comet I had to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.239
undergo physiological training in a
hypobaric chamber at the neutral

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.500
buoyancy lab.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Fast forward to now. Today, astronaut Don
Pettit is scheduled to renew his hypoxia

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.299
training certification and I asked him
if it would be okay if I tagged along

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.540
let me swim a few laps with him over the
International Space Station mock-up in

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.350
the neutral buoyancy lab before we
headed over next door for Don’s training.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.390
– You look like something the dog dragged in.
– I feel like it, too.
The purpose

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.970
of hypoxia training is to let astronauts
and aviators know when their brain’s

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.200
about to stop working correctly, which is very, very important. If you’re at a high

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.100
altitude in an airplane, the air is
thinner but the cabin is pressurized, so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.540
your body gets enough oxygen to operate. To simulate cabin depressurization, NASA

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.830
puts its astronauts in a chamber at
sea level and then pumps the air out to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.560
thin it out, so that it simulates a
higher altitude.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.980
Don’s training starts with class work
focused on understanding the specific

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.130
signs and symptoms of hypoxia in his own body.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.610
The goal of this training is to understand
your own physiological symptoms so that

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.170
you can take action quickly.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.680
For example, Don said he experiences
tunnel vision and air hunger, but I

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.920
remember for my training 15 years ago
that get really happy and start to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.180
tingle all over

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.600
– I can't take you seriously because this
is what you look like.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.790
– What do you mean? I look perfectly normal.
– [giggling]

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.820
This is the experiment we're going to do:
Don and I are both going to enter the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.450
hypobaric chamber at the same time and
fly to FL250, at which point we are

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.599
going to remove our masks and start to
experience the effects of hypoxia.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.310
Don is the control. He’s a trained
astronaut who recognizes the symptoms

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.069
for hypoxia and immediately corrects for them.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.239
I, on the other hand, am under the direct supervision of a NASA flight surgeon and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.220
after I notice the effects of hypoxia,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.790
I’ve asked if I could delay for about
one minute so we can better understand

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.180
the physiological effects of not
immediately putting your mask on.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.860
OK, here we go, we're getting set up.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.800
While Jerry gets me situated, I’m
going to talk about the two types of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.500
decompression: Number one, rapid
decompression this is like being inside

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.940
of an explosion.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.920
You dump all your pressure instantly, all
the moisture condenses out of the air,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.100
you’re suddenly in a cloud.
Very scary, very violent

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.030
Yeah, we’re not going to do that.
What we're going to do is simulate a slow,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.440
steady leak. We’re going to start at sea
level and ascend at 5,000 feet [1,500m] per minute

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.510
all the way up to 25,000 feet [7,500m], or as aviators call it, flight level 250

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.290
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.120
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.550
 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.120
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.930
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.380
 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.200
 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.660
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.960
 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.890
 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.810
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.330
 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.560
 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.080
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.100
 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.490
 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.350
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.340
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.520
 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.280
 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.220
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.150
 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.849
 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.110
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.490
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.960
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.380
 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.300
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.920
 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.140
 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.810
 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.090
 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.680
 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.900
 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.200
 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.420
 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.680
 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.990
 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.280
 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.520
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.820
 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.750
 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.700
 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.760
 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.650
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.130
 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.060
 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.640
 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.900
 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.780
 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.140
 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.200
 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.480
 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.260
 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.900
 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.360
 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.240
 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.360
 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.180
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.480
 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.060
 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.280
 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.350
 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.420
 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.900
 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.700
 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.820
 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.600
 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.060
 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.560
 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.040
 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.670
 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.760
 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.080
 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.780
 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.950
 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.590
 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.430
 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.230
 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.470
 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.700
OK, I want to make one thing abundantly clear.
We performed this demonstration at

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.360
25,000 feet [7,500m]. I had about three to five minutes of consciousness left.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.040
However, most airliners travel at 35,000 feet [10,000m].

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.400
Look at this chart: There is way less oxygen up there.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.660
At 35,000 feet [10,000m] you literally have seconds
of useful consciousness at that altitude.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.290
You can go from a normally rational
person to someone so helpless you can

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.850
even save yourself if your life depends
on it.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.400
I don’t-

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.770
I don’t wanna die

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.700
I don’t tell you this to scare you. I
simply want you to understand the

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.300
physiology behind that little preflight
announcement.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.300
“Put your mask on first before helping others.”

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.200
 

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.700
 

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.480
 

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.500
Look, I don’t want to get too deep or philosophical with this,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.180
but I think there's a neat metaphor here.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.180
Sometimes it’s easy for me to see the
problems in other people and focus on

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.770
that and I get so carried away with
fixing other people that I forget that I

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.330
have a problem too.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.580
And I think that’s what’s so cool about
this demonstration.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.100
Sometimes you just got to put your mask on first and get yourself sorted

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.520
before you can help others.

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:17.650
– So thanks again for saving my life, by
the way.
– You're welcome, it was an honor and a pleasure.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.510
– It was great.
– [Inaudible] all the time.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.530
–Thank you.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.400
There you go, now we learned why
you need to put your mask on first

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.089
before you help other people.
You don’t want to get hypoxia.

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:29.490
I'm Destin

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.490
you’re getting smarter every day, have a good one.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.290
I want to say thank you to the awesome people at NASA’s neutral buoyancy laboratory.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.900
They kept me super safe, super informed and they educated me and made me smarter every

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.230
moment I was with them. That was really awesome.
Thank you so much, guys

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.680
Anyway, I’m Destin you’re getting smarter every day.
Have a good one.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.700
–What’s the deal here, Don?
– Well I cut the regular lens off of the goggles

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.900
–OK
– and then I took an old pair of
glasses and I cut the plastic to fit my

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.360
goggles and then I glued them on.
– You basically MacGyvered your own goggles,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.240
so that you had correction underwater.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.860
– That’s right.
– That’s pretty good.
