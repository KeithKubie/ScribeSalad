&gt;&gt; Hey. Although the human body is really complex, we can

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.000
learn a lot about it by analyzing individual pieces or genes and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.100
seeing what the overall outcome is. Okay but what happens if

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.270
a single trait is affected by more than just a single gene?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.485
&gt;&gt; Well, that means we're going to have to dig a lot deeper,

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.630
and we're going to have to determine exactly how genes are related to each

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.890
other as well as to the traits that they influence. In the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.280
next lesson we're going to learn about

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.570
traits that are regulated by multiple genes.
