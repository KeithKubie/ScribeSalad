00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:02.486
- [Voiceover] A store has
five different lengths

00:00:02.486 --> 00:00:06.177
of extension cords for sale,
as shown in the table above.

00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:10.566
If the range of lengths of
the five cords is seven feet,

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.816
what is the greatest possible value of X?

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:15.198
So the range is the difference

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:17.461
between the highest value
and the lowest value,

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.782
and we're trying to find the
greatest possible value of X,

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:23.800
then X should be the greatest value here.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.704
And let's see if that can work out.

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:26.946
So let's just write the cord lengths,

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:28.362
and I just like to write 'em in order

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:29.721
just to visualize things.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.659
So let's see, the lowest one is six feet,

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.457
and then we have a seven foot cord,

00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:36.779
then we have an eight foot cord,

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:38.857
and then we have an 11 foot cord.

00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:40.180
And then we have to X foot cord,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.084
but let's not think
about that one just yet.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.383
So if these were just
the four types of cords,

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:47.540
the range here would be
the high minus the low.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.895
It would be 11 minus six,
which is equal to five.

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:53.554
Now, they tell us that the
real range is seven feet,

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.793
so that means we can
go even higher than 11.

00:00:56.793 --> 00:00:58.476
And one way to think about it is,

00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:00.937
if we're trying to maximize the value for,

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:04.072
if we need to maximize the value for X,

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:08.216
then we need to go seven
higher than the lowest value.

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:10.561
So the lowest value is six,

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.856
you go seven higher than
that, so plus seven,

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:17.515
you're going to get to 13.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:22.135
So X, the highest possible
value for X is 13.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:23.458
So X would be,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.838
X would be equal to 13.

00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:29.717
So X is 13 right over here.

00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:30.634
Now, if someone were to say,

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:32.898
"What would be the lowest
possible value for X?"

00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:34.279
you'd wanna go the other way around.

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.774
So if there's six, seven, 18, and 11,

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:39.515
and if you wanted to
minimize the value for X,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.732
you wanna X as small as possible,

00:01:41.732 --> 00:01:42.452
then you would say,

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.159
"Okay, well X is going to be the minimum

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.040
"of our cord lengths,"

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.244
and then you would take
seven less than the highest.

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:50.984
So 11 minus seven,

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:55.605
11 minus seven is going
to get you to four.

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:56.353
So this question said

00:01:56.353 --> 00:01:58.849
what's the highest possible
value of X, it's 13.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.368
But if it said what's the
lowest possible value of X,

00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:03.818
then it would be the
high, the existing high,

00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:08.148
minus seven so that you
can get a range of seven.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:09.471
And so in that case you
would've gotten four.

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:11.073
But that's not what they,
they didn't ask us this.

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:12.652
I'm just, you know, in
the future you might see

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:14.342
a question like that.
