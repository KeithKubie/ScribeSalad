00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.525
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Talking
about students at MIT.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.260
So some of you are
graduating soon,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.695
and this might be
your last chance

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.197
to ask Noam Chomsky a question.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.099
So anyone who hasn't
spoken yet would

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.168
like to ask a question
before you graduate?

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.209
AUDIENCE: We've talked in this
class a bit about silencing

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.213
and how that kind of leads
into the whole system.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.850
Sorry, I can speak up.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.585
So we've talked about silencing.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.420
NOAM CHOMSKY: About?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.120
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Silencing.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.088
NOAM CHOMSKY: Silencing.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.322
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.225
And how stories are hidden,
like you talked about--

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.563
what can we do about that?

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.799
NOAM CHOMSKY: About silencing?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.367
AUDIENCE: What
measurable steps can we

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.736
take towards
uncovering the stories

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.372
and actually making
change happen?

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:19.212
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, what you
do about silencing is speak up.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:22.515
We have a lot of
freedom if we use it.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.484
In fact, a lot more
than in the past.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.689
Take the last thing I mentioned.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.794
For women, the opportunity is
to speak up and become active

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:40.567
and have an impact is way beyond
what it was, say, 50 years ago.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:46.706
In fact, I was talking to
Michel about this before.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.875
I got a ton of email.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.711
And a lot of it is
from young people.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.747
And one question that keeps
coming up over and over

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.816
again is, everything's awful.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.485
What can we do?

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.956
But if you look closely
over many years,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.126
I've noticed that the
kinds of questions you get

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.562
depend on where the
people are coming from.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.132
So if people are coming from--

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:17.871
say when I go down to give talks
in immigrant slums in South

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.107
Boston, nobody ever
asks what they can do.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.309
They tell me what they're doing.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.314
When I go to a remote
village in Southern Colombia

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.084
where people are being
murdered by paramilitaries

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:34.687
and there's a chemical
company trying to--

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.525
a gold mining company trying
to destroy the water supply.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.326
They don't ask me,
what should they do?

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.662
They tell me what they're doing.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.131
When people are
privileged and have

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.270
every opportunity in front of
them, they ask, what can we do?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.439
And the fact is almost anything.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.142
There's all sorts of
opportunities open.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.178
Way more than there
were in the past

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:03.183
because we do enjoy the legacy
of people who have struggled

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.186
in the past under much
harsher conditions

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:11.224
and have provided us with the
opportunities we now have.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:15.995
Like, say, the opportunities
to be a student at MIT.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:16.896
That's an opportunity.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.865
It gives you all
sorts of things.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.268
It was closed to half the
population 50 years ago.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:28.007
It was closed, of course, to
minorities almost entirely.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:35.982
Well, it just illustrates what's
gone on all over the society.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:40.420
I mean, take, say,
the Sanders campaign,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.758
which I think was the most
important aspect of the 2016

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:49.728
election, by far.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.865
Out of that, there are groups
developing that are really

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.367
trying to do things.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.769
You can be part of that.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.305
Make new ones.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.841
All sorts of opportunities.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.944
And I think the
prospects for the future

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:09.949
are not too bad when you think
of people's actual attitudes.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.118
And the way those
attitudes could

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:17.523
be melded into activist and
political and other programs

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.526
to bring about
changes in society.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:24.597
So I don't think there's a
real shortage of opportunity.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:32.372
I mean, there are all sorts
of efforts to atomize people,

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.940
keep you alone.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.243
That's one of the functions
of social media incidentally.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:40.380
You sit alone with--
whatever it is--

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.249
your device and
you think you have

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.152
friends in Indonesia and so on.

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:51.824
But you're really separated
from the people around you.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:56.162
Atomization is a very important
way of controlling people,

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.399
because you can only do
things if you work together.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.303
So when you're all
separated, that's great.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.507
Then, those who really run
things, they do get together.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:12.979
They don't sit around
looking at iPads, and so on.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.114
So you can keep the population--

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.085
In fact, that's one of the main
things consumerism is about.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:22.355
You take a look at the history
of the advertising industry.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.357
It's quite interesting.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.860
The huge advertising and
public relations industry

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.963
developed in the freest
countries in the world,

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.500
in Britain and the United
States about a century ago.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.469
And the reason was pretty clear.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.404
It was often stated.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.207
People had won enough
freedom, so that you

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.876
couldn't control them by force.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.312
So you had to control
them in other ways.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.181
And the best way
of controlling them

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:53.853
is what was called
convincing them

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:58.024
to be concerned with the
superficial things of life,

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.893
like consumption.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:06.332
So if you can get
to a stage where--

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.301
thinking of my granddaughter.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:12.138
Teenage girls on a
Saturday afternoon.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.208
The best thing they can think of
doing is walking through a mall

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:19.912
and looking at things
they can't buy.

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.881
That's great.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.650
When you get to a
society like that,

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.253
you've got people under control.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.189
And there's some
pretty obvious things

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.260
that are never discussed,
like you've all

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.797
heard 10 million times about
the wonders of free market

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.465
societies.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.336
But almost no one tells
you that the business world

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:46.072
hates free market society.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.342
And in fact, they spend hundreds
of billion dollars a year

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.544
to undermine markets.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.247
It's called advertising.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:58.618
Anyone who has studied
economics knows that markets--

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:03.122
the marvels of markets are based
on informed consumers making

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.991
rational choices.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.994
Then, you study the mathematics
and you make up the models,

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:08.895
and so on.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.997
Take a look at the real world.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:15.168
Hundreds of billions of
dollars are spent every year

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:20.473
to ensure that uninformed
people make irrational choices.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.942
It's called advertising.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.344
If you had a market society.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.916
If, say, Ford Motor
Company has cars to sell,

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.552
what they would do is say,
here are the characteristics

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.487
of our cars.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:36.956
Small ad on television.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.124
Here's the characteristics.

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:41.227
Here's what Consumer
Reports says about it.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.695
That's not what they do.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.364
What they do is try
to create illusions,

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:50.002
so you will be uninformed and
make an irrational choice.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.104
In fact, while the
economics department

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:55.074
is talking about
rational choice models

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:57.343
and so on, with
informed consumers,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:01.214
the business world is trying
to make sure it doesn't happen.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.317
Of course, that's the
thing that has the effect.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.986
Speaking of silencing,
how much do you

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:10.156
hear about this in
economics courses?

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.826
Or in the general discussion?

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:14.460
It's not deep.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.294
It's not profound.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.596
It's not quantum physics.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.897
We all know it.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.100
It's right in front of our
eyes, but it's kept silent.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.769
And those are the kind of things
you have to break through with.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.438
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Thank
you so much, Noam.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.672
That was wonderful.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:29.742
[applause]
