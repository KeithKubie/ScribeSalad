FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone,
and thank you for coming.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.220
I'm so excited to introduce
Jane Chen, who's the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.150
co-founder of Embrace.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.670
As she'll tell you shortly,
Jane is saving millions of

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.710
lives with an incubator that
sells for 1% of the

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.500
traditional cost.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.590
Her mission is to create
innovations that represent a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620
new trend in technology--

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.090
simple, localized, affordable
solutions that have the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.770
potential to make huge
social impacts.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.479
Prior to Embrace, Jane worked
with nonprofit organizations

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.390
on health care issues in several
developing countries.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.980
She spent several years as the
program director of a startup

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.150
HIV AIDS nonprofit in China,
and worked for the Clinton

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.630
Foundations Initiative
in Tanzania.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.230
She also worked at Monitor
Group as a management

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.560
consultant.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.750
Chen has been selected as
TEDIndia fellow, a TED senior

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.890
fellow, an Echoing Green
fellow, and a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.110
Rainier Arnold fellow.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.820
Recently, she was also named a
young global leader by the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.870
World Economic Forum.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.040
She holds an MBA from Stanford
University and a master's in

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.680
public administration
from Harvard.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.330
With that, let's all welcome
Jane, who will be speaking

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.800
about embracing life.

00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.430
JANE CHEN: Thank you
so much for being

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.200
here on a Friday afternoon.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
So I wanted to start
by walking you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.875
through a quick exercise.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.550
I'll ask everyone to
play along here.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.740
Please close your eyes
and open your

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.880
hands in front of you.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880
Now imagine for a moment
what you could

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060
place in your hands--

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.670
your keys, maybe an apple.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.260
Now open your eyes.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.500
What about a life?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.390
What you see here is
a premature baby.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
He looks like he's sleeping
peacefully, when in fact, he's

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.560
struggling to stay alive because
he can't regulate his

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.180
own body temperature.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.270
There are millions of babies
like this born every year

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.370
around the world and the mission
of Embrace is to give

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.410
these babies a chance to survive
through a low cost

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.030
infant warmer.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.790
Embrace is a social enterprise
that aims to provide a line of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.320
innovative and affordable
medical devices for emerging

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.020
markets, starting with
our warmer, and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.840
was started at Stanford.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.380
Back in 2007, when I was doing
my MBA, I took a class there

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.730
called Design for Extreme
Affordability, which is half

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.430
MBAs and half engineers.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.610
And we were given the challenge
to build a baby

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.220
incubator that cost less than
1% of the cost of a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.230
traditional incubator, which
is $20,000 in the US.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.820
My own background before
business school, I was doing

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.580
HIV AIDS work first in China
and then in Africa.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.100
And through those sets of
experiences, I saw these huge

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.280
health care disparities
in developed

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.660
versus developing countries.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.110
In the US, anyone who needs AIDS
medication can get it.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.260
But in places in China and
Africa, this was virtually

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.630
impossible.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.120
So I saw many people who lost
their lives or children who

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.910
lost their parents because they
weren't able to access

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.330
these medications.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.300
And the most frustrating part of
this, to me, was that these

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.250
are medications that exist and
these are people that were

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.860
dying for preventable causes.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.340
So Embrace has become a platform
for me and my team to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.700
try to bridge that disparity
in health care.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.230
And up here are my three
co-founders, who I've been

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.850
incredibly fortunate
to work with.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.920
So I wanted to walk you through
some of the design

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.380
process that we used
to develop Embrace.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.450
There's a lot of talk about
design thinking these days,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.930
and I think it's really just
a fancy way of saying

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.980
humancentric design that's
very experimental.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.470
As I'll walk you through each
of the steps, first is to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.390
really understand the problem
at hand, to be out where the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.810
problem is, to observe it, and
develop that user empathy.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.480
And defining the problem is
the most important step in

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320
this entire process.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.050
It seems very simple, but that's
what paves the way for

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.970
human centered product
development.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.130
And there's ideating,
prototyping, and finally

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.380
testing, and this is all
an iterative process.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.740
So the first step for us was
to really understand the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.990
background of the problem.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.320
There are 20 million low birth
weight and premature babies

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.510
born every year around
the world.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.470
Four million babies die in the
first 28 days of their life.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.790
That's 450 babies every hour.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.380
One of the biggest problems
they face is staying warm.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.850
Because they're so tiny, they
don't have enough body fat to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.670
regulate their own
temperature.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.070
And for this reason, many either
die or they grow up

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.120
with extreme long term
health problems.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.030
Incubators, of course,
are the most common

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.790
solution to this problem.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.690
But not only are they expensive,
they require a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.910
constant supply of electricity,
so you're not

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.490
going to find them in rural
areas where most of these

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.900
babies are dying.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.550
And instead what you see are
light bulbs-- light bulbs are

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.170
the most common solution out
there, but in every clinic

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.290
I've been to that uses a light
bulb, you hear stories of them

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.640
shattering over babies because
of problems with the circuits.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.910
Or you see parents who tie hot
water bottles surround their

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.670
babies' bodies or hold them over
hot coals-- so, really

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.070
unsafe, ineffective solutions.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.190
From there, we went to
the observe phase.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.020
So we went across the length and
breadth of India talking

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.460
to mothers, midwives, doctors,
community health care workers,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.790
trying to understand the
root of the problem.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.570
And we heard stories
like this.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.480
This is a woman that
I met on one of my

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.570
first visits to India.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.210
She lives in a village
in Maharastra.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.410
And she had given birth to a
tiny baby girl and had taken

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.610
this girl to the village
doctor to be

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.960
placed in an incubator.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.510
The doctor advised her to take
her baby to the nearest city

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.150
hospital that was over four
hours away, and she didn't

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.270
have the means to get there,
so her baby died

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.380
as a result of that.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.840
And we heard this story
over and over again.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.700
We also heard stories
like this one.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.373
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:45.430
JANE CHEN: Sujatha lost all
three of her babies.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.700
And again, in every village
I've been to in India, you

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.050
hear the same story over
and over again.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.730
And so it was based on research
like this that we

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.480
realized the problem wasn't
serving doctors

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.040
and big city hospitals.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.470
We needed a product that could
get to women like Sujatha.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.490
In India, 50% of births take
place in a home setting.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.030
In countries like Bangladesh,
that number is as high as 90%.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.720
And so we defined the problem,
and thought about the user as

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.630
a desperate parent in a remote
village without resources to

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.470
access a major hospital with
the need being the means to

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.760
give their dying baby
a chance to survive.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.050
And so with that, we realized
that we needed a product that

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.260
could work without a constant
supply of electricity, that

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.039
has no moving parts, that is
portable, that's safe and

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.070
intuitive to use so even a
mother or midwife could use

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.100
it, and something that would
allow for close mother to

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.050
child interaction.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.280
So we begin prototyping.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.090
You can see all the different
ideas we had, ranging from a

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.950
hot water incubator to a tent
like device to a maternity

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.400
vest that my colleague Linus
is nicely modeling here.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.090
And the idea that we like the
best that fit our criteria was

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.400
that of a little sleeping bag
that uses a phase change

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.610
material, a wax like substance,
to keep the baby at

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.300
a constant temperature.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.310
And I'll show you the final
device and then some of the

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.490
evolution of getting
to that point.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.690
So this is the Embrace Nest.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.080
As you can see, it looks
like a little

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.110
sleeping bag for a baby.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.030
It's made out of entirely
waterproof materials, so you

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.590
can clean it easily between
every baby.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.861
It's reusable.

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.650
But The core technology
sits in the back here.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.420
So this is a pouch of
what's called a

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.740
phase change material.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.690
It's a wax like substance.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.700
You can heat this either with
boiling water or with an

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.755
electric heater.

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:45.880
But the key is once melted,
it stays at the exact same

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.000
temperature for up to eight
hours at a time, after which

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.450
you can simply reheat it.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.700
So I'll pass this around.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.060
And it looks like a very
simple device, but it's

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.410
actually taken hundreds
of iterations

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.550
to get to this point.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.360
This is the very first
prototype--

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.800
very cliche, but the drawings
are on the back of a napkin,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.130
and we used margarine
to prototype.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.310
It has very similar qualities
to the wax.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.460
And then the first renditions
of this, we actually had a

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.300
product-- we just went to a
Salvation Army, found all the

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.170
relevant baby gear, and the
very first version of the

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.060
product actually has a tube
running through it that you

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.190
pour boiling water into
that melts the wax.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.190
And then someone said to us,
it's probably not a good idea

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.560
to boiling water right next to
the baby's head, so we quickly

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.940
scrapped that idea.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.245
Then we went to a second
version here.

00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:51.920
We realized that babies in these
countries don't wear

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.170
diapers, so we needed something
that was really easy

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.950
to clean and that
was waterproof.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.050
This is where we started moving
to those materials.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.620
I'm going to skip a
few of these here.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.650
This one's really interesting,
because initially we had it

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.990
such that the wax would just sit
right inside the sleeping

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.660
bag and the baby would
lie on top of that.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.910
The wax is food grade, it's
completely nontoxic, that

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.480
would be totally safe.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.920
But there is this perception
of fear from mothers of the

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.800
wax leaking onto the baby, and
so that led us to create a

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.560
separate compartment that you
see in this current edition

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.750
where the wax sits.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.350
Because cleanliness is so
critical-- you don't want

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.960
cross infection across
babies--

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.780
we created this sleeping bag out
of one piece of fabric, so

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.560
there are almost no seams
in there, so dirt

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.720
can't collect inside.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.080
You see a little plastic window
in the front there This

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.790
is something doctors were
requesting, because they

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.920
wanted to monitor the baby's
breathing and color, and so we

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.490
added that in.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.310
This is a picture of
my nephew that I

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.716
stuffed into the device.

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:58.720
We show it, because user testing
is key, so use your

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.960
family members if necessary.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.100
And this is an interesting
story.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.320
So on the wax pouch, what you'll
see is a temperature

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.110
indicator that tells you when
the pouch needs to be reheated

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.070
or when it's too cold
or too hot.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.850
And initially we had a numeric
scale going from about 30 to

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.930
40 degrees Celsius.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.180
But as we went in villages and
tested this, mothers would say

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.900
to us we don't trust
Western medicine.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.120
If you give me a certain dosage
of medicine to give to

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.870
my baby, I'll cut in half
because it's too strong.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.200
So if you told me to keep this
at 37 degrees Celsius, I'll

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.060
keep it at a little less
than that, because it's

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.570
probably too warm.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.030
So it's something we certainly
didn't expect to hear sitting

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.750
in Palo Alto.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.320
But that led us to this version
of the design, which

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.850
is a happy face,
frowning face.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.200
And now it's just simply
a OK, not OK.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.990
So, just really simple cultural
nuances have had a

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.240
huge impact on the way we've
gone about designing the

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.310
device and making it
really locally

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.420
appropriate to these markets.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.090
And from there, we
went to testing.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.000
So this is the very first low
birth weight baby Nisha that

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.560
was placed in the device.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.420
And since then, we've done
randomized controlled trials

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.830
now and across over 200 babies
showing that our product is as

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.560
safe and efficacious as a
standard of care, even in a

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.960
tertiary level setting.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.430
So our progress to date-- our
product is available in

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.890
hospitals across south India
with initial pilots being done

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.780
across seven countries.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.510
As I mentioned, we have

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.720
multi-center studies completed.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.090
We have an ISO 1345
certification, meaning that we

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.950
meet international standards
with both regards to

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.700
manufacturing and design.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.920
We have a global partnership
established with GE

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.510
Healthcare.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.700
They're our largest global
distributor.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.990
And Embrace has been recognized
as one of the top

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.660
innovations by the World
Health Organization.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.310
But what's been most exciting
is seeing our product in use

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:00.130
in the field and the impact
that it's having on lives.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.450
This is one of the very first
babies to use the device.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.870
This is an 850 gram baby,
less than two pounds.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.420
And when I went to the hospital,
the doctor said to

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.025
me, there's no way this baby's
going to survive.

00:14:13.025 --> 00:14:15.690
And If it weren't for your
product I would just

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.550
leave him to die.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.300
I went back two weeks after this
photograph was taken and

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.230
the baby was still alive.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.930
Two weeks after that, he was
sent home with his parents.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.990
This a woman named Mandala who
gave birth to baby slightly

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.290
over two pounds.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.840
Mandala lost her first two
babies, as is so often the

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.580
case in the women
that we help.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.910
And in this case, what was
wonderful is that you could

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.130
see Mandala's confidence
starting to come back as her

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.070
baby gained her health.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.340
And in many of these settings,
what happens is not only do

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.100
women lose their babies, but
they are blamed by their

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.320
communities for the loss
of their babies.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.280
And oftentimes their families,
their husband's families, will

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.140
pressure him to leave
her if she can not

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.650
produce a healthy baby.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.200
So there's a really important
aspect to this work which goes

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.080
beyond saving babies, and that's
empowering these women.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.820
This is one of my favorite
stories.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.560
This is a woman named Kurthi.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.760
Kurthi also lost her first
baby and gave birth to a

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.420
second, a 3 and 1/2 pound baby,
who was placed in our

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.220
product for about seven
days' time.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.860
And I went back and visited
Kurthi a few months later.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.450
You can see now the baby's nice
and healthy, very chubby.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.090
And she'd gone back and
told her entire

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.330
village about Embrace.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.590
Even the 110 year old great
grandmother knew about the

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.180
product and did a little
dance to thank us

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.430
as we left her home.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.612
And this is another
favorite story of

00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:57.880
mine, which is in China.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.300
I just visited this orphanage
that we're working

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.910
with two weeks ago.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.300
And this is baby Long.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.360
He was born about seven
months ago.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.290
He was two pounds when
they found him.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.970
This is an orphanage that
rescues abandoned babies.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.950
They brought him to the
orphanage and kept him in our

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.610
product for about 30 days.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.370
And this is baby Long
seven months later.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.800
You can see that he's healthy,
he's very happy, very

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.980
interactive.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.900
And they informed me that this
was the first time a baby of

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.200
this size had survived
in the orphanage.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.430
These are some snapshots
of our product being

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.970
used around the world.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.530
And what's been really, really
exciting is seeing the product

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:45.270
go from this to this, which is
now a standard of care in many

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.720
of these settings.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.360
So this is just the
start for us.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.890
Over the next five
years, we hope to

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.970
impact a million lives.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.280
And we continue to get requests
every day from people

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.180
all over the world asking when
can we buy this product?

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.030
I won't go into all of these,
but I'll read one in

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.490
particular that's always
touched my heart.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.710
It's a woman from Uganda who
says, the majority of

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.099
premature babies are never given
a chance to make it out

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.569
of the hospitals--

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.410
sorry, it's hard for
me to read this.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.859
Because there are no incubators,
they are left to

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.829
die without the comforting
touch of their mothers in

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.410
those final moments.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.660
And they're placed directly
in the trash can.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.540
So we get stories, requests,
like this every day that just

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.730
really breaks our hearts.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.610
And our goal is to scale this
globally as quickly as we

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.160
possibly can.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.380
So with that, I thought I'd end
with a video so you guys

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.105
can see the product in use.

00:17:54.577 --> 00:17:58.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Almost every
second of every day, a baby is

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.670
born premature or with
low birth weight.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.820
Where they're born makes all
the difference as to what

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.300
happens next.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.240
In the developed world, these
babies are placed in an

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.620
incubator until they're able
to make it on their own.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.510
But for babies born in parts of
the world without reliable

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.180
electricity or modern medical
equipment, desperate mothers

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.850
and fathers wrap their babies in
blankets, pack them in hot

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.610
water bottles, or place them
under bare light bulbs to keep

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.005
them from freezing to death.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.200
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.600
In 2008, graduate students at
Stanford University were

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.830
assigned the challenge of
designing a baby incubator for

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.700
the people who need
it the most.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.790
Compelled by the cause, these
students abandoned their

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.310
career paths, moved to India,
and dedicated themselves to

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.860
testing and developing
their design.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.090
After dozens of iterations and
years of testing, the Embrace

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.080
infant warmer is being
distributed to disadvantaged

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.160
communities and is
saving lives.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.830
Using an innovative phase change
material, a pouch is

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.670
heated with a short burst of
electricity or boiling water.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.920
Once activated, it maintains
a constant temperature

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.060
for up to six hours.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.860
One unit can save dozens of
lives, and it costs a fraction

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.380
of the price of an incubator.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.620
Kurthi's baby weighed less than
four pounds at birth and

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.590
was in danger of dying.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.850
An Embrace warmer kept her alive
and three months later,

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.190
the baby has doubled in weight
and is doing well.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.460
When baby Long was abandoned at
an orphanage in Beijing, he

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.550
weighed only two pounds
and was hypothermic.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.430
The orphanage had no incubator,
but they did have

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.870
an Embrace Nest.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.870
After 30 days in the Embrace
warmer, baby Long had

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.780
stabilized and put on weight.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.325
He is now a healthy and
happy seven month old.

00:20:15.325 --> 00:20:19.190
MALE SPEAKER: Yesterday we saw
that there was a 1.9 kilogram

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.472
baby who was wrapped very well
but still had a temperature of

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:27.525
34 degrees centigrade and that
baby was not suckling.

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:29.670
Two hours from the time of
putting it into the Embrace

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.475
Nest, the baby spontaneously
started to suck.

00:20:32.475 --> 00:20:36.272
The baby is doing well and the
rest of the babies from now on

00:20:36.272 --> 00:20:39.224
will be in good care.

00:20:39.224 --> 00:20:42.730
DR. KUMAR: The main advantage
of the warmer, the Embrace

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:48.260
warmer, is its portability, its
ease of use, and safety.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.000
There is no separation of
the mother and child.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.430
The mother can feed the baby and
the bonding is improved.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.700
DR. BENAKAPPA: We
had a 900 baby.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.620
We needed to put him
on radiant warmer.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.440
Not a single warmer
was available.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.970
Immediately, we thought of
Embrace and we put the baby

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.770
inside that.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.460
So as far as neonatal mortality
in terms of low

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.100
birth weight preterm babies,
term babies with very low body

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.260
weight-- all of them are
safe and sound and

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.560
comfortable in Embrace.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Embrace has
received international

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.357
recognition, and now has the
manufacturing infrastructure

00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:23.291
in place to rapidly scale
for global distribution.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.150
With your support, Embrace is
poised to help one million

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.030
babies in the next five years.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.280
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:49.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Embrace.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.085
Every child deserves
the opportunity to

00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:54.510
live, to grow, to dream.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.410
JANE CHEN: So that's Embrace
in a nutshell.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.480
And if there are any
questions, I'd be

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.331
happy to take them.

00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:09.880
AUDIENCE: I notice that there's
a liquid on top of the

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.730
phase change material.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.905
What's that for?

00:22:11.905 --> 00:22:13.790
JANE CHEN: So it serves
two purposes.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.040
One, it's a heat conductor, so
we make sure the heat is

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.240
evenly transferred throughout
the whole pouch.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.390
The second thing it does is it
acts as a cushion for the

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.560
baby, so even when the wax
hardens, the baby is lying on

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.925
a soft surface.

00:22:26.925 --> 00:22:29.070
AUDIENCE: So I was just kind of
curious on what some of the

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.390
factors are that are limiting
the expansion.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.830
I know you guys have a really
good reputation and your

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.200
product's effective, so
I was just kind of

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.910
curious what else.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.840
JANE CHEN: Sure.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.580
So I think there's a couple
different things

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.380
that go into that.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.850
One is certainly
distribution--

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.350
so, figuring out who are our
partners are going to be in

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.080
distribution.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.420
And distribution is not so
simple just leaving the

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.090
product there.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.750
Even though it's a simple
product, it does require

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.690
training, and training not only
of the doctors but of the

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.130
nurses, of everyone who
interacts with the product.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.610
Things like making sure the
product is cleaned thoroughly

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.590
between every baby, for
example, requires that

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.160
constant training.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.440
In addition to just distributing
the product, what

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.740
we're also doing is building
education around the product

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.400
because our interest is in
the outcome, not just the

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.610
technology.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.230
And so if our interest is really
in infant mortality,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.760
then the product gives us an
entry point into these

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.320
communities.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.970
And once we're there, we want to
educate around things like

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.920
hygiene, nutrition,
breastfeeding-- all the other

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.670
really important factors that go
into saving a baby's life.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.250
AUDIENCE: So maybe this
extends into the

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.180
distribution question.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.700
So all the pictures I saw
was mostly of hospitals.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.445
JANE CHEN: I'm sorry?

00:23:36.445 --> 00:23:37.780
AUDIENCE: Of hospitals.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.430
So I am thinking that it is used
by hospitals right now.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.150
How are you going to go it at
home, because that you're not

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.115
going to anticipate a premature
babies, so you're

00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:47.050
not going to buy
it in advance.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.380
So how is that going
to happen?

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.360
JANE CHEN: That's a
great question.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.390
So we actually have two versions
of the product.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.800
One is called the Embrace
Nest, which is used in a

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.010
clinical setting, and the second
is called the Embrace

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.680
Care, and that one is used
in a home setting.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.470
And the difference is one uses
intermittent access to

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.190
electricity, and the second
one uses just

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.810
entirely hot water.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.920
So the way we plan to get these
into the homes-- we've

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.860
started with the clinical
product with the reason of

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.120
wanting to get the buy in of the
medical community before

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.390
we go into a village setting.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.690
But what happens is, in India,
for example, the government is

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.320
actually paying women to give
birth in institutions to bring

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.330
down the rate of infant
mortality.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.690
However, even if the woman
gives birth in the

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.980
institution, she doesn't have
money to keep her baby there

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.640
over a few days So doctors are
discharging these babies at

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.170
one kilo sometimes, at 2
and 1/2 pounds or even

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.450
smaller than that.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.290
And so they have requested
a product that they can

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.630
essentially prescribe to
patients and these patients

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.980
can take it home with them.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.070
So that's how we'll start
getting into the home setting,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.350
and we've just began
that initiative.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.830
Over time, what we hope to do
is sell the product directly

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.870
to midwives and to community
health care workers.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.690
So if each community health care
worker has one of these

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.560
in their kit, then they can
take it from home to home,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.480
take it to one family.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.200
After that family's done with
it, which usually is a month

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.030
at most, then the community
health care worker can

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.630
sterilize, sanitize it, and can
take it to the next baby.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.730
AUDIENCE: So socially minded,
how do you think about

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.320
intellectual property?

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.750
Because on the one hand, you'd
like a big juggernaut like

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.780
Siemens or GE to copy what you
have and get product out to

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.010
babies and help them.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.130
On the other hand, you want to
make sure that they don't do

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.390
bad quality jobs of it and that
you're able to innovate

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.190
such things.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.690
There's a lot of issues like
that in the drug industry.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.730
I'm curious how you
think about that.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.010
JANE CHEN: That's a
great question.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.370
So we think about
it in two ways.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.070
Yes, if other people copied this
product, perhaps we could

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.710
have larger scale in terms
of distribution.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.810
But you're spot on.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:53.060
What we're worried about is if
it's a local copycat, it's

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.460
very likely that it will be
a low quality product.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.030
We actually take a lot of care
to do the manufacturing in a

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.230
very rigorous and safe way,
as I said, that meets

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.200
international standards.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.060
A lot of testing goes into
each and every product.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.240
Rigorous clinical tests have
been done as well, so we want

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.730
to make sure the second rate
product is not introduced into

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.800
these communities.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.600
Because if it is and if it
starts hurting babies, that

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.740
will just kill this entire
category of devices.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.270
I think the other aspect of this
is also we rely on people

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.960
like GE or distribution partners
to get this to the

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.850
people, to the end customer.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.590
And if you're working with
for-profit companies who are

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.720
making that initial investment
and marketing the device, they

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.700
expect a return on it.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.700
And so they're going to want
us to be protected

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.020
intellectually.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.280
So you have to think about this
across the entire value

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.410
chain and how it gets to
your end customers.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.710
AUDIENCE: Point-- what is your
guys' corporate structure?

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.850
Are you for profit, nonprofit,
because you talk about social

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:52.550
enterprise.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.520
What is your---?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.450
JANE CHEN: So we actually have
a unique corporate structure

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.800
that's a mix of both a for
profit and a nonprofit.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.700
We started in 2008 as a
nonprofit as a 501(c)(3) and

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.870
quickly came to realize
that to do things like

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.520
manufacturing and distribution,
even our

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.410
clinical studies, we require
capital to do that.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.600
And you could raise it the way
we were in $5,000, $10,000

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.040
increments, but it was a very,
very difficult to do that and

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.300
focus on the operations.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.170
And so what we ended up doing
was spinning out a for profit

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:29.280
arm of the company that allowed
us to raise capital in

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.210
larger increments.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.220
And the way it works is the
nonprofit holds the

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.350
intellectual property, it takes
donations to give away

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.970
the units to the poorest
communities and provide all of

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.770
these educational services
around it.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.100
The for profit then licenses the
technology, manufactures,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.550
sells it to the clinics that can
afford to pay for it-- so

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.700
these are still bottom of the
pyramid clinics, but they have

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.440
a revenue stream.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.850
They can pay for the product--

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.450
and then does future
research and

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.900
development for new products.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.970
And so the idea is that by
leveraging private and

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.290
philanthropic capital,
we can cover all

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.390
segments of the market.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.710
AUDIENCE: One thing I'm always
curious about in

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.100
entrepreneurship and technology

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.890
innovation, why now?

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.400
Like, why is this
happening now?

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.245
Why hasn't this been
done before?

00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:15.910
And I don't mean it in a bad
way, but very much like what

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.870
happened at that sparked this
and why is it successful now?

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.200
Why hasn't it been
done before?

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.090
JANE CHEN: Yeah.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.450
You know, I am not entirely
sure about that.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.390
But I love getting that
question, because I think it

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.090
means you're under a good design
when someone looks at

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.990
something and says,
this is so simple.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.470
How come no one's done
this before?

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:34.430
Yeah, it's a really
good question.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.670
Part of it, I think, definitely
is about timing,

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:37.770
and that if you think
about this

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.700
issue of infant mortality.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.250
It's getting more attention
internationally in the global

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.500
public health community
than ever before.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.280
It's the Millennium Development
goal that we're

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.700
the furthest away
from reaching.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.820
I'll give you some stats here.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.900
So of all deaths of children
under five years old, 40% of

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.430
them happen in the first 28
days of a child's life.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.640
Now beyond 28 days, vast
improvements have been made

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.890
because of vaccines.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.490
That's brought down the death
rate significantly.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.270
But there have been very few, if
any, interventions in that

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.170
first 28 days, and that's really
what Embrace is trying

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.405
to address here.

00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:14.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.490
Thanks for giving the speech.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:18.050
It's really interesting to
learn about your product.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.550
I actually used work and
development before.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.070
So one of the questions I had
for you was how do you get buy

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.400
in, and by buy in, I mean
cultural buy in, because a lot

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.350
of countries are not open to
having products coming from a

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.560
foreign country?

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.990
And then also how you get
monetary buy in, because a lot

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.600
of developing countries like
to get things for free?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.530
JANE CHEN: So in terms of buy
in, one of the things I really

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.930
stressed here was our efforts in
making the product locally

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:46.960
appropriate.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.210
So right after Stanford,
the entire founding

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.680
team moved to India.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.690
All of our operations are based
in India, all of our

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.930
manufacturing is done in India,
and so I think we're

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.450
perceived more as an Indian
company, or at the very least

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.620
a hybrid, than an American
company trying to bring in

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.660
Western technology into the
market, which is what many of

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.590
these incubators are.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.490
And so I think from that
perspective, buy in has not

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.070
been so difficult.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.910
I think, however, this is a new
concept and a lot of what

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.160
we're doing now is around
thinking through how do we

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.880
effect behavior change?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.580
Just because something is needed
as demonstrated by the

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.200
number doesn't mean demand
is necessarily there.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.970
And that requires a lot of
education, awareness raising,

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.440
marketing, so that's the
part of the process

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.500
Embrace is at now.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.120
In terms of monetary buy in,
we really believe in market

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.720
mechanisms where they work.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.470
And so in the areas that we
operate, we work with a lot of

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:43.260
private clinics.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.470
And in countries like India,
you see a rise of private

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.450
health even in rural settings.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.490
And there, we are very much
selling the product, selling

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.580
it at margin.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.740
That's really important for
the organization in our

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.390
efforts to become sustainable.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.380
To the segments of the
population that we reach

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.280
through our NGO partners, the
ones we know cannot be served

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.820
by the market, there we do
give away the product.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.110
But because we accompany it
with so much training and

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.440
programs, we ensure that it's
being used-- again, that it's

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.060
not just being dumped
at the clinic.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.230
Thanks for coming out.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.810
So I imagine that success
rate is not 100%.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.740
You can correct me if
I'm wrong on that.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.050
Have you found instances where
there have been times where

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.170
these children just aren't able
to be saved, and what is

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.960
the effect about the perception
of the product when

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.455
that happens, and how do
you counteract that?

00:31:37.455 --> 00:31:40.450
JANE CHEN: That's a
great question.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.840
Fortunately, we have not seen
that as of yet, or if it's

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.970
happened, we haven't
been notified.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.670
We don't follow every case
of usage of the product.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.960
But the fact is, these are
sick babies, these are

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.900
vulnerable babies, and there
will be babies who die in this

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.950
product because our product
is not a cure all.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.730
It solves some of the problem in
terms of keeping the babies

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.640
warm, but oftentimes these
babies need to be

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.750
resuscitated, they need oxygen,
they need further care

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.110
beyond just the product.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.650
And so I think that's why the
clinical studies for us have

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.130
been so critical, to show the
efficacy of the product, to

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.730
show the safety, why we follow
very strict processes in our

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.480
design and our manufacturing,
so if and when that does

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.160
happen, we can go back and
say, here are all the

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.400
safeguards that we've
put in place.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.180
And none of this, by the way,
is required by the Indian

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.090
government.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.540
Our product doesn't fall under
any regulatory standards.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.930
We've just done this to really
go above and beyond for this

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.141
exact reason.

00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:44.780
AUDIENCE: I noticed in the
beginning your mission

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.780
statement is to bring low cost,

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.630
affordable medical devices.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.500
So beyond the incubator, what
are the other products that

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.760
you're thinking about
or working on or

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.710
are currently testing?

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.000
JANE CHEN: So we're really
focused on the maternal child

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.990
health care space.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.470
As I said, we've just launched
a second version of the

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.050
product that you see today.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.330
So we want to make sure we get
these products right first.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.600
But the way we're thinking about
it is working within the

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.160
same space and leveraging those
distribution channels to

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.410
bring other technologies
to market.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:17.930
So a lot of early stage idea.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.920
Nothing I can talk about quite
yet, but it's something we

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.270
certainly intend to do.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.420
AUDIENCE: I heard you speak at
SOCAP yesterday as well.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.780
And I think one of the themes
that I saw at SOCAP-- social

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.730
capital conference that was
interesting, which I'm curious

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.450
about your thoughts.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.660
Once you've proven the efficacy
of a product, it's

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.530
almost better for the world
as fast as you can scale.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.330
And in that sense, is there any
thoughts on whether you

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.820
want to license it out and start
sort of having contract

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.290
manufacturing for helping it
scale and get delivery at a

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.670
scale that's beyond your
manufacturing capabilities at

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.160
some point?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.780
And how do you make
that decision?

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.720
JANE CHEN: I think we're
certainly open to that.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.710
It's kind of step
by step process.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.780
I think when you launch
something like this that is an

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.850
entirely new concept, you do
have to micromanage the

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.800
process initially to understand
a number of things.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.000
How is it being used?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.110
How do we continue iterating the
product to make sure it's

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.170
appropriate each of these
different settings?

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.429
Even things like how do we sell
the product, how do we

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.570
position it, how do
we price it--

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.889
I don't think anyone will do
as good of a job as the

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.250
organization that
founded this.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.010
So I think once we have figured
that out then the next

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:26.429
step is to work with local
distributors, and then beyond

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.770
that-- yeah, licensing is
definitely a possibility.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.440
AUDIENCE: What is Embrace's
greatest need right now?

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.610
JANE CHEN: What is our
greatest need?

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:36.170
A number of different needs.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.620
So definitely, great partners.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.780
That's really how we're
going to scale.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.320
We don't have the capacity
to go into each of these

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.320
countries and so we rely on NGO
partners that have really

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.610
strong infrastructure in place
so they can help with that

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.139
scaling process.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.690
Connections to--

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.960
again, to NGOs, to governments,
to people in the

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.040
public health community who
can help to scale this.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.000
We're always looking for
more human resources.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.870
So, I don't know where
Will went.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.400
One of our interns
works here now.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.220
We have a really fun internship
program that we

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.270
have every year.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.830
And then, of course, funding--
so funding on our nonprofit

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.590
side to continue scaling these
programs and to get more

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.990
products out there.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.850
AUDIENCE: I saw that when you
guys started, you had a really

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:18.870
small team.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.510
And I was curious to know what
kind of background you came

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:25.220
from, whether it was engineering
or business or

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.590
design, something like that?

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.640
JANE CHEN: I personally did
my MBA and a public policy

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.160
degree, and I had experience
before that in consulting and

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.080
then with non-profits.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.600
There was a mix of nonprofit
and private sector.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.250
But I think I've come to realize
is you don't need to

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.250
be a designer to
do design work.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.150
Anyone can be a designer.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.630
And this design process I showed
is just an organized

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.520
process for creativity.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.490
And so our product is
a mix of engineers--

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:59.850
or our team is a mix of
engineers, of clinical folks,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.030
operational folks.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.710
It's just a really fun
multidisciplinary team that's

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.650
been able to bring
this to market.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.530
AUDIENCE: Maybe I missed this
because I came a little bit

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.110
later, but what are some of
your success metrics like

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.510
number of children saved?

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.180
As in like growth, how many
units are being purchased?

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.180
JANE CHEN: Right now, it's all
about the number of units

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.740
being purchased or distributed,
as well as the

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.670
number of babies who've
used those.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.580
So each product can be used
by multiple babies.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.510
That's the metric that
we're looking at.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.490
We're also trying to establish
the metrics to look at within

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.900
our educational programs-- for
example, how many people are

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.630
touched by those.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.520
And over time, through more
studies, how has the incidence

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.510
of hypothermia been reduced
among this population?

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.910
And when we have enough numbers,
then looking at

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.490
things like mortality and
morbidity, how we've been able

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.693
to impact those.

00:36:49.693 --> 00:36:53.560
AUDIENCE: Going across the
design thinking philosophy--

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.190
how long did it take?

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.750
If you look at step one to the
final step, how long did you

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.000
spend in kind of each of those
phases and which one did you

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.580
spend the most time in?

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.430
JANE CHEN: Let's see.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.970
It's probably taken
five years.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.520
So it's a process
that never ends.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.640
It's iterative, so we continue
to iterate on the product all

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.070
the time as we find new
things on the market.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.370
I think that's a really
important aspect of design

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.290
thinking is this innovation
never ends.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.600
You can always make the product
better, and we're were

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.460
always listening for
customer feedback.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.390
And being in the field, so
we're able to do that.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.840
I think, though, as I said the
most important part of that

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.020
process is really that
point of view.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.760
So who's your user and
what's the need?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.380
It sounds simple.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.580
But by shifting the focus, in
this case, away from the

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.550
doctors and the medical
practitioners to a simple

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.710
enough product that could
eventually be used in the home

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.590
setting, that really guided the
entire direction of the

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.415
product and the organization.

00:37:51.415 --> 00:37:54.910
AUDIENCE: You're in a really
interesting space, because

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.070
it's non-profit and for profit
at the same time.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.040
And I was curious to know what
are some of the challenges you

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.675
think are unique to that space,
or something that

00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:07.320
you've overcome or
struggled with?

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.410
JANE CHEN: You mean in terms of
being a hybrid structure or

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.070
in doing both?

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.170
Sorry, we just had a long
meeting about this yesterday.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.660
My colleague Pria is sitting in
the audience, so she's on

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.470
the nonprofit side of the
organization and I'm on the

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.040
for profit side.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.980
I think that's what's really
important, I mean, in terms of

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.490
legal structure and
contracts--

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.690
that can be figured out-- but
making sure the teams are in

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.580
constant communication, that
there's alignment, and that

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.460
they continue to be aligned over
time is really critical.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.020
And it's actually difficult in
the sense that we have one

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.120
organization, part of the
organization, that's sitting

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.350
in the US, and another part
of the organization that's

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.700
sitting in India.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.190
And so you have to be really
proactively communicating all

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.920
at the same time to make sure
the left arm and the right arm

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.410
knows what the other
side is doing.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.740
And the whole idea behind this
is two entities together will

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.860
be much stronger than either
of them individually.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.330
But to make that work well,
it's all about execution,

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.095
ultimately, in communication.

00:39:08.095 --> 00:39:10.150
AUDIENCE: This is sort of more
generally about when you're

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.260
building up the company
and when you

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.470
decided to be a nonprofit.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.780
When you're fund raising in the
start and trying to get

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.240
sort of bootstrapped and move
up to, like, raising funds,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.780
what were your challenges and
how did you learn and adapt to

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.256
what you needed to do?

00:39:22.256 --> 00:39:24.950
JANE CHEN: I think initially
it's always difficult as a

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.360
startup to prove your
credibility.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.600
I think because we're a products
company raising money

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.630
for product development it's
actually very difficult.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.720
I think it's easier once you
have a program out there, you

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.015
can show impact.

00:39:38.015 --> 00:39:39.820
But if you're raising money
for years of product

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.380
development in a nonprofit
model, it's a little unusual

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.180
and can be quite difficult.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.010
But I would say persistence is
the way you overcome it.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:55.030
So I always say in my books no
means maybe and maybe means

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:59.490
yes, so never take
no for an answer.

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.110
And over time, once you start
building a core group of

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:07.220
funders, they start spreading
the word about your work.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.290
And so I think that those
relationships become

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.480
absolutely critical in
the early days of

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.260
doing that fund raising.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.180
AUDIENCE: This is a question
for the observation phase.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.850
So I'm assuming that once you
went to the community, that's

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.250
probably where you found the
most information about the

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.662
context and environment
of people.

00:40:24.662 --> 00:40:28.450
I just want to know what
techniques or tools did you

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.830
guys use in order to bring--

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:35.010
to reveal the most interesting
discoveries and which helped

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.070
influence the design
of the product?

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.690
And from a cultural perspective,
were people

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:43.206
comfortable with you applying
those techniques to ask them

00:40:43.206 --> 00:40:46.660
about personal experiences or
how they live in their homes?

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.050
Was there that pushback from the
culture, because if you're

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.130
not from that culture,
maybe it's a

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.620
stranger, they look different?

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.300
So was it a kind of
cultural pushback?

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.240
JANE CHEN: So a lot of it ranged
from just observation,

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.510
sitting there observing, that's
it-- just being a

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.120
silent observer and watching how
these people interacted,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.640
not just with regards to babies,
but in their day to

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.510
day lives to understand
the overall context.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.160
We also did a lot of focus
groups and we did individual

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.890
interviews, as well as
with groups of women.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.710
We even had sessions where we
asked them to co-create with

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.860
us, so we gave them materials
and asked them to design or

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.160
sketch and help us understand
how they were

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.270
thinking about things.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.430
So there are a number
of tools.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.470
The cultural sensitivity is--
there definitely are.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.130
We had to have translators go
with us into the field.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.840
And when we brought people
who were local, we'd get

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.470
information that was
much richer.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:48.300
The other thing we realized was
the gender disparity or

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.580
the discomfort in talking about
some of these issues are

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.720
really sensitive with
men versus women.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.390
And so initially, I had
translators that were men, and

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.730
then I bought ones
that were women.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.460
You'd see this huge difference
in how open the women were

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.820
willing to be.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.680
I also I think that trust just
takes time to build.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.710
And so the communities where
we've gone back over and over,

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.830
they've began to trust
us as a partner.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.090
Those are definitely areas
where we get the richest

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.420
information.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.820
And that just takes
time to build.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.430
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned that
there were no safety or

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.650
regulatory burdens to
overcome in India.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.540
Is that universally true or are
there are places where the

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.390
regulatory landscape is
more of a burden?

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.190
JANE CHEN: They are.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:33.020
So India right now is the
process of, I think, figuring

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.520
out and articulating what that
regulatory landscape is.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.610
So there is a drug controller,
for example.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.120
There are certain medical
devices are regulated under

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.320
that, but ours doesn't fall
under any category.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.210
But I think that's going
to quickly change over

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.570
the next few years.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.420
AUDIENCE: There's many needs
within the world.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.190
How did you decide that
this was the one

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.040
you wanted to pursue.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.250
And then what was a turning
point for your whole team to

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.810
say, this is going to
happen, we're all

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.885
going to move to India?

00:43:01.885 --> 00:43:05.080
JANE CHEN: So this one-- you may
have missed the beginning

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.540
of the presentation.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.020
It came about through a class
project, actually.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.340
So it was a challenge that was
posed to a few of us taking

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.910
this class together, and that's
how everything started.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.590
But in terms of how we decided
to move forward with it, I

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.410
think the end of the class
came and we thought if we

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.620
don't take this forward, no
one else is going to.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.300
We're sitting on a
great idea here.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.200
We really wanted to see
it through to the end.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.190
So we started applying for
different grants and there's

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.040
one in particular that
required a two year

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040
commitment.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.950
And so once we got that, we knew
we were locked in for a

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:42.670
couple of years.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:46.350
And slowly one by one, everyone
either quit their

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.305
jobs or graduated.

00:43:47.305 --> 00:43:51.570
And as a team together, we
decided to do this full time

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.480
and move to India, and have
grown since then from four

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.030
people to 60 people.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.740
So it's been really fun to see
the growth of the company and

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.870
building the organization
has been one of the most

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.960
interesting things for me.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.020
Cool.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.420
Well, thank you guys so much.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.260
If you guys want to stay updated
on Embrace, we have a

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.230
sign up sheet here.

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:14.260
We would love to keep you
posted on our progress.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.240
We also have an event
coming up on

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.310
November 19th at Stanford.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.010
So again, if you sign up for the
newsletter, we'll give you

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.500
more information on that.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.370
It's going to be at the
design school there.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.280
We're going to be doing some
really fun activities around

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.840
the design thinking process that
I introduced here today.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.130
So thank you again for being
here, and we hope that you'll

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.380
get involved in some way.
