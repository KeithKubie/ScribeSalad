scientific mysteries are first of all
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.350
scientific mysteries are first of all
the origin of the universe itself and

have intelligence and yet our brain only

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
have intelligence and yet our brain only
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790

consumes about 20-30 watts of power and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
consumes about 20-30 watts of power and
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.850
consumes about 20-30 watts of power and
yet it performs calculations better than

yet it performs calculations better than
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.549
yet it performs calculations better than
any large supercomputer so it's a

any large supercomputer so it's a
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.880
any large supercomputer so it's a
mystery how is the brain wired up and if

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
mystery how is the brain wired up and if
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160

we can figure that out what can we do it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
we can figure that out what can we do it
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.700
we can figure that out what can we do it
to enhance our mental capabilities when

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
to enhance our mental capabilities when
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.290
to enhance our mental capabilities when
you look at the brain and all the parts

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
you look at the brain and all the parts
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700
you look at the brain and all the parts
of the brain they don't seem to make any

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
of the brain they don't seem to make any
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.250

evolution well one way to look at it is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
evolution well one way to look at it is
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250

I was a child I would go to the Science

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
I was a child I would go to the Science
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520
I was a child I would go to the Science
Museum and look at the snakes sometimes

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
Museum and look at the snakes sometimes
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.710
Museum and look at the snakes sometimes
and they would stare back at me and I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
and they would stare back at me and I
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810
and they would stare back at me and I
would wonder what are they thinking

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
would wonder what are they thinking
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.319
would wonder what are they thinking
about well I think now I know what

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
about well I think now I know what
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090
about well I think now I know what
they're thinking about was is this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
they're thinking about was is this
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.120
they're thinking about was is this
person lunch then we have the center

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
person lunch then we have the center
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890
person lunch then we have the center
part of the brain going forward and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
part of the brain going forward and
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050
part of the brain going forward and
that's a so-called monkey brain the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
that's a so-called monkey brain the
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.899
that's a so-called monkey brain the

mammalian brain the brain of emotions
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.780
mammalian brain the brain of emotions
the brain of social hierarchies then

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
the brain of social hierarchies then
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.179
the brain of social hierarchies then
finally the front of the brain is the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
finally the front of the brain is the
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460

cortex this is where rational thinking

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
cortex this is where rational thinking
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.530
cortex this is where rational thinking
is and when you ask yourself a question

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
is and when you ask yourself a question
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.330
is and when you ask yourself a question
where am i anyway the answer is right

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

behind your forehead that's where you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
behind your forehead that's where you
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.609

really are well I have a theory of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
really are well I have a theory of
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.040
really are well I have a theory of
consciousness which tries to wrap it all

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
consciousness which tries to wrap it all
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.220

up together there have been about 20,000

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
up together there have been about 20,000
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.430
up together there have been about 20,000
or

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
or
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140
or
so papers written about consciousness

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
so papers written about consciousness
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.680
so papers written about consciousness
and no consensus never in the history of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
and no consensus never in the history of
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.860
and no consensus never in the history of
science have so many people devoted so

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
science have so many people devoted so
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.400
science have so many people devoted so
much time to produce so little well I'm

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
much time to produce so little well I'm
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.130
much time to produce so little well I'm
a physicist and when we physicists look

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
a physicist and when we physicists look
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.130
a physicist and when we physicists look
at a mysterious object the first thing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
at a mysterious object the first thing
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990
at a mysterious object the first thing
we try to do is to create a model a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
we try to do is to create a model a
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.290
we try to do is to create a model a
model of this object in space and then

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
model of this object in space and then
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.570
model of this object in space and then
we hit the play button and run it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
we hit the play button and run it
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.720
we hit the play button and run it
forward in time this is how Newton was

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
forward in time this is how Newton was
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.640
forward in time this is how Newton was
able to come up with a theory of gravity

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650
able to come up with a theory of gravity
 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.650
able to come up with a theory of gravity
this is how Einstein came up with

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
this is how Einstein came up with
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.260
this is how Einstein came up with
relativity so I tried to use this in

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270
relativity so I tried to use this in
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.080
relativity so I tried to use this in
terms of the human brain and evolution

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
terms of the human brain and evolution
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.120
terms of the human brain and evolution
so what I'm saying is I have a new

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130
so what I'm saying is I have a new
 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.100
so what I'm saying is I have a new
theory of consciousness based on

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
theory of consciousness based on
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.170
theory of consciousness based on
evolution and that is consciousness is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
evolution and that is consciousness is
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.020
evolution and that is consciousness is
the number of feedback loops required to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
the number of feedback loops required to
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.280
the number of feedback loops required to
create a model of your position in space

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
create a model of your position in space
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.440
create a model of your position in space
with relationship to other organisms and

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
with relationship to other organisms and
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.100
with relationship to other organisms and
finally in relationship to time so think

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110
finally in relationship to time so think
 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740
finally in relationship to time so think
of the consciousness of a thermostat I

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
of the consciousness of a thermostat I
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.500
of the consciousness of a thermostat I
believe that even a lowly thermostat has

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
believe that even a lowly thermostat has
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.010
believe that even a lowly thermostat has
one unit of consciousness that is it

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020
one unit of consciousness that is it
 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.590
one unit of consciousness that is it
senses the temperature around it and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
senses the temperature around it and
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.110
senses the temperature around it and
then we have a flower a flower has maybe

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
then we have a flower a flower has maybe
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.260
then we have a flower a flower has maybe
maybe 10 units of consciousness it has

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270
maybe 10 units of consciousness it has
 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.020
maybe 10 units of consciousness it has
to understand the temperature the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
to understand the temperature the
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.630
to understand the temperature the
weather humidity where gravity is

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
weather humidity where gravity is
 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.970
weather humidity where gravity is
pointing and then finally we go to the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
pointing and then finally we go to the
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.490
pointing and then finally we go to the
reptilian brain which I call level 1

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
reptilian brain which I call level 1
 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.310
reptilian brain which I call level 1
consciousness and reptiles basically

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
consciousness and reptiles basically
 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.810
consciousness and reptiles basically
have a very good understanding of their

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
have a very good understanding of their
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.970
have a very good understanding of their
position in space especially because

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980
position in space especially because
 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.130
position in space especially because
they have to lunge out and grab prey

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
they have to lunge out and grab prey
 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.740
they have to lunge out and grab prey
then we have level 2 consciousness the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
then we have level 2 consciousness the
 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.630
then we have level 2 consciousness the
monkey consciousness the consciousness

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640
monkey consciousness the consciousness
 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.930
monkey consciousness the consciousness
of emotions social hierarchies where are

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
of emotions social hierarchies where are
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.229
of emotions social hierarchies where are
we in relationship to the tribe and then

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
we in relationship to the tribe and then
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.770
we in relationship to the tribe and then
where are we as humans as humans we are

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.699
where are we as humans as humans we are
at level 3 we run simulations into the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
at level 3 we run simulations into the
 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.910
at level 3 we run simulations into the
future animals apparently don't do this

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
future animals apparently don't do this
 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.090
future animals apparently don't do this
they don't plan to hibernate they don't

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
they don't plan to hibernate they don't
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.810
they don't plan to hibernate they don't
plan the next day's agenda they have no

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
plan the next day's agenda they have no
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.970
plan the next day's agenda they have no
conception of tomorrow to the best of

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980
conception of tomorrow to the best of
 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.219
conception of tomorrow to the best of
our ability but that's what our brain

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229
our ability but that's what our brain
 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.010
our ability but that's what our brain
does our brain is a prediction machine

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020
does our brain is a prediction machine
 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.260
does our brain is a prediction machine
and so when we look at the evolution

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
and so when we look at the evolution
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.939
and so when we look at the evolution
from the reptilian brain to the

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949
from the reptilian brain to the
 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.760
from the reptilian brain to the
mammalian brain to the prefrontal cortex

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770
mammalian brain to the prefrontal cortex
 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.529
mammalian brain to the prefrontal cortex
we realized that is the process of

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539
we realized that is the process of
 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.350
we realized that is the process of
understanding our position in space with

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
understanding our position in space with
 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.689
understanding our position in space with
respect to others that is emotions and

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699
respect to others that is emotions and
 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.600
respect to others that is emotions and
finally running simulations into the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
finally running simulations into the
 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.090
finally running simulations into the
future
