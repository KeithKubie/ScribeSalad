VAN RIPER: Hi, I'm Van Riper.

00:00:01.796 --> 00:00:03.670
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: And
I'm Adriana Cerundolo,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.170
Community Manager
for the GDG Program.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.280
I want to first wish you a very
happy new year, and happy 2015.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.910
Really excited for this year.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.800
And I also hope you all had
a wonderful holiday season,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.624
for all of you who celebrated.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.540
VAN RIPER: And with a
new year sometimes comes

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.460
change, and we have
a change to announce.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.560
I'm going to be taking a new
position at Google, working

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.180
with communities
inside of Google

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.799
around mindfulness practices.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.840
It's actually a very
exciting opportunity for me,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.510
but it does mean
that going forward,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.750
you'll be coming solely to
Adriana about GDG support.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.370
And of course, with
Sarah, supporting her.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.367
I just want reaffirm to you
all that my leaving the program

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.700
does not indicate any less
support from Google for this.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.280
In fact, if anything,
support is greater

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.200
than it's ever been
inside of Google.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.734
I can tell you from my
early days here at Google,

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:01.400
there were times when there were
some questions about whether we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.270
should be investing
in this program.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.990
At this point, with
the impact this program

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.030
has had for us, that's
no longer question.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
It's more about, how does Google
invest in these communities,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.090
and how do we work best
with these communities?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.594
That's really what's going on.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:18.010
You see these new
things going on,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.890
like the study jam
program as we're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.940
exploring new ways to
work with the community

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.884
and scale our efforts,
and at the same time

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:29.800
provide opportunities
to you in the community.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.090
So I just want to underscore
that-- in fact, I probably

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.320
wouldn't be leaving if
I felt that there were

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.190
things that were not going well.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.330
The very fact that
I'm leaving is

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.990
made possible by the health
of the program within Google.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960
So I just wanted
to underscore that.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.550
I do want to say this-- it was
a very hard decision for me.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.170
This program has been
a labor of love for me.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.030
I know many of you I
consider close friends now,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.370
and I hope that we will
continue our friendship.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.120
This is not a goodbye.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.810
This is more of a
we-will-meet-again situation.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.950
And I know to the extent
that I can be involved,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.380
I would like to stay
involved on an, obviously,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.630
less formal basis.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.270
So you may not be rid
of me completely yet,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.080
but I have every
confidence in Adriana

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.779
in taking this program forward.

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.195
I think I'd like
to take this time

00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:42.255
to actually use this
as a teachable moment,

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:43.880
because one of the
things I feel really

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.530
good about in the situation is
the way that Adriana and I have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.700
worked together and really
shared responsibility

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.880
for this program over
the last two years

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.410
so that she knows this
program inside and out.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.090
And I know that she's as
passionate about this community

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.790
as I am and that
she's going to be

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.460
a great advocate for you guys.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.960
Sorry.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.310
These are actually
tears of gratitude,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.380
because I'm so grateful
for the opportunity

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.050
to work with all of you.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.560
When I took this job, I said
that it was just amazing.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.180
I never thought that
I would get paid

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.250
to do something that
I love like this

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.390
and to work with so
many incredible people.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.101
It's been a real gift,
these last four years.

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:50.600
Actually, the whole
seven years I've

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.180
been involved with
it, but particularly

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.596
these last four years, where
I could spend all my energies

00:03:54.596 --> 00:03:55.097
on this.

00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:57.262
But if there's something I
wanted to teach you all--

00:03:57.262 --> 00:03:58.980
and people ask me
about this, about how

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.441
do I get to work at
Google-- and I said,

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.940
don't worry about
working at Google.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.700
Find what you're passionate
about and do that.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.660
And if that lead you to
Google, that's a plus.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.300
But if it doesn't
lead you to Google,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.390
you're still doing
what you love.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.390
And I was just fortunate
enough that what I love

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.360
brought me here.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.040
And at this point in
my life, a new passion

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.829
has really come up for me
around mindfulness practices,

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.370
and there was this
unique opportunity

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.880
to do that at Google and
leverage my community

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.430
experience.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.960
So it was just, again, another
opportunity I couldn't pass up.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.030
Otherwise, they would have to
drag me kicking and screaming

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.450
from this job.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.370
So the thing I
wanted to say there

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.890
is that what made this
really easier for me--

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.820
it's still hard-- was
knowing that Adriana

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.630
was ready to step
in and be solely

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.160
in charge of this program
and take it forward.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.400
And I want to strongly
encourage you, number one,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.440
to follow your passions.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.398
And if they lead you away
from GDG communities,

00:04:56.398 --> 00:04:58.030
so be it, because
it's more important

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.390
that we have passionate
people in the communities.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.642
And I know those of you
that are in there now

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:04.475
are passionate about
this but, your passions

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:08.520
will change just like mine have,
and you need to follow those.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.340
But in order to be
able to do that and not

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.680
leave your communities
stranded, you

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.290
need to be building a
community of leadership.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.630
You guys need to become
meta-community managers, just

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.590
like Adriana and I are
meta-community managers.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.460
You need to be
coaching and building

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.780
other community leaders
in your communities

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.510
so that when the time comes
for you to go on to new things,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.392
you can do that knowing that
your community will be fine.

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:34.600
In fact, I wouldn't be here--
I want to actually take

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.687
this point to thank
Kevin Nielson,

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:39.770
because if he hadn't stepped
up when I needed help

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.155
with the Java user
groups in 2006--

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:43.530
I was starting to
get burned out.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.613
I would have probably
stopped doing community work

00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:49.314
altogether, but because Kevin
came on board, I got energized.

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:50.730
Not only did I do
the Java work, I

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.438
started doing the
Google Technology Group

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:53.640
work with Kevin's help.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.320
That led to this job.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.920
Similarly-- I don't share
this publicly, but I am now.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.626
In 2000, after I started
this job, it was my dream job

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:05.000
but it was a very
challenging job

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.735
and I was feeling really
burned out by it about a year

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:08.360
or two into it.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.734
And that's when
we hired Adriana.

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:13.272
And I was seriously thinking
about leaving the job.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.730
Not because I didn't love the
work, but it was just killing

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.400
me physically,
emotionally, doing the job.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.294
And it was with her support
that I was able to then, again,

00:06:22.294 --> 00:06:22.960
get reenergized.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.600
You need to find good people.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.240
I've been fortunate in finding
those good people in my life

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.180
to work with that support
me in following my dreams,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.220
even if it takes
me away from them.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.000
So I want to encourage you all
to do that in your lives, too.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.890
And I guess with that, I'll just
turn it back over to Adriana.

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.300
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
Van, first off I just

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.650
want to thank you for
all the amazing work

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.170
that you've done
with the community.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.210
Obviously without you, this
global program wouldn't exist.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.770
Van, as you all know-- or
maybe those of you that are new

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.580
don't-- he was a pioneer
for the GDG program.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.720
Before that, it was really
just an idea in a few cities.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.350
And because of his
passion around this work,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.010
Google basically poached him to
create this global community.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.400
And it basically went
from two groups to now

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.000
we have over 550 globally.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.240
It's really amazing.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.030
Van-- I think he
already knows this,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.700
but it's just so
you all know-- he's

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.280
seen as a leader and
thought-leader in the community

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.730
space as a Community
Manager here within Google.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.580
People come to him asking
for expertise and support

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.310
on programs that
they're running.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.930
It's really amazing to see.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.400
And selfishly, I'm glad that
he's staying within Google

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.650
to do community work, because
I personally as a Googler

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.030
am going to reap the benefits
of the awesome community

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.430
that he's now going to be
creating around mindfulness.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.940
At the same time, I'm obviously
really going to miss you, Van.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.110
It's been an amazing two
years working with you.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.950
Not only on a
professional level.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.950
Also on a friend level.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.570
Obviously that's not
going to go away,

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.600
and I'm so glad your
staying within Google.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.880
But I also want to
take this moment

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.550
to thank you for all the
mentorship that you gave to me.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.840
I did have community
manager experience when

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.990
I came into this role,
but it was really

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.610
through the tutelage,
I guess you can say,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.940
of Van over the last
two years working

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.210
with a really passionate
awesome community that's

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.980
organically growing
around the world

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.600
to understand what community
management is really all about.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.770
And without that, I would not
have the wealth of expertise

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.900
that I currently have.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.560
And that being said, going
forward I will certainly

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.150
still use Van as my consultant
as I have a hard decisions

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.065
to make, and working on this
program-- on this community--

00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:56.090
and continuing to grow it.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.810
And on that note, I want
to reassure everybody

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.220
that, as Van said,
nothing's changing here.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.120
I will be your main
Program Manager, or really,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.930
Community Manager at Google
for this global program.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.580
However, things will continue
to be carried out just

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.090
as they have been, because
whenever I have a decision

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.180
to make and I'm not sure
about how to go, I ask myself,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.190
what would Van do?

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.980
I actually had that
thought just yesterday.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.510
So thank you for all
your amazing work.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.910
And I know that you will be,
obviously, sorely missed.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.470
Not only by myself, but by the
awesome community out there.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.760
But I am also really excited
to be leading the program,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.920
to taking this forward, and
having an amazing 2015 year.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.840
We have a lot of great
things coming ahead,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.520
and I just urge you all to
keep doing what you're doing

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.720
and know that this program
is in a great position

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.420
and has more eyes
on it internally

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.940
from Google than ever before.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.620
It's the sole channel for
reaching developers globally,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.520
and so that's a really
powerful place to be

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.690
and it's very much valued.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.070
So I'm really looking forward
to all the opportunities

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.690
and resources that's going to
be coming through this year.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.790
You can stay tuned by
the end of this month

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.570
to get an update on what's
to come for this year

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.140
directly from me.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.630
And also, please continue to
be nice and work with Sara,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.750
as she's going to be my
co-pilot going forward.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.110
So thank you, Van.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.920
Thanks to everybody.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.730
And we will surely be in touch.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.990
If you have any questions
or concerns about this,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.880
please feel free
to reach out to me.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.460
You all still have Van's
email address, as well.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.250
I urge you to reach
out to him, as well.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.160
We're both here as
resources for you.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.180
VAN RIPER: Yes, I'm still
happy to hear from any of you.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.780
If it's a specific thing
about running the GDG

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.700
support from Google,
that needs to go

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.400
through Adriana going forward.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.960
But whenever you're
in Mountain View,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.750
I'd love to see you for lunch.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.026
Have a great 2015, everyone.

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:05.640
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Bye-bye.
