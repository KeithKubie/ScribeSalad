00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.972
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice that we have an equation, but we still have an unknown, this total

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:08.127
final volume. I'm going to use a bucket to try and help us figure it out. Let's

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.437
see if we can get an expression for this volume. We know, for our first volume,

00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:16.479
we had 5 gallons. So, I'm going to pour those 5 gallons into my bucket. For the

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:20.598
second volume, I don't know how much of it I used. We're going to pour an x

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:25.047
amount of that. So, we know our final volume is going to be 5 gallons plus x

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:30.115
gallons. This is the amount of gallons we wind up in the end, our volume 3. Now,

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:34.675
that we know that the total volume is 5 gallons plus x gallons, we have one

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:40.210
equation with one variable. Now, we're ready to solve. So, you solve this. How

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.728
much punch mix should we use that's 80% water to get our 75% water punch mix?

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:49.491
Write your answer here. And I've already included the unit of gallons, so don't

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:50.213
write that.
