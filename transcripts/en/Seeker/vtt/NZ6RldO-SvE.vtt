00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.839
We all know hand sanitizer is bad for you
- but a new study finds it can actually increase

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.939
the amount of BPA in your system!

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:14.080
Yet another reason to stop using it altogether!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.460
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and there’s
been a lot of talk over the past few years

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.019
about hand sanitizer, and why it can actually
dangerous for you.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.289
Dnews did an episode on it just last year.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.179
The basic idea is that triclosan, the active
ingredient in hand sanitizer, kills off all

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.609
of your good bacteria, making it easier for
antibiotic resistant strains to flourish.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.660
But that’s not the only reason it’s bad.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.070
A new study published this week in PLOS One,
finds that using hand sanitizer can also increase

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.109
your skin’s absorption of BPA.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.010
BPA stands for Bisphenol A, and it’s a chemical
used in the production of almost all hard

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
plastics, including containers used for most
foods and beverages.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.080
Essentially, it imitates our hormones, in
a way that disrupts our body’s natural endocrine

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080
system.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.489
Studies have linked high amounts of BPA to
hormone disorders, heart disease, cancer,

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.940
infertility, and even diabetes.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.920
In a nutshell, it’s bad.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.659
And according to this new study, hand sanitizer
makes it even worse.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.060
Most commonly used hand sanitizers contain
chemicals that enhance the penetration of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.140
lipophilic compounds into your skin.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.280
BPA is one of those compounds.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.750
So researchers from the University of Missouri
looked specifically at thermal receipt paper

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.130
- which contains very high quantities of BPA
- to see if hand sanitizer increased the absorption

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.210
of those chemicals.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.479
Turns out, it does.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.479
A lot.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.899
They found that using hand sanitizer before
touching receipt paper, increases the absorption

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.140
of BPA up to 100 fold.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.650
What’s more, is that all of that extra BPA
lingers on your hands, so if you were to eat

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.670
food directly afterwards, you’d be getting
a double dose of BPA absorption - first from

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.450
your hands, and then from your mouth.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.180
And those specific levels of BPA have been
proven to increase the risk of disease in

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.840
adults, and developmental abnormalities in
children.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.010
So what can we do about this?

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.500
Well, unfortunately, no safe alternatives
to BPA have been identified for use in thermal

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.590
paper - so until those technologies are developed,
the best thing you can do is just stop using

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.259
hand sanitizer unless you really, really need
it.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.950
And definitely don’t use it before ordering
take-out food.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.260
It’s just not worth it!

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.260
What do you guys think?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.560
Have you sworn off hand sanitizer altogether?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.849
Let us know how you feel in the comments below
- and as always, thank you guys for watching!
