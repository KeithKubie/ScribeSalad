00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
feels overwhelming and like what the
fuck<00:25:08.580><c> do</c><00:25:08.730><c> we</c><00:25:08.760><c> do</c><00:25:08.970><c> with</c><00:25:09.090><c> this</c><00:25:09.270><c> because</c><00:25:09.570><c> this</c>

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:09.690 align:start position:0%
fuck do we do with this because this
 

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.930 align:start position:0%
fuck do we do with this because this
wasn't<00:25:09.930><c> on</c><00:25:10.140><c> the</c><00:25:10.290><c> air</c><00:25:10.440><c> so</c><00:25:11.340><c> I</c><00:25:11.370><c> think</c><00:25:11.490><c> that's</c><00:25:11.790><c> when</c>

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't on the air so I think that's when
 

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.430 align:start position:0%
wasn't on the air so I think that's when
again<00:25:12.210><c> they</c><00:25:12.330><c> haven't</c><00:25:12.630><c> discussed</c><00:25:13.110><c> this</c><00:25:13.260><c> with</c>

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
again they haven't discussed this with
 

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
again they haven't discussed this with
me<00:25:13.590><c> I'm</c><00:25:13.950><c> purely</c><00:25:14.520><c> speculating</c><00:25:14.880><c> because</c><00:25:15.290><c> to</c>

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:16.290 align:start position:0%
me I'm purely speculating because to
 

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.630 align:start position:0%
me I'm purely speculating because to
them<00:25:16.440><c> if</c><00:25:16.590><c> it</c><00:25:16.650><c> was</c><00:25:16.800><c> on</c><00:25:16.920><c> the</c><00:25:16.950><c> air</c><00:25:17.220><c> I'm</c><00:25:17.340><c> guessing</c>

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
them if it was on the air I'm guessing
 

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.500 align:start position:0%
them if it was on the air I'm guessing
they<00:25:17.700><c> would</c><00:25:17.820><c> have</c><00:25:17.910><c> said</c><00:25:18.030><c> well</c><00:25:18.120><c> that's</c><00:25:18.330><c> what</c><00:25:18.450><c> he</c>

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:18.510 align:start position:0%
they would have said well that's what he
 

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
they would have said well that's what he
does<00:25:18.660><c> on</c><00:25:18.780><c> the</c><00:25:18.840><c> air</c><00:25:19.050><c> but</c><00:25:19.590><c> they're</c><00:25:19.740><c> not</c><00:25:19.890><c> looking</c>

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.010 align:start position:0%
does on the air but they're not looking
 

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.740 align:start position:0%
does on the air but they're not looking
at<00:25:20.250><c> it</c><00:25:20.370><c> like</c><00:25:20.460><c> well</c><00:25:20.640><c> he</c><00:25:20.820><c> was</c><00:25:20.940><c> reacting</c><00:25:21.120><c> to</c><00:25:21.450><c> being</c>

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
at it like well he was reacting to being

hit<00:25:21.990><c> I</c><00:25:22.170><c> think</c><00:25:22.410><c> they</c><00:25:22.710><c> just</c><00:25:22.740><c> were</c><00:25:23.010><c> like</c><00:25:23.130><c> okay</c><00:25:23.820><c> we</c>

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
