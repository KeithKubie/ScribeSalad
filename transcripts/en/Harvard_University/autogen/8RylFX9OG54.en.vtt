there was going to be some sort of

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:13.210
there was going to be some sort of
 

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.060

um so I'm wondering what you think about

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.070
um so I'm wondering what you think about
 

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.340
um so I'm wondering what you think about
if there's a need for that if there's a

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.350
if there's a need for that if there's a
 

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.930
if there's a need for that if there's a
possibility for that and if you think

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:27.940
possibility for that and if you think
 

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.250
possibility for that and if you think
there is any in this book well I think I

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:32.260
there is any in this book well I think I
 

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.770

think I don't know about redemption but
 

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.060
think I don't know about redemption but
I think there is recognition and for me

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.070
I think there is recognition and for me
 

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:47.250
I think there is recognition and for me
that has some value because I I think

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:47.260
that has some value because I I think
 

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.310
that has some value because I I think
I'm a little bit exhausted by the sense

didn't intend to offend and then the
 

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.300
didn't intend to offend and then the
sort of white positioning of any

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.310
sort of white positioning of any
 

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.480

white woman in that car yeah and and she
 

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:52.809
white woman in that car yeah and and she
felt that suddenly she was being asked

00:49:52.809 --> 00:49:52.819
felt that suddenly she was being asked
 

00:49:52.819 --> 00:49:58.299

to be an alliance with this racist

00:49:58.299 --> 00:49:58.309
to be an alliance with this racist
 

00:49:58.309 --> 00:50:02.359
to be an alliance with this racist
construction and when she told me the

00:50:02.359 --> 00:50:02.369

00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:05.359
construction and when she told me the
story she said what did I do to suggest

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:05.369
story she said what did I do to suggest
 

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:07.430

00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:23.839
myself in that and I think I think the
other thing about your question is it's

00:50:23.839 --> 00:50:23.849
other thing about your question is it's
 

00:50:23.849 --> 00:50:26.180

institution of racism only affects
 

00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:58.089
institution of racism only affects
people of color and because of perceived

00:50:58.089 --> 00:50:58.099
people of color and because of perceived
 

00:50:58.099 --> 00:51:02.059
people of color and because of perceived
mobility of whiteness it really isn't
