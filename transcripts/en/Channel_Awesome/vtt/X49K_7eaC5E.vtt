Rob: The Dr. Phil Story!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.180
Doug: Mad as in angry or mad as in crazy?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.800
Rob: Yes.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.720
Doug: Goodnight, Pluto! Good luck surviving Hurricane Irma!

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.480
Rob: You know, if Mickey didn't finish off that bottle of Bourbon, he might realize there's a hurricane outside.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.800
Doug: What's that, boy? A sharknado?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.980
Mickey: Pluto!

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.400
Pluto!

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.260
Doug: Well, he's no longer a planet, so who gives a shit?

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.760
Mickey: He's gone!

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.720
Doug: Goofy's gonna experiment on Pluto. 
There will be answers.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.440
Rob: Judging by these footprints, I deduce he has feet.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.380
Doug: Welcome to Castlevania! Yahoo! Yahoo!

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.740
Dr. Triple X?!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.700
Rob: Next on Cinema Snob: The first porno starring cartoon dogs.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.900
Well, it's nice of that bridge to politely collapse.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.720
Doug: Eh, we want to kill you, but kill you with kindness.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.580
It's like the welcome mat of Steve Bannon's house.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.380
Rob: You now belong to the Disney Vault.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.800
I thought I was public domain!

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.860
Wrong!

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.480
Doug: The great survivors.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.780
Mickey: Pluto!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Rob: Seeking revenge on Mystery Inc., the nearsighted ghoul had no idea this wasn't Scooby-Doo.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.420
Coming this summer: Walt Disney's Doom 64.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.060
Mickey: Aahaahaahaahaahaa!

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.860
Doug: Screw it! I'm getting a cat!

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.680
Rob: The legs of Gwendoline Christie foreshadow Mickey's end.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.200
Doug: Okay guys, I know it's the thirties, but I thought we'd be able to do better than this!

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340
Mickey: Ahah! Hahaha...

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.860
[Mickey yelps again]

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.920
Fire in my hole! I'm searching for Pluto but I got hit in my Uranus!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.440
Rob: Mickey has a match?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.900
Doug: Disney was a smoker, so Mickey is a smoker.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.520
Rob: At the sound of the tone, it'll be Death 'o Clock.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.120
Doug: I don't have any lungs or lips, but take this!

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.340
Rob: Oh, it's the newest reality show, "Practical jokes and Satan."

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.020
Mickey: Pluto...

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.120
Doug: Do~

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.700
Doug: Do~ Re~

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.340
Doug: Do~ Re~ Mi~

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.080
Doug: Do~ Re~ Mi~ Fa~

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.580
Doug: Do~ Re~ Mi~ Fa~ -BOO

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.620
Doug and Rob: Dammit, Frank!

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.140
Mickey: Pluto...

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.920
Doug and Rob: Piss off!

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.160
Rob: Y'know, I get the dog, I'm just not for the life of me understanding the chicken.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.520
Doug: So this is how Chick-fil-A comes up with their sandwich ideas!

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.220
Doctor: And now...

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.920
Rob: Good god Dog, Where's your junk?!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.900
Doug: I splice you Gangnam Style!

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.560
Doctor: I'm a raring, tearing wizard when it comes to cutting up!

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.800
[Laughs]

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.660
Rob: I guess it was pretty funny.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.100
Doctor: - A chicken's gizzard on the wishbone of a pup.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.440
Rob: Woah! Seriously! You should get that looked at! I'm a doctor you know!

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.880
Doctor: Here's the great experiment -

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.740
- I'm just about to tackle:

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.860
Doug: Human Centipede for kids!

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.100
Doctor: - the next result will bark, or crow, or cackle!

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.300
[Evil laugh]

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.680
Rob: Y'know, I gotta hand it to him, the science seems pretty legit.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.720
Doug: Yikes! Bob Barker was right! Spay or neuter folks!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.080
Mickey: Pluto!!

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.860
Rob: H.P Lovecraft's Mouse Trap, it's the scariest game for ages 3 to the grave!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320
Doug: Free hugs!

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.080
Rob: I thought we had something!

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.020
Doug and Rob in monotone unison: 
We just saw Transformers 5.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.020
Doug: Heads up!

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.680
Doug:  Heads up! Keep ahead!

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.380
Doug: Heads up! Keep ahead! Head him off!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.880
Doug: Heads up! Keep ahead! Head him off!
Heads will roll!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.780
Doug: Heads up! Keep ahead! Head him off! 
Heads will roll! Head pun.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.160
Doug and Rob: DAMMIT, FRANK!!

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.180
[Mickey yelps]

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.940
Doug: Sorry, it's my thing.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.240
Rob: This is what Jehovah's Witnesses wish they could do at every door.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
Oh! Shelob! Have you lost weight?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.620
Doug: This is actually what Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 4 was gonna look like.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.040
Must have gotten him in the funny bone.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.920
Rob [Talking about Doug]: 
I have no brother.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.460
Rob: Eat my S!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.440
Doug: Oh, Good God!!

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.300
[In a lame-brained voice] 
A family picture!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300
[In a lame-brained voice] 
A family picture! From Hell!

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.660
Rob: That very specifically sounds like Pluto's shadow being cut in half!

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.520
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.040
I can't even- Who does this?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.600
Why have six doors if only the last one's locked?!

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.700
Doug: This is some Goofy-crap right here!

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.580
Well nice knowing you Pluto! 
This was your last episode!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.940
Ah! Another proud volunteer to watch The Emoji Movie!

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.500
Mickey: Pluto!!

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.640
Rob: It's like a salon run by Morticia Addams!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.640
Sorry! I was thinking of joke from Big Bang Theory! That's how you know I'm evil!

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.400
Apparently Mickey's a little dusty in the groinal department.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.260
Doug: Minnie has a lot of headaches.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.500
Rob: Bugs Bunny says, "Merry Christmas, ya little shit!"

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.400
Doug: You expect me to talk?!

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.860
No, Mister Mouse, I expect you to squeak!

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.240
[Mickey whimpering]

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.540
Doug: See kids? This is what happens when you eat at Arby's before bedtime.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.980
Rob: But they have the meats!

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.460
[Mickey screams in surprise]

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.320
Holy crap! That was way worse than Donald's dream about becoming a Nazi!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.860
[Mickey repeatedly calling for Pluto]

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.340
Doug: Hey kids, what have we learned today?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.140
Rob: That a story about a boy and his dog can be made better with buzzsaws,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.860
skeletons and a creepy scientist who makes 
the Marquis de Sade look like Mister Rogers.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.860
Doug: You might be wondering where Minnie was in all of this!

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.800
She was the Doctor's first victim.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.880
Bye!!
