00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.464
Scientists can grow human kidney 
tissue in a dish, which are
called kidney organoids.

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:11.219
These organoids typically lack
 a pervasive and mature
vascular system, which is needed
for organ-level function.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.644
Now, researchers developed an
in vitro method for enhancing
the vascularization of whole
kidney organoids.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:28.319
They enhance kidney organoid
vascularization and maturation
by culturing them under
continuous fluid flow in a 3D
printed millifluidic chip.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:37.037
Vasculature produced in the
organoids is pervasive and
contains open lumens.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:45.962
Vascularization of epithelial
structures enhances their
maturity.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:52.010
Segmented vascularized nephron-
like structures form when
cultured under flow.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:01.102
Vascularization of glomerular
structures mirror in vivo
development with capillaries
 invading the glomerular cleft.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:07.609
Vasculature between different 
organoids in the chip can 
interconnect via anastomosia

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:20.997
The well-vascularized kidney 
organoids have the capacity to 
fuse with each other, creating 
larger tissue pieces.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:29.506
These organoids can be used to 
model kidney diseases and to 
test toxicity.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:58.868
