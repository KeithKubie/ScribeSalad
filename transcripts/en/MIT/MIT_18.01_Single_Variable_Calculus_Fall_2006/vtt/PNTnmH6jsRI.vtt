00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.430
PROFESSOR: So we're through
with techniques of

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.730
integration, which is really the
most technical thing that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.040
we're going to be doing.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.200
And now we're just
clearing up a few

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.080
loose ends about calculus.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.810
And the one we're going to talk
about today will allow us

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.530
to deal with infinity.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.940
And it's what's known
as L'Hopital's Rule.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.990
Here's L'Hopital's Rule.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.360
And that's what we're
going to do today.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:14.990
L'Hopital's Rule it's also known
as L'Hospital's Rule.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.840
That's the same name, since the
circumflex is what you put

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.610
in French to omit the s.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.290
So it's the same thing, and
it's still pronounced

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.840
L'Hopital, even if it's
got an s in it.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.160
Alright, so that's the
first thing you need

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.650
to know about it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.040
And what this method does is,
it's a convenient way to

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:55.410
calculate limits including
some new ones.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.670
So it'll be convenient
for the old ones.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.310
There are going to be some new
ones and, as an example, you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.910
can calculate x ln x as
x goes to infinity.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.100
You could, whoops, that's not a
very interesting one, let's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.470
try x goes to 0 from
the positive side.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.590
And you can calculate, for
example, x e^ - x, as x goes

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.190
to infinity.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.340
And, well, maybe I should
include a few others.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.550
Maybe something like ln x /
x as x goes to infinity.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.580
So these are some examples of
things which, in fact, if you

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.380
plug into your calculator,
you can see what's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.220
happening with these.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.430
But if you want to understand
them systematically, it's much

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.140
better to have this tool
of L'Hopital's Rule.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.970
And certainly there isn't
a proof just based on a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.310
calculation in a calculator.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.760
So now here's the idea.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.750
I'll illustrate the idea
first with an example.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.380
And then we'll make
it systematic.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.020
And then we're going
to generalize it.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.840
We'll make it much more, so
when it includes these new

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.330
limits, there are some little
pieces of trickiness that you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.050
have to understand.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.850
So, let's just take an example
that you could have done in

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.070
the very first unit
of this class.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:41.230
The limit as x goes to 1 of
x ^ 10 - 1 / x ^2 - 1.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.370
So that's a limit that
we could've handled.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.110
And the thing that's
interesting, I mean, if you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.070
like this is in this category
that we mentioned at the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.480
beginning of the course
of interesting limits.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.750
What's interesting about it is
that if you do this silly

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.700
thing, which is just plug in
x = 1, at x = 1 you're

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.480
going to get 0 / 0.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.720
And that's what we call
an indeterminate form.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.340
It's just unclear what it is.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.150
From that plugging, in you
just can't get it.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.490
Now, on the other
hand, there's a

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.360
trick for doing this.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.960
And this is the trick
that we did at the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.350
beginning of the class.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.040
And the idea is I can divide
in the numerator and

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.230
denominator by x - 1.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.060
So this limit is unchanged, if
I try to cancel the hidden

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.400
factor x - 1 in the numerator
and denominator.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.630
Now, we can actually carry out
these ratios of polynomials

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.580
and calculate them by long
division in algebra.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.660
That's very, very long.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.110
We want to do this
with calculus.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.170
And we already have. We already
know that this ratio

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.420
is what's called a difference
quotient.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.380
And then in the limit, it tends
to the derivative of

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.340
this function.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.390
So the idea is that this is
actually equal to, in the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.400
limit, now let's just study
one piece of it.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.150
So if I have a function f ( x),
which is x ^ 10 - 1, and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.710
the value at 1 happens to
be equal to 0, then this

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.350
expression that we have, which
is in disguise, this is in

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.300
disguise the difference
quotient, tends to, as x goes

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.030
to 1, the derivative,
which is f' ( 1).

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.620
That's what it is.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.090
So we know what the numerator
goes to, and similarly we'll

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.650
know what the denominator
goes to.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.580
But what is that?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.460
Well, f ' (x) = 10x ^ 9.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.610
So we know what the answer is.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.550
In the numerator it's 10x ^ 9.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.470
In the denominator, it's going
to be 2x, that's the

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.340
derivative of x ^2 - 1.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.930
And then were going to have
to evaluate that at x = 1.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.160
And so it's going to be
10/2, which is 5.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.350
So the answer is 5.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.050
And it's pretty easy to get
from our techniques and

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.580
knowledge of derivatives,
using this rather clever

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.510
algebraic trick.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.540
This business of dividing
by x - 1.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.030
What I want to do now is just
carry this method out

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.420
systematically.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.290
And that's going to give us the
approach to what's known

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.260
as L'Hopital's Rule.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.860
What my main subject
for today.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.040
So here's the idea.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.530
Suppose we're considering, in
general, a limit as x goes to

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.860
some number a of f
( x) / g ( x).

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.330
And suppose it's the bad case
where we can't decide.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.200
So it's in determinate.
f ( a) = g ( a) = 0.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.730
So it would be 0 / 0.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.580
Now we're just going to
do exactly the same

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.520
thing we did over here.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.170
Namely, we're going to divide
a numerator and denominator,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.010
and we're going to repeat
that argument.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.390
So we have here f
( x) / x - a.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.240
And g (x) / x - a also.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.200
I haven't changed
anything yet.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.120
And now I'm going to write it
in this suggestive form.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.050
Namely, I'm going to take
separately the limit in the

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.330
numerator and the denominator.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.460
And I'm going to make
one more shift.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.250
So I'm going to take the limit,
as x goes to a in the

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.960
numerator, but I'm going
to write it as f ( x) -

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.270
f ( a) / x - a.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.870
So that's the way I'm going to
write the numerator, and I've

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.580
got to draw a much
longer line here.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.720
So why am I allowed
to do that?

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.690
That's because f (a) = 0.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.000
So I didn't change this
numerator of the numerator any

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.210
by subtracting. f ( a) = 0.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:19.260
And I'll do the same thing
to the denominator.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.650
Again, g ( a) = 0,
so this is OK.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.760
And lo and behold, I know
what these limits are.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:34.110
This is f ' (a) / g '(a).

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.660
So that's it.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.880
That's the technique and this
evaluates the limit.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.070
And it's not so difficult.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.310
The formula's pretty
straightforward here.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:51.410
And it works, provided that
g ' (a) is not 0.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.590
Yeah, question.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:09:05.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.900
PROFESSOR: The question is, is
there a more intuitive way of

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.210
understanding this procedure.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:21.650
And I think the short answer
is that there are other,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.600
similar, ways.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.520
I don't consider them to
be more intuitive.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.180
I will be mentioning one of
them, which is the idea of

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.280
linearization, which goes back
to what we did in Unit 2.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.480
I think it's very important to
understand all of these, more

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.810
or less, at once.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.530
But I wouldn't claim that any
of these methods is a more

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.890
intuitive one than the other.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.830
But basically what's happening
is, we're looking at the

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.340
linear approximation
to f, at a.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.980
And the linear approximation
to g at a.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.880
That's what underlies this.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.630
So now I get to formulate for
you L'Hopital's Rule at least

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.430
in what I would call the
easy version or, if you

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.520
like, Version 1.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:10.290
So here's L'Hopital's Rule.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.290
Version 1.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.480
It's not going to be quite the
same as what we just did.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.670
It's going to be much,
much better.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.860
And more useful.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.840
And what is going to take care
of is this problem that the

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.730
denominator is not 0.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.420
So now here's what we're
going to do.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.000
We're going to say that it turns
out that the limit a x

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.480
goes to a of f(x) / g ( x) = the
limit as x goes to a to a

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.210
f '(x) / g' (x).

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.160
Now, that looks practically
the same as

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.380
what we said before.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.310
And I have to make sure that you
understand when it works.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:02.820
So it works provided this is
one of these undefined

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.430
expressions.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.700
In other words, f (
a) = g ( a) = 0.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.320
So we have a 0 / 0 expression,
indeterminant.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.280
And, also, we need one
more assumption.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:30.360
And the right-hand side, the
right-hand limit exists.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.510
Now, this is practically
the same thing as

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.310
what I said over here.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:41.050
Namely, I took the ratio of
these functions, x ^ 10 - 1

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.540
and x ^2 - 1.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.460
I took their derivatives, which
is what I did right

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.180
here, right.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.480
I just differentiated them
and I took the ratio.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.680
This is way easier than the
quotient rule, and is nothing

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.780
like the quotient rule.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.900
Don't think quotient rule.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.070
Don't think quotient rule.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.360
So we differentiate the
numerator and denominator

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.400
separately.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.030
And then I take the limit as
x goes to 1 and I get 5.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.940
So that's what I'm claiming
over here.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.275
I take these functions, I
replace them with this ratio

00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:14.000
of derivatives, and then
I take the limit

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.650
instead, over here.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.020
And it turned out that the
functions got much simpler

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.120
when I differentiated them.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.790
I started with this messy object
and I got this much

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.520
easier object that I could
easily evaluate.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.830
So that's the big game that's
happening here.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.495
It works, if this limit makes
sense and this limit exists.

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:38.130
Now, notice I didn't claim that
g, that the denominator,

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.260
had to be non-0.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.070
So that's what's going
to help us a little

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.430
bit in a few examples.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.650
So let me give you a couple
of examples and

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.570
then we'll go further.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.470
Now, this is only Version 1.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.340
But first we have to understand
how this one works.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.300
So here's another example.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:06.400
Take the limit as x goes to
0, of sin 5x / sin 2x.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.060
This is another kind of example
of a limit that we

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.350
discussed in the first
part of the course.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.930
Unfortunately, now we're
reviewing stuff.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.980
So this should reinforce
what you did there.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.330
This will be an easier way
of thinking about it.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.050
So by L'Hopital's Rule,
so here's the step.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.870
We're going to take one
of these steps.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.560
This is the limit, as x goes to
1, of the derivatives here.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:43.220
So that's 5 cos 5x / 2 cos 2x.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.735
The limit was 1 over there,
but now it's 0. a

00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:48.530
is 0 in this case.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.500
This is the number a.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.930
Thank you.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.760
So the limit as x goes to 0 is
the same as the limit of the

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.400
derivatives.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.620
And that's easy to evaluate.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.910
Cosine of 0 = 1, right.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.550
This is equal to
5 (cos (5* 0).

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.840
And that's a multiplication
sign.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.660
Maybe I should just
write this as 0.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.240
Divided by 2 cos 0.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:24.440
But you know that that's 5/2.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.340
So this is how L'Hopital's
method works.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:33.660
It's pretty painless.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.540
I'm going to give you another
example, which shows that it

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.010
works a little better
than the method that

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:45.550
I started out with.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.380
Here's what happens if we
consider the function

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:55.470
cos x - 1 / x ^2.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.940
That was a little harder
to deal with.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:03.060
And again, this is one of these
0 / 0 things near x = 0.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:11.200
As x tends to 0, this goes to
an indeterminate form here.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.370
Now, according to our method,
this is equivalent to, now I'm

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.630
going to use this little wiggle
because I don't want to

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.030
write limit, limit, limit,
limit a million times.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.330
So I'm going to use a
little wiggle here.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.840
So as x goes to 0, this is going
to behave the same way

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.390
as differentiating numerator
and denominator.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.640
So again this is going to be
- sin x in the numerator.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:42.110
In the denominator, it's
going to be 2x.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.140
Now, notice that we still
haven't won yet.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.060
Because this is still
of 0 / 0 type.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.000
When you plug in x =
0 you still get 0.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.270
But that doesn't damage
the method.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.630
That doesn't make
the method fail.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.270
This 0 / 0, we can
apply L'Hopital's

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:10.410
Rule a second time.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.120
And as x goes to 0 this is
the same thing as, again,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.860
differentiating the numerator
and denominator.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.900
So here I get - cos x in the
numerator, and I get 2 in the

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.480
denominator.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.300
Again this is way easier than

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.260
differentiating ratios of functions.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.240
We're only differentiating the
numerator and the denominator

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.060
separately.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.960
And now this is the end.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:48.660
As x goes to 0, this is - cos
0 / 2, which is - 1/2.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.710
Now, the justification for this
comes only when you win

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.130
in the end and get the limit.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.820
Because what the theorem says is
that if one of these limits

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.580
exists, then the preceding
one exists.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.100
And once the preceding
one exists, then the

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.980
one before it exists.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.480
So once we know that this one
exists, that works backwards.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.950
It applies to the preceding
limit, which then applies to

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.030
the very first one.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.000
And the logical structure here
is a little subtle, which is

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.460
that if the right side exists,
then the left side will also

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.380
exist. Yeah, question.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:32.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.410
PROFESSOR: Why does the
right-hand limit have to

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.120
exist, isn't it just the
derivative that has to exist?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.470
No.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.500
The derivative of the numerator
has to exist. The

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.420
derivative of the denominator
has to exist. And this limit

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.390
has to exist. What doesn't have
to exist, by the way, I

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.080
never said that f prime of a
has to exist. In fact, it's

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.690
much, much more subtle.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.380
I'm not claiming that f ' (a)
exists, because in order to

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.990
evaluate this limit, f ' (a)
need not exist. What has to

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.050
happen is that nearby, for x not
equal to a, these things

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.060
exist. And then the limit has
to exist. So there's no

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.630
requirements that the limits
exist. In fact, that's exactly

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.860
going to be the point when we
evaluate these limits here.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.760
Is we don't have to evaluate
it right at the end.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.050
PROFESSOR: So the question that
you're asking is, why is

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.970
this the hypothesis
of the theorem?

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.700
In other words, why
does this work?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.370
Well, the answer is that this
is a theorem that's true.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.050
If you drop this hypothesis,
it's totally false.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.520
And if you don't have this
hypothesis, you can't use the

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.820
theorem and you will get
the wrong answer.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.320
I mean, it's hard to express
it any further than that.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.040
So look, in many cases
we tell you formulas.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.280
And in many cases it's so
obvious when they're true that

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.610
we don't have to worry
about what we say.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.980
And indeed, there's something
implicit here.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.550
I'm saying well, you know, if
I wrote this symbol down, it

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.370
must mean that the
thing exists.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.280
So that's a subtle point.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.850
But what I'm emphasizing is that
you don't need to know in

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.730
advance that this one exists.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.020
You do need to know in advance
that that one exists.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.850
Essentially, yeah.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.620
So that's the direction
that it goes.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.100
You can't get away with not
having this exist and still

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:37.740
have the statement be true.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.600
Alright, another question.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.740
Thank you.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:47.700
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.080
PROFESSOR: So I'm getting a
little ahead of myself, but

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.610
let me just say.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.670
In these situations here, when x
is going to 0 and x is going

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:00.120
to infinity.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.900
For instance, here when x goes
to 0, the logarithm is

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.340
undefined at x = 0.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.240
Nevertheless, this
theorem applies.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.170
And we'll be able to use it.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.520
Over here, as x goes to
infinity, neither of these --

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.540
well, actually, come to think
of it, e^ -x, if you like,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.890
it's equal to 0 at infinity.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.220
If you want to say that
it has a value.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.700
But in fact, these expressions
don't necessarily have values.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.340
At the ends.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:33.160
And nevertheless, the
theorem applies.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.930
I mean, it can exist. It's
perfectly OK for it to exist.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:37.910
It's no problem.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.220
It just doesn't need
to exists.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:45.080
It isn't forced to exist.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.090
So here's a calculation
which we just did.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.460
And we evaluated this.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:58.050
Now, I want to make a comparison
with the method of

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:06.770
approximation.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.990
In the method of approximations,
this Example

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.780
2, which was the example with
the sine function, we would

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.820
use the following property.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.370
We would use sin u is
approximately u.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:22.120
We would use that linear
approximation.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:29.160
And then what we would have here
is that sin 5x / sin 2x

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:35.610
is approximately 5x / 2x,
which is of course 5/2.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.490
And this is true when u is
approximately 0, and this is

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.550
true certainly as x goes
to 0, it's going

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.880
to be a valid limit.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.640
So that's very similar
to Example 2.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.530
In Example 3, we managed to look
at this expression cos x

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.640
- 1 / x ^2.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.510
And for this one, you have to
remember the approximation

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.940
near x = 0 to the
cosine function.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:15.580
And that's 1 - x ^2 / 2.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.850
So that was the approximation,
the quadratic approximation to

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.250
the cosine function.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.780
And now, sure enough,
this simplifies.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:32.630
This becomes - x ^2 / 2 /
x ^2, which is - 1/2.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.620
So we get the same answer,
which is a good thing.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.450
Because both of these
methods are valid.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.520
They're consistent.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.600
You can see that neither
of them is

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.940
particularly a lot longer.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.490
You may have trouble remembering
this property.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:51.050
But in fact it's something that
you can easily derive.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.705
And, indeed, it's related to the
second derivative of the

00:22:54.705 --> 00:22:56.540
cosine, as is this
calculation here.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:04.260
They're almost the same amount
of numerical content to them.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:12.240
So now what I'd like to do is
explain to you why L'Hopital's

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.970
Rule works better
in some cases.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:20.350
And the real value that it has
is in handling these other

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.550
more exotic limits.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:33.960
So now we're going to do
L'Hopital's Rule over again.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.360
And I'll handle these
functions.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.680
But I'll have to rewrite them,
but we'll just do that.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.100
So here's the property.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.260
That the limit as x goes to a of
f ( x) / g (x) is equal to

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:54.730
the limit as x goes to a
of f ' ( x) / g '(x).

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.980
That's the property.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.990
And this is what we'll
always be using.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.490
Very convenient thing.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.660
And remember it was true
provided that f (

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:11.530
a) = g (a) = 0.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:23.240
And that the right-hand
side exists.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.600
But I claim that it
works better, and

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.340
I'll get rid of these.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.980
But I'll write them again
to show you that

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.990
it works for these.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:43.680
So there are other cases.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.250
And the other cases that
are allowed are this.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.230
First of all, as indicated by
what I just erased, you can

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.570
allow a to be equal to plus
or minus infinity.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.680
It's also OK.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.820
So you can take the
limit going to the

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.110
far ends of the universe.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.630
Both left and right.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:12.265
And then the other thing that
you can do is, you can allow f

00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:19.690
( a) and g (a) to be plus
or minus infinity.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.540
Is OK.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.670
So now, the point is that we can
handle not just the 0 / 0

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:33.780
case, but also the infinity
/ infinity case.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.020
That's a very powerful tool, and
quite different from the

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:42.050
other cases.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:49.610
And the third thing is that the
right-hand side doesn't

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:56.500
really quite have to exist,
in the ordinary sense.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.460
Or, it could be plus
or minus infinity.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.970
That's also OK.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.270
That's still information.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:10.620
So if we can see where it goes,
then we're still good.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.920
If it goes to plus infinity, if
it goes to 0, if it goes to

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.490
a finite number, if it goes to
minus infinity, all of that

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.390
will be OK.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.550
It just if it oscillates wildly
that we'll be lost. And

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:27.500
those calculations we'll
never encounter.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.710
So this basically handles
everything that you could

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.050
possibly hope for.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:37.050
And it's a very convenient
process.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.510
So let me carry out
a few examples.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.760
And, let's see, I guess the
first one that I wanted to do

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.640
was x ln x.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.300
So what example are we up to.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:57.150
Example 3, so Example
4 is coming up.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.560
Example 4, this is one of the
ones that I wrote at the

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.430
beginning of the lecture,
x ln x.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:12.930
This one was on our
homework problem.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.740
In the limits of some
calculation.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:26.170
But so this one, you have to
look at it first to think

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.020
about what it's doing.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.530
It's an indeterminate form, but
it sort of looks like it's

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:30.980
the wrong type.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.070
So why is it in an indeterminate
form.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.600
This one goes to 0, and this
one goes to minus infinity.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.460
So, excuse me, this
is a product.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:46.210
It's 0 times minus infinity.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.010
So that's an indeterminate form,
because we don't know

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.200
whether the 0 wins or the
infinity this could keep

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.850
getting smaller and smaller and
smaller, and this could be

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:52.890
getting bigger and
bigger bigger.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.420
The product could be anything
in between.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.740
We just don't know.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:04.270
So the first step is to write
this as a ratio of things,

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.840
rather than a product
of things.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.770
And it turns out that the way
to do that is to use the

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.220
logarithm in the numerator,
and the 1 / x in the

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.360
denominator.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.040
So this is a choice that
I'm making here.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.800
Now, I've just converted it to
a limit of the type minus

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.100
infinity divided by infinity.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.830
Because the numerator is going
to minus infinity as x goes to

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:37.550
0 plus and the denominator 1 /
x is going to plus infinity.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.300
Again, there's a competitions,
but now it's one of the forms

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.210
to which L'Hopital's
Rule applies.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:49.400
Now I'm just going to apply
L'Hopital's Rule.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.670
And what it says is that
I differentiate here.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.500
So I just differentiate a
numerator and denominator.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.900
Applying L'Hopital's
Rule is a breeze.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.710
You just differentiate,
differentiate.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.810
And now it just simplifies
and we're done.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.260
This is the limit as x
goes to 0 plus of,

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.180
well, the x^2's cancel.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:20.360
This is the same as just
- x. x factors cancel.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.820
And so that's 0.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.170
The answer is that it's 0.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:30.650
So x goes to 0 faster then ln
n goes to minus infinity.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:36.400
This 0 was the winner.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.430
Something you can't

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:44.240
necessarily predict in advance.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.920
So let's do the other two
examples that I wrote down.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.230
I'm going to do them in slightly
more generality,

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:58.590
because they're the most
fundamental rate properties

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.220
that you're going to need to
know for the next section.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.000
Which is improper integrals.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.390
And also they're just very
important for physical math,

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.390
and any other kind of
thing, basically.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.340
So here, let's just do these.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.700
So let's see, which one do I
want to do first. So I wrote

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:22.400
down the limit of x e^2 - x, but
I'm going to make it even

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:22.970
more general.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.692
I'm going to make it any
negative power here, where p

00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:30.190
is some positive constant.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.680
Now again, this is a product of
functions, not a quotient,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.350
a ratio, of functions.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:41.010
And so I need to rewrite it.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:50.670
I'm going to write it
as x / e ^ p x.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.060
And now I'm going to apply,
well, so it's of this form

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.420
infinity / infinity.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.480
And now that's the same as the
limit as x goes to infinity of

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.520
1 / p e^ px.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.670
So where does that go?

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.250
As x goes to infinity.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.710
Now we can decide.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.430
The 1 stays where it is.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:23.440
And this, as x goes to infinity,
goes to infinity.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.080
So the answer is 0.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:48.500
And the conclusion is that x
grows more slowly then e ^ px.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.100
As x goes to infinity.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.980
Remember, p is positive
here, of course.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.990
It's the increasing
exponentials.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:32:03.080
Not the decreasing ones.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.530
Let's do a variant of this.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.690
I'll do it the opposite way.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.580
So I'm going to call
this example 5 '.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.900
It really doesn't give us any
more information, but it gives

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.280
you just a little bit
more practice.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:27.800
So suppose I look at things the
other way. e^ px divided

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:35.260
by, say, x^ 100.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:42.010
Now, this is an infinity /
infinity example, again.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.820
And you can work out
what it's doing.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.030
But there are two ways of
thinking about this.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.480
There's the slow way
and the fast way.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.390
The slow way is to differentiate
this 100 times.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.530
That is, right?

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.290
Apply L'Hopital's Rule
over and over and

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.490
over and over again.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.430
All the way.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.150
It's clear that you
could do it, but

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.570
it's kind of a nuisance.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.850
So there's a much cleverer
trick here.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.750
Which is to change this to
(the limit as x goes to

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:25.850
infinity of the e ^ px
/ 100 / x) ^ 100.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.700
So if you do that, then
we just have one

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.540
L'Hopital's Rule step here.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:44.130
And that one is that this is
the same as (x goes to

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:55.830
infinity of, well it's p / 100
e^ p x / 100 / 1) ^ 100.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:02.480
That's our L'Hopital's step.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:09.310
And of course, that's (infinity
/ 1 ) ^ 100.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.410
Which is infinity.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:14.360
Now, again I did this in a
slightly different way to show

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.800
you that it works with
infinity as well.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.400
So that was this other case.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.010
The right-hand side can
exist, or it can be

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.460
plus or minus infinity.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.240
And that applies
to this limit.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.990
And therefore, to the
original limit.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:35.550
And the conclusion here is
that e ^ px, p &gt; 0, grows

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:46.340
faster than any power of x.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.600
I picked x ^ 100, but obviously
it didn't matter

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.670
what power I picked.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:35:02.050
The exponents beat
all the powers.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.340
So we have one more of the
ones that I gave at the

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.780
beginning to take care of.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.330
And that one is the logarithm.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.720
And its behavior at infinity.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.700
So I'll do a slightly variant
on that one, too.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:25.080
So we have Example 6, which is
ln x, and instead of dividing

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.780
by x, I'm going to
divide by x^ 1/3.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.650
I could divide by any positive
power of x, we'll just do this

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.170
example here.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:38.340
So now this, as x goes to
infinity, is of the form

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.230
infinity / infinity.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.530
And so it's equivalent to what
happens when I differentiate

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.250
numerator and denominator
separately.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:36:00.320
And that's 1 / x, and here
I have 1/3 x ^ - 2/3.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.470
1 / x, and then 1/3 x^ - 2/3.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.920
Now, when the dust settles
here and you get your

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.560
exponents right, we have an x^ -
1, and this is an x ^ + 2/3,

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.500
and that's a 1/3 becomes a 3.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:19.260
So this is what it is.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:26.480
And that's equal
to 3x ^ - 1/3.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.830
Which we can decide.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.150
It goes to 0.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:37.240
As x goes to infinity.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:49.910
And so the conclusion is that
ln x grows more slowly as x

00:36:49.910 --> 00:37:08.690
goes to infinity, than x ^ 1/3
or any positive power of x.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:15.500
So any x ^ p, p positive,
will work.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.670
So ln is really slow,
going to infinity.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.550
It's very, very gradual.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.420
Yeah, question.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:45.970
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.230
PROFESSOR: The question
is, how many

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.630
hypotheses do you need here?

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:57.760
So I said that, and I think what
you were asking is, if I

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.940
have this hypothesis, can I
also have this hypothesis.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.870
That's OK.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.840
I can have this hypothesis
combined with this one.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.280
I need something about
f (a) and g ( a).

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.910
I can't assume nothing
about f(a) and g(a).

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.370
So in other words, I have to
be faced with either an

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:24.180
infinity / infinity, or
a 0 / 0 situation.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.650
So let's see.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:35.160
A rule applies in the 0 / 0, or
infinity / infinity case.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.910
These are the only two cases
that it applies in.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:45.370
And a can be anything.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.880
Including infinity.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.230
Plus or minus infinity.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.390
The rule applies in
these two cases.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:58.310
So in other words, this is
what f ( a) / g ( a) is.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.750
Either one of these.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.540
And in fact, it can
be plus or minus.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.290
PROFESSOR: And the right-hand
side has to be something.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:21.250
It has to be either finite or
plus or minus infinity.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.690
So you need something.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.740
You need a specific value of a,
you need to decide whether

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.070
it's an indeterminate form.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.390
And you need the right-hand
limit to exist. It's not hard

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.530
to impose this.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.423
Because when you look at the
right-hand side, you'll want

00:39:36.423 --> 00:39:37.350
to be calculating it.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.600
So you want to know
what it is.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:47.640
So you'll never have problems
confirming this hypothesis.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.280
Alright.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.480
Let me give you one
more example here.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.600
Which is just slightly
trickier.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:15.130
Which involves, so here's
another indeterminate form.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.780
That's going to be 0 ^ 0.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.580
So there are lots of these
things where you just don't

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.690
know what to do.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.730
And they come out in various
different ways.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.390
The simplest example of this
is the limit as x goes to 0

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:41.430
from above of x ^ x.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:45.360
In order to work out what's
happening with this one, we

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.610
have to use a trick.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.650
And the trick is this is
a moving exponent.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.220
And so it's appropriate
to use base e.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.010
This is something that we did
way back in the first unit.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:06.900
So, since we have a moving
exponent, we're

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.830
going to use base e.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.690
That's the good base
to use whenever you

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.600
have a moving exponent.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.530
And so rewrite this as
x^ x = e ^ x ln x.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.960
And now, in order to figure
out what's happening, we

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.250
really only have to know what's

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:32.140
going on with the exponent.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.100
So remember, actually
we already did this.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.100
But I'm going to do it
once more for you.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.340
This is ln x / (1 / x).

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.360
And that's equivalent, as
x goes to 0, to using

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:51.450
L'Hopital's Rule to 1 / x, and
this is - 1 / x ^2, which is -

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.350
x, which goes to 0.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:58.030
As x goes to 0.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.670
And so what we have here is that
this one is going to be

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:06.200
equivalent to, well, it's
going to tend to

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.520
what we got over here.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.170
It's e ^ 0.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.980
That exponent is what we want.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.250
As x goes to 0.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:27.190
So that's the answer This
limit happens to be 1.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.050
That's actually relatively easy
to do, given all of the

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:42.700
power that we have
at our hands.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:49.310
Now, let me give you
one more example.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.360
Suppose you're trying to
understand the limit

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:59.060
of sin x / x ^2.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:06.320
If you apply L'Hopital's Rule,
as x goes to 0, you're going

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.660
to get cos x / 2x.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:19.270
And if you apply L'Hopital's
Rule again, as x goes to 0,

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:24.920
you're going to get
the - sin x / 2.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:35.840
And this, as x goes
to 0, goes to 0.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.820
On the other hand, if you look
at the linear approximation

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:49.620
method, linear approximation
says that sin x is

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:55.090
approximately x near 0.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.560
So that should be x / x ^2.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.900
Which is 1 / x, which
goes to infinity.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.980
As x goes to 0, at least from
one side, minus infinity to

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.100
the other side.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.320
So there's something fishy
going on here, right?

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.330
So this is fishy.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.520
Or maybe this is fishy,
I don't know.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.420
So, tell me what's wrong here.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:26.750
Yeah.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:37.120
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.070
So the claim is that the
second application of

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:51.950
L'Hopital's Rule, this
one, is wrong.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.620
And that's correct.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.700
And this is where you
have to watch out,

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.500
with L'Hopital's Rule.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.920
This is exactly where you
have to watch out.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.580
You have to apply the
test. Here it's an

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:03.820
indeterminate form.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.260
It's 0 / 0 before I
applied the rule.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.290
But in order to apply the rule
the second time, it still has

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.410
to be 0 / 0.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.170
But this one isn't.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:19.290
This one is 1 / 0.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.650
It's no longer an indeterminate
form.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.910
It's actually infinite.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.970
Either plus or minus, depending
on the sign of the

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.520
denominator.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.970
Which is just what
this answer is.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.550
So the linear approximation
is safe.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.160
And we just applied L'Hopital's
Rule wrong.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:55.760
So the moral of the story here
is look before you L'Hop.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.260
Alright.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:09.850
Now, let me say one
more thing.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:22.900
I need to pile it on just
a little bit, sorry.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:36.700
So don't use it as a crutch.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.690
We don't want to just get
ourselves so weak, after being

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.580
in the hospital for all
this time, that we

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:55.560
can't use, I'm sorry.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.700
So remember that you shouldn't
have lost your senses.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:09.770
If you have something
like this, so

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.210
we'll do this one here.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.470
Suppose you're trying to
understand what this does as x

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.200
goes to infinity.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:23.770
Now, you could L'Hopital's
Rule five

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.700
times, or four times.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:30.040
And get the answer here.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.260
But really, you should realize
that the main terms are

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.870
sitting there right
in front of you.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.470
And that there's some
algebra that you can

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:38.490
do to simplify this.

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:45.450
Namely, it's the same as
1 + 2 / x + 1 / x^ 5.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.510
And then in the denominator,
well, let's see.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.110
It's x.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:57.965
So this would be dividing by 1
/ x^ 5 in both numerator and

00:47:57.965 --> 00:47:58.240
denominator.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:04.410
And here you have 1 / x + 2
over, sorry I overshot.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.250
But that's OK.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.110
2 / x^ 5 here.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.650
So these are the main
term, if you like.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:18.590
And it's the same as 1 / 1 / x,
which is the same as x, and

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.490
it goes to infinity.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.930
As x goes to infinity.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:28.040
Or, if you like, much more
simply, just x ^ 5 / x^ 4 is

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.230
the main term.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:30.520
Which is x.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.590
Which goes to infinity.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:36.110
So don't forget your basic
algebra when you're doing this

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.210
kind of stuff.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.640
Use these things and don't
use L'Hopital's Rule.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.760
OK, see you next time.
