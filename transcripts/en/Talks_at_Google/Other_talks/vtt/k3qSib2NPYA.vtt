00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.434
LaJeunesse: GOOD AFTERNOON
AND THANKS TO EVERYONE

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.267
FOR BEING HERE.

00:00:05.267 --> 00:00:06.801
MY NAME IS ROSS LAJEUNESSE,

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.300
AND I AM HEAD OF STATE POLICY
FOR THE WESTERN U.S.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.267
HERE AT GOOGLE.

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:13.234
TODAY'S PANEL
IS ON PROPOSITION 8,

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.367
WHICH I'M SURE
ALL OF YOU KNOW

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.501
IS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.567
GOING BEFORE VOTERS
THIS NOVEMBER

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:23.400
WHICH WOULD AMEND
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.767
TO PROHIBIT
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:27.300
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.467
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.534
LaJeunesse: THAT RAISES
A GOOD POINT.

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:35.501
TODAY'S PANEL IS NOT BALANCED.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.667
AND BY THAT I HAVE NO COMMENT
ON THE MENTAL FACULTIES

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.400
OF OUR THREE PANELISTS.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.734
I'M MERELY
STATING THAT

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.400
WE DO NOT HAVE OPPONENTS
AND PROPONENTS OF PROP 8

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.534
ON TODAY'S PANEL.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:50.300
THE REASON FOR THAT
IS TODAY'S PANEL

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.534
IS HAPPENING
THROUGH THE HARD WORK

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:56.267
OF THE GAYGLERS GROUP
AND OTHER GOOGLERS

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:59.200
WHO OPPOSE PROPOSITION 8.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.701
THE PUBLIC POLICY GROUP
IS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.267
AND IS HELPING
TO HOST THE PANEL,

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.834
AND WE WOULD DO
THE SAME IF WE WERE APPROACHED

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.968
BY PROPONENTS
OF PROPOSITION 8.

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:12.234
SO I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:15.501
BEFORE WE TURNED IT OVER
TO OUR PANELISTS.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.534
WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:19.934
OF PANELISTS
TODAY.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:23.667
THEY ARE ALL SUPERSTARS.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.400
I KNOW EACH OF THEM PERSONALLY
TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.067
AND I'M JUST GONNA DO
A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF EACH

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:31.834
BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THEM.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.567
SO WE'LL HAVE A BRIEF
PRESENTATION FROM EACH PANELIST,

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:39.067
AND THEN I HOPE THAT
WE'LL SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:41.000
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
AND HAVING A LIVELY DEBATE

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.934
ABOUT PROPOSITION 8.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:48.734
TO MY FAR LEFT
IS STEVE SMITH.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.801
NOW, STEVE IS A BIT
OF A SACRAMENTO LEGEND.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:54.501
HE IS A PRINCIPAL AT DEWEY
SQUARE GROUP WHERE HE FOCUSES

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:57.734
ON COMMUNITY ORGANIZING
AND CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.701
HE WAS THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER
FOR BOTH "NO ON 73"

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:02.801
AND "NO ON 85."

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:03.968
CORRECT?

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.801
WHICH WERE THE 2005

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:09.267
AND 2006 BALLOT INITIATIVES
DEALING

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:10.634
WITH PARENTAL NOTIFICATION.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:13.267
STEVE WON
BOTH THOSE CAMPAIGNS.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.100
HE IS NOW
THE CHIEF STRATEGIST

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.868
FOR THE "NO ON 8" CAMPAIGN.

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:19.834
IN A PRIOR LIFE,

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:23.801
STEVE WAS SECRETARY OF LABOR
UNDER GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS.

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:28.434
TO STEVE'S RIGHT
IS PATRICK GUERRIERO.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:31.267
PATRICK IS THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR OF GILL ACTION FUND,

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:35.400
WHICH IS A DENVER-BASED
ADVOCACY GROUP

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.400
WHICH FOCUSES ON NATIONAL ISSUES
SURROUNDING EQUAL RIGHTS

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.601
FOR ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS
OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.367
OR GENDER IDENTITY.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:50.334
IT'S A BIPARTISAN GROUP,
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND--

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:53.267
YOU'VE BEEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
SINCE 2006, CORRECT?

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:55.901
BEFORE THAT, PATRICK
WAS HEAD

00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:57.767
OF THE LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS.

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:00.834
AT THE RIPE
OLD AGE OF 25,

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:02.701
PATRICK WAS ELECTED
TO THE MASSACHUSETTS

00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:04.167
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.234
BACK IN 1993.

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:07.767
HE SERVED THREE TERMS
IN THE HOUSE

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.501
BEFORE BEING ELECTED MAYOR
OF HIS HOMETOWN

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:13.567
OF MELROSE, MASSACHUSETTS.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.234
AFTER TWO TERMS AS MAYOR,
PATRICK BECAME THE FIRST

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.501
OPENLY GAY CANDIDATE
FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.934
IN THE NATION'S HISTORY
WHEN MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.801
JANE SWIFT ASKED HIM
TO JOIN HER TICKET.

00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:25.968
THAT WAS IN 2002.

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.234
Guerriero: RIGHT.

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:32.434
LaJeunesse: TO PATRICK'S RIGHT
IS KATE KENDELL.

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:33.834
AND I AM PERSONALLY
A GREAT FAN OF KATE'S,

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.567
EVER SINCE I HEARD HER GIVE
A FANTASTIC SPEECH

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:36.934
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:40.100
WHICH STILL REMAINS
WITH ME TODAY.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.667
SHE'S A BRILLIANT ADVOCATE
FOR EQUAL RIGHTS

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:46.968
FOR GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL,
AND TRANSGENDERED INDIVIDUALS.

00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:49.434
SHE DOES THAT IN HER CAPACITY
AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:03:49.434 --> 00:03:52.667
OF THE NATIONAL CENTER
FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.601
BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:04:00.367
NCLR ADVOCATES EQUAL PROTECTION
FOR LGBT INDIVIDUALS

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.601
THROUGH LITIGATION,
ADVOCACY,

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:04.801
AND PUBLIC EDUCATION.

00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:08.501
IN ADDITION, KATE
IS A MUCH SOUGHT AFTER

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.801
NATIONAL COMMENTATOR
ON THESE ISSUES.

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.300
SHE'S APPEARED
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.534
"WALL STREET JOURNAL,"
CNN, NPR.

00:04:15.534 --> 00:04:18.901
PRETTY MUCH ANY PUBLICATION
ONE CAN THINK OF,

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:20.100
KATE HAS BEEN THERE.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.067
AND KATE IS GOING
TO START US OFF TODAY.

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:25.467
SO I'M GONNA TURN IT
OVER TO YOU.

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:26.968
Kendell: GREAT.
THANK YOU, ROSS.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:28.968
LaJeunesse: WHY DON'T WE JUST
WELCOME OUR PANELISTS FIRST?

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.133
THIS IS GREAT.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:33.367
[applause]

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:36.501
Kendell: AND I JUST WANNA
POINT OUT THAT ROSS

00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:38.534
MADE THOSE
VERY GENEROUS INTRODUCTIONS

00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:40.901
OF ALL THREE OF US
WITH NOT ONE NOTE.

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.667
THAT'S...

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:44.934
BIG BRAINS,
YOU GOOGLE PEOPLE.

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:45.934
ALL OF YOU.

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.534
IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:52.434
AND TO BE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT I THINK IS--

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:54.234
I THINK THE MOST--
WELL, CERTAINLY IT'S THE MOST

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:58.501
IMPORTANT FIGHT THAT
I HAVE FACED AS A MEMBER

00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:00.534
OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:03.300
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PROGRESSIVE FIGHTS

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.667
WE'VE EVER FACED
IN THIS NATION.

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:09.834
AND I THINK ITS POTENTIAL
TO TURN THE TIDE

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.968
ONCE AND FOR ALL AND
TO REALLY CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE

00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:17.534
FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY
REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION

00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.901
IS REALLY ENORMOUS,
AND I TRULY BELIEVE

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.667
THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.267
IT'S TRUE,
AS ROSS POINTED OUT,

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:27.834
THAT WE DON'T HAVE PROPONENTS
OF PROP 8 ON THIS PANEL.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:30.467
BUT I DID GROW UP MORMON
IN UTAH,

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:34.767
SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO--
THE ARGUMENT'S PRESENTED--

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:38.067
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO GO BACK TO MY ROOTS

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:40.934
BECAUSE THE CHURCH
OF MY CHILDHOOD IS A VERY

00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:43.534
VIGOROUS PROPONENT
OF PROP 8.

00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:45.634
AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT
OF THEIR MESSAGING.

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:47.434
AND I'VE BEEN
IN SOME CONVERSATIONS

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:50.133
WITH SOME OF MY OWN
FAMILY MEMBERS

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:54.767
ABOUT PROP 8, AND IT DOES
STIMULATE SIGNIFICANT VIEWS

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:57.033
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
AND IN THE COUNTRY.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.234
BUT ONE THING
THAT IS BECOMING CLEAR

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.567
IS THAT PEOPLE
ARE RECOGNIZING

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.667
THAT WE NOW
LIVE IN A STATE

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:06.534
THAT TREATS
ALL PEOPLE EQUALLY

00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:08.934
WHEN IT COMES
TO THE RIGHT TO MARRY.

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:14.334
EVERYONE IN THIS STATE CAN MARRY
THE PERSON THAT THEY LOVE.

00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:18.601
THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT--
[applause]

00:06:18.601 --> 00:06:22.467
THAT IS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT RIGHT.

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:25.300
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT WAY
OF BEING.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.801
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT WAY
OF UNDERSTANDING

00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.434
ONE'S SELF
AND ONE'S RELATIONSHIP.

00:06:30.434 --> 00:06:33.801
NO ONE SHOULD GROW UP FEELING
AS IF THEIR RELATIONSHIP

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:35.367
IS SUBSTANDARD.

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:37.334
THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:40.667
THAT THEIR LOVE IS NOT REGARDED
EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.801
AND WE NOW LIVE IN A STATE
WHERE THAT IS THE CASE,

00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:46.767
AND IT IS A TRULY LANDMARK

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:48.100
AND HISTORIC MOMENT.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.367
SO WHAT VOTERS ARE FACING,
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:52.801
IN SOME OF THE MESSAGING
AND THE POLLING

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:54.767
THAT STEVE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT
IN A FEW MINUTES--

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.767
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FACED
WITH THE QUESTION

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.534
OF WHETHER FOLKS ARE REALLY
WILLING TO ELIMINATE

00:07:00.534 --> 00:07:04.667
THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
TO MARRY--

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:07.267
WE ARE FINDING THAT REGARDLESS
OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:12.868
ABOUT SAME-SEX COUPLES MARRYING,
THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:15.634
THE POLITICAL STOMACH--
IT IS TRENDING THIS WAY,

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:17.534
ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY,
VERY CLOSE--

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:21.400
TO ELIMINATE
THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.067
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO HAVEN'T SEEN

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:26.000
THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE
OF THE INITIATIVE,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.901
IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND THIS IS HOW
IT WILL APPEAR ON THE BALLOT.

00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:32.400
ARGUMENT LANGUAGE
THAT EVERYONE WILL BE GETTING

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.100
IN THEIR MAILBOXES
THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.634
IT'S PROPOSITION 8.

00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:37.968
THIS IS THE TITLE:

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:40.934
"ELIMINATES RIGHT
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRY."

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:42.667
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THESE ARE THE STAKES

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.067
THAT MAKE IT SO HIGH.

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:46.767
IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.434
THE HIGHEST LAW
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:52.334
AND THEN IT'S 13 QUICK WORDS.

00:07:52.334 --> 00:07:55.100
"CHANGES CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION
TO ELIMINATE THE RIGHT

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.667
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRY."

00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.267
AND THIS IS THE KEY LANGUAGE:

00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:00.400
"PROVIDES THAT ONLY MARRIAGE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.133
IS VALID OR RECOGNIZED
IN CALIFORNIA."

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:05.767
NOW THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE
ARE VOTING ON,

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.934
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND

00:08:07.934 --> 00:08:11.400
WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS
AND THAT IT'S NOT A SITUATION

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.133
WHERE WE'RE SAYING
YOU HAVE TO BE CELEBRATING

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:16.868
THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
TO MARRY,

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:19.100
ALTHOUGH FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.701
OR ATTENDED WEDDINGS,
IT'S A VERY MOVING

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.000
AND CELEBRATORY EXPERIENCE.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.701
THE ISSUE IS,
ARE YOU WILLING TO ELIMINATE

00:08:26.701 --> 00:08:29.367
THIS VERY IMPORTANT,
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:32.100
FOR A WHOLE CATEGORY
OF CALIFORNIANS?

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.000
"WHY VOTE NO?"

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.467
AND THIS IS EASY MESSAGING

00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:37.434
THAT YOU ALL COULD WRITE
YOURSELVES,

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.234
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OPPOSED
TO PROP 8,

00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:40.834
THAT WE DON'T ELIMINATE
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:43.234
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:47.133
THAT IT'S WRONG TO TAKE
A CATEGORY OF PEOPLE AND SAY,

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:48.501
"YOU ARE GOING
TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.734
"THAN ANYBODY ELSE BASED
ON A FACTOR

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:54.000
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR ABILITY."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.801
THAT SAME-SEX COUPLES
AND INDIVIDUALS

00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:58.834
ARE PART OF CALIFORNIA.

00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:00.467
A PART OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:01.934
THIS IS WHO WE ARE.

00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:04.334
THIS IS PART OF WHAT MAKES
THIS STATE GREAT.

00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:07.467
PART OF THE DIVERSITY
THAT MAKES THIS STATE GREAT.

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:09.834
WE HEAR ARGUMENTS
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:12.100
AND THE MAIN ARGUMENTS
THAT THEY ARE MAKING--

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.067
ONE OF THE KEY ONES--
IS THAT CALIFORNIA

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:17.234
HAS MUSCULAR
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:19.334
THAT PROTECT SAME-SEX COUPLES.

00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:20.868
WE DON'T NEED MARRIAGE.

00:09:20.868 --> 00:09:23.534
MARRIAGE SHOULD JUST BE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.

00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:25.501
WELL, WE ALL KNOW--
WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE

00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.367
WITH DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS--
THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.234
IT'S NOT THE SAME VOCABULARY.

00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:32.267
THERE'S NOT
A COMMON UNDERSTANDING.

00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:34.133
COUPLES WHO ARE
IN DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:35.701
STILL FACE ENDLESS QUESTIONS

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.033
ABOUT WHO THEY REALLY ARE
TO EACH OTHER.

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:40.868
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY

00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:43.834
IN THIS STATE, AND ELIMINATING
THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:48.200
IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE SHOULD BE VOTING ON,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.534
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
VOTERS SHOULD VOTE "YES" ON.

00:09:51.534 --> 00:09:54.934
WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN THAT
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:57.367
OUR POLLING RIGHT NOW--
AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN

00:09:57.367 --> 00:10:01.767
A LOT OF PUBLIC POLLS THAT
SHOW US SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:04.234
THE "NO" VOTE SIGNIFICANTLY
AHEAD OF THE "YES" VOTE.

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:08.667
WE ARE MUCH CLOSER THAN SOME
OF THOSE POLLS SHOW.

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:11.033
AND THERE'S ALL SORTS
OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:12.801
THAT STEVE
CAN TALK ABOUT MORE,

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:14.367
BUT WHAT YOU ALL
NEED TO UNDERSTAND,

00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:16.901
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
TO UNDERSTAND IN THIS FIGHT,

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:18.934
IS THAT WHILE
IT'S IMMINENTLY WINNABLE,

00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:21.033
IT IS A DEAD HEAT.

00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:23.767
AND THE "UNDECIDED" UNIVERSE
IS MUCH SMALLER

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.434
THAN ON USUALLY ANY
OTHER QUESTION AT THIS TIME

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:29.467
AND THOSE "UNDECIDEDS"
ARE THE FOLKS

00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:32.601
WHO WE REALLY NEED TO REACH,
AND WHO NEED TO UNDERSTAND

00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:35.968
THE MESSAGE
OF WHAT THE HARM WOULD BE.

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:38.067
THIS IS NOT A NEUTRAL VOTE.

00:10:38.067 --> 00:10:40.467
A VOTE TO ELIMINATE
THE RIGHTS OF ANY CATEGORY

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:43.067
OF PEOPLE DOES HARM,
AND IT CERTAINLY DOES HARM--

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:45.334
WILL DO HARM--
TO SAME-SEX COUPLES,

00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:47.601
AND THEIR FAMILIES,
AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEM

00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:50.234
IN TERMS OF THEIR STATUS
UNDER THE LAW.

00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:54.400
SO THAT UNDECIDED POOL,
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.033
THAT IT'S A SMALL UNIVERSE
OF DONORS.

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:57.601
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:00.000
THEY'RE NOT
IN ANY ONE DEMOGRAPHIC.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.834
THEY'RE ALL UP AND DOWN
THE STATE.

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:04.968
BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE
IN A NECK-AND-NECK RACE,

00:11:04.968 --> 00:11:08.501
AND AS WE GO
INTO THE ADVERTISING SEASON,

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.267
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY,
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT

00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:15.467
THAT WE HAVE THE MUSCULAR
CAMPAIGN TO BE UP,

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.667
TO BE UP EARLY, AND TO MAKE SURE
WE CAPTURE THOSE UNDECIDEDS.

00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:21.100
SO THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.000
THERE'S NOT ANY CAMPAIGN
THAT CAN EVER WIN

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.400
IN CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE
BASED ON JUST VOLUNTEERS,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.133
OR JUST THOSE OF US

00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:31.734
WHO ARE LEADERS
ON ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE,

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:35.133
WHETHER IT'S RACIAL JUSTICE
AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,

00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:36.601
OR WHETHER IT'S
PARENTAL NOTIFICATION

00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.601
AS STEVE HAS WORKED ON BEFORE,
YOU NEED PROFESSIONALS.

00:11:39.601 --> 00:11:43.667
AND WE KNEW THAT EARLY ON,
SO WE WENT TO TWO

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:48.801
OF THE BEST OPERATIONS AND
THE BEST SHOPS IN THE COUNTRY

00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:51.334
TO BE THE PROFESSIONALS
ON OUR CAMPAIGN.

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:53.067
YOU'LL HEAR IN A MOMENT
FROM DEWEY SQUARE.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:56.934
ROSS OBVIOUSLY DID GREAT JUSTICE
TO STEVE'S CREDENTIALS

00:11:56.934 --> 00:12:01.100
AS OUR GENERAL CONSULTANT,
AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.567
WORKING HAND-IN-HAND
WITH STEVE

00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:07.000
IS OGILVY PUBLIC RELATIONS--
ALSO HAS WON NUMEROUS CAMPAIGNS

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.634
STATEWIDE IN CALIFORNIA--
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGING

00:12:10.634 --> 00:12:14.000
THAT THE VOTERS SEE--
HOW YOU WIN CAMPAIGNS

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.901
IN CALIFORNIA
IS THOSE ADS THAT PEOPLE SEE.

00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.667
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL,
BY NOVEMBER 4th,

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.667
WILL BE COMPLETELY SICK
OF THEM,

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:25.501
THAT MESSAGING FRAMES HOW
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:27.434
AND OGILVY,
THEY'RE PROS AT DOING THIS,

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:28.968
AND WE FEEL
VERY CONFIDENT WITH THEM.

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:31.400
WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED
PARTNERSHIPS

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.734
THROUGHOUT THE STATE,
AND I'M JUST GONNA GO

00:12:32.734 --> 00:12:33.868
THROUGH THESE QUICKLY.

00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:35.334
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO READ 'EM ALL

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:37.267
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST--
THERE'S SO MANY

00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:39.400
WHO ARE SUPPORTING.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.901
AND THIS BUSINESS LIST
IS ONLY PARTIAL.

00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:42.701
THERE ARE MANY MORE
ORGANIZATIONS,

00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:44.267
AND BUSINESSES,
AND CORPORATIONS

00:12:44.267 --> 00:12:46.934
THAT ARE IN PROCESS
IN MAKING DECISIONS

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.467
ABOUT SUPPORTING PROP 8.

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:50.434
WE BELIEVE THIS LIST
WILL BE VERY LONG.

00:12:50.434 --> 00:12:52.901
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.

00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.667
AND IT RUNS THE GAMUT.

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:56.901
IT'S NOT JUST
LGBT ORGANIZATIONS.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.901
IT'S EVERYONE WHO WANTS
TO LIVE IN A STATE

00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:02.067
WHERE PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY
AND EQUALLY.

00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:03.501
THOSE ARE JUST
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.

00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:06.400
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLE.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.400
THE GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T MAKE DECISIONS

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.734
ABOUT WHO PEOPLE MARRY.

00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:12.300
GOVERNMENT STAYS
OUTTA THAT BUSINESS.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.868
THE LAW TREATS
EVERYONE EQUALLY.

00:13:13.868 --> 00:13:15.400
AND SO WE HAVE SUPPORT
FROM ALL SORTS

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.367
OF CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS,
FROM MAINSTREAM ORGANIZATIONS,

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:22.701
FROM RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:25.634
IT HAS REALLY BEEN
A VERY GRATIFYING CAMPAIGN

00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:27.100
TO BE INVOLVED IN.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.734
SO FUNDRAISING--BECAUSE THIS
IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, FOLKS.

00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:32.801
AND I WISH IT WASN'T
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.667
I WISH IT WAS ABOUT,
YOU KNOW,

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.334
"LET ME JUST HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH YOU."

00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:37.667
AND "LET'S WORK IT ALL OUT."

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.367
AND "LET ME GET YOU
TO VOTE 'NO'."

00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:41.267
BUT IT'S ABOUT MONEY.

00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:43.601
AND SO FAR WE'VE RAISED
OVER $10 MILLION.

00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:49.601
THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED
FOR A GAY ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.501
NEVER BEFORE HAS THAT KIND
OF MONEY BEEN RAISED

00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.267
FROM 32,000 DONORS.

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.901
NEVER BEFORE
FROM THAT MANY DONORS.

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.667
BUT YOU CAN ALL DO THE MATH.

00:13:57.667 --> 00:13:59.367
YOU KNOW THERE ARE
A LOT MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:01.834
WHO HAVEN'T GIVEN,
THAT CAN GIVE,

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:03.367
AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GIVE.

00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:04.901
AND THAT $10 MILLION,

00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:06.534
NOT GONNA DO IT.

00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:07.734
WE KNEW
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:10.033
THIS WAS GONNA BE
A $20 MILLION CAMPAIGN.

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:12.567
AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE SEEING
FROM OUR OPPOSITION

00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:15.701
IS NOT ONLY THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A $20 MILLION CAMPAIGN,

00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.901
BUT IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
A 24 OR 25,

00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:20.100
MAYBE $26 MILLION CAMPAIGN.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.467
AND THAT'S JUST COLD,
HARD FACT.

00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:25.000
WE BELIEVE WE CAN RAISE IT.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.934
BUT IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE WHO'VE
NEVER WRITTEN A CHECK BEFORE

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:32.334
TO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
FOR US TO GET TO THAT MARK.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:34.167
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST--

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.767
AND WE'VE SEEN THIS MONEY
POURING INTO THE OTHER SIDE,

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:39.567
MAINLY FROM, SO FAR,
THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS,

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.200
THE MORMON CHURCH,
AND FOCUS ON THE FAMILY.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.767
THESE ARE VERY LOW DOLLARS.

00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:46.467
THEY'LL BE FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, TEN, MAYBE 20 TIMES THAT

00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:48.000
BY THE TIME WE'RE DONE.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.434
AND WE JUST HAVE TO MATCH THEM
DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR.

00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:53.400
THE MEDIA BUY TO DO THIS--

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.868
WE GO UP OCTOBER 6th
IN ALL THESE MAJOR MARKETS.

00:14:57.868 --> 00:14:59.901
AND WE'RE IN ALL THOSE MARKETS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.033
ALL OUR UNDECIDED VOTERS ARE.

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:07.434
I WISH THEY WERE ALL IN A SMALL
NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS GATOS.

00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:09.667
THAT WOULD MAKE IT
SO MUCH EASIER.

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:10.868
BUT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.567
THEY'RE IN EVERY AGE GROUP.

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:15.234
THEY'RE BOTH REPUBLICAN
AND THEY'RE DEMOCRAT.

00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:16.267
THEY'RE LATINO.

00:15:16.267 --> 00:15:17.567
THEY'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:18.601
THEY'RE WHITE.

00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:20.167
THEY'RE BLUE-COLLAR.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:21.200
THEY'RE WEALTHY.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.267
THEY'RE OLDER.

00:15:22.267 --> 00:15:23.734
I MEAN, THEY ARE EVERYONE.

00:15:23.734 --> 00:15:28.634
THE "UNDECIDED" UNIVERSE
IS EVERYONE THAT YOU KNOW

00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:31.601
IN YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE,
AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.167
THAT WE NEED TO REACH,
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:34.601
IN THIS CAMPAIGN,

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:38.467
TO REACH THEM ALL
AND TO MOVE THEM TO A "NO."

00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:40.634
DONALD WILDMON,
WHO IS PRESIDENT

00:15:40.634 --> 00:15:42.334
OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY
ASSOCIATION--

00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:46.200
ONE OF, I WILL SAY,
THE MOST VITRIOLICLY NASTY

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.000
ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATIONS
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.667
AND PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE
AROUND THE IDEA

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:53.100
OF LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE
MARRYING,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.801
AND THEY'RE NOT ANTI-GAY.

00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:56.400
I WANNA BE CLEAR
ABOUT THAT.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.501
PEOPLE CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE IDEA

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:02.000
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES MARRYING,
AND THAT DOES NOT

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.667
MAKE THEM ANTI-GAY.

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:07.133
DONALD WILDMON,
ANTI-GAY.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.234
AND HE HAS MADE
A LIFE'S WORK

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:13.167
OUT OF REALLY PUTTING FORWARD--
SPEWING FORWARD--

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.901
THE MOST VICIOUS,
FEAR-MONGERING

00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:18.634
ABOUT LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE,
AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS.

00:16:18.634 --> 00:16:20.100
"IF WE LOSE IN CALIFORNIA,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.434
"IF THEY DEFEAT THE MARRIAGE
AMENDMENT, WE'RE DONE.

00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:26.133
THEY'VE WON THE CULTURE WARS."

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:29.834
NOW, FOLKS, IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO HAVE THAT WIN.

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:34.901
BUT IF HE IS FRAMING IT
THAT WAY--

00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:38.167
A MAN WHO HAS MADE
A LIFE'S WORK OF DEMONIZING

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:41.200
LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE--
THEN IF YOU CARE

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.267
ABOUT ANYONE WHO IS LGBT,

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.868
IF YOU ARE LGBT YOURSELF,
IF YOU CARE

00:16:46.868 --> 00:16:48.601
ABOUT PROGRESSIVE ISSUES,

00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:51.767
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE AS WELL.

00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:55.267
BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE PASSION,
AND THAT'S HOW YOU FUND

00:16:55.267 --> 00:16:57.033
AND SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:59.133
WE'VE GOTTA HAVE
THE SAME THING.

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:02.567
SO OUR MESSAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:05.901
DON'T ELIMINATE
THE RIGHT TO MARRY FOR ANYONE.

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.167
IT'S A "VOTE NO" ON PROP 8,
AND GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW

00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:09.868
TO DO THE SAME.

00:17:09.868 --> 00:17:12.934
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT
NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS

00:17:12.934 --> 00:17:14.934
TO WHAT WE'RE FACING.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:18.434
AND PATRICK GUERRIERO
AND GILL ACTION

00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:21.834
UNDERSTANDS THOSE RAMIFICATIONS
AND HOW THEY FEED IN--

00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:25.133
AND HOW CALIFORNIA FEEDS INTO
THAT AND EFFECTS THE COUNTRY

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:28.300
PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYONE
IN THE NATION.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.367
HE IS A DEAR COLLEAGUE, AND IT
IS REALLY A PLEASURE FOR ME

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:34.200
TO ACTUALLY SEE YOU IN PERSON,
SINCE WE'VE BEEN EXCHANGING

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.968
THREE OR FOUR EMAILS
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:38.334
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS
AS WE WORK ON THE CAMPAIGN.

00:17:38.334 --> 00:17:40.534
SO I'LL LET PATRICK TALK
ABOUT THE NATIONAL PICTURE.

00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:41.934
Guerriero:
THANKS, KATE.

00:17:41.934 --> 00:17:43.501
THE, UM, YOU KNOW, KATE--

00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:49.167
[applause]

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:51.834
KATE NOT ONLY BRINGS
OBVIOUSLY GREAT INTELLECT

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:55.934
TO THIS ARGUMENT, BUT ALSO
A GREAT DEAL OF EMOTION.

00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:58.234
AND IT'S HARD NOT TO BE
EMOTIONAL AND PASSIONATE

00:17:58.234 --> 00:18:00.968
ABOUT THIS.

00:18:00.968 --> 00:18:03.701
I KNOW LAST NIGHT OVER DINNER--

00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:06.400
HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH SOME FOLKS,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.033
AND IT'S A SENSE THAT WE ARE
ON THE BALLOT.

00:18:11.033 --> 00:18:13.534
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A BALLOT--
COMING FROM CALIFORNIA,

00:18:13.534 --> 00:18:15.300
YOU'RE USED TO A LOT
OF BALLOT INITIATIVES.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.834
THIS IS A UNIQUE ONE
IN THAT HUMAN BEINGS, US,

00:18:17.834 --> 00:18:23.501
OUR FRIENDS, OUR NEIGHBORS,
OUR PARTNERS ARE ON THE BALLOT.

00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:26.534
AND OUR DIGNITY, OUR BASIC
FAIRNESS IS ON THE BALLOT.

00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:28.167
THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION
THAT COMES WITH THAT.

00:18:28.167 --> 00:18:30.000
AND FOR THOSE OF US

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.434
WHO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE
LIVING THROUGH THE KIND

00:18:32.434 --> 00:18:35.601
OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
OF OUR GENERATION,

00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:38.601
IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO HAVE
THE BLOOD PRESSURE GO UP,

00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:42.200
AND TO BE ANXIOUS,
AND TO COME AT THIS CAMPAIGN

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.634
FROM A VERY,
VERY EMOTIONAL PLACE.

00:18:44.634 --> 00:18:48.501
WHICH IS WHY I
OFTEN BECOME THE, UM,

00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:49.868
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSON
IN THE ROOM

00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:53.334
BECAUSE I COME FROM A UNIVERSE
IN RUNNING GILL ACTION--

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:56.300
WHICH IS A ORGANIZATION
THAT INVESTS

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.868
IN EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY
IN HARDCORE POLITICAL WORK

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:00.667
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:04.133
I COME FROM A LENS THAT
IS REMARKABLY DISPASSIONATE

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:08.234
SOMETIMES, UNEMOTIONAL,
DEEPLY DATA-DRIVEN,

00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:11.834
DEEPLY RESEARCH-DRIVEN,
DEEPLY POLL-DRIVEN,

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:14.634
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A WHOLE LOT OF BATTLES

00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:16.501
THAT ARE BEING FOUGHT
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:19.067
THAT MATTER
TO NOT ONLY LGBT PEOPLE,

00:19:19.067 --> 00:19:22.133
BUT PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE NATION.

00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:24.467
AND IN DOING SO,
PART OF OUR JOB

00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:28.400
IS TO GO BACK TO OUR DONOR,
AND HIS NAME IS TIM GILL,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.801
WHO'S ONE OF THE MOST
GENEROUS PHILANTHROPISTS

00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:32.467
AND POLITICAL INVESTORS
IN THE NATION,

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:35.133
AND A GROUP OF OTHER DONORS,
GENEROUS DONORS

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.634
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WE GIVE
POLITICAL COUNSEL TO,

00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:40.267
AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS
TO THEM

00:19:40.267 --> 00:19:42.934
ABOUT THE PLACES WHERE
THEIR MONEY, IF INVESTED,

00:19:42.934 --> 00:19:47.834
CAN MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE
IN THE FASTEST AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:19:47.834 --> 00:19:50.033
AND WE HAVE LITERALLY
TRAVELED THE COUNTRY.

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:51.701
WE'VE LOOKED
AT EVERY BALLOT INITIATIVE.

00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:53.400
WE'VE LOOKED
AT EVERY STATE RACE.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.234
WE'VE LOOKED
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS

00:19:55.234 --> 00:19:58.100
THAT HAPPEN IN AN ELECTION YEAR,
AND WE'VE DECIDED

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.934
REALLY RECENTLY, TO BE HONEST,

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:02.701
THAT THIS IS SINGULARLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.234
HAPPENING IN NOVEMBER
OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL ELECTION.

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:08.634
WE BELIEVE THIS
HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS,

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:12.501
NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND
EVERY SINGLE LGBT FAMILY HERE,

00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:15.567
BUT SOMETHING YOU
MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF IS THAT

00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:18.267
NOT ONLY WOULD THIS BE
THE FIRST STATE EVER

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.601
TO HAVE THE PUBLIC AFFIRM
THE BASIC FAIRNESS

00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:24.767
FOR ALL FAMILIES,
BUT THERE ARE

00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:26.767
A NUMBER OF STATES THAT
LITERALLY ARE WAITING

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.300
AND WATCHING TO SEE

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.834
WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS STATE.

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:31.467
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A FEW EXAMPLES.

00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:34.000
IN NEW YORK,
THE STATE LEGISLATURE

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.767
AND THE GOVERNOR ARE VERY CLOSE
TO REACHING A POINT

00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:39.834
WHERE THEY COULD PASS
MARRIAGE EQUALITY

00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:41.834
AND HAVE THE GOVERNOR
SIGN IT NEXT YEAR.

00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:43.234
THEY'RE WATCHING
AND WAITING TO SEE

00:20:43.234 --> 00:20:45.067
WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:20:45.067 --> 00:20:47.033
IN NEW JERSEY,
WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE

00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:50.133
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF PASSING
MARRIAGE EQUALITY,

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:53.601
AND THE GOVERNOR IS WATCHING
WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA

00:20:53.601 --> 00:20:57.634
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS WILL
PASS THE MUSTER OF THE PUBLIC.

00:20:57.634 --> 00:21:01.400
EVEN IN PLACES LIKE IOWA,
THE COURT IS ABOUT TO RULE

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.501
OVER THE NEXT 8-12 MONTHS
IN WHAT COULD BE

00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:07.033
A HISTORIC DECISION
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.501
ABOUT WHETHER
TO AFFIRM THE RIGHTS

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:13.000
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
IN IOWA TO MARRY.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.901
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE
THAT COURT,

00:21:14.901 --> 00:21:17.467
AND THAT LEGISLATURE,
AND THE PUBLIC IN IOWA

00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:20.767
IS TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:22.000
SO WE HAVE NEVER SEEN

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.868
IN ANY STATE BEFORE
A SINGLE BALLOT INITIATIVE

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:30.968
THAT WOULD IMPACT MORE PEOPLE
AND IMPACT MORE STATES.

00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:33.767
AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY TOLD
A NUMBER OF OUR INVESTORS

00:21:33.767 --> 00:21:36.100
AND DONORS THAT WE TALKED TO
THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.200
THIS WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER WE'RE ABLE

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.434
TO REALIZE FULL EQUALITY FOR
LGBT FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:46.601
OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS,
OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TAKE

00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:48.567
TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS.

00:21:48.567 --> 00:21:51.334
15 YEARS VERSUS 50 YEARS.

00:21:51.334 --> 00:21:55.100
THIS RACE ACTUALLY HAS
THAT TYPE OF EXPONENTIAL EFFECT

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.100
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.934
AND WHEN YOU ADD
TO THAT THAT OUR ENEMIES

00:21:58.934 --> 00:22:02.167
ARE OFTEN THE ENEMIES
OF THE PRO-CHOICE MOVEMENT,

00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:05.434
OFTEN THE ENEMIES
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT--

00:22:05.434 --> 00:22:07.834
WHEN YOU HEAR DON WILDMON
SAYING THIS IS REALLY

00:22:07.834 --> 00:22:09.701
GROUND ZERO
FOR THE CULTURE WAR,

00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.667
THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS AT STAKE

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:14.267
IN NOVEMBER
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:16.367
AND SO WE'VE DETERMINED THIS
TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT RACE

00:22:16.367 --> 00:22:19.300
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.000
THAT ALONE THOUGH WOULD NOT LEAD
US TO TELL PEOPLE TO INVEST.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.300
THERE ARE A LOT
OF REALLY IMPORTANT RACES

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.267
THAT DON'T MEET
THE CRITERIA TO WIN.

00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:31.400
AND SO WE DID A FULL ANALYSIS
OF THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.334
THE FIRST QUESTION IS
CAN YOU WIN BASED ON THE DATA

00:22:34.334 --> 00:22:36.501
YOU HAVE AROUND POLLING
AND THE RESEARCH YOU HAVE?

00:22:36.501 --> 00:22:40.033
AND THE ANSWER
IS UNEQUIVOCALLY YES.

00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:42.934
THE POLLING SHOWS, DEPENDING
ON WHOSE POLL YOU BELIEVE,

00:22:42.934 --> 00:22:46.267
THAT WE'RE WITHIN FIVE
TO TEN POINTS UP OR DOWN

00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:48.267
DEPENDING ON WHAT
DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS.

00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:49.567
THE CLIMATE.

00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:52.000
AND SO THIS IS A--
AND I THINK, KATE,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.667
YOU'VE TERMED IT WELL--
A DEAD HEAT.

00:22:54.667 --> 00:22:57.501
A COMPLETE DEAD HEAT
THAT COULD EITHER WIN

00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:00.767
BY A COUPLE POINTS
OR LOSE BY A COUPLE POINTS.

00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:03.200
THE SECOND QUESTION
IS DOES THIS STATE

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.968
AND ITS GENEROUS CITIZENS
HAVE THE CAPACITY

00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:09.367
TO RAISE THE MONEY NECESSARY
TO WAGE A FULL-FLEDGED CAMPAIGN?

00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:11.701
IN A LOT OF STATES
THE ANSWER IS "NO."

00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:14.400
IN THIS STATE
THE ANSWER IS "YES,"

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.701
EXCEPT THAT THERE IS
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF URGENCY

00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:20.334
BECAUSE, LITERALLY,
TV TIME NEEDS TO BE PURCHASED

00:23:20.334 --> 00:23:22.868
WITHIN THE NEXT
TWO TO THREE WEEKS.

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:25.868
AND I WILL BE SO RAW
AS TO SAY THIS.

00:23:25.868 --> 00:23:28.534
FROM THE NUMBERS
WE HAVE SEEN AND ANALYZED,

00:23:28.534 --> 00:23:34.033
IF OUR OPPONENTS OUT-RAISE US,
WE WILL LOSE.

00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:36.667
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO SAY.

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:38.267
BUT WE REALLY BELIEVE
THAT'S THE CASE,

00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:40.934
AND THAT IS A LEVEL
OF URGENCY AROUND MAKING SURE

00:23:40.934 --> 00:23:43.167
WE CAN FUND
A FULL-FLEDGED CAMPAIGN.

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:44.334
THE NEXT QUESTION WE ASKED

00:23:44.334 --> 00:23:47.801
OURSELVES IS THAT
CAN THE LGBT MOVEMENT,

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:51.801
THAT HAS SUCH TREMENDOUS HEROES,
MOVE FROM JUST BEING

00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:57.801
A PROGRESSIVE ADVOCACY MOVEMENT
TO ONE THAT ACTUALLY EMPOWERS

00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:59.634
SMART, STRATEGIC,
POLITICAL THINKERS

00:23:59.634 --> 00:24:03.300
TO MAKE HARDCORE POLITICAL
CHOICES TO WIN AN ELECTION?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.667
AND WE'RE CONVINCED
AFTER TAKING A REAL CLOSE LOOK

00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:07.434
AT THIS CAMPAIGN
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS

00:24:07.434 --> 00:24:10.067
THAT THEY'VE HIRED
SOME REALLY SMART PEOPLE.

00:24:10.067 --> 00:24:13.501
THE BEST AVAILABLE TO RUN
THE SMARTEST CAMPAIGN,

00:24:13.501 --> 00:24:16.968
AND THAT THE LGBT ORGANIZATIONS
ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY THERE

00:24:16.968 --> 00:24:20.067
IN TERMS OF PUTTING EGO
AND ORGANIZATION ASIDE,

00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:22.868
AND MICROMANAGEMENT ASIDE, AND
ALLOWING THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

00:24:22.868 --> 00:24:26.601
TO BE EMPOWERED TO MAKE
THE TOUGH CHOICES THAT WILL

00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:29.067
TAKE PLACE BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY.

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:32.267
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE
WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR IS TRENDS.

00:24:32.267 --> 00:24:34.634
WHAT WE KNOW IS
THE PUBLIC WITNESSED

00:24:34.634 --> 00:24:39.367
A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE
GETTING MARRIED ONLY WEEKS AGO

00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:42.667
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN THIS STATE.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:47.000
AND THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD BY
THE FAR-RIGHT THAT THE LOCUSTS

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.400
AND PLAGUE WOULD BE HITTING
CALIFORNIA WITHIN DAYS.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.968
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE DONE OKAY
SINCE THOSE MARRIAGES.

00:24:51.968 --> 00:24:54.200
I DON'T THINK
ANY HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGES

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.801
HAVE BEEN THREATENED.

00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:57.868
SO ALL THE DOOM AND GLOOM
THAT WE ALSO HEARD

00:24:57.868 --> 00:24:59.834
IN MASSACHUSETTS,
AND WE ALSO HEARD

00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:02.100
THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA,
DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.434
AND SO THERE SEEMS TO BE
THIS UNDERLYING BELIEF

00:25:05.434 --> 00:25:08.367
THAT THERE IS GOOD ENERGY,
THERE IS A GOOD FEELING HERE,

00:25:08.367 --> 00:25:11.467
BUT IT'S GONNA BE DAMN CLOSE
HOWEVER WE LOOK AT IT.

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:12.901
THE GOOD NEWS,

00:25:12.901 --> 00:25:15.601
UNDER A FAIRLY UNEMOTIONAL,
DATA-DRIVEN,

00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:18.434
POLL-DRIVEN ANALYSIS
OF THE STATUS OF THIS CAMPAIGN,

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:23.367
WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO WIN,
IF WE CAN RAISE THE MONEY

00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:25.534
AND DELIVER THE MESSAGE
INTO THE LIVING ROOMS

00:25:25.534 --> 00:25:27.067
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE.

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:28.934
AND ONE OF THE PERSONS
BEST CAPABLE OF DOING THAT

00:25:28.934 --> 00:25:30.367
IS STEVE SMITH.

00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:34.901
HE'S A FAIRLY MODEST--
AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME.

00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:37.567
BUT STEVE HAS BEEN
DOING BALLOT INITIATIVES

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:38.968
FOR THREE DECADES.

00:25:38.968 --> 00:25:40.601
I KIDDED EARLIER
THAT YOU STARTED

00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:41.734
WHEN YOU WERE FIVE,
I GUESS.

00:25:41.734 --> 00:25:43.400
FOR THREE DECADES,
HE'S BEEN DOING

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.701
BALLOT INITIATIVES.

00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:47.734
HE'S DONE OVER A DOZEN "NO ON"

00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:49.400
CERTAIN BALLOT INITIATIVE
CAMPAIGNS, AND HE'S WON

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.200
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.601
AND SO WE'VE PUT THE,
KIND OF, THE TRUST

00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:56.601
AND THE CONFIDENCE INTO ONE
OF THE BEST PEOPLE POSSIBLE

00:25:56.601 --> 00:25:57.901
TO MAKE SURE WE CAN WIN.

00:25:57.901 --> 00:25:59.200
STEVE.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.501
Smith: HOWDY.

00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:01.868
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO KNOW

00:26:01.868 --> 00:26:03.601
THAT A REPUBLICAN
FROM MASSACHUSETTS

00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:05.601
AND A DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA
CAN HANG OUT.

00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:06.968
GLAD YOU'RE ON MY LEFT.

00:26:06.968 --> 00:26:09.634
YEAH, WELL, I'LL ALWAYS BE
ON YOUR LEFT, BROTHER.

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:11.267
[chuckling]

00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:13.167
LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE,

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:14.334
AND THEN WHAT
WE GOTTA GET DONE

00:26:14.334 --> 00:26:16.901
IN THE NEXT VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:19.968
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REFERENCES
HERE ABOUT 40/40/20.

00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:21.200
THAT REALLY IS WHERE IT IS.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.868
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN POLLS
DONE IN THE LAST--

00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:26.601
ABOUT NINE OR TEN WEEKS.

00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:28.000
SOME OF THOSE ARE PUBLIC.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.100
SOME OF THOSE ARE PRIVATE.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.400
EVERY ONE OF THEM
HAS COME BACK.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.067
THEY HAD
DIFFERENT RESULTS,

00:26:33.067 --> 00:26:36.067
BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS COME
BACK WITHIN THAT 40/40 MARGIN.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:37.334
SOMETIMES WE'RE AHEAD.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:38.567
SOMETIMES THEY'RE AHEAD.

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:40.267
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS
THE SAME 20%

00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:42.901
SWIMMING AROUND OUT THERE.

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:46.467
THAT'S THE 20%
THAT WE NEED TO TALK TO,

00:26:46.467 --> 00:26:49.200
THAT WE NEED TO CONVINCE
IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.901
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THEM?

00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:53.767
WE ARE NOW--I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF PREPARATION.

00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:56.300
KATE'S BEEN GETTING READY
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN, WHAT,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.300
THREE OR FOUR YEARS?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.467
man: ALL HER LIFE?

00:26:58.467 --> 00:26:59.734
Smith: YEAH.

00:26:59.734 --> 00:27:01.133
THAT'S A DIFFERENT WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:03.501
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:05.067
BUT WE'RE NOW DOWN TO IT.

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:07.501
27 DAYS FROM NOW,
THOSE OF YOU

00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:09.634
WHO ARE ABSENTEE VOTERS
WILL GO HOME

00:27:09.634 --> 00:27:12.100
TO A BALLOT IN YOUR MAILBOX.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.868
30 DAYS LATER,
THE ELECTION HAPPENS.

00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:16.367
WE'RE THERE.

00:27:16.367 --> 00:27:18.667
NOW THE THING
THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO

00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:21.033
IS TALK TO VOTERS.

00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:23.634
AND IN THIS ELECTION
IN CALIFORNIA,

00:27:23.634 --> 00:27:27.734
THERE WILL BE 12.5,
12.6 MILLION VOTERS.

00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:30.834
MORE VOTERS THAN HAVE
EVER CAST A BALLOT

00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:33.934
IN ANY SINGLE STATE
IN ANY ELECTION IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:27:33.934 --> 00:27:35.267
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
BECAUSE THE TR--

00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:36.467
I MEAN, LOOK,
LET'S FACE IT.

00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:38.501
THE PRESIDENTIAL
IS ENERGIZING, FOLKS.

00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:40.100
THERE'S GONNA BE
A HUGE TURNOUT.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.534
WE HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT.

00:27:42.534 --> 00:27:46.567
WE HAVE TO TALK
TO THOSE 20% OF THE VOTERS

00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:49.534
AND GET THEM
TO COME OUR WAY.

00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:52.033
I'VE TOLD THIS CLIENT THIS
SEVERAL TIMES.

00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:55.000
WHEN I MANAGED
THE "NO ON PROP 85" CAMPAIGN

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.167
FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD
TWO YEARS AGO,

00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:00.067
LITERALLY, THE FIRST
CAMPAIGN POLL THAT SAID

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:03.567
THAT WE WERE AHEAD, I READ
AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE

00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:04.968
ON ELECTION DAY.

00:28:04.968 --> 00:28:07.968
WE HAD BEEN BEHIND THE ENTIRE
TIME IN CLOSING THE GAP.

00:28:07.968 --> 00:28:10.067
THIS IS NOT THAT KIND
OF SITUATION.

00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:11.734
I'VE SEEN POLLS
SAYING WE'RE AHEAD.

00:28:11.734 --> 00:28:13.901
I'VE SEEN POLLS SAYING
WE'RE SLIGHTLY BEHIND.

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:16.667
BUT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE WIRE,

00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:18.467
AND THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA WIN AGAIN

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:19.901
IS TO TALK TO THOSE VOTERS.

00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:21.801
HOW DO YOU TALK
TO VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA?

00:28:21.801 --> 00:28:23.934
IT'S CALLED TELEVISION
AND RADIO.

00:28:23.934 --> 00:28:25.634
'CAUSE THERE'S
TOO DAMN MANY OF US

00:28:25.634 --> 00:28:27.534
TO DO IT ANY OTHER WAY,
FRANKLY.

00:28:27.534 --> 00:28:28.767
THIS JUST
IS NOT NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:30.501
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:34.501
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED
TO GO UP ON THE TELEVISION,

00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:37.501
WE NEED TO BUY MORE ADVERTISING
THAN THEY'RE BUYING,

00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:39.868
AND WE NEED TO DELIVER
OUR MESSAGE.

00:28:39.868 --> 00:28:42.400
KATE TALKED
ABOUT TALKING TO PEOPLE.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.133
YOU CANNOT ELIMINATE
THE RIGHT TO MARRY.

00:28:46.133 --> 00:28:48.167
YOU HAVE TO ALLOW
COMMITTED COUPLES

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:49.601
WHO ARE IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER

00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:51.801
TO GO OUT AND GET MARRIED.

00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:53.033
WE'RE THERE NOW.

00:28:53.033 --> 00:28:55.968
WE'RE THERE
AFTER A HUGE FIGHT.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.067
WE NOW NEED TO STAY THERE.

00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:00.901
AND IN CALIFORNIA,
THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS IS

00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:03.734
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED
IN SO MANY FORUMS

00:29:03.734 --> 00:29:07.667
THAT IF WE WIN THIS,
IT'S DONE.

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:11.968
REMEMBER, THE LEGISLATURE'S
PASSED IT TWICE.

00:29:11.968 --> 00:29:15.234
THE GOVERNOR NOW SUPPORTS
OUR SIDE OF THE ISSUE.

00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:18.300
THE COURT HAS NOW RULED,
THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER BODY

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.501
OUT THERE
LEFT TO DECIDE.

00:29:20.501 --> 00:29:22.367
IT'S CALLED THE VOTERS.

00:29:22.367 --> 00:29:27.133
SO IF THE VOTERS
SAY NO ON 8,

00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:28.267
WE'RE DONE.

00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.801
THERE IS NO MORE PLACE
FOR THE OTHER SIDE

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.234
TO PLAY THEIR GAMES.

00:29:32.234 --> 00:29:34.100
THAT MEANS WE NEED
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.200
ARE WE GONNA GET 1/4 MILLION,
1/2 MILLION

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.868
VOLUNTEER PHONE CALLS MADE?

00:29:37.868 --> 00:29:39.033
YES.

00:29:39.033 --> 00:29:41.567
ARE WE GONNA DO MAIL
AND PHONE TO PROBABLY

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:43.334
A MILLION AND A HALF,
2 MILLION VOTERS?

00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:44.400
YES.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.968
BUT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA

00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:51.400
REACH OUT AND TOUCH 12.4,
12.5 MILLION VOTERS

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.467
IS ON THE TELEVISION,
INTO FOLKS' LIVING ROOMS,

00:29:53.467 --> 00:29:55.968
TO SOME DEGREE
ON THE INTERNET.

00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:57.968
THAT'S IT.

00:29:57.968 --> 00:29:59.501
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE GET TO THOSE FOLKS.

00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.200
SO THAT'S HOW
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.000
THIS IS CALIFORNIA.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.434
WE GOTTA WIN THIS FIGHT.

00:30:04.434 --> 00:30:06.000
WE GOTTA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.601
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

00:30:08.601 --> 00:30:14.601
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING
IN THE LAST 57 DAYS--

00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:17.167
AND THAT'S THE WAY
I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THAT 20%.

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:19.434
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT
THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION.

00:30:19.434 --> 00:30:22.200
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT
GAY MARRIAGE.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.834
IN FACT, MOST OF THAT UNDECIDED
PROBABLY DON'T.

00:30:24.834 --> 00:30:27.133
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
OPPOSE IT.

00:30:27.133 --> 00:30:28.968
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.

00:30:28.968 --> 00:30:31.400
BUT WHAT THEY NEED
TO BE--UNDERSTAND IS

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.467
THEY DON'T NEED
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:36.667
THEY JUST NEED TO SAY,
"I DON'T NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:39.767
"THOSE PEOPLE--
WE HAVE A RIGHT.

00:30:39.767 --> 00:30:43.667
EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO MARRY
THE PERSON THEY LOVE."

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:44.968
THAT SIMPLE.

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.334
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE
TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:30:46.334 --> 00:30:48.467
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA
COMMUNICATE TO THEM.

00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:50.834
WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE
ON THEIR LANGUAGE--

00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:54.100
WITH THEIR LANGUAGE.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.167
STARTING FROM WHERE
THEY COME FROM

00:30:56.167 --> 00:30:58.000
AND BRING 'EM HOME
TO A "NO" VOTE.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.567
ABSOLUTELY DOABLE.

00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:01.334
WE'RE GONNA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION.

00:31:01.334 --> 00:31:03.100
WE'RE GONNA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.801
THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER.

00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:07.300
THE REAL QUESTION IS
ARE WE GONNA GET TO GO UP

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.934
ON THE TELEVISION EARLIER?

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:13.100
BECAUSE WHOEVER GETS UP
ON THE TELEVISION FIRST

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.234
WILL PROBABLY
WIN THIS CAMPAIGN.

00:31:16.234 --> 00:31:18.300
SOME FUNNY THINGS I--

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.501
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED
SEVERAL TIMES HERE.

00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:20.868
I'VE DONE MORE CAMPAIGNS THAN,
FRANKLY,

00:31:20.868 --> 00:31:22.267
I WANNA THINK ABOUT.

00:31:22.267 --> 00:31:24.934
YES, I AM AS OLD AS I LOOK.

00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:27.100
[chuckling]

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.534
MOST OF IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT
OF ME IN CAMPAIGNS.

00:31:29.534 --> 00:31:31.601
ALMOST EVERY TIME
ONE SIDE

00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:34.234
OR THE OTHER GETS UP--
IT CAN ONLY BE A MATTER

00:31:34.234 --> 00:31:35.634
OF A FEW DAYS,
IT COULD BE A WEEK--

00:31:35.634 --> 00:31:38.534
AND THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT OUT
AN AD THAT DEFINES THE RACE,

00:31:38.534 --> 00:31:39.767
GUESS WHAT?

00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:42.400
IF THEY GO UP,
GOD KNOWS HOW

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.901
THEY'LL DEFINE
THE RACE ACTUALLY.

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:45.934
LATELY WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT BIGAMY.

00:31:45.934 --> 00:31:47.801
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT,
"ARE WE GOING TO TEACH

00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:49.834
OUR KIDS IN KINDERGARTEN?"

00:31:49.834 --> 00:31:51.834
WE'VE HEARD,
"OH, DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP.

00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:53.667
YOU DON'T NEED THIS."

00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:55.801
WE'VE HEARD A BUNCH OF STUFF
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:58.133
WITH, "SHOULD PEOPLE
BE ALLOWED TO MARRY

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:01.167
THE PERSON THEY LOVE?"

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:04.200
IF WE GO UP,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.367
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT,
"SHOULD PEOPLE BE ALLOWED

00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:09.467
TO MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE?"

00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:12.934
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT,
"DON'T ELIMINATE THOSE PEOPLE'S

00:32:12.934 --> 00:32:14.868
"RIGHTS TO GET MARRIED.

00:32:14.868 --> 00:32:16.701
DON'T TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY."

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.400
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.100
THAT IS WHAT'S
ON THE BALLOT.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.868
THAT'S THE DECISION.

00:32:23.868 --> 00:32:25.267
THE OTHER SIDE GETS UP FIRST
AND MAKES THIS ABOUT

00:32:25.267 --> 00:32:27.334
ALL SORTS OF OTHER STUFF?

00:32:27.334 --> 00:32:30.067
I'M GONNA END UP, AND THE WHOLE
COALITION IS GONNA END UP,

00:32:30.067 --> 00:32:32.300
SPENDING TWO OR THREE WEEKS
TRYING TO STRAIGHTEN OUT

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.400
IN PEOPLE'S HEADS
WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.934
WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO DO THAT.

00:32:35.934 --> 00:32:38.801
WE NEED TO JUST GO
AND MAKE OUR CASE,

00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:41.100
TELL 'EM WHAT IT'S ABOUT,
AND THEN--

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.667
THIS IS CALIFORNIA.

00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:44.434
PEOPLE DO BELIEVE IN FREEDOM.

00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:46.400
THEY DO BELIEVE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.033
AND WE'LL WIN THIS RACE.

00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:51.601
BUT WE ONLY DO IT
IF WE GET UP THERE FIRST

00:32:51.601 --> 00:32:52.834
AND TELL 'EM, YOU KNOW,
"THIS IS IT.

00:32:52.834 --> 00:32:54.267
"DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE CRAP,
FRANKLY,

00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:55.567
COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE."

00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:56.734
THANK YOU.

00:32:56.734 --> 00:32:59.300
MORE THAN WILLING
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.267
LaJeunesse: PLEASE JOIN ME
IN THANKING OUR PANELISTS.

00:33:01.267 --> 00:33:04.200
[applause]

00:33:06.968 --> 00:33:09.367
ALL RIGHT,
SO THE MICS ARE OPEN.

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:11.734
IF ANY OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
PLEASE JUST GO

00:33:11.734 --> 00:33:14.100
TO ONE OF THE MICS AND THEN
FOR THE SATELLITE OFFICES

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.434
WHO ARE JOINING US BY V.C.,
WE'LL ALSO

00:33:17.434 --> 00:33:18.467
BE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:33:18.467 --> 00:33:19.567
WE'LL JUST TAKE A COUPLE

00:33:19.567 --> 00:33:21.267
FROM THE LIVE AUDIENCE
FIRST.

00:33:21.267 --> 00:33:24.734
man: HI. I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR ALL BEING HERE.

00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:26.133
I'VE MET SEVERAL
OF YOU BEFORE.

00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:29.300
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
INCREDIBLE WORK.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.367
I AM GETTING MARRIED
TO MY SAME-SEX PARTNER

00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:35.901
IN A WEEK AND HALF, AND I WOULD
RATHER NOT HAVE TO DEAL

00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:38.834
WITH LEGAL CONFUSIONS
COME POST-NOVEMBER.

00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:41.000
AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME AFTER 25 YEARS

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.467
OF BEING WITH THIS MAN,
IS THAT NOBODY ELSE

00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:45.634
HAS TO WAIT 25 YEARS
BEFORE THEIR STATE

00:33:45.634 --> 00:33:48.467
CATCHES UP WITH THEM.

00:33:48.467 --> 00:33:50.634
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS,
IF I MAY.

00:33:50.634 --> 00:33:53.434
ONE IS...

00:33:53.434 --> 00:33:57.601
WHEN TALKING TO CORPORATIONS,
HOW DO YOU MAKE

00:33:57.601 --> 00:34:00.000
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAS
TO BE A BUSINESS CASE

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.067
THAT THEY SHOULD
OPPOSE PROPOSITION 8

00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:09.434
AND THAT THEY SHOULD LAY OUT
CASH TO DO IT?

00:34:09.434 --> 00:34:11.267
Kendell: WELL, I THINK
ONE THING THAT'S GOOD

00:34:11.267 --> 00:34:14.634
ABOUT BEING IN A STATE
LIKE CALIFORNIA

00:34:14.634 --> 00:34:17.501
IS THAT THE FIRST PART OF THAT
IS A PRETTY EASY CASE TO MAKE.

00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:22.601
WE LIVE IN A STATE WHERE--
IN A COUNTRY, ACTUALLY--

00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:25.234
WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY
OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:27.634
HAVE NON-DISCRIMINATION
POLICIES,

00:34:27.634 --> 00:34:30.701
HAVE LGBT EMPLOYEE GROUPS
AND BENNET HEADS THE ONE

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:31.834
HERE AT GOOGLE.

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.534
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
BENNET.

00:34:33.534 --> 00:34:36.267
AND IT'S JUST A PART
OF THE WORKFORCE,

00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:38.834
AND IT'S A PART OF RETAINING
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST.

00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:40.634
NOT SAYING THAT LESBIAN
AND GAY PEOPLE

00:34:40.634 --> 00:34:44.467
ARE SMARTER THAN MOST PEOPLE,
BUT WE'RE A PART OF THE POOL

00:34:44.467 --> 00:34:47.334
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT
TO RETAIN.

00:34:47.334 --> 00:34:52.300
AND IT'S A PART OF GOOD BUSINESS
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU--

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.801
THERE'S NO BARRIER
TO THE BEST EMPLOYEE

00:34:55.801 --> 00:34:57.901
WANTING TO COME WORK FOR YOU.

00:34:57.901 --> 00:35:00.801
SO THAT'S A PRETTY EASY CASE
TO MAKE IN CALIFORNIA,

00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:02.400
AND BUSINESSES GET THAT.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.300
THE SECOND PIECE
IS A LITTLE BIT HARDER,

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.968
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE FINDING.

00:35:05.968 --> 00:35:09.467
AND WITH PG&amp;E,
AND LEVI AND STRAUSS COMPANY,

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:14.467
AND AT&amp;T SUPPORTING "NO"
ON PROP 8 AND GIVING MONEY,

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.534
WHAT THEY'RE RECOGNIZING
IS WE'RE PAST THE TIME

00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:20.534
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE
IT'S ENOUGH TO SAY--

00:35:20.534 --> 00:35:22.667
TO RETAIN THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST,

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:24.667
WE HAVE NON-DISCRIMINATION
POLICIES.

00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:28.567
WE HAVE A LGBT GROUP.

00:35:28.567 --> 00:35:31.334
EVERYONE IS UNDERSTANDING
THIS IS THE FIGHT

00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:35.367
THAT DEFINES EXACTLY WHAT KIND
OF WORKPLACE YOU ARE

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:37.300
AND WHAT
THE BUSINESS COMMITMENT IS.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.367
IT'S NOT ABOUT WORDS
ON A PAPER.

00:35:39.367 --> 00:35:41.400
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.901
OF ANY ONE PARTICULAR
ORGANIZATION.

00:35:43.901 --> 00:35:47.734
IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE
THAT PROP 8 IS DEFEATED.

00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:50.400
AND WE FOUND AS PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LOTS

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.267
OF DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS
IN THE SILICON VALLEY

00:35:52.267 --> 00:35:54.701
AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS COUNSEL,
AND IF ANY OF YOU

00:35:54.701 --> 00:35:57.801
HAVE CONNECTIONS
TO CORPORATIONS--

00:35:57.801 --> 00:36:00.133
GOOGLE, OBVIOUSLY,
WOULD BE NUMBER ONE ON THAT,

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:02.901
BUT OTHERS AS WELL,
YOU SHOULD TALK TO ME,

00:36:02.901 --> 00:36:04.801
AND I CAN PUT YOU IN TOUCH
WITH THE BUSINESS COUNSEL

00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:06.100
BECAUSE WE FOUND

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.133
THAT THAT MESSAGE WORKS,
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.834
IS THE OTHER
NUMBER ONE THING

00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:13.467
THAT GETS MONEY
FROM CORPORATIONS?

00:36:13.467 --> 00:36:18.334
MONEY THAT COMES
FROM THEIR COMPETITORS.

00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:24.334
SO IF GOOGLE JUMPS FIRST
PUBLICLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY,

00:36:24.334 --> 00:36:27.467
YOU GET THE HIT OF BEING FIRST,
AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE

00:36:27.467 --> 00:36:29.167
WILL COME ALONG.

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.767
AND IF GOOGLE DOESN'T GO FIRST,
THAT'S FINE.

00:36:30.767 --> 00:36:35.200
SOMEBODY'S GOING FIRST, AND
THAT'S IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.267
BUT BOTH THOSE THINGS WE FIND
ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE.

00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:39.968
man: OKAY,
JUST AS A MINOR CORRECTION,

00:36:39.968 --> 00:36:43.901
I WOULD NEVER SAY I WAS HEAD
OF THE GAYGLERS GROUP.

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:46.133
WE HAVE A WHOLE STEERING
COMMITTEE AND EVERYTHING.

00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:48.133
I'M THE "COORDINATOR,"
WHICH SOUNDS VERY GAY,

00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:50.968
AND RIGHTLY SO, AND
IT'S A MUCH WEAKER POSITION,

00:36:50.968 --> 00:36:52.400
BELIEVE ME.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.434
Kendell: WELL, THEY CALL ME
THE HEAD LESBIAN, SO I JUST--

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:55.801
man: YEAH, OKAY.

00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:58.400
THE OTHER QUESTION
AND THIS IS THE THING

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.868
THAT FRUSTRATES
ME THE MOST

00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:03.100
AND THAT I'M
MOST SCARED OF, REALLY--

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.868
IS THAT THE ISSUE IS FRAMED,
AND NOT ONLY

00:37:05.868 --> 00:37:10.901
JUST BY OUR OPPONENTS,
AS GAYS VERSUS CHRISTIANS,

00:37:10.901 --> 00:37:14.167
GAYS VERSUS PEOPLE OF FAITH,
GAYS VERSUS FAMILIES.

00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:16.367
AND EVEN THE NEWSPAPERS
WILL CALL

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:18.067
DONALD WILDMON'S ORGANIZATION--

00:37:18.067 --> 00:37:19.701
I MEAN, IT'S GOT A NAME,

00:37:19.701 --> 00:37:21.133
AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION.

00:37:21.133 --> 00:37:22.901
THEY CAN USE THE NAME AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED.

00:37:22.901 --> 00:37:25.901
BUT THEY'LL ALSO CALL IT
A FAMILY ORGANIZATION.

00:37:25.901 --> 00:37:27.567
A CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION.

00:37:27.567 --> 00:37:29.968
AND I KNOW ENOUGH FAMILIES
AND ENOUGH CHRISTIANS

00:37:29.968 --> 00:37:32.834
TO KNOW THAT WHAT THAT IS IS
REALLY AN ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATION

00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:34.968
WITH A FUNNY NAME.

00:37:34.968 --> 00:37:40.634
UM, HOW--AND THAT FRAMING
SEEMS SO EMBEDDED

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:44.434
IN ALL CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT THIS.

00:37:44.434 --> 00:37:48.701
THE WAY THE TELEVISION SHOWS
WILL INTRODUCE

00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:52.868
ONE GAY PERSON
AND ONE CHRISTIAN.

00:37:52.868 --> 00:37:58.033
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
TO SHIFT THAT?

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:00.234
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S
THE WAY WE LOSE.

00:38:00.234 --> 00:38:01.834
Kendell: YEAH,
GOOD POINT.

00:38:01.834 --> 00:38:03.667
Guerriero: A COUPLE OF POINTS,
AND I'LL LET STEVE

00:38:03.667 --> 00:38:06.767
GET TO THE CORE OF THE MESSAGING
PIECE TO IT, IS ONE,

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:08.567
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA CHANGE

00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:10.367
SOME OF THAT FRAMEWORK
WITHIN 60 DAYS,

00:38:10.367 --> 00:38:12.200
WHICH IS A TOUGH THING
TO SEE.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.167
BUT WE CAN CHANGE
THE FRAMEWORK BY WHICH PEOPLE

00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:17.300
LOOK AT CIVIL MARRIAGE
LICENSES.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.734
AND SO, YES, WE CAN PUSH TO HAVE
REALLY SMART SPOKESPERSONS

00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.968
WHO CAN SPEAK
WITH A LEVEL OF RELIGIOSITY

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.601
ON THE NEWS AND IN NEWSPAPERS,
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE.

00:38:26.601 --> 00:38:29.300
BUT WE ALSO AREN'T GONNA CHANGE
THIS GREATER FRAMEWORK

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.267
ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA,
AND NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT,

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:34.234
AS I THINK WAS
REALLY SMARTLY DONE

00:38:34.234 --> 00:38:36.100
ON THE DAY
OF THE FIRST MARRIAGES,

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.667
THAT THERE WAS
A WONDERFUL CELEBRATION,

00:38:38.667 --> 00:38:41.033
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT IT WAS CLEARLY

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:42.901
CIVIL MARRIAGE LICENSES.

00:38:42.901 --> 00:38:45.701
PEOPLE WALKING INTO CITY HALLS
AND TOWN HALLS

00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.200
GETTING A PIECE OF PAPER
AND RECOGNIZING THEIR

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.133
SOMETIMES HALF
A CENTURY RELATIONSHIP.

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:54.467
AND SO IT DIFFUSES
THAT SWING-VOTER'S SENSE OF,

00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:57.133
"IS THIS ABOUT
MY OWN MARRIAGE OR NOT?"

00:38:57.133 --> 00:39:00.400
BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH
A TIGHT TIMELINE.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.634
WHAT WE'VE FOUND JUST
IN ONE OTHER STATE

00:39:02.634 --> 00:39:04.901
WHERE WE'VE HAD
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:07.267
IS THAT WHEN THE PUBLIC SAW
INDIVIDUALS ASKING

00:39:07.267 --> 00:39:09.567
FOR A PIECE OF PAPER,
A LICENSE TO RECOGNIZE

00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:11.501
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IN MASSACHUSETTS,

00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:16.000
THAT SWING VOTER ENDED UP MOVING
JUST SLIGHTLY TO OUR SIDE,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.033
WHICH IS WHY STEVE'S POINT
ABOUT FRAMING THIS ARGUMENT

00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:19.501
REALLY FAST
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

00:39:19.501 --> 00:39:23.033
ABOUT THAT VERSUS
THE QUESTIONS THAT OTHERS

00:39:23.033 --> 00:39:26.334
WOULD WANNA PROPOSE,
I THINK IS THE CRITICAL

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:28.234
LYNCHPIN TO WINNING.

00:39:28.234 --> 00:39:29.634
Smith: GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS HERE.

00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:32.534
THE GOOD NEWS IS--THIS IS
GONNA SOUND REALLY FUNNY--

00:39:32.534 --> 00:39:35.701
THAT THE FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCHES
ARE GONNA PUT 40,000--

00:39:35.701 --> 00:39:37.234
THEY'RE GONNA TRY

00:39:37.234 --> 00:39:40.334
TO PUT 40,000 PEOPLE
IN QUALCOMM STADIUM

00:39:40.334 --> 00:39:44.767
FOR A PRAYER VIGIL ON THE SUNDAY
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:47.734
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY
I'M SAYING IT'S GOOD NEWS.

00:39:47.734 --> 00:39:50.133
FOR UNDECIDED VOTERS
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

00:39:50.133 --> 00:39:54.067
THEY ARE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT NOTION, FRANKLY.

00:39:54.067 --> 00:39:56.701
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS LEADING UP TO THAT,

00:39:56.701 --> 00:40:00.400
WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME RECOGNIZED
RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THIS STATE

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.234
AND HAVE THEM IN QUIET TONES,
NOT SORT OF THREATENING

00:40:05.234 --> 00:40:09.767
AND RHETORICAL AND ALL THAT,
TALK ABOUT...

00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:11.868
WHAT'S REAL.

00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:15.434
THAT, IN FACT, LOVE, COMMITMENT,
MARRIAGE,

00:40:15.434 --> 00:40:21.100
FAMILIES IS NOT EXCLUSIVE
TO STRAIGHT CALIFORNIANS.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.033
AND THAT'S GONNA CUT
ON THAT ISSUE, AND I THINK

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:26.534
IT PROBABLY WORKS REAL WELL
WITH THEIR BASE

00:40:26.534 --> 00:40:28.434
THAT THE FOLKS COULD
GET REALLY EXCITED,

00:40:28.434 --> 00:40:31.267
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHO THEY ARE.

00:40:31.267 --> 00:40:34.834
I THINK FOR "UNDECIDED,"
FOR THAT 20% IN THE MIDDLE,

00:40:34.834 --> 00:40:36.234
THAT'S GONNA END UP CUTTING
OUR WAY SLIGHTLY

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:37.701
IF WE HANDLE IT WELL.

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:38.934
Guerriero: AND ONE QUICK
FOOTNOTE.

00:40:38.934 --> 00:40:42.901
IF EVERY SINGLE LGBT PERSON
IN THIS STATE,

00:40:42.901 --> 00:40:45.033
AND OUR FRIENDS,
AND FAMILY, AND ALLIES,

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:48.801
JUST SENT TO THEIR
EMAIL UNIVERSE A STATEMENT,

00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:51.901
"MY FAMILY IS ON THE BALLOT
THIS NOVEMBER,"

00:40:51.901 --> 00:40:53.667
THAT ALONE COULD BE WORTH
A COUPLE POINTS

00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:55.601
THAT DETERMINE WINNING
AND LOSING.

00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.100
AND WE DISCOVERED ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.467
THAT SOME OF THE MOST
PASSIONATE LGBT ACTIVISTS

00:41:01.467 --> 00:41:04.033
NEVER ASKED THEIR OWN FAMILY
FOR A VOTE.

00:41:04.033 --> 00:41:06.367
AND LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE
HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:07.801
'CAUSE THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE

00:41:07.801 --> 00:41:12.267
THE DIFFERENCE ON TOP
OF THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN.

00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:14.467
man: SO LET ME START
BY MENTIONING AN ANECDOTE.

00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:17.000
A FRIEND OF MINE WAS DOING
SOME CANVASSING IN PALO ALTO,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.234
AND HE SAID THERE WERE MULTIPLE
PEOPLE HE RAN INTO

00:41:20.234 --> 00:41:23.267
WHO SAID, "OH, YES, I SUPPORT
GAY PEOPLE TO MARRIAGE.

00:41:23.267 --> 00:41:25.367
I'M GONNA VOTE 'YES' ON 8."

00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:26.801
[chuckling]

00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:28.501
HE WAS LIKE,
"UNGH! STOP!"

00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:31.868
SO, I MEAN, THAT--
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GUYS KNOW

00:41:31.868 --> 00:41:33.067
HOW TO HANDLE THAT ONE.

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:34.667
I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION
THE ANECDOTE

00:41:34.667 --> 00:41:36.868
THAT EVEN JUST LAST WEEKEND
HE WAS STILL GETTING THAT.

00:41:36.868 --> 00:41:39.467
IT'S A PROBLEM.

00:41:39.467 --> 00:41:44.434
BUT MY QUESTION IS--
SO I'VE ALREADY GIVEN MORE--

00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:47.033
ACTUALLY TEN TIMES MORE MONEY
TO THIS CAMPAIGN

00:41:47.033 --> 00:41:49.267
THAN I'VE EVER GIVEN
TO ANY OTHER POLITICAL THING.

00:41:49.267 --> 00:41:53.167
UM, WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

00:41:53.167 --> 00:41:54.200
[laughter]

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.367
I MEAN,
IS THAT THE ONLY THING?

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:56.534
Smith: NO.

00:41:56.534 --> 00:41:57.868
Kendell: NO, IT'S NOT
THE ONLY THING.

00:41:57.868 --> 00:42:00.100
AND LISTEN,
LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL,

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.534
THANK YOU FOR GIVING,
AND IF EVERYONE GAVE

00:42:02.534 --> 00:42:04.534
TEN TIMES WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN
TO ANYTHING ELSE,

00:42:04.534 --> 00:42:06.267
WE WOULD WIN THIS THING.

00:42:06.267 --> 00:42:07.968
SO THAT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE.

00:42:07.968 --> 00:42:09.334
THANK YOU.

00:42:09.334 --> 00:42:11.501
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO.

00:42:11.501 --> 00:42:17.334
THERE ARE ACTION ITEMS
ON THE NOONPROP8.COM WEBSITE,

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:20.400
AND THE BIGGEST THINGS
THAT YOU CAN DO

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.267
ARE WHAT PATRICK ALLUDED TO.

00:42:22.267 --> 00:42:25.200
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NEVER
ANYONE WHO KNOWS YOU

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.167
THAT DOESN'T KNOW
THEY SHOULD VOTE NO.

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:31.400
FROM YOUR DRY CLEANER,
THE MOST INCIDENTAL CONTACTS,

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.701
TO THE MOST
SUBSTANTIAL CONTACTS.

00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:37.000
WAKING UP EVERY DAY SAYING,
"WHO DO I TALK TO TODAY?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
WHAT CAN I DO TODAY
TO DEFEAT PROP 8?"

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.133
LETTERS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

00:42:44.133 --> 00:42:47.067
THERE'S A WHOLE
GOOGLE NETWORK OF FOLKS

00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:49.701
THAT PROBABLY HAVEN'T GIVEN
AND DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS.

00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:52.701
ASKING PEOPLE TO GIVE, WHICH
YOU MAY NOT HAVE DONE BEFORE.

00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:56.133
WE CAN GIVE YOU TEMPLATES
FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT.

00:42:56.133 --> 00:42:59.100
AND THEN ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE CAMPAIGN,

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.367
THE FIELD COMPONENT
OF THE CAMPAIGN.

00:43:01.367 --> 00:43:03.534
AND THERE IS AN OFFICE
DOWN HERE

00:43:03.534 --> 00:43:06.100
IN--I THINK IT'S IN SAN JOSE
IS THE FIELD OFFICE.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.667
BUT YOU CAN
ACTUALLY CONTACT ME DIRECTLY

00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:11.968
AND I'LL PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH
FOLKS TO DO SOME PHONE BANKING.

00:43:11.968 --> 00:43:13.300
EVEN THOUGH--
WHAT YOU'RE PHONE BANKING--

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.601
IS YOU'RE NOT DOING COLD CALLS.

00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:15.834
AND I UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE ARE LIKE,

00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:17.567
"OOH, I JUST DON'T WANNA CALL
STRANGERS."

00:43:17.567 --> 00:43:20.100
BUT LET ME JUST SAY
TO STEVE'S EARLIER POINT,

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.968
WE WILL WIN THIS WITHIN
THE MARGIN OF ERROR.

00:43:22.968 --> 00:43:26.067
THAT MARGIN OF ERROR
COULD BE, YOU KNOW,

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:29.667
MICHAEL PHELPS' FINGERNAIL
IS WHAT WE SAY IN THE CAMPAIGN.

00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:33.701
AND THAT COULD BE
THE 250,000 VOTERS

00:43:33.701 --> 00:43:36.133
THAT WE ARE GOING TO CALL,
PHONE BANKING,

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:37.734
ASKING THEM TO VOTE NO.

00:43:37.734 --> 00:43:39.601
GRAB A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS.

00:43:39.601 --> 00:43:41.400
GO OUT AND MAKE A NIGHT OF IT.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.033
TWO HOURS PHONE BANKING,

00:43:43.033 --> 00:43:44.567
TAKE 'EM OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF PITCHERS,

00:43:44.567 --> 00:43:47.968
AND YOU WILL HAVE DONE
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:43:47.968 --> 00:43:50.767
IN ADDITION
TO THE OTHER LIST OF THINGS.

00:43:50.767 --> 00:43:52.534
Guerriero: THE PITCHERS
BEFORE OR AFTER THE CALLS?

00:43:52.534 --> 00:43:54.000
Kendell: WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT JUST DEPENDS.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.601
I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.

00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:57.467
Smith: DO YOU GET BETTER?

00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:59.267
LaJeunesse: ALL RIGHT,
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A QUESTION

00:43:59.267 --> 00:44:03.033
FROM ONE OF THE SATELLITE
OFFICES, REMOTE OFFICES, BY--

00:44:03.033 --> 00:44:05.334
IT'S AUDIO, RIGHT--
JUST AUDIO?

00:44:05.334 --> 00:44:10.801
ANYONE OUT THERE HAVE
A QUESTION FOR OUR PANEL?

00:44:10.801 --> 00:44:14.968
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE.

00:44:14.968 --> 00:44:16.901
man: CAN YOU CLARIFY TO PEOPLE
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:18.067
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:19.901
LaJeunesse: OKAY, DO YOU WANNA
MAKE THAT POINT?

00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:21.133
Kendell: OH, YES.

00:44:21.133 --> 00:44:22.601
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE.

00:44:22.601 --> 00:44:23.667
INTERNATIONALLY?

00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.067
Smith: NO.

00:44:25.067 --> 00:44:26.901
LaJeunesse: I'M SORRY,
THE QUESTION WAS TO CLARIFY

00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:29.934
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE
YOU RESIDE, YOU ARE LEGALLY

00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:31.400
ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE CAMPAIGN.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.934
Kendell: YES, YOU HAVE TO BE
A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:44:34.934 --> 00:44:35.934
BUT--

00:44:35.934 --> 00:44:36.968
man: OR GREEN CARDS.

00:44:36.968 --> 00:44:38.400
OR GREEN CARD HOLDERS.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.100
Kendell: OR GREEN CARD HOLDER,
THANK YOU, YES.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.501
OR GREEN CARD HOLDER.

00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:43.234
YOU ALL WOULD KNOW THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

00:44:43.234 --> 00:44:44.868
YES.

00:44:44.868 --> 00:44:47.667
AND YOU CAN GIVE MONEY
TO THE CAMPAIGN

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:50.901
EITHER THROUGH THE WEBSITE--
YOU CAN--

00:44:50.901 --> 00:44:55.400
THERE'S A WAY TO GIVE THERE
OR CONTACT THE WEBSITE ABOUT--

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.133
THE CONTACT INFORMATION THERE
ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE A GIFT.

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:02.234
ABOVE THE THE $10 MILLION
THAT YOU SEE THERE

00:45:02.234 --> 00:45:04.767
AND THE $32,000 THAT WE--
OR 32,000 DONORS

00:45:04.767 --> 00:45:08.033
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER,
A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE,

00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:10.000
NOT A MAJORITY, OF COURSE,
BUT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.734
IS FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A STATE

00:45:12.734 --> 00:45:15.267
THAT WON'T BE TOUCHED, AS
PATRICK TALKED ABOUT, BY THIS.

00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:16.901
SO NO MATTER
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE--

00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:19.734
SO IF YOU HAVE
WEALTHY FRIENDS OR FAMILY

00:45:19.734 --> 00:45:22.033
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA

00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:25.601
WHO YOU THINK WOULD BE WILLING
TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION,

00:45:25.601 --> 00:45:27.567
WE WILL DO WHATEVER
WE NEED TO DO

00:45:27.567 --> 00:45:29.634
AT THE CAMPAIGN TO HELP YOU
FACILITATE THAT.

00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:31.567
WE WILL PROVIDE YOU
TALKING POINTS,

00:45:31.567 --> 00:45:33.734
A SAMPLE LETTER,
WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

00:45:33.734 --> 00:45:35.534
YOU KNOW, I'LL GET
ON THE PHONE MYSELF WITH 'EM

00:45:35.534 --> 00:45:37.100
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE
OF THE GIFT.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.367
[laughter]

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:42.634
AND YOU CAN--FROM ANYWHERE
YOU LIVE YOU CAN GIVE.

00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:45.200
YES, GOOD QUESTION.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.834
woman: I WANNA GO BACK TO THE
FRAMING AND MESSAGING DISCUSSION

00:45:48.834 --> 00:45:50.968
ALTHOUGH STEVEN PARTLY
ADDRESSED, YOU KNOW,

00:45:50.968 --> 00:45:52.667
WHAT I HAD AS A QUESTION.

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:57.000
SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD HERE
IS IT'S NOT--

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.834
FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE
IN THE 20%,

00:46:00.834 --> 00:46:02.934
YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH IT,

00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:04.367
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS,

00:46:04.367 --> 00:46:07.167
WHICH IS A GREAT PROGRESSIVE,
A GREAT, YOU KNOW,

00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:10.234
LIBERTARIAN ARGUMENT,
BUT I'M CONCERNED HOW IT GETS

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:12.534
TO THE CHRISTIAN BASE.

00:46:12.534 --> 00:46:15.133
THEN WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS,
YOU KNOW,

00:46:15.133 --> 00:46:17.100
SOMEONE'S FAMILY
IS ON THE LINE.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.801
WHICH IS ALSO A GREAT ARGUMENT,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:22.968
LIKE A "PETA" ARGUMENT IN THERE
IS SOME CONDESCENSION OF, LIKE,

00:46:22.968 --> 00:46:28.901
THE STRAIGHT MAJORITY RELATING
TO THE LGBT MINORITY.

00:46:28.901 --> 00:46:31.434
SO, AGAIN, I'M WONDERING
TO WHAT EXTENT IT GETS

00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:33.167
TO THE CHRISTIAN BASE.

00:46:33.167 --> 00:46:36.868
SO I'M THINKING THAT
WHAT I DON'T HEAR IS, LIKE,

00:46:36.868 --> 00:46:39.734
REALLY POSITIVE, LIKE,
AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS.

00:46:39.734 --> 00:46:43.734
LET'S SAY BECAUSE
THE LGBT MINORITY WANTS TO JOIN

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:48.300
AND IS JOINING IN THE
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE ITSELF,

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.167
IT ACTUALLY AFFIRMS
THE MARRIAGES OF, YOU KNOW,

00:46:51.167 --> 00:46:53.801
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE,
'CAUSE I'VE HEARD IN SOME STATES

00:46:53.801 --> 00:46:57.000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO, LIKE,
REMARRY BECAUSE THEY FEEL

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.601
THAT, YOU KNOW,
GAY MARRIAGE HAS THREATENED

00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:01.467
THEIR SACRED INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE AND, YOU KNOW,

00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:03.000
ALL OF THAT STUFF.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.334
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT
CAN BE SWITCHED.

00:47:05.334 --> 00:47:07.567
LIKE, THE ARGUMENT CAN BE
SWITCHED AND SAY,

00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:10.767
"LOOK, YOUR INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE IS, YOU KNOW,

00:47:10.767 --> 00:47:15.801
"REAFFIRMED BY VOTING NO
TO THE PROPOSITION.

00:47:15.801 --> 00:47:18.234
"YOU'RE REAFFIRMING YOUR OWN,
BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,

00:47:18.234 --> 00:47:20.033
CHRISTIAN, IF NEED,
THE INSTITUTION."

00:47:20.033 --> 00:47:22.267
SO I JUST HAVEN'T HEARD THAT,
AND I'M WONDERING

00:47:22.267 --> 00:47:25.901
IF THERE'LL BE ANYTHING.

00:47:25.901 --> 00:47:28.334
Smith: WHAT--IF I WERE
TO GO DOWN THAT PATH,

00:47:28.334 --> 00:47:30.167
THE WAY I WOULD
SAY THAT PRECISELY--

00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:32.467
AND I GOTTA SAY WORDS
IN THIS THING MATTER A LOT.

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:34.100
woman: YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.901
Smith: I WOULD SAY
DON'T LIMIT--

00:47:36.901 --> 00:47:41.200
DON'T ELIMINATE OUR RIGHT
TO AFFIRM MARRIAGE.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.567
TO JOIN THE--I MEAN, WE--

00:47:43.567 --> 00:47:46.033
GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE
WANNA STAND UP

00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:49.100
AND SHARE
IN THE RESPONSIBILITY,

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.868
THE COMMITMENT,
THE JOY OF MARRIAGE.

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:54.767
DON'T ELIMINATE
OUR RIGHT TO DO THAT.

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:56.801
SO I'D TAKE IT THAT ONE STEP.

00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:58.834
YES, MAKE IT POSITIVE,
MAKE IT AFFIRMING,

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:00.934
BUT THEN DO THE ELIMINATION
AT THE END

00:48:00.934 --> 00:48:04.934
BECAUSE, IN FACT,
THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES FOLKS.

00:48:04.934 --> 00:48:09.400
woman: HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES
ON--AS TO HOW WORDING CHANGES,

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.801
LIKE, POLL RESULTS?

00:48:10.801 --> 00:48:12.400
LIKE, WHAT IS THE DATA?

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.467
Smith: LET ME GIVE YOU JUST
ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE,

00:48:14.467 --> 00:48:17.133
AND IT'S A LITTLE OFF.

00:48:17.133 --> 00:48:21.100
BUT IF--TO--
CLEARLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.968
TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY,
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:25.767
IS "DISCRIMINATE."

00:48:25.767 --> 00:48:30.534
IF YOU USE "DISCRIMINATE,"
ABOUT 10, 15% OF THE PEOPLE

00:48:30.534 --> 00:48:32.968
WON'T BUY IT AS WELL
AS IF YOU JUST SAY,

00:48:32.968 --> 00:48:34.534
"TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY."

00:48:34.534 --> 00:48:37.033
YOU GET A 10-15%
DIFFERENT REA--

00:48:37.033 --> 00:48:38.901
THAT'S WHY THE WORD
"ELIMINATE" IS SO--

00:48:38.901 --> 00:48:42.200
THE WORD "ELIMINATE"
IS PROBABLY WORTH TEN POINTS.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.400
JUST USING THAT WORD.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.501
SO THAT'S WHY I SAY
WHEN YOU MAKE

00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:47.200
THE POSITIVE AFFIRMING,
"YEAH, WE WANT IT.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.567
"WE WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:50.534
WE WANT THE COMMITMENT."

00:48:50.534 --> 00:48:52.667
DON'T ELIMINATE OUR RIGHT
TO DO THAT.

00:48:52.667 --> 00:48:53.834
woman: OKAY.

00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:55.968
LaJeunesse: AND RIGHT HERE.

00:48:55.968 --> 00:48:57.934
man: I THINK YOU ACTUALLY JUST
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

00:48:57.934 --> 00:49:01.634
MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE,
IN OCTOBER WHEN YOU GO

00:49:01.634 --> 00:49:04.834
ONTO THE AIRWAVES, ARE YOU GOING
TO BE PUTTING FORWARD

00:49:04.834 --> 00:49:06.968
A POSITIVE MESSAGE SAYING,
YOU KNOW, "EQUALITY TO ALL,"

00:49:06.968 --> 00:49:10.200
OR ARE YOU GOING TO BE SAYING,
"DON'T DESTROY OUR MARRIAGE"?

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.234
Smith: WE'RE GONNA--IT'S A
POSITIVE MESSAGE TO SOME DEGREE.

00:49:12.234 --> 00:49:14.033
BUT LET ME JUST SAY,
AND THIS GOES BACK TO--

00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:15.701
I FORGET WHO IT WAS EARLIER
THAT SAID

00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:18.234
THERE IS CONFUSION OUT THERE.

00:49:18.234 --> 00:49:21.467
EVERY AD YOU SEE US DO
AT THE END WILL BE A NEGATIVE.

00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:24.567
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A "NO,"
YOU KNOW?

00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:26.901
VOTE NO ON 8.

00:49:26.901 --> 00:49:30.300
WE CAN'T ALLOW ANY CONFUSION
ABOUT THAT AT THE END.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.634
LaJeunesse: STEVE, COULD YOU
JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

00:49:32.634 --> 00:49:35.100
VOTERS WHO ARE UNDECIDED
AT THE LAST MINUTE

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.033
GENERALLY GO TOWARD
THE "NO" ANYWAY, RIGHT?

00:49:37.033 --> 00:49:38.501
Smith: YEAH.

00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:40.100
LaJeunesse: IF THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT,

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.534
BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE,
IT GOES "NO," IS--

00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:43.200
Smith: RIGHT, GENERALLY,

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200
IF YOU'RE PUSHING A "YES" VOTE
YOU HAVE A BIGGER BURDEN

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.634
THAN IF YOU'RE PUSHING
A "NO" VOTE,

00:49:46.634 --> 00:49:48.367
GENERALLY, IN MOST ELECTIONS.

00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:51.767
SO IF FOLKS GO INTO A VOTING
BOOTH AND THEY'RE NOT SURE YET,

00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:53.200
PEOPLE ARE KINDA, YOU KNOW--

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.901
THEY GET NERVOUS
ABOUT CHANGE, FRANKLY.

00:49:55.901 --> 00:49:57.434
SO IF THEY HAVEN'T REALLY
MADE UP THEIR MIND,

00:49:57.434 --> 00:49:59.367
YOU'RE LIKELY
TO GET A "NO" VOTE.

00:49:59.367 --> 00:50:01.701
THE ONE THING I WILL SAY THAT
MAKES THIS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:04.567
IS IN SOME PEOPLE'S HEADS,
WE'RE THE ONES

00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:06.534
LOOKING FOR THE CHANGE NOW
BECAUSE MARRIAGE

00:50:06.534 --> 00:50:08.133
IS RELATIVELY RECENT.

00:50:08.133 --> 00:50:11.100
SO WE HAVE A SLIGHT TINGE
ON THAT,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.968
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO DRIVE A, YOU KNOW,

00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:14.901
"VOTE NO ON 8."

00:50:14.901 --> 00:50:16.701
AND AS YOU HAVE
ALL YOUR CONVERSATIONS--

00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:21.234
AND I WANNA AGAIN SAY,
ONE ON ONES

00:50:21.234 --> 00:50:23.334
PUTTING IT ON THE BASIS
TO YOUR FRIENDS OF,

00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:25.868
"HEY, THIS VOTE IS ABOUT ME.

00:50:25.868 --> 00:50:28.834
PROPOSITION 8,
YOU'RE VOTING ON ME."

00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:30.400
YOU'RE GONNA PULL
SOME FRIENDS THAT WAY.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.534
THEY KNOW YOU.

00:50:31.534 --> 00:50:32.601
Guerriero: SINCE I'M
THE LEAST--

00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:33.868
man: "VOTE NO ON ME."

00:50:33.868 --> 00:50:35.701
Guerriero: "VOTE NO
ON ME"?

00:50:35.701 --> 00:50:36.767
THAT MIGHT WORK

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:37.934
WITH SOME OF OUR ENEMIES.

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.534
Smith: THOSE ARE YOUR ENEMIES,
YEAH, RIGHT?

00:50:39.534 --> 00:50:41.701
Guerriero: SINCE I'M THE LEAST
POLITICALLY CORRECT UP HERE,

00:50:41.701 --> 00:50:45.734
I DO WANNA NOTE ONE THING
ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.

00:50:45.734 --> 00:50:49.901
IS THAT IF I'M COMPLETELY
COMFORTABLE WITH THE AD

00:50:49.901 --> 00:50:52.033
THAT STEVE PUTS UP
IN A FEW WEEKS,

00:50:52.033 --> 00:50:54.067
WE'LL PROBABLY LOSE.

00:50:54.067 --> 00:50:55.968
IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE
WITH THE AD YOU SEE,

00:50:55.968 --> 00:50:58.267
AND IT MOVES YOU
IN A SPECIAL PLACE,

00:50:58.267 --> 00:51:01.868
IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT AD
TO MOVE THOSE PEOPLE.

00:51:01.868 --> 00:51:05.033
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO
ONCE WE ANALYZE A CAMPAIGN,

00:51:05.033 --> 00:51:07.734
AND THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE,
AND THE DATA, AND THE POLLING,

00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:10.667
AND RESEARCH,
AT SOME POINT, WE STEP BACK

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:12.434
AND SAY, "HE KNOWS--

00:51:12.434 --> 00:51:14.834
OR, "WE BELIEVE
HE IS TOTALLY CAPABLE

00:51:14.834 --> 00:51:16.667
OF FIGURING OUT WHAT
THAT MESSAGE IS."

00:51:16.667 --> 00:51:19.267
AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY,

00:51:19.267 --> 00:51:21.334
MAYBE EVEN
THE PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY,

00:51:21.334 --> 00:51:23.868
THAT DON'T LIKE THAT AD,
OR DON'T LIKE THE FACT

00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:26.234
THAT THE AD MIGHT CHANGE
TEN DAYS LATER

00:51:26.234 --> 00:51:28.267
DEPENDING ON WHAT
THE OTHER SIDE DOES.

00:51:28.267 --> 00:51:31.801
AND FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN
AROUND THE COUNTRY,

00:51:31.801 --> 00:51:34.634
MOST OF THE TIMES
THE LGBT MOVEMENT

00:51:34.634 --> 00:51:37.200
HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PULL
BACK. AND ENDED UP

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.234
MICROMANAGING THE MESSAGE,
AND CRITIQUING THE MESSAGE.

00:51:40.234 --> 00:51:42.901
AND WE ENDED UP WITH A MESSAGE
THAT MADE US FEEL REALLY GOOD

00:51:42.901 --> 00:51:46.334
AT NIGHT
UNTIL ELECTION NIGHT.

00:51:46.334 --> 00:51:49.067
AND SO A BIG,
BOLD STEP FOR ALL OF US,

00:51:49.067 --> 00:51:51.267
INCLUDING THOSE OF US WHO ARE
INVESTING BIG-TIME IN THIS,

00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:54.901
IS TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE
WE JUST KIND OF EMBRACE THAT

00:51:54.901 --> 00:51:56.634
AND ACCEPT STEPPING
OUT OF CONTROL,

00:51:56.634 --> 00:51:59.634
TRUSTING THAT THERE'S
A REAL SMART TEAM IN PLACE.

00:51:59.634 --> 00:52:01.300
SO THAT'S A TOUGH THING
FOR ALL OF US,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.133
AND I'M SURE ALL OF US
IN THE ROOM TODAY.

00:52:03.133 --> 00:52:06.334
LaJeunesse: WHY DON'T WE SWITCH
OFF AND GO OVER HERE?

00:52:06.334 --> 00:52:09.934
man: YOU ALMOST ANSWERED
MY SECOND QUESTION.

00:52:09.934 --> 00:52:14.434
BUT THERE ARE REALLY TWO THINGS
THAT SCARE ME ABOUT THIS THING.

00:52:14.434 --> 00:52:15.901
WHICH IS, NUMBER ONE,
WHAT I'M GONNA CALL

00:52:15.901 --> 00:52:18.901
"THE DAVID DUKE EFFECT."

00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:21.634
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE POLLS
MAY SHOW THEY'RE EQUAL,

00:52:21.634 --> 00:52:24.901
BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIE
AND TELL THE POLLSTERS

00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:27.300
WHAT THEY THINK THE POLLSTERS
WANNA HEAR RATHER THAN

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.634
WHAT THEY WANNA FEEL.

00:52:29.634 --> 00:52:34.300
AND THE SECOND IS,
CAN THE GAY COMMUNITY

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.868
REALLY MAKE HARD-HEADED
POLITICAL DECISIONS?

00:52:36.868 --> 00:52:38.767
I KEEP ON THINKING
OF WHAT RECENTLY

00:52:38.767 --> 00:52:42.334
HAPPENED WITH HRC AND ENDA,
WHERE HRC MADE

00:52:42.334 --> 00:52:45.901
WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS NOT THE
POLITICALLY CORRECT DECISION,

00:52:45.901 --> 00:52:51.133
BUT THE POLITICALLY--
THE CORRECT POLITICAL DECISION,

00:52:51.133 --> 00:52:55.167
AND THEY JUST GOT RAMMED
FOR IT.

00:52:55.167 --> 00:53:00.267
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
HATED THEM AS A RESULT, SO.

00:53:00.267 --> 00:53:02.434
Guerriero: I'LL DEFEND YOU
FOR A SECOND HERE.

00:53:02.434 --> 00:53:05.367
IN THE SENSE THAT THE GOOD
NEWS IS, UNLIKE THE HRC MODEL,

00:53:05.367 --> 00:53:07.834
WHICH WAS A VERY DIFFICULT
EXPERIENCE FOR THE COMMUNITY,

00:53:07.834 --> 00:53:09.834
AND DIVIDED REALLY
WELL INTENTIONED PEOPLE,

00:53:09.834 --> 00:53:12.834
IS THAT TO THE CREDIT
OF KATE AND MANY OTHER

00:53:12.834 --> 00:53:15.367
OF THE LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA,
THERE HAS BEEN

00:53:15.367 --> 00:53:18.567
A TWO, THREE-YEAR PROCESS
OF GETTING TO A PLACE

00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:20.067
WHERE WE KNEW THIS CAMPAIGN
WAS GONNA HAPPEN

00:53:20.067 --> 00:53:21.701
AT SOME POINT.

00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:24.767
AND LITERALLY, FROM THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF,

00:53:24.767 --> 00:53:26.601
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD
THIS CAMPAIGN

00:53:26.601 --> 00:53:29.100
MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE
ULTIMATELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.367
WHEN IT COMES TO EVERY
STRATEGIC DECISION.

00:53:30.367 --> 00:53:33.601
AND SO, NO, THERE ISN'T
A HISTORY OF DOING IT.

00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:35.367
THIS CAMPAIGN
AND THE COALITION GROUPS,

00:53:35.367 --> 00:53:37.834
I THINK, HAVE A
VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

00:53:37.834 --> 00:53:39.434
THAT THAT'S GONNA BE THE CASE,

00:53:39.434 --> 00:53:41.701
ESPECIALLY BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY.

00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:45.033
AND IF WE DON'T OVERCOME THAT,
WE WILL LOSE.

00:53:45.033 --> 00:53:46.667
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:48.467
IT'S A VERY
LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

00:53:48.467 --> 00:53:50.234
Kendell: YEAH, AND I COULD
JUST SAY, I MEAN,

00:53:50.234 --> 00:53:53.167
WE'RE ALREADY KNEE-DEEP
IN MESSAGING AT THIS POINT.

00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:55.567
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE MESSAGING IS BASED ON

00:53:55.567 --> 00:53:57.734
WHAT THE POLLS
AND THE FOCUS GROUP SAYS.

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.934
IT'S NOT BASED ON THE AD
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE,

00:53:59.934 --> 00:54:03.467
YOU KNOW, AS A RADICAL,
LESBIAN FEMINIST,

00:54:03.467 --> 00:54:05.567
YOU KNOW, UP ON THE TV.

00:54:05.567 --> 00:54:07.067
SO--AND WE ALL
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:54:07.067 --> 00:54:08.367
Smith: I'VE HEARD THAT
ABOUT YOU.

00:54:08.367 --> 00:54:09.968
I'VE HEARD THAT
ABOUT YOU.

00:54:09.968 --> 00:54:12.234
Kendell: AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T
HAD A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT.

00:54:12.234 --> 00:54:14.901
I WILL--I JUST HAVE TO NOTE,

00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:18.000
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
COMPLETELY DISAGREE

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.834
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTERIZATION
ABOUT THE HRC THING.

00:54:20.834 --> 00:54:22.868
AND IT'S NOT A POLITICAL CORRECT
OR NOT.

00:54:22.868 --> 00:54:27.000
I THINK, STRATEGICALLY,
IT WAS A BAD DECISION.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.501
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT.

00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:29.834
I DON'T WANNA
GET OFF POINT ABOUT IT,

00:54:29.834 --> 00:54:31.234
BUT I JUST HAVE
TO BOOKMARK IT.

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.601
man: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:54:32.601 --> 00:54:35.601
Kendell: BUT TO THE BIGGER ISSUE
THAT YOU'RE RAISING,

00:54:35.601 --> 00:54:38.300
WE ARE COMPLETELY ON BOARD
WITH WINNING.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.601
I WANNA WAKE UP
NOVEMBER 5th KNOWING--

00:54:41.601 --> 00:54:43.567
I MEAN, I'M GONNA WAKE UP
KNOWING THAT I DID

00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:45.200
EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.234
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
I COULD HAVE DONE

00:54:47.234 --> 00:54:49.033
TO DEFEAT PROP 8.

00:54:49.033 --> 00:54:51.400
I DON'T WANNA BE
SECOND GUESSING ANYTHING

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.767
THAT I DID OR MY LEVEL
OF COMMITMENT.

00:54:53.767 --> 00:54:55.601
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA LOSE IT

00:54:55.601 --> 00:54:59.701
BECAUSE I WAS WEDDED
TO MESSAGING THAT I LIKED

00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:01.467
THAT WAS NOT DRIVEN
AND SUPPORTED

00:55:01.467 --> 00:55:02.701
BY THE DATA.

00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:04.234
Smith: AND LET ME
JUST FINISH OUT THE RESPONSE

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.801
TO YOUR FIRST PART
OF YOUR QUESTION.

00:55:05.801 --> 00:55:08.367
IF WE DON'T WALK IN THERE WITH
A 10-POINT LEAD IN THE POLLS,

00:55:08.367 --> 00:55:09.367
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

00:55:09.367 --> 00:55:10.501
man: OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:12.601
Smith: I MEAN,
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:14.267
woman: UM, MY QUESTION RELATES

00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:17.167
TO THE LANGUAGE ABOUT
THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS

00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:21.434
UPON THE STATE IF PROP 8 PASSES
OR DOESN'T PASS.

00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:23.601
I NOTICED THAT THERE
IS SOMETHING RELATING

00:55:23.601 --> 00:55:25.634
TO TOURISM REVENUE,
BUT THERE IS NOTHING

00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:28.834
ABOUT THE EFFECT
OF LGBT WORKERS CHOOSING

00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:30.501
TO COME TO THE STATE
OR TO LEAVE THE STATE

00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:32.300
DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.400
HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND
OF ANALYSIS DONE ON THIS,

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.868
WHETHER IT BE BY THE STATE
OR BY "NO ON PROP 8"?

00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:40.534
Guerriero: YEAH, I BELIEVE
THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE AT UCLA

00:55:40.534 --> 00:55:42.067
HAS DONE A STUDY
THAT SHOWS THAT FIGURE.

00:55:42.067 --> 00:55:43.667
THEY WERE STILL
FINE-TUNING IT.

00:55:43.667 --> 00:55:45.067
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THE ACTUAL FINAL REPORT,

00:55:45.067 --> 00:55:46.767
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE,
KIND OF,

00:55:46.767 --> 00:55:49.701
MANY TALKING POINTS
THAT WILL BE CIRCULATED

00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:51.667
BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER,
AND IT'S THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE,

00:55:51.667 --> 00:55:53.200
THAT REALLY IS THE BEST
IN THE COUNTRY

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.367
AT DOING THAT TYPE OF WORK
FOR THESE BALLOT INITIATIVES.

00:55:56.367 --> 00:55:58.267
Kendell: WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE DATA IN TIME

00:55:58.267 --> 00:56:00.834
FOR THE FISCAL ANALYST
LANGUAGE.

00:56:00.834 --> 00:56:04.200
SO OTHERWISE IT WOULD SAY, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, A BILLION DOLLARS.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.567
AND, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH

00:56:05.567 --> 00:56:07.534
TO, YOU KNOW,
DRIVE PEOPLE TO VOTE NO.

00:56:07.534 --> 00:56:10.100
BUT IT'S A VERY
WELL TAKEN POINT.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.534
LaJeunesse: WE'RE AT RIGHT
ABOUT 4:00,

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.501
AND I WANNA BE RESPECTFUL
OF THE PANELISTS' TIME,

00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:16.033
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TIME
FOR ONE MORE QUESTION.

00:56:16.033 --> 00:56:17.267
Kendell: YOU BET.

00:56:17.267 --> 00:56:18.868
man: THANKS,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

00:56:18.868 --> 00:56:22.067
THAT MY WIFE AND I KNOW
FIVE LONG-TERM COUPLES

00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:23.634
WHO'VE BEEN GETTING MARRIED
WITHIN, ABOUT,

00:56:23.634 --> 00:56:26.734
A TWO-MONTH PERIOD HERE,
AND IN EACH CASE,

00:56:26.734 --> 00:56:31.167
WE'VE BEEN DONATING
TO "NO ON 8" IN THEIR HONOR.

00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:33.234
AS A WEDDING GIFT,
WE FIGURE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE

00:56:33.234 --> 00:56:34.901
MEANINGFUL
THAN YET ANOTHER TOASTER OVEN.

00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:37.868
[applause]

00:56:37.868 --> 00:56:40.934
AND THAT THOSE FIVE COUPLES
INCLUDE, BY THE WAY,

00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:43.601
OUR CURRENT PASTOR,
TWO FORMER PASTORS

00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:47.033
AND THEIR PARTNERS,
AND I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY

00:56:47.033 --> 00:56:50.100
I AND MY WIFE
CERTAINLY RESENT WILDMON

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.000
AND THE REST
OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.167
TRYING TO MONOPOLIZE
THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN,

00:56:54.167 --> 00:56:56.901
'CAUSE THEY
CERTAINLY DO NOT SPEAK FOR US.

00:56:56.901 --> 00:56:58.267
SO, TWO QUESTIONS.

00:56:58.267 --> 00:57:01.601
ONE IS WHAT CAN THE PROGRESSIVE
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY DO

00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:05.968
TO HELP DEFEAT PROPOSITION 8
ASIDE FROM, YOU KNOW,

00:57:05.968 --> 00:57:07.467
WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING?

00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:09.868
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LIMITS
IN TERMS OF WHAT ONE CAN DO,

00:57:09.868 --> 00:57:13.000
YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF DIRECT
ACTION WITHIN THE CHURCH,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.200
BUT BY BEING LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE,
WE WANNA GET THAT MESSAGE OUT.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.067
AND THEN, ALSO,
I WAS HOPING THAT PATRICK

00:57:19.067 --> 00:57:21.868
COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE
TO THE HISTORY

00:57:21.868 --> 00:57:23.834
IN MASSACHUSETTS,
AND HOW OPINIONS

00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:26.467
HAVE TURNED AROUND THERE
JUST BY THE FACT

00:57:26.467 --> 00:57:28.801
OF GAY MARRIAGE
BEING ESTABLISHED.

00:57:28.801 --> 00:57:31.767
IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW,
FROM 3,000 MILES AWAY

00:57:31.767 --> 00:57:34.667
THAT THAT REALLY HAS TURNED
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S OPINIONS

00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:37.334
AROUND AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT.

00:57:37.334 --> 00:57:39.167
Guerriero: SURE, I'LL MAYBE
CONNECT BOTH QUESTIONS

00:57:39.167 --> 00:57:41.067
AND WRAP THEM INTO ONE,
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:57:41.067 --> 00:57:42.567
POWERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

00:57:42.567 --> 00:57:45.000
THAT EVERY TIME
THE RADICAL RIGHT

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.367
WOULD GO ON TV,
OR HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE,

00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.767
OR ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE,

00:57:49.767 --> 00:57:54.167
THE PROGRESSIVE RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY CHOSE TO DO SOMETHING

00:57:54.167 --> 00:57:56.434
THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY,
REALLY SMART.

00:57:56.434 --> 00:57:58.601
THEY DIDN'T DECIDE
TO DEBATE THE BIBLE

00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.434
OR THE INTERPRETATION
OF SCRIPTURE.

00:58:01.434 --> 00:58:04.267
THEY CHOSE TO TALK ABOUT
HOW WE TREAT OUR NEIGHBORS.

00:58:04.267 --> 00:58:09.534
ABOUT THEIR VIEW OF RELIGIOSITY,
ABOUT CHRISTIANITY,

00:58:09.534 --> 00:58:11.367
AND THEY KINDA FLIPPED
THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT

00:58:11.367 --> 00:58:13.100
COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.100
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE,
BECAUSE THE WORK

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.567
TO HAVE A HEAVY-DUTY,
MULTI-SYLLABIC,

00:58:17.567 --> 00:58:20.434
RELIGIOUS DEBATE IS ONE
WE ULTIMATELY LOSE

00:58:20.434 --> 00:58:22.734
IN A TIGHT TIMEFRAME
ABOUT A COMPLEX ISSUE

00:58:22.734 --> 00:58:24.467
THAT PEOPLE ARE
STRUGGLING WITH.

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:26.501
BUT THEIR WILLINGNESS
TO STAND AT A MICROPHONE,

00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:29.167
STAND PUBLICLY, SPEAK
AT PUBLIC HEARINGS AND SAY,

00:58:29.167 --> 00:58:32.467
"I'M A MAN OR A WOMAN
WHO BELIEVES IN GOD

00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:34.300
"AND BELIEVES THAT MY NEIGHBOR
SHOULD BE TREATED

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:38.534
ABSOLUTELY EQUALLY," UM,
WAS THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTERPOINT.

00:58:38.534 --> 00:58:40.434
IT DIDN'T WIN
THE FAR-RIGHT VOTER.

00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:42.968
IT DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,
GET TO THAT 40%

00:58:42.968 --> 00:58:44.834
THAT AIN'T GONNA BE--
AREN'T GONNA BE WITH US.

00:58:44.834 --> 00:58:47.434
BUT IT DID MOVE JUST
THAT SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:58:47.434 --> 00:58:50.567
THAT NEEDED TO STEP OUR WAY.

00:58:50.567 --> 00:58:52.968
AND THEN THE LAST THING I DID--
THE ONLY NEGATIVE PART

00:58:52.968 --> 00:58:54.501
ABOUT ALL THE MARRIAGES
IN MASSACHUSETTS

00:58:54.501 --> 00:58:57.400
WAS THAT IT'S COST ME
SO MUCH MONEY IN WEDDING GIFTS

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.834
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:02.868
SO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS
ACTUALLY NEGATIVE INDIVIDUALLY.

00:59:02.868 --> 00:59:04.534
YOU'VE DONE A REALLY--

00:59:04.534 --> 00:59:06.100
PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING YOU CAN DO

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.434
WHICH IS ENSURE THAT THE NEXT
GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:59:08.434 --> 00:59:11.067
CAN NEVER--WON'T HAVE
TO QUESTION WHETHER THEY CAN

00:59:11.067 --> 00:59:15.133
MARRY THE PERSON THAT THEY LOVE
AND THAT IS A GREAT ACT

00:59:15.133 --> 00:59:18.167
OF CHRISTIANITY
AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.

00:59:18.167 --> 00:59:21.000
AND WE, LIKE YOU,
HAVE REALIZED IN MASSACHUSETTS

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.033
THAT ALL OF THE THREATS
OF THE FAR RIGHT

00:59:24.033 --> 00:59:26.167
HAVE NOT COME TRUE.

00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:28.901
AND THE PUBLIC,
WHICH USED TO BE 35%

00:59:28.901 --> 00:59:30.501
SUPPORTING MARRIAGE EQUALITY,

00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:32.701
MOVED UP TO 50
ONCE THE WEDDINGS HAPPENED.

00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:35.667
MOVED UP TO 55,
AND NOW TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE,

00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:37.734
INCLUDING THE MAJORITY
OF REPUBLICANS,

00:59:37.734 --> 00:59:41.567
SUPPORT FULL MARRIAGE EQUALITY
FOR EVERYONE IN A STATE.

00:59:41.567 --> 00:59:43.434
IT'S A PRETTY
AMAZING PLACE TO LIVE.

00:59:43.434 --> 00:59:45.300
AND THIS GREAT STATE'S
GONNA BE THE NEXT ONE

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.434
TO EXPERIENCE THAT MILESTONE.

00:59:48.434 --> 00:59:50.033
LaJeunesse: DANIELLE,
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

00:59:50.033 --> 00:59:51.033
I SAW YOU BY THE MIC.

00:59:51.033 --> 00:59:52.033
ARE YOU ALL SET?

00:59:52.033 --> 00:59:54.000
JUST ONE LAST QUICK ONE.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.067
COME ON UP.

00:59:56.067 --> 00:59:58.968
Danielle: HEY, THANK YOU.
I AM DANIELLE.

00:59:58.968 --> 01:00:01.234
I WORK
IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE.

01:00:01.234 --> 01:00:04.100
AND I AM ONE OF TEN KIDS.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.133
NUMBER THREE OUT OF TEN.

01:00:06.133 --> 01:00:09.300
AND I WAS JUST
INSTANT MESSAGING MY DAD.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.868
MY DAD IS
A DIE-HARD REPUBLICAN CATHOLIC,

01:00:12.868 --> 01:00:16.334
AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, DAD,
I'M UP TO MISCHIEF."

01:00:16.334 --> 01:00:18.334
AND HE ASKED ME
WHAT I WAS DOING.

01:00:18.334 --> 01:00:22.801
AND I MENTIONED WHERE I WAS,
AND HIS QUESTION WAS,

01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:25.801
"CAN'T YOU JUST CALL IT
SOMETHING ELSE?"

01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:27.567
HE'S LIKE,
"IT'S NOT MARRIAGE.

01:00:27.567 --> 01:00:29.067
CAN'T YOU JUST CALL IT
SOMETHING ELSE?"

01:00:29.067 --> 01:00:32.701
SO I WANTED TO HAVE YOU GUYS
REALLY PINPOINT

01:00:32.701 --> 01:00:35.601
WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:37.767
AND MARRIAGES ARE.

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:41.100
I HAVEN'T--MY FAMILY
BEING VERY CATHOLIC--

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.767
AND THEY'RE FROM PENNSYLVANIA,
SO I SAID,

01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:45.167
"DAD, YOU'RE NOT REGISTERED
TO VOTE IN CALIFORNIA,

01:00:45.167 --> 01:00:47.868
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER."

01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:49.667
Kendell: BUT WE'LL HUMOR YOU
ANYWAY.

01:00:49.667 --> 01:00:52.901
Danielle: YEAH, THANK YOU.

01:00:52.901 --> 01:00:54.901
Kendell: I--IF I HAD A DOLLAR
FOR EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN ASKED

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:58.200
THAT QUESTION, YOU KNOW,
I COULD FUND THE CAMPAIGN.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.367
AND WHAT I'VE TAKEN TO SAYING
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME THAT QUESTION

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:06.734
IS I SAY, "WHY?"

01:01:06.734 --> 01:01:08.767
'CAUSE THINK ABOUT
WHAT ARE THEY ASKING?

01:01:08.767 --> 01:01:12.767
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL

01:01:12.767 --> 01:01:16.868
ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN'S
RELATIONSHIPS

01:01:16.868 --> 01:01:21.334
THAT GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES
DO NOT SHARE.

01:01:21.334 --> 01:01:26.300
SO THE WORD "MARRIAGE"
SHOULD BE RESERVED

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.934
FOR THOSE REAL RELATIONSHIPS.

01:01:29.934 --> 01:01:31.767
THE MOST IMPORTANT
RELATIONSHIPS.

01:01:31.767 --> 01:01:35.100
THE RELATIONSHIPS
THAT I UNDERSTAND THE MOST.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.467
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
GET THIS.

01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:40.300
SO ONCE I HEAR
THE ANSWER BACK TO THE,

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.634
"TELL ME WHY YOU WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE A DIFFERENT NAME?"

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:48.334
IT GENERALLY UNCOVERS
SOME LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT

01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:51.968
WHICH PROVIDES
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

01:01:51.968 --> 01:01:54.734
TO SAY, BECAUSE THEN
MY NEXT QUESTION IS,

01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:57.167
"WELL, LET ME JUST
TURN THE TABLES.

01:01:57.167 --> 01:01:59.400
"HOW ABOUT IF WE CALL
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.133
"A CIVIL UNION
OR A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP

01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:04.501
"AND MINE A MARRIAGE?

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.701
WOULD YOU GIVE UP
THE WORD 'MARRIAGE'?"

01:02:06.701 --> 01:02:08.634
GIVE UP THE WORD "MARRIAGE"
FOR EVERYONE,

01:02:08.634 --> 01:02:10.100
AND EVERYONE
HAS A CIVIL UNION.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.400
NOW, WHILE THAT MIGHT BE
SOME PEOPLE'S IDEA

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.167
OF THAT'S A PERFECT SOLUTION
FOR THIS.

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:15.968
AND THEN IF YOU GET MARRIED IN
A CHURCH IT'S CALLED "MARRIAGE,"

01:02:15.968 --> 01:02:18.367
THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:23.634
MARRIAGE IS THE INSTITUTION
AND THE VOCABULARY

01:02:23.634 --> 01:02:27.133
THAT WE USE TO DENOTE
THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:02:27.133 --> 01:02:29.667
OF A COMMITMENT
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:32.667
IT IS WHAT WE DO.

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:37.467
AND AS LONG AS WE DO THAT,
GAY AND LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS

01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:39.567
SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED
FROM IT.

01:02:39.567 --> 01:02:41.767
IT'S AS TERRY STEWART SAID
IN THE ARGUMENT

01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:43.334
BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA
SUPREME COURT

01:02:43.334 --> 01:02:45.534
WHEN SHE WAS ASKED
THIS VERY QUESTION.

01:02:45.534 --> 01:02:48.434
WORDS MATTER.

01:02:48.434 --> 01:02:52.167
THERE'S A REASON
WHY THIS LANGUAGE MATTERS

01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:54.968
AND WHY YOUR DAD--
WHO SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY PERSON,

01:02:54.968 --> 01:02:58.167
SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY DAD,
WHO I LOVE--

01:02:58.167 --> 01:03:00.267
WANTS TO ASK THAT.

01:03:00.267 --> 01:03:03.133
BECAUSE HE WANTS IT
TO GO AWAY...

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:07.267
INSTEAD OF A CONTINUING
CONVERSATION THAT SAYS,

01:03:07.267 --> 01:03:11.667
"THIS IS ABOUT US
AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS

01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:14.801
BEING ABLE TO BE VALIDATED
IN THE SAME WAY."

01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:17.000
NO DAD EVER SAID,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.868
"I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE
AT MY DAUGHTER'S CIVIL UNION,

01:03:19.868 --> 01:03:23.567
DOMESTIC PARTNER
COMMITMENT CEREMONY."

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:29.567
WE DANCE
AT OUR CHILDREN'S WEDDINGS.

01:03:29.567 --> 01:03:33.567
WE GET MARRIED.

01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:36.601
AND AS LONG AS THAT
IS THE WAY WE MARK

01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:40.801
IMPORTANCE IN RELATIONSHIPS
AND COMMITMENT,

01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:44.501
SAME-SEX COUPLES SHOULD HAVE
THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY.

01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:45.834
LaJeunesse: ALL RIGHT.

01:03:45.834 --> 01:03:47.567
HELP ME THANK KATE, PAT,
AND STEVE.

01:03:47.567 --> 01:03:51.167
[applause]
