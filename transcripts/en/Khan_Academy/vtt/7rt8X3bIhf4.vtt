00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.840
Problem number six.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.530
That's too skinny.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.140
I want to use this tool.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.620
Problem number six.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.210
I had to restart my computer,
so everything got reset.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.730
If m and k are positive, it's
fairly complicated.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.820
And they that 10m squared k to
the negative 1 is equal to

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:40.580
100m, what is m to the negative
1 in terms of k?

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.340
Let's see if we can simplify
that thing I wrote at the top.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.730
k to the negative one
is equal to 100m.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.830
Well let's divide both sides
by 10, you get m squared.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.110
k to the negative one-- that's
the same thing as m squared

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.360
over k-- is equal to, and we
divide the other side by ten,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.070
is equal to 10m.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.360
Let's divide both sides by m,
and they're positive, so we

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.130
can do that.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.870
So it's not 0.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.070
So you get m over k is equal
to 10, because m squared

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.550
divided by m is just 10.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.050
m is equal to 10k.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.720
But they don't want us to figure
out what m is in terms

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.490
of k, they want to know
m to negative one.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010
Well m to the negative 1 is just
1 over m, so if we just

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.450
invert both sides of this, we
know that 1 over m is equal to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.320
1 over 10k.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.880
That's the same thing,
of course, as m to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.450
the negative 1.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.630
And 1 over 10k, that's
choice D.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.090
Problem number seven.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.080
We are on problem number
seven, that

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.570
I will do in mauve.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.040
Edna and Nancy leave the house
for a common friend at the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.800
same time, and walk
for 4 hours.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.700
4 hours is how far they walk.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.450
Edna walks due east at
the average rate of 4

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.740
kilometers per hour.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.632
Nancy walks due north
at an average of 3

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:25.496
kilometers per hour.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.190
I'm doing this a little bit
messy, but you get the point.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.710
Nancy's going north, Edna's
going east. What is the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.070
straight-line distance between
them in kilometers at the end

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.860
of 4 hours?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.390
So this is Pythagorean
theorem.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.630
At the end of 4 hours, how far
has Edna traveled east?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.870
They're starting at the same
point, oh I don't like that.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.180
How far has Edna gone east?

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.480
Well, she's going to be
going 4 kilometers per

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.290
hour times 4 hours.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.160
And that equals 16 kilometers.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.690
That's how far Edna went
east. Now how far

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.740
did Nancy go north?

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.720
Well she went at, oh my god
I was using the line tool.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.970
Undo.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.530
So same thing, she went north
at 3 kilometers per

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.890
hour times 4 hours.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.540
So she traveled 12 kilometers.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.870
This is a Pythagorean
theorem problem.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.190
After 4 hours, Nancy's
there, Edna's there.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.200
And you just need to figure out
the straight-line distance

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.000
between them.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.250
We just have to figure
out this.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.330
And actually, a trick to this,
let's say that we want to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.620
solve for x, you could say that
x squared is equal to 12

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.899
squared plus 16 squared.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.570
And you could figure it out.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.140
Or you can make the further
realization that this is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.590
essentially a 3,
4, 5 triangle.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.580
You could say that this is 4
times 4, this is 3 times 4, so

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.100
this side is going
to be 5 times 4.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.050
If you remember your 3, 4, 5
triangle, Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.610
If you don't, just do this.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.640
You get x squared is equal
to 144 plus 256.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.500
So x squared is equal to
400, and then you get

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.270
x is equal to 20.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.330
So you could do it either way,
this would have been a little

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.510
bit less math.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.510
So x is equal to 20,
so it is choice E.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.000
East, the other one
walks north.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.250
This is choice E.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.600
Problem number eight.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.790
I'm using an old workbook that
was used by my cousin when she

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.200
was in seventh grade.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.370
She's now in tenth grade, and
she's marked up some of these

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.760
problems. So I have a little
bit trouble reading.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.870
And she was only in seventh
grade, but some of the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.130
problems are circled incorrect
so that's what's making me

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.360
second guess myself every
now and then.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.930
But anyway, back to the
problems. She now doesn't get

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.040
any problems incorrect,
back to the problem.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.950
She's actually the reason why I
started doing this, because

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.510
I worked with her, and
she saw improvement.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.020
And then I worked with her
brother, and they saw

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.130
improvement.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.700
And then I said, well let me
just make a bunch of videos,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.626
so a bunch of people can
see some improvement.

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:57.830
So let's see what they
have drawn here for

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.200
problem number eight.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.450
So let me draw the x-axis.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.030
Let me draw the y-axis.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.800
And then they drew a parabola.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.090
The figure above shows the graph
of a quadratic function

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.235
that has a minimum
at point 1, 1.

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:17.655
At the point 1 comma 1, it
has its minimum point.

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.485
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:06:19.485 --> 00:06:22.130
That's the minimum
point there.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.430
If f of b is equal to f of 3,
which of the following could

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.660
be the value of b?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.690
So on the graph they drew,
if you go to 3.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.350
1, 2, 3, and if you
just follow up.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.910
You go to 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, so you go up 5.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:52.630
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there's
a point here.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.910
And at least this side of the
parabola, or the quadratic,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.460
goes something like this.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.300
I'm trying to draw as carefully
as possible.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.850
And the other side
is symmetric.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.380
It'll do the same thing.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.760
And they say f of b is
equal to f of 3.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.690
So f of 3 is here, and if you
want to get the exact number

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.630
it's f of 3 is equal to 5.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.440
But that actually doesn't
even matter.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.300
Because this is 1, this
is the point 1, 1.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.460
This is the point, this
is x is equal to 3.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.290
And the big realization is, well
this is a quadratic, this

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.610
is a parabola, this is
it's minimum point.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.450
So it's going to be symmetric
around this point.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:44.160
So if it reaches 5 here, so it
took 2 units to reach 5 going

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.690
to the right, going in the
positive x direction.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.230
So similarly, it's going to take
2 units to reach 5 going

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.180
in the negative x direction.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.450
So what's 2 units less than 1?

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.750
So 1, 2, you'd get
to negative 1.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.230
So at b could be equal
to negative 1.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.450
Actually b would be equal
to negative 1.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.800
So the correct answer is C.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.356
The choice is b is equal
to negative 1.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.960
Let's see if I can squeeze
in problem number nine.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.900
Problem number nine.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.400
A family of 5 is planning
a 4-day camping trip.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.260
So 5 people times 4 days.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.330
Each person will need 1
bottle of water for

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.120
each day of the trip.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.549
So times 1 bottle per
day, per person.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.640
If water is sold only in
3-bottle packages, how many

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.490
packages must the family
buy for the trip?

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.670
Well how much water
do they need?

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.540
There's 5 people, 4 days, and
they each need a bottle of

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.460
water a day.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.220
So they need 20 bottles.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.090
And it only comes in packages
of 3, or multiples of 3.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.275
If they bought 6 packages it
would be 18 bottles, that's

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:03.780
not enough.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.330
So they have to get
7 packages.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.570
7 packages times 3 is equal to
21 bottles, so they have to

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.180
buy 7 packages.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.670
Not too bad.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.340
All right.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.180
I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.790
I'll see you soon.
