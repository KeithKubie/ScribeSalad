00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.341
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please welcome
Professor Jared Diamond.

00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:06.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.560
JARED DIAMOND: It's a
pleasure to be with you today,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.930
even though my 26-year-old twin
sons will laugh very hard when

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.540
they hear where I've
been today, because they

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.250
know my total
technological incompetence.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.980
And so I feel obliged to
warn you at the outset

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.100
that I am here under
false pretenses

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.610
if you think that I'm
capable of communicating

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.170
with you about
technological matters.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.130
But I can talk about books.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.960
And the occasion for
my being in New York

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.710
is the release of
a young persons

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.700
edition for the first
time of one of my books.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.050
It's the first of my books, "The
Third Chimpanzee," now being

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.490
released in a version
aimed at high school

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.160
students and middle
school students.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.730
The background to
my writing this book

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.900
and my writing subsequent
books was somewhat indirect.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.480
This book, the first of my
books for a broad public,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.060
was published when
I was 55 years old,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.520
so this came relatively
late in life.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.030
I got my PhD in the specialty
of studying sodium transport

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.810
in the gall bladder.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.280
I trained as a
laboratory physiologist.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210
And I was hired by
UCLA medical school

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.270
in 1966 to teach medical
students about the physiology

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.470
of gall bladders, intestines,
kidneys, and related organs.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.210
This book clearly is not in the
area of my research specialty.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.070
At the same time, I had become
a bird watcher, an amateur bird

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.490
watcher, when I
was seven years old

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.760
and continued bird watching
throughout high school,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.860
college.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.370
After I got my PhD, I was
interested in gall bladder

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.200
research and the challenges
of laboratory physiology.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.660
But it dawned on me
with growing horror

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.690
that I was expected to
devote the rest of my life

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.970
to writing papers on gall
bladders for the world's four

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.230
other gallbladder experts.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.060
That seemed confining.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.290
There are many other
interesting things in the world.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
In the course of the 1980s,
I began writing articles

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.100
about subjects other than
birds and gall bladders

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.260
for the weekly journals,
first "Nature" and "Science."

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470
And that led to my
writing articles

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.660
for so-called popular
science magazines, "Discover"

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.420
and "Natural History Magazine."

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.040
But I had still not
thought of writing a book.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.410
The triggering event
for me was the birth

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.420
of my wife's and my
twin sons in 1987,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.770
when I was nearly 50 years old.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.630
Until then, I had read
the sorts of things

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.820
that I'm sure that all of you
read about the things that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.730
may happen by such and
such a year if we continue

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.200
on our present course of
exploiting world resources.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.600
One reads that by 2050, the
world's tropical rainforests

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.690
will essentially
all be destroyed

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.650
outside of the Amazon basin
and perhaps parts of the Congo

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.590
basin.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.170
One reads that the
world's fisheries

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.410
will have largely
collapsed by 2040.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.400
One reads that
global warming will

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
have reached such and
such temperature by 2060.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.390
And until the birth
of my sons, whenever

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.050
people talked about
what would happen

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.770
in 2050, end of the rainforest,
because I was born in 1937,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.740
I'm not going to
be around in 2050.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.680
2050 was an arbitrary
unreal date.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.770
It might have been 2567.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.660
I can't get very excited about
things will happen in 2567.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.240
And I also could not
get excited about things

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.720
projected happen in 2050.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.130
Then our sons were born.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.070
And I realized with a jolt that
2050 is not an imaginary year

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.600
far off in the future.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.850
My sons will be 63
years old in 2050 .

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.280
They will be at the
peak of their lives,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.500
even short of the
peak of their lives.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.230
They'll have decades
ahead of them.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.550
So 2050 is not an
imaginary date.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.330
It's instead a very real
date for my children.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.290
And yet my wife and I
when our kids were born

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.040
began doing the
things that parents

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.530
do when children are born,
namely we drew up wills.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.360
We did estate planning.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.790
We bought life insurance.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.270
And I realized that
there was a disconnect.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.300
What on earth are we
doing drawing up wills

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.720
and buying life insurance
and forming a trust

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.110
if the world in which my
kids will find themselves

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.820
in the year 2050 is a
world not worth living in,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.030
if we've messed up the world?

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.640
It did not make sense for us
to be devoting this effort

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.620
to these practical
concerns of life insurance

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.280
if I was not also dealing with
the big problems of the world

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.150
that might make
the world of 2050

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.570
a world not worth
being around in.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.560
And so it was birth
of my twin sons

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.040
that motivated me to
start writing books

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.140
for a broad public to explain
issues of science and issues

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.850
of the world to
a public audience

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.790
and to try to motivate people
to take seriously the issues

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.840
that the world faces,
as well as to share

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.910
with people the excitement that
I feel in understanding how

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.710
the world works, which
is basically science.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.130
And "The Third Chimpanzee"
then was the first

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.720
of my books for a broad public.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.830
It's about how humans became
different from other animals.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.110
The reality-- and it came
out only in the 1990s,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.360
It's been known for a long
time, from the 1800s onwards,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.710
that the animal species
most closely related,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.970
most similar to humans,
is chimpanzees, the two

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.310
chimpanzee species of Africa,
the so-called common chimp

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.530
and the bonobo or pygmy chimp.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.280
But if one had asked a
biologist in the 1970s and 1980s

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.580
how big is the genetic
difference between chimpanzees

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.240
and humans, most of us would
have guessed, well, maybe

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:15.000
humans and chimps, maybe we
share 60%, 70% of our DNA,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.180
because we're really
very different.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.280
And therefore, it
was a big surprise

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.960
in the 1990s when DNA
sequencing and comparison

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.190
techniques revealed that
humans and chimpanzees are

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.930
98% identical in their DNA.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.050
There's only a 2% difference.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.720
So within some 2% of our
DNA is the explanation

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.420
for why we are sitting here
wearing clothes and talking

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.540
while our close
relatives the chimpanzees

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.770
are in zoos, instead of
chimpanzees being here

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.040
and us being in the zoos.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.580
It's also the case
that that 2% difference

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.940
of DNA between us
and chimpanzees

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.070
must explain all the
other interesting stuff.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.300
In that 2% must
be the explanation

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.200
for why we have language
and the chimpanzees

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.550
don't have language.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.610
There must be the explanation
for why we have art and music

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.650
and sculpture and
they don't have

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.470
art and music and sculpture.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.880
There must also
be the explanation

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.090
for why we make war
on a large scale

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.690
and they don't make
war on a large scale.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.010
And yet humans and chimpanzees
diverged only 6 million years

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.919
ago.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.250
And until about it
80,000 years ago,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.040
humans were not a very
remarkable species.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.380
Yes, we had a large brain.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.450
But we weren't doing
anything significant

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.410
with that large brain.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.090
It's only that 70,000
years ago the first signs

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.120
of art and rapid
technological innovation

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.210
show up in the fossil record.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.725
What that means is
that all the things

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.800
that we consider
distinctively human,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.100
such as art and
music and language,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.530
they must have
developed very recently.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.510
And that means that they
must have animal precursors.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.130
We ought to be able to recognize
those animal precursors.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.550
Well, we should be
able to recognize what

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.510
in chimpanzees human
art developed from.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.660
And we should be able to
recognize other animal

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.350
species that have carried
art to greater lengths, much

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.980
greater length, than
have chimpanzees.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.260
And so this first book of
mine, "The Third Chimpanzee,"

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:43.550
is about the evolution of
humans from our animal ancestors

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.060
and about the animal origins of
what's considered distinctively

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.530
human traits, including
language, art, music, addiction

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.730
to drugs, and
advanced technology.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.640
I wrote my books to
be understandable

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.570
to a wide public.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.520
I've always been
interested in understanding

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.530
things and explaining things.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.930
I have one sibling, a
younger sister, a year

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.610
and a half younger than I am.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.860
And so as I grew
up, I was always

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.940
explaining things to
my younger sister.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.920
When I began in the
1980s to write articles

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.680
about things other than
gall bladders and birds,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.730
they were things that were
not in my area of specialty,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.470
such as the development
of language.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.480
I had to ask the
experts in these fields

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.790
to explain their subjects
to me and to recommend

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.610
reading where I could
learn about early forms

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.980
of human language.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.220
In short, not only had I been
explaining things to my sister,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.070
but from the 1980s
onwards I was spending

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.130
a lot of my time trying to
explain to myself things

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.540
that were not my specialty.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.810
And so my books developed as
explaining to other people

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:13.030
complex subjects in the
same way that I had learned

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.090
to explain those complex
subjects to myself.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.550
Initially, when I published
"Third Chimpanzee,"

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.830
and then my subsequent books,
"Guns, Germs, and Steel,"

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.820
about the long-term pattern
of human history, "Why

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.630
is Sex Fun?" about human
sexual evolution, "Collapse,"

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.060
about how societies
succeed or fail

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.090
at managing their
problems, most recently

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.560
"The World Until
Yesterday," comparing

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.320
traditional tribal societies
with modern state-level

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.150
societies, these books
are about-- they're

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.960
longish books, most of
them up to 500 pages,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.170
except for "Why is Sex Fun?"
which was only 167 pages,

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.970
because after 167 pages, I had
to admit I didn't understand

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.580
why sex is fun in an
evolutionary sense.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:10.430
But the books are still
about complex material.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.200
And it did not occur
to me that my books

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.790
might get read in schools.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.200
And therefore, it
surprised me in the 1990s

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.630
when I started giving
talks on my books

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.790
to find that regularly in the
audiences for my book tours

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.030
there would be school classes.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.040
And the school classes, high
school classes, middle school

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.790
classes, often were the most
motivated of my listeners.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.042
They would come up afterwards.

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.250
They would want books signed.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.690
They would want photographs.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.270
They would be very excited.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.975
Some of them had made
t-shirts with a picture of me

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:48.750
or with my name on the t-shirt.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:56.140
And so I was discovering
that school students find

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:02.080
these big questions as
interesting as do adults.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.440
Then came another
wake-up event for me,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.490
which again involved my sons.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.980
By the time my sons were in the
seventh grade, because they're

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.380
twins, they were
at school together.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.230
And one day my sons
came home from school

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.400
and they were angry at me.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.050
And I didn't know
what I had done

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.750
to arouse their
justified wrath that day.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.430
So I asked them,
what's the matter?

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:33.016
And they said, Daddy, your book
has been assigned to our class

00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:35.690
today.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.260
And we haven't read it.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.140
But we know without reading
it that it's a bad book.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.180
And worst of all, our teacher
invited you in to give a talk

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.920
to our class.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.550
And you accepted.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.450
And that is so embarrassing.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.910
You are going to humiliate
us in front of our classmates

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.086
by showing the stupid things
that you do and write about.

00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:05.090
Well, I'd already accepted.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.750
And so I came to my sons'
seventh grade class.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.390
My two sons were seated
in the next to back row.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.550
And I've never seen such a
portrait of utter humiliation

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.730
and embarrassment.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.060
They were sitting there averted.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.760
Their faces were red.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.620
They were all
scrunched up, trying

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.290
to make themselves as
invisible as possible,

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.240
because their father was about
to start talking and showing

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.880
their classmates, talking to
their classmates about things

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.280
that their classmates
would utterly despise.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.400
So I started talking
about my book.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.260
And my sons' classmates
were sitting up.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.425
And they were listening.

00:14:50.425 --> 00:14:52.420
And they were
beginning to smile.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.820
And they were interested.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.140
And they laughed at
the appropriate places.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.150
They began asking me questions.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
They were really quite relaxed.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.780
It became clear to my
sons that their classmates

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:09.800
found these big questions
as interesting as do adults.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.556
And gradually my sons rotated
around to face forwards.

00:15:13.556 --> 00:15:14.930
And their bodies
straightened up.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.240
And smiles came on
their face as they

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.845
saw that this was OK
with their classmates.

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:24.580
And after that
lecture, my sons have

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.340
become among the devoted
backers of my books.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.540
If my sons hear that I
got a negative review

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.320
or that someone criticized
some aspect of my book,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.076
my sons immediately
become indignant.

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:41.780
Well, that episode
then brought home to me

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.080
that these big questions
of science and history

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.800
and technology engage
not only adults,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.350
but that they also
engage young people.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.790
In retrospect, that's
I think not surprising,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.310
because the subjects of my
book-- each book that I've

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.170
written has been about
whatever at the time

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.560
seemed to me the most
interesting unsolved problems

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.150
of human nature after the
previous book of mine.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:20.610
"Third Chimpanzee," then, about
human evolution from animals.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.380
Another big question that was
the subject of "Guns, Germs,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.090
and Steel," as I look
out at you today,

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.330
it looks to me like the
great majority of you

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.430
are of Old World
origin, that's to say

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.690
of European or Asian
or African background.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.290
And yet if we could have been
at this spot 500 years ago,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.424
every person here
would have been

00:16:43.424 --> 00:16:47.060
of Native American origins.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.780
Why did history
turn out that way?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.520
Why was it that Europeans came
and occupied the New World?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.160
Why was it not instead the case
that Native Americans expanded

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.950
and occupied the Old World?

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.070
Or why didn't Aboriginal
Australians, why were not they,

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.930
or why weren't Africans the
ones to expand over the world?

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.160
That really is the biggest
question of human history.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.119
But historians have not
answered that question for us.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.520
And yet everybody in the
United States walking

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.349
around can see the
people around them.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.390
And already children
have to ask themselves,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:28.630
so why is it this way?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.250
But historians have not
provided the answer.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.470
And in the absence of an
accepted answer to this biggest

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.790
question of history,
why was it Europeans

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.680
who expanded around the world,
in the absence of an accepted

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:46.030
answer, people have to come
up, at least unconsciously

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.100
or without saying
it, with an answer.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.640
And everybody can see that
people look different,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.440
that people have different
faces, hair color, skin

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.780
color, and eye color.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:00.440
And therefore people assume that
inside those different faces

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.230
lie different brains and
the different brains are

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.700
the explanation for the broad
pattern of human history,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.400
although there is no evidence
whatsoever to support

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.130
a hypothesis of genetic
differences of intelligence

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.930
between peoples of
different continents.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.720
And indeed, there's evidence
in the opposite direction.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.450
So young people find these
questions interesting

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.080
just as do older people.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:43.520
Recently the first of my
books, "The Third Chimpanzee,"

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.680
was prepared in a version
addressed specifically

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.070
to young people, even though
the adult version was already

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.850
being sold in schools
and read in schools.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.670
And I wondered, well, the
adult version is already

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.770
being sold in schools.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.140
What does one need a
children's version for?

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:10.470
I saw the produced young
people's version myself

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.120
for the first time, the
finished version, the day

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.830
before yesterday.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.670
And I must say it is very
user-friendly, compared

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:25.930
to my adult books, which are
500 pages long and dense.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.800
The young people's version
contains the material

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.060
of the adult version.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.630
It has 16 chapters.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.560
The adult version as 19
chapter, so some of the material

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.330
has been compressed.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.260
And the language is
a little simpler.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.350
The sentence
structure is simpler.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.000
I tend to write with a sentence
structure of the German author

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.350
Thomas Mann, that's to say long
sentences with many examples.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.050
My wife, who is my first
editor for all my books,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.270
my wife always says when she
sees a manuscript of my book,

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.530
her first response
is always the same.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.810
Jared, why do you have
to wait until page five

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.930
to say what this
chapter is about?

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.360
Say it on the first page.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.260
Jared, why do you have
to give 37 examples when

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.320
2 examples would suffice?

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.400
And so in the version of
"The Third Chimpanzee"

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.370
for young people, those
of the 37 examples

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.730
that survived my
wife's comments have

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.830
been reduced to a
couple of examples.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.980
Technical terms are
explained more carefully.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.950
And the layout is a neater
layout than my adult books.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.930
My adult books, because
there's lots of material,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.040
the print goes towards the
top and bottom of the page

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.130
and out towards the margins.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.200
But you'll see that this
young people's version has

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.920
a much more inviting,
user-friendly layout.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.030
An interesting story
in this connection

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.640
is that my books
have been translated

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.800
into many foreign languages.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.160
And as any of you who speak
a foreign language other

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.260
than English know the length
of text or the length of speech

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.800
that it takes to say something
in a foreign language

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.680
differs among languages.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.120
For example, I'm just back
from a lecture trip to Italy.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.090
And in Italian it
takes about 10%

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.100
more text to say
something than in English.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.090
In German, it takes
about 30% more text

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.410
to say something
than in English.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.710
And a year ago, when my book
"The World Until Yesterday"

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.790
came out in a German
edition, I went to Germany

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.390
to do publicity for it.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.480
And I was with my best
friends in Germany.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.750
My best friend
said to me, Jared,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.540
when you write your
next book, could you

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.200
please make it shorter, because
this book, 800 pages long,

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.340
it's so heavy that when
we lie in bed at night

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.930
and would like to
be reading it, it's

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.720
just too heavy to
hold and read in bed.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.490
So this young person's
version is shorter.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.156
But it's got the essence
of the adult version.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:13.230
Why does it make a difference
for not just adults but also

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.830
young people, school
people, to understand

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.760
these big questions of history
and science and of the world?

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.190
Partly it's because
these big questions

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.390
are as interesting
to them as to us.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.870
The other reason is
that young people

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.590
are the ones who are
going to be affected

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.000
by the consequences of
what we are doing now.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.760
Certainly I will
not be around to see

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.910
the end of the
tropical rainforests.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.675
And many of you here
will not be around to see

00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:45.050
some of the things
that are going

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.570
to happen in years like 2070.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.910
But people who are
in high school now

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.050
will be seeing
what happens, will

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.780
be living with the
consequences of what

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.670
the world is like in 2070.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.060
So the present
school generation,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.220
they're the ones who will face
the results of the decisions

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.770
that we're making now
based on our understanding

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:17.380
or lack of understanding
or scorn for science.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.700
That's a strong reason
for the engagement

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.890
of school people with these big
issues of science and history.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.020
Often I hear the question,
when young people get

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.940
involved in these big questions
of science and history, so

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.930
what can young people do to
make the world a better world?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.080
My estimate is that
the chances are

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.540
about-- I would describe
myself as a cautious optimist.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.900
By that I mean that I rate
the chances as about 51%

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.200
that the world after 2050 will
be a world worth living in

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.410
with first world conditions,
and the chance at 49% that it

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:02.220
will be irrevocably messed up.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.930
Whether we have a happy
landing or an unhappy landing

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.040
depends upon our own decisions.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:16.030
So what can young people do
to make the right decisions,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.890
to motivate all of us to
make the right decisions?

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:23.210
One thing that they can do is
that pretty soon or already,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.290
high school students are
going to be able to vote.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.710
So I always tell young people
when they ask what can we do,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.000
first thing I say is vote.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.740
The United States has
the lowest voter turnout

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.550
for elections of
any major democracy.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.880
Even presidential
elections get only 60%

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.600
of Americans turning out.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.460
The most recent election
for mayor of Los Angeles,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.370
my city Los Angeles,
one of the largest,

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.680
most important cities in
the United States, only 20%

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.130
of Los Angelenos
could be bothered

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.550
to vote for mayor
of their own city.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.330
If government makes
bad decisions,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.610
we have only ourselves
to blame for it,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.430
for not getting engaged with
elections, for not voting.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.740
And so one thing I tell
young people is vote

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.320
as soon as you're able to vote.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.490
Not only vote, but also
talk to your friends

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.950
and talk to other people
and encourage them to vote.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.020
And share your views with them.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.650
Voting really makes a
difference in the United States.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.780
There are spectacular examples
within the last 10 years

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.140
of important elections
that got decided

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.840
by rather narrow margins.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.970
Was it the 2000 presidential
election, in effect

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.240
got decided by a margin
of several 100 votes

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.570
in the state of Florida?

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.460
Or conversely, you
can say it got decided

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.660
by one vote on
the Supreme Court.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.850
Some years ago, the election
for governor of Washington

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.470
was decided by something
like 167 votes.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.510
That means that if 17 people
who did not vote had voted

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.950
and each of them had
talked to and persuaded

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.720
10 of their friends, that
election for governor

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.590
of Washington could
have been overturned.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.270
So something that
young people can do

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.630
is to vote and persuade
their friends to vote.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.030
Another thing that
people in schools can do

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.090
is to talk to their parents.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.230
Young people, having
learned more recently,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.780
may be more current
about important issues

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.530
than are their parents.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.790
Young people don't have
such rigidified minds

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.300
as their parents do.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.820
Talking in the business world,
I have friends in Microsoft.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.270
And I have friends
in hedge funds.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:54.410
And so I've talked a lot of
people in the business world.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.080
There are many people
in the business world

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.570
who don't take environmental
issues seriously.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.780
There are also lots of
people in the business world

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.970
who do take social and
environmental issues seriously.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.910
And I frequently
hear reasons why

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.860
people in the
business world started

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.530
to take environmental
issues seriously.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:18.400
It's that they
came home and there

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.990
was their teenage
son or daughter.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:26.660
And the 14-year-old daughter
asks her CEO mother or father,

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.710
Mommy or Daddy, what did you
do in your business today?

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.660
And by the way, what do you
think of the climate change?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.910
And the mother or father
responds, climate change.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.430
What is that green nonsense
that you are learning in school?

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.850
Climate change is the
biggest hoax ever.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.320
And I'm really disgusted that
your school is wasting time

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.170
on these environmental matters.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:54.920
Whereupon the 14-year-old breaks
into tears, explodes in fury,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.640
says, Mommy, you are loathsome,
ignorant, and disgusting.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.540
And I'm not going to talk to
you until you educate yourself.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.880
That really gets the
attention of a parent.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.310
And I have friends in
the business world,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.070
some high-placed friends
whom I will not name,

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.860
who had a transformative
experience

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.260
as a result of their
teenage child telling them

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.800
what they should
be learning, or had

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.430
a transformative experience, as
did I, as a result of starting

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.850
to get concerned about the
world that their children would

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.580
be launched into.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.210
So in short, what can
school children do?

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.660
Pretty soon they can vote.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.860
They can encourage
other people to vote.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.870
They can talk to their parents.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.620
If their parents' knowledge
is 40 years out of date,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.480
as is quite likely, they
can provide their parents

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.930
with more up-to-date knowledge.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.260
They have a pipeline
to their parents

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:03.280
that their parents
employees do not have.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.530
They can really influence
the views of their parents.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:10.400
And then finally, there are
many things, many active things

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.900
that people can do
already when in schools.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.850
The day before yesterday,
while I was in Boston,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.440
someone in an audience
that I was talking to

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.900
explained to me that there
is a program in Boston

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.090
for planting trees on
a large-scale basis.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.250
And the person being
interviewed was a 15-year-old

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.880
who was involved in that
tree planting program.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:48.900
My own kids took part in
a march on the UCLA campus

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.940
to call attention to
problems of rainforests.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.950
My kids in their
kindergarten class

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:59.520
did that already when my
kids were six years old.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.470
Young people can
start to get involved

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.890
in environmental movements and
social movements, many of which

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:13.090
have a youth organization
associated with it.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.870
And pretty soon young people
will start earning money.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.990
When they earn money
and when and if

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.020
they acquire some
disposable money,

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.350
they can start donating
their disposable money

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.820
to causes of their choice.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.060
It may seem like
a waste of effort.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.940
Why should you give $100 to
some environmental or social

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.630
organization?

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.900
What can $100 do for
the world's problems?

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.560
Well, the reality is that
effective environmental and

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.320
social organizations, like World
Wildlife Fund and Conservation

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.190
International and
others, they're

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.100
very good at attracting
matching funds.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.020
So typically, every
$100 that ends up

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.114
as a donation to World Wildlife
Fund gets parlayed into $700,

00:31:05.114 --> 00:31:09.250
seven times as much, by
attracting matching funds

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:14.210
from governments and from
various nongovernmental

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.190
organizations.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:20.280
So if you think that giving
$100 isn't going to do any good,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.290
think of it as giving $700.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.120
And $700 is enough to
launch an initial survey

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.530
of some primate species, some
monkey species in Africa that

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.050
otherwise would not
have an initial survey.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:37.280
Those are then things that
young people can do and can

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.360
motivate their parents to do.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.490
All of that, then,
is the background

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:47.910
to my pleasure at seeing a young
people's edition of my book

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:51.200
"The Third Chimpanzee"
coming out.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.990
I hope that it will
increase interest

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.000
in schools for these big
questions of technology,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.290
science, and history, even
beyond the interest that there

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:03.270
is now.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.900
Well, that's all
that I wanted to say.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.990
But I'm sure that
many or most of you

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.560
have been young people
recently or have

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.420
experience with young
people, children of your own,

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.840
or impending
children of your own.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.790
And I'm sure that you also have
thoughts about these subjects.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.730
So let's use the
rest of the time

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.190
today for your own thoughts
and your own questions

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.050
about these matters.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.942
I see there's a microphone
there and a microphone here.

00:32:28.942 --> 00:32:31.150
So any of you who would like
to say something, please

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.774
feel free to come up
to the microphone.

00:32:35.462 --> 00:32:36.980
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jared.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.790
So I recently came across
your essay called something

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.150
like "The Worst Mistake in
the History of Humanity."

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.307
You ended it on a
pretty depressing note.

00:32:46.307 --> 00:32:48.140
And I was wondering in
the intervening years

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.600
if you think there's any hope
for coming back from that

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.450
or fixing the problems that
agriculture has created.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.910
JARED DIAMOND: Yeah.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.010
When one looks at the
problems of the world,

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:04.720
certainly I go back and
forth between being depressed

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.350
and being optimistic, or
being cautiously optimistic,

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.060
or being very optimistic.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.720
When I wrote that essay, I
was in a pessimistic mood.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.470
In the last several years--
so in the last several years

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.817
there are more and
more people exercising

00:33:20.817 --> 00:33:22.150
more and more destructive power.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.290
But there have also been some
developments for the good

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.770
in the last several years.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.610
Three years ago most
Americans did not

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.220
accept the reality of
global climate change.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.250
Now most Americans
do accept the reality

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.500
of global climate change.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.650
10 years ago large
multinational corporations

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.400
tended to be dismissive
of environmental concerns.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.120
Now many big multinational
organizations,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.090
such as Walmart and
Chevron and Coca-Cola,

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.160
are very concerned about
environmental issues,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.270
because they recognize
that it is a life and death

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.130
matter for them, that it
affects their bottom line.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.270
Coca-Cola is mostly water.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:06.180
And if Coca-Cola cannot
get clean water in Tanzania

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.500
or in the 89 other countries
of the world where Coca-Cola

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.409
bottles Coca-Cola, then
Coca-Cola is out of business.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:18.449
So that's why the chair of the
board of World Wildlife Fund

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.230
now is the former
CEO of Coca-Cola.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.409
In short, in response
to your question,

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.449
I wrote that essay at a
time when I felt pessimistic

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.770
and there will I'm sure be
other reasons in the future

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.960
to be pessimistic.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.570
But at the moment, I'm
cautiously optimistic.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.860
As I say, my
ratings now are 51%.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.426
And I hope they'll go higher.

00:34:40.426 --> 00:34:41.260
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.190
JARED DIAMOND: Yes?

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.600
AUDIENCE: So thank you
for your introduction

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.704
on why you wrote this book.

00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:49.480
So I wonder about the
2% difference in genome.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.969
Could you show examples
of other species

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.929
that are at a 2%
difference or less?

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.904
Because otherwise, I can't tell
if 2% is significant or not.

00:34:59.904 --> 00:35:01.320
JARED DIAMOND:
Very good question.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.670
Thank you for raising that.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.020
I did not talk about it.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.080
So what is the significance
of a 2% difference?

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:16.560
A rule of thumb in birds and
mammals is that, for example,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.740
the most abundant forest
bird in North America

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.960
is the Red-eyed Vireo.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.270
And there's another
abundant forest bird

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.240
called the White-eyed Vireo.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.260
The Red-eyed Vireo and
the White-eyed Vireo,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.070
they're both Vireos that
clown around in the treetops.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.430
The genetic difference between
Red- and White-eyed Vireo

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.940
is 2%.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:46.150
The rule of thumb then
is that 2% or even 1%,

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.210
the difference between
the common chimpanzee

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.830
and the bonobo, the
pygmy chimpanzee, in DNA

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.970
is about 1.5%.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:57.950
So 2% is the difference
between well-marked species.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.390
But it's not a spectacularly
big difference.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.610
Again, to calibrate
it, the difference

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:09.980
between humans and Neanderthals,
modern humans and Neanderthals

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.460
is considerably less than 1%.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.020
And it's now clear that
humans and Neanderthals

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.690
hybridized to a limited extent.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.850
Common chimps and pygmy
chimps, about 1.5%.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.490
Humans and both of
those chimps, 2%.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.150
Humans and gorillas about 2.5%.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.260
Humans and orangutans,
maybe 4% or 5%.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.590
Humans and old world
monkeys, maybe 9%.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.447
So does that then calibrate
these differences?

00:36:35.447 --> 00:36:36.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.460
JARED DIAMOND: That's
a very good question.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:37.959
Yeah?

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.550
AUDIENCE: We're at
Google, so we really

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.730
respect like real-time data.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.400
In your comment about how
people accept global warming,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.550
today the Gallup
Poll released data

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.400
in their long-term
consistent polling

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.800
on the subject of
global warming.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.630
And they discovered that
the US population's concern

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.560
for global warming
peaked in 2007.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.150
It has since dropped
significantly

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:16.410
from a 40% concern in
2007 to a 34% percent

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.450
of people being
concerned about it today.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:25.370
The interesting question would
be why are we going backwards?

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.480
JARED DIAMOND: Why are
we going backwards?

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.230
Good question.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.100
Reasons that we
are going backwards

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.960
are that we need more clear
explanations of science.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.060
The great majority of
scientists don't make an effort

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.540
to communicate the
results to the public.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.140
Those few, that minority
of scientists who do

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.270
try to explain science to
the public often get flak

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.560
from other scientists
for doing so.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.270
The reaction of other
scientists to so-called science

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.530
popularizers is he or she
is writing for the public

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.732
because his or her
research is washed up.

00:37:58.732 --> 00:38:00.440
And there's nothing
else to do, so that's

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.880
why he or she is
writing for the public.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.360
That's part of the problem.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.080
Another part of the
problem is that the science

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.260
of global climate change
is really complicated.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.630
At the end of
January, I was asked

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:19.050
to give a talk to a hedge fund
group on global climate change.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.080
And I must say, I had to
work for a couple of weeks

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.590
to understand the
material, elementary things

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.330
such as global warming.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.965
So on the average, the world's
temperature is increasing.

00:38:31.965 --> 00:38:34.340
Wouldn't you think that that
would be good for the world,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.260
because higher temperatures
mean more crop growth,

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.320
so it ought to mean more food?

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.930
The reasons why
higher temperatures

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.870
don't mean more food
are complicated.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:49.590
They include the fact that high
temperatures mean faster growth

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.610
not only of wheat,
but also of weeds.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.340
And on the average,
weeds benefit more

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.415
from higher temperatures than do
the crops we're interested in.

00:38:58.415 --> 00:39:01.240
In the case of wheat,
which is the major food

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.640
crop of the world,
higher temperatures

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.480
mean that the wheat
matures earlier,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.030
when there's less seed produced.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:13.920
In short, the science
involved is complicated.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.040
And scientists haven't
made the effort

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.540
that they should be making
to explain the science.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.300
And then there's politics.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.680
There are people,
there are businesses

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.310
that make money by
doing things that

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:30.850
are bad for the environment,
such as the fossil fuel,

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.540
such as segments of the
fossil fuel industry.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.610
And when there are
things that are

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.930
bad for people's
pocketbooks, that

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.930
influences what they
believe to be the truth.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.950
Yes?

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.548
"The Third Chimpanzee,"
the original one,

00:39:48.548 --> 00:39:50.250
was one of my favorite books.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.050
And I already felt that
it was very accessible.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.270
Now, when I read "Guns,
Germs, and Steel,"

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.520
that one was far
less accessible.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.090
But that one felt to me
like it had an underlying

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.809
message of humans
aren't so different.

00:40:02.809 --> 00:40:04.600
Groups of humans are
not necessarily better

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.350
than other humans.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.800
That's not why,
say, Europeans are

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.750
better than people from,
say, South America.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.130
What are reasons that you
chose to make a young people

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.540
version of "The
Third Chimpanzee"

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.289
instead of "Guns,
Germs, and Steel," which

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:20.732
seems to have a little
bit more social relevance?

00:40:20.732 --> 00:40:21.940
JARED DIAMOND: Good question.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.364
So why did I choose to make
a young person's edition

00:40:26.364 --> 00:40:28.780
of "Third Chimpanzee" and not
of "Guns, Germs, and Steel?"

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.090
The answer is, I didn't choose.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.210
Instead, it was proposed to
me by Seven Stories Press

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.460
to do a young person's
edition of "Third Chimpanzee."

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.050
Previously a school teacher,
Boston school teacher

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.730
with experience in
writing for young people,

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.780
had proposed to do a young
person's edition of "Guns,

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.090
Germs, and Steel," but the
rights to "Guns, Germs,

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.190
and Steel" are held
by another publisher.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:57.500
And the other publisher did
not want a children's version,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.190
because the other publisher
was concerned that a children's

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.770
version would decrease
rather than increase

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.890
sales of the adult version.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.490
In the case of
"Third Chimpanzee,"

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.100
it remains to be seen whether
the young person's edition will

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.770
increase or decrease sales
of the adult version.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.680
So in short, it
wasn't my choice.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.290
As for what you said about
"Guns, Germs, and Steel,"

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.810
I agree with you that
"guns, Germs, and Steel"

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.850
is a more complicated book
than "Third Chimpanzee,"

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.230
because it's dealing with
more complicated questions,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.389
the reasons why
agriculture arose

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:32.930
in certain parts of
the world but not

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.230
in other parts of the world.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.850
They don't jump into your face.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.670
So it's a more complicated book.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.510
Also, I must say in
retrospect that I

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:49.255
think "The Third Chimpanzee"
is the most engagingly written

00:41:49.255 --> 00:41:51.020
of my books.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.866
And that's partly because
in "Guns, Germs, and Steel"

00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:57.270
and "Collapse," I had
to work really hard

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.010
to explain complicated things.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:05.640
And the result is a
writing style more focused

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.760
on clarity of explanation,
without as much

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.557
of the humor and liveliness that
there is in "Third Chimpanzee."

00:42:13.557 --> 00:42:14.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:17.632 --> 00:42:19.033
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:42:19.033 --> 00:42:21.680
I'm a big fan of your books.
"Guns, Germs and Steel"

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.020
question.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.250
So I was wondering,
a lot of the reasons

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.960
that there was disparity as
described in "Guns, Germs,

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.020
and Steel" was due
to like geography

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.680
or access to different
agricultural techniques

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.750
and plants, et cetera.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.120
Now that that's kind of
disappeared with technology,

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.390
I still see a lot of
disparity in the world.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.850
Why isn't that going away
more quickly, in your opinion?

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.670
JARED DIAMOND: Why
hasn't disparity

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.770
in the world gone away when
"Guns, Germs, and Steel" is

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.180
about the consequences
of an initial disparity

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.410
10,000 years ago?

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.560
A short answer to
your question would

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.620
be that the disparity in the
origins of agriculture 10,000

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.010
years ago, which
produced disparity

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:12.890
in the origins of technology,
because the growth

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.610
of technology depended upon
having enough food to feed lots

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.610
of people, and surplus food
to feed people who would

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.625
sit in the village and
play with dirt and fire

00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:23.550
and eventually
stumble on the idea,

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.220
stumble on the discovery
of smelting copper.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:30.940
The differences around the world
in the origins of agriculture

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.480
had to do with the
differences around the world

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.820
in domesticable wild
plant and animal species.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.140
The differences in wealth
around the world today

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.560
are partly a historical
legacy of those origins

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.060
of agriculture.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.390
That's to say, those places
that developed agriculture first

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:56.090
got a head start on areas that
didn't develop agriculture,

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.520
or that developed less
productive agriculture.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.200
California, for example, the
breadbasket of the United

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.730
States now, Native
Americans in California

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.410
never developed
agriculture for themselves,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.890
even though California
is obviously

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.430
a great place for agriculture.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.610
The reason is that
California is not home

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.940
to domesticable wild
plant and animal species.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.600
But once agriculture developed,
first in the Fertile Crescent--

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.325
the area that today is
Iraq, Iran, Syria and so on.

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.950
It developed there
first because that's

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.320
was home to wild wheat and
barley and pigs and sheep

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.360
and so on.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.000
And once those
plants and animals

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.600
had been domesticated and
then spread out of the Fertile

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.110
Crescent, the Fertile Crescent
then had no further advantage.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.550
Its advantage had
spread to Europe,

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.270
which is much more
fertile land and richer

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.150
soil than the Fertile Crescent.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.070
And so Europe rather quickly
overtook the Fertile Crescent.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.200
Reasons today why
there are differences

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.790
in wealth around the world,
why the world's richest

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.950
country, Norway
and Luxembourg, has

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.390
a per capita income
about 400 times

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.880
the per capita income of the
world's poorest countries,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.580
like Burundi, the
differences are partly

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.820
differences in history,
history giving different head

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.790
starts to different parts world.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.260
Partly it's due to
differences in geography.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.100
The Tropics are
just less productive

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.830
agriculturally than the
temperate zones because

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:24.260
of thinner, less fertile
soils and more soil pests,

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.330
more disease problems
in the Tropics.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.460
There's a big role of
differences in institutions.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.810
Countries that for
one reason or another

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.760
are corrupt or have
ineffective governments

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.800
or don't enforce contracts or
don't obey the rule of law,

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.860
institutions-- I would say
institutions provide about half

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.739
of the explanation.

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:48.280
And the other half
of the explanation

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.560
for the differences in wealth
around the modern world

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.940
are these effects of
geography and history.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.141
Does that address your question?

00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:55.766
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:55.766 --> 00:45:56.266
We'll see.

00:45:56.266 --> 00:45:58.790
I was also wondering
about a prediction

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.840
of if it would disappear
rather quickly soon,

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.232
or if it's going to
be a slower process.

00:46:04.232 --> 00:46:05.440
JARED DIAMOND: Good question.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.523
Really important question.

00:46:06.523 --> 00:46:07.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.231
JARED DIAMOND: Will
those differences

00:46:09.231 --> 00:46:12.730
in wealth around
the world disappear?

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:17.990
Well, we see that within
the last 50 years,

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.430
some countries that
used to be very poor

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.430
have achieved first
world standards.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.670
South Korea was desperately
poor 50 years ago.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.840
Malaysia was poor.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.960
So there are some countries
that have gotten rich quickly.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.210
China is in the process
of increasing its living

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.650
standards.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:46.490
And so economists talk now of
a convergence economically,

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:49.430
opposed to the divergence
in last centuries

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.930
as Europe got far ahead
of the rest of the world.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.360
But there are still big
differences in wealth and power

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.160
around the world.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.020
And they are important,
because poor countries,

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.530
in poor countries we have
who are desperate and don't

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.190
see any hope.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:06.610
People in those countries
will support-- they're angry.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.050
They'll support terrorists.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:10.850
And we're not going
to have a world

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.870
worth living in 50 years from
now unless on the one hand

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.680
we get control of our
environmental problems

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.100
and on the other hand unless we
succeed in reducing the wealth

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.020
gap between rich
and poor countries,

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.840
because nowadays frustrated
people in poor countries

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.135
have ways of venting their
anger, as you in New York

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:32.867
know very well, at
people in rich countries.

00:47:32.867 --> 00:47:33.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.019
JARED DIAMOND: Yeah.

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.060
AUDIENCE: Yes, Professor.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.190
Thank you so much for giving
this talk, first of all.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.940
I wanted to ask on your
thoughts of over-population

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.780
essentially over the
course of the next century,

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.390
in regards to
whether society will

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.220
be a livable place
over the next 50 years.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.460
In the 20th century
alone, the population

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.430
exploded at a rate that
was unseen over the course

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.610
of human history.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.219
And as other nations
continue to industrialize,

00:47:59.219 --> 00:48:00.760
it's only going to
get-- there's only

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.634
going to be more of us
until that trend tends

00:48:02.634 --> 00:48:03.667
to reverse itself.

00:48:03.667 --> 00:48:06.000
So I wanted to know what your
thoughts are on that role,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.789
and what we can do to at least
work with that in such a way

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:12.830
through the next-- as we
deal with climate change

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.940
and as we deal with
all these other issues.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.356
JARED DIAMOND:
Very good question.

00:48:16.356 --> 00:48:19.370
So the importance of population.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:22.160
World population is now a
little over seven billion.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.260
The projections, if
population increases

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.910
with the same first derivative
and second derivatives

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.550
that it has at the
moment, the estimates

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.940
are that world
population may level off

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.110
at around nine billion.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:41.710
But that's not something with
which we should be satisfied,

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.565
because we're already,
already in this world of seven

00:48:44.565 --> 00:48:47.450
billion people, there
are several billion

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.090
of those seven billion
people who are starving.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:56.660
As countries industrialize,
the population growth rate

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.500
drops dramatically.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:03.680
In fact, I think virtually all
first world countries today,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.480
with the possible exception
of the United States,

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.390
have birth rates below
the replacement level.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:15.050
What's maintaining
population growth in Europe

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.740
is immigration.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.710
In the United States,
population growth

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.430
is partly immigration,
partly high birth rates.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:25.660
But in Japan, the population
has started to contract.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.680
But it's correct that
a large population

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.630
is a strain on the
world's resources.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.320
What can be done about it?

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:40.580
Here are two of the simplest
things to do about it.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.250
Examining what happens in
countries around the world,

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.570
examining those countries
that have succeeded

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.350
in decreasing their birth rate.

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.250
One of the best predictors
of a decrease in birth rate

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.580
is the empowerment of
women by enabling women

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.150
to have paying jobs.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:56.910
For example, in Bangladesh.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.660
Bangladesh, one of
the poorer countries

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.610
of the world,
Bangladesh incredibly

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:03.790
has reduced its
population growth rate.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.660
I think it's now something like
2.3% per year, which is barely

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.420
above the replacement level.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.640
The reason is that
there have been

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.300
lots of jobs, so-called
sweatshop jobs,

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.950
available for women
in Bangladesh.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.640
And there were protests in the
first world about the low wages

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.550
that they're paid.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.470
But those low wages
mean that the women

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.249
have the money themselves.

00:50:23.249 --> 00:50:25.290
They don't need to get
money from their husbands.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.660
And one of the first things
that Bangladesh women want

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.460
to do when they have
money is to secure access

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.890
to family planning.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.140
I've also seen
this in New Guinea.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.740
The New Guineans know
about family planning.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.040
But they don't have
access to means.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.700
So in answer to your
question, the first thing

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.500
to do to halt
population growth rate

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.450
would be to provide
economic opportunities

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:52.150
for women in poor countries.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.680
And the other thing is
that one of the worst

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.940
offenders, possibly the
worst single offender,

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.500
in dealing with the
world's population problems

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:05.670
is the United States
government and its policies.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:12.760
The United States is not
willing to provide foreign aid

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.660
to countries tied to
family planning measures.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.800
But family planning is a
matter of sanity and survival.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.280
And it is utterly insane for
it to be a policy of the United

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:31.840
States government to interfere
to prevent access of family

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.130
planning means to
countries that want

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.070
to regulate their
own population.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.155
It's not that Americans are
telling the women of Bangladesh

00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:40.600
to have fewer children.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.560
The women in Bangladesh
know perfectly well

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.772
what's in their interest.

00:51:44.772 --> 00:51:46.480
My New Guinea friends
know perfectly well

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.090
what's in the interest.

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.860
And it is tragic for
the United States

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:59.750
directly not to promote the
spread of family planning

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.120
around the world.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.390
It's no accident that a source
of support for terrorism

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.140
is Pakistan, which
is-- remember,

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.920
Pakistan was a single country
until something like 1971

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.380
when it broke apart into
East and West Pakistan.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.280
And we now have a
controlled experiment.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.260
In Bangladesh, family
planning was embraced.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.030
In Pakistan, family planning
has not been embraced.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.890
And the result is the
Bangladesh population growth

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:29.830
rate near the replacement level.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:32.840
And in Pakistan, it's a couple
times the replacement level.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.340
Sorry.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.080
That's a long-winded, passionate
answer to your question.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.049
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:37.049 --> 00:52:37.840
JARED DIAMOND: Yes?

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:43.160
So you talk about the world
worth living in in 2050.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.190
And I haven't read your books.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:48.660
But I picked up a book
on eco-socialism once.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.890
And it presented a sort
of convincing argument

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.530
that the only chance
we have at surviving

00:52:55.530 --> 00:53:00.130
is, step one, socialism,
step two, a massive planned

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.780
contraction of
the world economy,

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.370
and then step three,
sort of disposing

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:08.040
industrial civilization
and no longer

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.130
kind of mass producing anything.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:13.320
And I sort of
bought the argument.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.170
And I'm willing to give
up a lot of things.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:22.530
But I wouldn't be willing to
give up computers and even

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:27.600
big data centers and stuff,
because that's how I have fun.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.620
And so to me, that wouldn't be
a world worth living in either.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.190
So I'm kind of
interested in what

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.270
is the extent of
sacrifice we have

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:40.276
to make to produce a
sustainable society?

00:53:40.276 --> 00:53:42.310
JARED DIAMOND: A big
important question.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:47.230
My view is
essentially your view.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.990
It's often felt--
and this may be

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:53.890
behind the thesis of the book
that you're talking about.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.110
People often say,
there's no way that I'm

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:01.620
going to sacrifice my
standard of living, especially

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.590
for those people out
there in Somalia or Nepal.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.560
I'm not willing to give up
my computers and my access

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.870
to food and my
ability to travel.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.690
But we don't have to give
up our standard of living.

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:22.140
Something like half of
American energy consumption

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.600
is wasted energy
consumption that does not

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.650
contribute to our
standard of living.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:30.420
A test of that is that the
energy consumption per person

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.530
in Europe is about half
that in the United States.

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.170
And yet by any reasonable
measure, the standard

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:38.100
of living, the quality
of life in Europe

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.070
is at least as high as
that in the United States.

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.600
And it's because
European countries

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.190
do a lot that in
the United States

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.840
would be decried as
socialistic, but which basically

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.660
is policies aimed at the
public good and policies aimed

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.890
at preventing
individuals from doing

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:59.960
bad things to the
rest of the world.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.860
So in short, the United
States could easily

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:07.540
reduce its energy consumption,
its consumption in general,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:10.250
without lowering its
standard of living, in fact,

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.760
I would say increasing
its standard

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.480
of living to European levels.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.167
You don't have to sacrifice.

00:55:16.167 --> 00:55:17.450
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.590
JARED DIAMOND: Yes?

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:20.960
AUDIENCE: You spoke at
the beginning about art

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.512
and sculpture and music
and language being

00:55:24.512 --> 00:55:25.970
I forget how many
tens of thousands

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:28.550
of years, less than
100,000 years old.

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:32.170
But music and spoken
language in particular

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.380
would leave no trace.

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.194
What do we know about how
old they really could be?

00:55:37.194 --> 00:55:38.610
JARED DIAMOND:
Very good question.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.170
Really interesting question.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:40.980
What do we know?

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:46.182
What's the evidence for how old
music and language and art are?

00:55:46.182 --> 00:55:48.140
Let's leave language to
the end, because that's

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.350
the most difficult.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:50.150
Music.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:51.950
People make musical instruments.

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.610
And musical
instruments have been

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:57.360
found going back to
about 40,000 years.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.730
There are flutes carved of
bone from Paleolithic Europe.

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:06.440
So our first evidence for
music, musical instruments,

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.150
is 40,000 years ago.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.000
There could have
been, of course, music

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.120
that does not involve
instruments that ended up

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.020
in the archaeological record.

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:18.510
As for art, the earliest
evidence of preserved art

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.250
is roughly 70,000
or 80,000 years ago.

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:25.120
That art consists
of ostrich eggs that

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:34.560
are perforated in Africa
and colored stones and trade

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:41.570
in amber across Europe and
then ochre, red pigment.

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:45.340
So the earliest evidence for
art is about 70,000 years ago.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.940
One can say, maybe
there was art,

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.660
maybe there was music that did
not leave preserved remains.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.230
That's possible.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.740
As for language,
that's more difficult,

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:59.670
because language
doesn't fossilize.

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:02.920
There's been discussion, debate
about whether Neanderthals

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.080
had language.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.850
With the sequencing of the
Neanderthal genome recently,

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.680
there's much interest in
the parts of the genome that

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.950
are associated with language.

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:17.440
The debate is still open
about where Neanderthals

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.480
had complex language with
grammar as do modern humans.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.530
To me, the strongest
piece of evidence

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.590
is that I would have
thought-- this my hypothesis--

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.230
that once people get
language and can start

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:34.500
talking and brainstorming
and storehousing information,

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.320
you're going to get an explosion
of invention and technology.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.510
But the explosion of
invention and technology

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:42.770
does not begin in the
archaeological record

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:46.500
until within the
last 100,000 years.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.190
And so it's my guess that
complex language also

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.610
emerged within the
last 100,000 years.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.890
But I would say that probably
half of archaeologists

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:57.410
would disagree
with me about that.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.330
In short, the
origins of language

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.070
and the time of the
origins of language

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:04.660
is still a fascinating
unresolved question.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.928
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:05.928 --> 00:58:07.380
JARED DIAMOND: Yeah?

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.140
AUDIENCE: So I was
raised with the idea

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.380
that many of the institutions
that we have now in the United

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:18.340
States and in Europe came
about or were made possible

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.010
through violent revolution.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:24.440
Is this accurate in your view?

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:30.160
And do you see a role,
helpful or not helpful,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.950
for violent
revolution in bringing

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:37.740
about the change necessary
to have a livable world 100

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.000
years from now?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.680
JARED DIAMOND: The
reason that I began

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.610
smiling as you formulated
your question was that I'm now

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:50.070
working on a new book, for
which I was reading material

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.120
this morning.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.290
And one of the questions
in the new book

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:57.110
is about the relative
importance or frequency

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.520
of violent revolution
on the one hand

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.674
and peaceful evolution
on the other hand.

00:59:01.674 --> 00:59:04.090
My a new book will look at
countries around the world that

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.930
underwent change, and
is asking the question

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:09.260
about the relative importance
of violent revolution

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.660
and peaceful evolution.

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:16.220
Preliminarily I can say
there are cases of each.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:21.410
The United States did have
a revolution 1776 onwards.

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:24.100
The United States also
made a major change

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.960
in the 1930s, the New
Deal, that did not

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.150
involve violent revolution.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:32.860
Britain changed greatly
from 1945 onwards,

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:38.390
adopting a social welfare
state, dismantling its fleet.

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:41.240
That did not involve
violent revolution.

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.670
Chile changed massively in 1972.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.040
That did involve
violent revolution

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.160
of a particularly horrible sort.

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.420
Indonesia achieved
independence in 1948.

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.260
That required, that involved
violence against the Dutch.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.210
Indonesia then had its
own revolution in 1966,

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.910
when Indonesians killed about
two million other Indonesians.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.520
That was a violent revolution.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.200
Since 1966, Indonesia
has changed greatly.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.580
But there has not been
a violent revolution

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.180
So a short answer
to your question

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.480
is I can find examples
on both sides.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.610
And if you could ask me that
question four years from now

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:24.210
when I've finished
my book, I'll be

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.880
able to tell you whether
I discern any pattern.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.670
At the moment, I've not
yet discerned a pattern.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.110
Yes?

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.600
AUDIENCE: This
question goes back

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.710
to the 2% difference between
chimpanzees and humans

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:37.960
in the genes.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.840
I'm wondering if this
is the right metric,

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.490
because as an analogy,
take any large computer

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:45.840
program that we have here.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.330
I can change very few
bits here and there

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:50.880
to make it behave like
something completely different.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.410
And it's the same thing,
if I understand correctly,

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:56.290
we have something
epigenetics that deals

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:58.666
with how you control these
genes that are getting

01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:00.040
triggered on and
off so you could

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.680
have the exact same
genes, but they

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.100
could behave very
different people

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.980
with just a few bits of
information and they changed.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.960
So the question is, then are
we looking at the right metric

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.100
to say, you could have
much smaller differences

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.145
in the genes itself, but
if the differences are

01:01:15.145 --> 01:01:16.520
of the right kind,
then you could

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.940
have completely different
behaviors exhibited by them.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.700
So how then-- do we have
a better explanation

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.760
for the differences that we see
between chimpanzees and humans

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.359
other than that, well,
it's a scalar 2% number?

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.650
JARED DIAMOND: You are correct.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:37.020
2% is a crude metric for the
overall difference in DNA.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.680
But different segments of
DNA do different things.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.500
And one might expect that
a change in the DNA that

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.980
control the structure
of the voice box

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.980
and the language processing
areas of the brain

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.190
would have much
heavier consequences

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.600
than a change in DNA for the
length of one's fingernail

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.340
or for the amount of hair
on top of one's head.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.840
One of the major efforts
in molecular genetics

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:12.190
now is in effect the approach
that you are talking about,

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.880
not being satisfied with saying
that there's a 2% difference--

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.820
all right, we knew
that, we learned

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:22.610
that 20 years ago-- but trying
to find out where the 2% is

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.410
and what of the
2% is significant.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:26.680
Lots of DNA is
thought to be junk.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.320
If 90% of DNA is junk, then
the salient differences

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.840
between us and chimpanzees
aren't in 2% of our DNA.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.230
They're in 0.2%
percent of our DNA.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:42.220
And almost every month now
or every couple months now,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.700
one sees a paper in
"Nature" or in "Science"

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:51.230
focusing on particular areas
of human DNA or Neanderthal DNA

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.160
and trying to
understand what are

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.850
the differences between
human and Neanderthal DNA,

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.520
or what are the differences
between human and chimpanzee

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.180
DNA.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.210
So yes, you are correct.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.954
And that's a major research
program at the moment.

01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:04.861
Yeah?

01:03:04.861 --> 01:03:07.110
AUDIENCE: Regarding of violent
revolution specifically

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.030
in Chile, I just finished
"Shock Doctrine."

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.840
I don't know if you've read it.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.605
But it has a lot to
say about the nature

01:03:11.605 --> 01:03:13.730
of violent revolutions,
and sometimes that violence

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:15.580
has something to do
with people coming

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.690
to power that want to
have economic programs

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.870
such as radical capitalism,
for example, that leaves

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:24.740
the vast majority of people
out of wealth and prosperity

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.955
and then it requires violence
in order to enforce those ideas.

01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:30.330
So I was just going to recommend
"Shock Doctrine" to you.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.270
That's all.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.080
JARED DIAMOND: Again,
an interesting question

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.760
on which I'm going to reserve
judgment for several years

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.110
until I've looked at
more of a database.

01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:48.120
Yes?

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.040
AUDIENCE: Can I cheat
and get a second one?

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.052
This is data again.

01:03:53.052 --> 01:03:55.694
And I'd like to speak
against the need

01:03:55.694 --> 01:03:56.652
for violent revolution.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.980
This year in New York
City the winter air

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.090
is cleaner than it
has been in 50 years.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.120
50 years.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.030
It turns out that it only took
three years, the last three

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:13.610
years, to get it to that point.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.310
What happened was
that it was discovered

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.200
that 1% of the
buildings in the city

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.230
were producing as much
pollution as all the cars

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.390
and trucks in the entire city.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:24.890
Yet, every one of
those buildings

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:28.114
could actually save money
by using cleaner methods.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.530
So what we did was we went to
those buildings and we said,

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.730
look.

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.380
You can save money
by being cleaner.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.730
And we got the law changed.

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:34.830
It was easy to get
the law changed,

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.371
because once you could tell the
mayor, Bloomberg at the time,

01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:41.240
and the City Council that you're
forcing people to save money,

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.440
they changed the law.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.570
And now it's illegal in
New York City-- well,

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:46.790
there are a couple
buildings until 2015

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.950
can do it-- to burn what's
called number six fuel oil.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:54.690
The air is cleaner today
than it's been in '50 years.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.630
Totally quiet.

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:56.960
Nobody knows about it.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.580
Didn't even raise a noise.

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.040
There was no violence involved.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.100
But we've accomplished
big things.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.237
If one goes through
the problems we have,

01:05:05.237 --> 01:05:06.320
yeah, you do have choices.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.080
You can have violent revolution.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.569
But the other
approach, and I think

01:05:09.569 --> 01:05:11.360
you'll discover this
if you look carefully,

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.330
is that most of the problems we
have have profitable solutions.

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:18.400
What we have to do is we have
to have the courage, the balls,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.140
and the persistence
to go out and find

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:24.680
the profitable solutions
and to encourage

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.080
people to do those things.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.570
To a great extent, we
don't need sacrifice

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:30.660
to solve these problems.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.620
What we need is we need
wisdom and we need courage.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.340
JARED DIAMOND: That's a
very good way to put it.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.630
I like your term
profitable solutions.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:41.420
And I'll give you
an example of it.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.860
On the board of
Conservation International,

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.310
the international
environmental organization

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:48.950
that I'm involved
with, on the board

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.660
is the son of the
founder of Walmart.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.250
So profitable
solutions for Walmart.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:01.040
Walmart 10 years ago
was not at all concerned

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.940
about environmental matters.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.435
And then Walmart woke up
a really elementary fact,

01:06:06.435 --> 01:06:09.690
namely that Walmart has
the largest private fleet

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.400
of trucks in the United States.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.300
I think it's second only to the
US government fleet of trucks.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.640
And the fuel efficiency
of Walmart trucks

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.070
was rather bad, six
miles per gallon.

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:22.100
Walmart was not
getting any benefit

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.010
from having these lousy
fuel-burning trucks.

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.380
In fact, they were wasting
a lot of money on it.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:30.000
And so Walmart
embarked on a program

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.940
to increase the fuel
efficiency of its trucks

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.060
to 18 miles per gallon, which
means a profitable solution,

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.640
saving 2/3 of their
expenditure for truck fuel.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.340
Some of the solutions
were simple.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.490
Truckers, truck drivers
have to pull over

01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:49.120
every 10 hours or so by law.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120
And if they're not
near a motel, they

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.680
pull over in the truck
by the side of the road.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.550
And if it's hot out
or if it's cold out,

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.940
they turn on the heater
or the air conditioner.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.810
Well, until relatively
recently, Walmart trucks

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.120
in the cabin, heated
or air conditioned

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.520
by leaving the motor
of the truck running.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.600
Walmart got the
elementary idea, we

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.130
can put a space heater or
a space air conditioner

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:17.700
in the cabin and not keep
running the motor just

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.770
in order to keep the
cabin warm or cold.

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:24.060
And then Walmart
has been working

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:28.760
on developing hybrid trucks,
so these are like Priuses,

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.030
but they're gigantic,
these 18-wheeler Priuses,

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:33.050
hybrid trucks.

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.950
Walmart has also been--
it has some trucks

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:41.180
running on biofuels, namely the
chicken drippings that come off

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.650
of fried chicken in supermarkets
and department stores.

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:48.600
Those drippings get
converted into fuel.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.610
And so Walmart
has biofuel trucks

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:56.160
running on in effect
processed chicken drippings.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.355
What this boils down to
is this is another example

01:07:59.355 --> 01:08:01.580
of profitable solutions.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.190
Walmart is reducing
fossil fuel consumption.

01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:07.380
But they're saving
money in the process.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.895
And one of the reasons why I'm
cautiously optimistic, rather

01:08:10.895 --> 01:08:13.360
than pessimistic, one of
the reasons why I'm not

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.080
going to tell you
let's all go outside

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.220
and commit a mass suicide, a
reason for my cautious optimism

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.240
is that within the last
decade lots of increasing

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.069
numbers of big companies
have discovered, as you say,

01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:25.940
possible solutions.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.029
I like your term.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:28.710
Perhaps that's a
good upbeat note

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:32.040
on which to end the formal
part of the discussion.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.419
Any of you want
books signed, I'm

01:08:33.419 --> 01:08:34.710
happy to sign books afterwards.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:44.768
[APPLAUSE]
