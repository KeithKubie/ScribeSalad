00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.828
- [Voiceover] We've
already seen multiple times

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:04.051
that glycolysis is the process

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:06.125
where we start with a glucose molecule

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.709
which has six carbons and
we're able to break it down

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.662
into two pyruvate molecules

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:12.520
which each have three carbons.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.086
And in the process of doing so,

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:17.497
we produce a net of two ATPs,

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:21.464
we reduce NAD+ to NADH,

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.833
we're adding a hydride
anion, so this is reduction,

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.321
this is reduction going
on right over there

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.839
and then we say, "Well, what happens?"

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.102
and, of course, we have the
water, some water produced

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:34.818
and some hydrogen ions.

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:36.977
But then the next question
is, well what happens next?

00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:39.662
And we could talk about
cellular respiration

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.227
and that's what will happen
in many organisms including...

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.038
It's happening in my body right now

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:46.719
in order for me to generate
as much ATP as possible.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.240
That's why I inhale oxygen.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.247
Because that oxygen is needed
for cellular respiration.

00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:53.699
But sometimes there isn't oxygen around

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.040
or I'm the type of organism
that just doesn't use oxygen

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.629
or doesn't conduct cellular respiration.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.795
Now we've already seen one example of that

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.876
and that was lactic acid fermentation.

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:08.760
It's a way of recycling these NADH's,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460
oxidizing them back.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.317
Oxidizing them back to NAD+.

00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:15.491
So this oxidation,

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:19.845
this oxidation from NADH to NAD+,

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.941
this is what we do in fermentation.

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:23.915
Actually, both variations of fermentation

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.320
that we're going to talk about.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.514
And lactic acid
fermentation, we talked about

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:31.043
taking the pyruvates to oxidize the NADH

00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:33.562
and in doing so the pyruvate
turns into lactic acid

00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:37.254
and that's used in yogurt
production, in sauerkraut,

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:38.775
it's also used in your muscles,

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.713
when your muscles run out of oxygen.

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.582
If you're kind of sprinting
or your lifting some

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:44.022
really really really heavy weights,

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:48.040
you probably have some lactic
acid fermentation going on.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.152
But now we're gonna talk about
another type of fermentation

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.054
and that is alcohol fermentation.

00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:54.912
Alcohol.

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:59.065
Alcohol or sometimes called
ethanol fermentation.

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:00.716
Ethanol fermentation.

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:02.515
Because when we talk
about drinking alcohol,

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:04.117
we're talking about ethanol.

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:06.182
Ethanol

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:09.622
fermentation.

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:12.151
And as you might guess,
this is the process

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.239
by which alcohol is produced
and things like bread.

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.771
It's used in baking a lot.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.478
But let's first think about the reaction

00:02:18.478 --> 00:02:19.778
and then we'll talk about

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:22.274
maybe where you might
have encountered it last.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.340
So we saw that pyruvate...

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790
When we finish glycolysis, we have,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.891
for each molecule of glucose,

00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.598
we have two molecules of pyruvate

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:32.954
and so each of these
molecules of pyruvate...

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:36.890
The first step is they
lose their carboxyl group

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.270
right over here and that's facilitated by

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.777
pyruvate decarboxylase.

00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:43.694
This name is all about getting rid of

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.771
a pyruvate's carboxyl group.

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:47.651
And you can see, when you
remove a carboxyl group,

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.277
it's a carbon and two oxygens,

00:02:49.277 --> 00:02:50.995
that is going to be,

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.794
and I'm not showing you the
detailed mechanism here,

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:55.371
but that's going to be a carbon dioxide

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.819
that is released and then what's leftover,

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.986
what's leftover, and once again

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:02.640
I'm not showing you
the detailed mechanism,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.913
but you can account at
least for the various atoms,

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:09.413
what's leftover is acetaldehyde.

00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:12.048
Acetaldehyde, I have trouble saying that.

00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:13.268
And then the next step,

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:16.448
the acetaldehyde can be reduced.

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:17.435
One way you can think about it,

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:20.975
you can say it's reduced by the NADH

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.833
to turn into ethanol.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.088
It's a similar mechanism

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.050
to what we saw in lactic acid fermentation

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.497
where we went from
pyruvate to lactic acid,

00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.551
but now it's acetaldehyde
going to ethanol.

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.933
So this right over here,

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:37.735
this is, this is reduced.

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:38.807
Reduced.

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.944
It gains a hydride.

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:42.069
One way to think about it is

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.286
it's gaining a hydride anion

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:47.908
and in the process that
this is being reduced,

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:50.591
the NADH is being oxidized.

00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.666
So this, this is being oxidized.

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:55.803
And the whole point of this,

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.068
the whole reason why it occurs

00:03:57.068 --> 00:03:59.053
is so that you can oxidize the NADH

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:04.053
to have more fresh NAD+ for
glycolysis to occur again.

00:04:04.173 --> 00:04:06.692
And as I mentioned in the video
on lactic acid fermentation,

00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:08.004
it's a little bit of a shame,

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:11.161
because the pyruvate
still has energy into it.

00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:12.264
If you had oxygen around,

00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:13.426
you could have cellular respiration,

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:14.621
you could go into the Krebs cycle,

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.009
the citric acid cycle,

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.709
and derive more energy from it.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.844
The NADH also, the
process of oxidizing it,

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.490
in theory, you can use it
to generate more energy.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.605
But we're not doing that

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.369
when we do either type of fermentation

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:27.704
whether ethanol fermentation

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:31.223
or we're talking about
lactic acid fermentation.

00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:32.870
But this is a process that has

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.368
proven very useful for human civilization.

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:39.012
This right over here,
the most famous actor

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.926
when we're talking about
ethanol fermentation

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:45.501
or alcohol fermentation is
this character right over here.

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:47.800
This is a yeast cell.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.818
Yeasts are categorized as fungi.

00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:52.258
That is a yeast cell.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:55.543
It's a handful of micometers in diameter,

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:56.901
although they can vary.

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:58.446
And variations of yeast are used

00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:02.207
in things like bread
making and wine making

00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:03.437
or alcohol production.

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.259
Beer, whatever you wanna talk about.

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.123
Because what the yeast does,

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:11.096
it uses, it digests the
sugar, it performs glycolysis

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.563
and then it performs alcohol fermentation.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.776
What makes bread so fluffy
is this step right over here.

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:20.886
When the carboxyl group gets
stripped off of the pyruvate

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:23.382
facilitated by the pyruvate decarboxylase,

00:05:23.382 --> 00:05:25.425
and the carbon dioxide gets released,

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:26.842
it makes the bread fluffy.

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:28.281
It bubbles through the dough

00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:31.015
and gives it its nice spongy flavor.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:32.843
But you also have ethanol being produced.

00:05:32.843 --> 00:05:34.171
So it's actually an interesting fact

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:35.803
that a lot of bread...

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:36.941
You know, I've been reading up on it,

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.514
a lot of the ethanol might get baked off,

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:41.329
but bread will usually have

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.799
trace amounts, trace
amounts of alcohol in it.

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:47.289
So bread will have trace amounts,

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.470
trace amounts of ethanol in it

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.630
because the whole process,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.173
you're using yeast to leaven the bread.

00:05:53.173 --> 00:05:54.858
To give it this fluffiness,

00:05:54.858 --> 00:05:56.706
that yeast is performing glycolysis

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:59.430
and alcohol fermentation
is producing ethanol

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.905
and in the process the carbon dioxide

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:02.926
that gives the fluffiness
but there's still going to be

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:07.163
some trace amounts of ethanol.

00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:08.961
Now, of course, if you're
talking about wine production,

00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.437
your goal is to get to the actual ethanol

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:15.625
which we view as traditional
drinking alcohol.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:20.625
So yeast plays a fairly
important role in our society.
