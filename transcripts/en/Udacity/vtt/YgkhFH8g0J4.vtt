00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.969
There are two more software process models that I want to cover, so

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.120
bear with me. The first one is the Rational Unified software Process

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.500
or IUP, which is s a very popular one based on UML.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.620
RUP works in an iterative way, which means it that it performs different

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.360
iterations. And at each iteration, it performs four phases. So what I'm

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.030
showing you here, is a high level view of the process. And I

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.630
don't want you to focus on all the different details, because we

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
will discuss these details later on, in a lesson that is actually dedicated

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.470
to RUP. What I want to give you now, is just the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.020
gist of how this works. So, in each one of these four

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.680
phases, which I'm going to describe in a second. We perform standard software

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.060
engineering activities, the ones that we just discussed. And we do them

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.320
to different extent, based on the phase in which we are.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.841
In particular, in the inception phase the work is mostly to sculpt

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.940
the system. So basically figuring out what is the scope of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.220
work, what is the scope of the project, what is the domain.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.670
So that we can be able to perform initial cost

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.190
and budget estimates. The operational phase is the phase in which

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
we focus on the domain analysis and define the basic architecture

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.030
for the system. So this is a phase in which analysis

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.290
and design are particularly paramount. Then there is a construction phase,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.250
which is where the bulk of the development actually occurs. And

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.640
as you can see here, is where most of the implementation

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.280
happens. And finally, the transition phase is the phase in which

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.090
the system goes from development into production, so that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.380
it becomes available to users. And of course, this is

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.480
the phase in which the other activities in software

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.710
development become less relevant and deployment becomes the main one.
