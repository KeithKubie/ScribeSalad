00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:01.166
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.441
is get a little bit of
practice subtracting

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.670
in scientific notation.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.670
So let's say that I have
4.1 x 10 to the -2 power.

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:15.956
4.1 x 10 to the -2 power

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:19.137
and from that I want to subtract,

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:24.137
I want to subtract 2.6,
2.6 x 10 to the -3 power.

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:29.191
Like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.700
and see if you can solve this on your own

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.999
and then we could work
through it together.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.344
All right, I'm assuming
you've had a go it.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.130
So the easiest thing
that I can think of doing

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.592
is try to convert one of these numbers

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:43.749
so that it has the same,
it's being multiplied

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.280
by the same power of ten as the other one.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.952
What I could think about doing,

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:52.294
well can we express
4.1 times 10 to the -2?

00:00:52.294 --> 00:00:56.566
Can we express it as
something times 10 to the -3?

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:01.566
So we have 4.1 times 10 to the -2.

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:06.156
Well if we want 10 to the
-2 to go to 10 to the -3

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:09.871
we would divide by 10, but
we can't just divide by 10.

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:12.146
That would literally change
the value of the number.

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:13.261
In order to not change it, we want

00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.351
to multiply by 10 as well.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.578
So we're multiplying by
10 and dividing by 10.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.086
I could have written it like this.

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.963
I could have written 10/10 times,

00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:26.565
let me write this a little bit neater.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:30.536
I could have written 10/10 x this

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:34.437
and then you take 10 x 4.1, you get 41,

00:01:34.437 --> 00:01:37.246
and then 10 to the -2 divided by 10

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:39.095
is going to be 10 to the -3.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.554
So this right over here,
this is equal to 10 x 4.1

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:47.554
is 41 times 10 to the -3.

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:49.218
And that makes sense.

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:54.218
41 thousandths is the same
thing as 4.1 hundredths

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:56.672
and all we did is we
multiplied this times 10

00:01:56.672 --> 00:01:58.831
and we divided this times 10.

00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.945
So let's rewrite this.

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:04.945
We can rewrite it now as 41 X 10 to the -3

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:11.075
minus 2.6, -2.6 x 10 to the -3.

00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:16.895
So now we have two things.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:21.702
We have 41 X 10 to the
-3 - 2.6 x 10 to the -3.

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:24.674
Well this is going to be the same thing as

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:28.598
41 - 2.6.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:33.265
- 2.6, let me do it in that same color.

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:35.331
That was purple.

00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:39.902
- 2.6, 10 to the -3.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:43.186
10, whoops, 10 to the -3.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.995
There's 10 to the -3
there, 10 to the -3 there.

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:48.550
One way to think about it,
I have just factored out

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.895
a 10 to the -3.

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:53.751
Now what's 41 - 2.6?

00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:58.751
Well 41 - 2 is 39, and then
-.6 is going to be 38.4.

00:03:02.527 --> 00:03:05.198
38.4 and then you're going to have

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.263
times 10 to the -3 power.

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:10.979
x 10 to the -3 power.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.394
Now, this is what the product,

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:16.041
or this is what the difference
of these two numbers is

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:18.363
but this is no longer
in scientific notation.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.429
In order to be scientific notation

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:25.429
this number right over
here has to be between 1,

00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:27.859
has to be greater than or equal to 1

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.876
and less than 10.

00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:34.593
So what we could do is we
could divide this number

00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:36.543
right over here by 10.

00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:40.374
We can divide this by 10
and then we can multiply,

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.998
then we can multi...so we could do this.

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:46.405
We could, kind of the opposite
of what we did up here.

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:49.407
We could divide this by 10
and then multiply by 10.

00:03:49.407 --> 00:03:50.939
So if you divide by 10 and multiply by 10

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.541
you're not changing the value.

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.790
So 38.4 divided by 10 is 3.84

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.508
and then all of this business,

00:03:58.508 --> 00:04:03.508
10 to the -3, 10 to the -3
x 10 is 10 to the -2 power.

00:04:05.103 --> 00:04:10.103
So this is going to be
3.84 x 10 to the -2 power.
