00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.270
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.440
Well, the idea of
this first video

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.400
is to tell you what's coming,
to give a kind of outline

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.350
of what is reasonable to learn
about ordinary differential

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.960
equations.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.890
And a big part of
the series will

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.610
be videos on first order
equations and videos

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.220
on second order equations.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.540
Those are the ones you
see most in applications.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.950
And those are the ones you
can understand and solve,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.440
when you're fortunate.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.520
So first order equations
means first derivatives

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.620
come into the equation.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.300
So that's a nice equation
that we will solve,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.660
we'll spend a lot of time on.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.420
The derivative is-- that's
the rate of change of y--

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.980
the changes in the unknown
y-- as time goes forward

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.120
are partly from depending
on the solution itself.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.490
That's the idea of a
differential equation,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.460
that it connects the changes
with the function y as it is.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.220
And then you have
inputs called q of t,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.880
which produce their own change.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.330
They go into the system.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.170
They become part of y.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.040
And they grow, decay,
oscillate, whatever y of t does.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.270
So that is a linear equation
with a right-hand side,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.980
with an input, a forcing term.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.570
And here is a
nonlinear equation.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.740
The derivative of y.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.700
The slope depends on y.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.870
So it's a differential equation.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.490
But f of y could be y squared
over y cubed or the sine of y

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.530
or the exponential of y.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.660
So it could be not linear.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.450
Linear means that
we see y by itself.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.740
Here we won't.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.590
Well, we'll come
pretty close to getting

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.620
a solution, because it's
a first order equation.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.800
And the most general first
order equation, the function

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.720
would depend on t and y.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.370
The input would
change with time.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.000
Here, the input depends only
on the current value of y.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.840
I might think of y
as money in a bank,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.300
growing, decaying, oscillating.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.920
Or I might think of y as
the distance on a spring.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.950
Lots of applications coming.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.850
OK.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.700
So those are first
order equations.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.220
And second order have
second derivatives.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.050
The second derivative
is the acceleration.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.740
It tells you about the
bending of the curve.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.536
If I have a graph, the
first derivative we know

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.780
gives the slope of the graph.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.720
Is it going up?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.750
Is it going down?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.680
Is it a maximum?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.070
The second derivative tells
you the bending of the graph.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.020
How it goes away
from a straight line.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.020
So and that's acceleration.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.340
So Newton's law-- the
physics we all live with--

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.980
would be acceleration
is some force.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.620
And there is a force that
depends, again, linearly--

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.200
that's a keyword-- on y.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.270
Just y to the first power.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.115
And here is a little bit
more general equation.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.930
In Newton's law,
the acceleration

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.910
is multiplied by the mass.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.450
So this includes a physical
constant here, the mass.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.040
Then there could
be some damping.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.200
If I have motion, there may
be friction slowing it down.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.070
That depends on the first
derivative, the velocity.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.740
And then there could be the
same kind of forced term

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.420
that depends on y itself.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.720
And there could be some outside
force, some person or machine

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.156
that's creating movement.

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:34.270
An external forcing term.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.170
So that's a big equation.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.210
And let me just
say, at this point,

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.470
we let things be nonlinear.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.780
And we had a pretty good chance.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.140
If we get these
to be non-linear,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.740
the chance at second
order has dropped.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.590
And the further
we go, the more we

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:03.000
need linearity and maybe
even constant coefficients.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.890
m, b, and k.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.570
So that's really
the problem that we

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.910
can solve as we get good at
it is a linear equation--

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.240
second order, let's say--
with constant coefficients.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.740
But that's pretty
much pushing what

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.480
we can hope to do
explicitly and really

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.720
understand the
solution, because so

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.420
linear with constant
coefficients.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.440
Say it again.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.600
That's the good equations.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.680
And I think of
solutions in two ways.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.030
If I have a really nice
function like a exponential.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.460
Exponentials are
the great functions

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.950
of differential equations, the
great functions in this series.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.420
You'll see them over and over.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.650
Exponentials.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.310
Say f of t equals-- e to the t.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.230
Or e to the omega t.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.420
Or e to the i omega t.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.090
That i is the square
root of minus 1.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.750
In those cases, we will get
a similarly nice function

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.990
for the solution.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.100
Those are the best.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.120
We get a function that we
know like exponentials.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.830
And we get solutions
that we know.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.860
Second best are we get some
function we don't especially

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.180
know.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.260
In that case, the
solution probably

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.130
involves an integral of
f, or two integrals of f.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.760
We have a formula for it.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.820
That formula includes
an integration

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.540
that we would have to
do, either look it up

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.010
or do it numerically.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.930
And then when we get to
completely non-linear

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.280
functions, or we have
varying coefficients,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.010
then we're going
to go numerically.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.340
So really, the wide,
wide part of the subject

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.610
ends up as numerical solutions.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.570
But you've got a
whole bunch of videos

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.890
coming that have nice
functions and nice solutions.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.450
OK.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.560
So that's first order
and second order.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.980
Now there's more, because
a system doesn't usually

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.100
consist of just a single
resistor or a single spring.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:50.370
In reality, we have
many equations.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.560
And we need to deal with those.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.350
So y is now a vector.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.300
y1, y2, to yn.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.950
n different unknowns.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.820
n different equations.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.070
That's n equation.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:08.060
So here that is
an n by n matrix.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.320
So it's first order.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.690
Constant coefficient.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.870
So we'll be able
to get somewhere.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.840
But it's a system of
n coupled equations.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.240
And so is this one with
a second derivative.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.280
Second derivative
of the solution.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.680
But again, y1 to yn.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.020
And we have a matrix,
usually a symmetric matrix

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.490
there, we hope, multiplying y.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.809
So again, linear.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.080
Constant coefficients.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.300
But several equations at once.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.030
And that will bring in
the idea of eigenvalues

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.760
and eigenvectors.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.480
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
is a key bit of linear algebra

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.790
that makes these
problems simple,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:02.240
because it turns
this coupled problem

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.620
into n uncoupled problems.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.390
n first order equations that
we can solve separately.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.390
Or n second order equations
that we can solve separately.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:19.110
That's the goal with
matrices is to uncouple them.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.020
OK.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.900
And then really the big
reality of this subject

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:33.600
is that solutions
are found numerically

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.750
and very efficiently.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.700
And there's a lot to learn
about that, a lot to learn.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:49.420
And MATLAB is a
first-class package

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.840
that gives you numerical
solutions with many options.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.940
One of the options
may be the favorite.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.650
ODE for ordinary
differential equations 4 5.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.810
And that is numbers 4, 5.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:15.030
Well, Cleve Moler, who
wrote the package MATLAB,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:22.200
is going to create a
series of parallel videos

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.540
explaining the steps
toward numerical solution.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.670
Those steps begin with
a very simple method.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.630
Maybe I'll put the
creator's name down.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.400
Euler.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.650
So you can know that because
Euler was centuries ago,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.330
he didn't have a computer.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.420
But he had a simple
way of approximating.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.870
So Euler might be ODE 1.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.820
And now we've left Euler behind.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.750
Euler is fine, but not
sufficiently accurate.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:07.790
ODE 45, that 4 and 5 indicate a
much higher accuracy, much more

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.710
flexibility in that package.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.880
So starting with
Euler, Cleve Moler

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.230
will explain several
steps that reach

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.090
a really workhorse package.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:30.020
So that's a parallel series
where you'll see the codes.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.090
This will be a
chalk and blackboard

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:41.520
series, where I'll find
solutions in exponential form.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:52.200
And if I can, I would like to
conclude the series by reaching

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.910
partial differential equations.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.590
So I'll just write some partial
differential equations here,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.080
so you know what they mean.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.340
And that's a goal
which I hope to reach.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.270
So one partial
differential equation

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:12.690
would be du dt-- you see
partial derivatives-- is

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.040
second derivative.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.950
So I have two variables now.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.520
Time, which I always have.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.880
And here is x in
the space direction.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.260
That's called the heat equation.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.080
That's a very important
constant coefficient,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.010
partial differential equation.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.150
So PDE, as distinct from ODE.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.520
And so I write down one more.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.950
The second derivative of u
is the same right-hand side

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.420
second derivative
in the x direction.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.540
That would be called
the wave equation.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.130
So this is like the first
order equation in time.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.820
It's like a big system.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.100
In fact, it's like an infinite
size system of equations.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.600
First order in time.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.240
Or second order in time.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.160
Heat equation.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.420
Wave equation.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:26.250
And I would like to also
include a the Laplace equation.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.070
Well, if we get there.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.680
So those are goals for
the end of the series that

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.820
go beyond some courses in ODEs.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.270
But the main goal
here is to give you

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:51.760
the standard clear picture
of the basic differential

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.550
equations that we can
solve and understand.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.040
Well, I hope it goes well.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.590
Thanks.
