00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.468
All right, let's welcome to "The
Next Level" 

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:06.239
stage our "Hart of the City"
alum, Mr. Marvin Hunter.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.173
What's up, with you, man?

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.042
Chilling, man, chilling.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.009
Pleasure to be here, brother.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:10.877
Good to see you again.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.711
Yeah, man.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:12.979
Good to be here.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:13.880
Let's go back to
when you were 19.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.314
OK.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:15.915
I want you to explain
something to me, man.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:16.749
Mm-hmm.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:18.484
I've got a picture.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:19.919
Explain this picture to me, man.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:23.056
That was a-- that was a
mixed-up guy right there.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.657
That's a mixed-up guy, right?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.658
He was trying to find himself.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:26.392
This is you.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.560
Yeah, man.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:28.494
- In the Navy.
- That's me.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:29.328
That's me.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.063
Look at the hat.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:30.997
Yeah, man.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.931
Look at the hair.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.099
Full of hope.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:34.367
You look happy about it too.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.668
- I wasn't happy at all.
- No?

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.769
- No, no.
- No happiness at all?

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.538
No happiness at all.

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.206
Do you feel like, uh-- do you
feel like you honed your comedy

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.374
talents in the Navy?

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.408
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.776
You have to.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.178
We had to find something
to break the monotony,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.879
you know, very serious
stuff we deal with.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.181
You know, the stupid shall be
punished is one of the rules

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.549
that I adopted early on.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.884
So stupid shall be
discussed and punished.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.219
Wow.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.353
Did you do comedy
shows on the Navy ship?

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.121
I did not.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.122
I did not.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.890
But around the base, I did.

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.625
Once you got out there, once
you started killing the scene,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.361
did your swag change a
little bit on the Navy ship?

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:03.963
- A little bit.
- A little bit?

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.398
A little pep in your step?
- A little bit, little bit.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.566
Everybody started
looking at you different?

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.301
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:09.402
Because a little-- during that
time, I was single, you know.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.803
- OK.
- So the little girls.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.105
You know what I'm
saying, the little girls?

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.406
You know.
- Little girls, little girls.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.307
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They like that?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.042
You know what I mean?

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:16.976
Somebody standing on stage, you
know, a little bit of power.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:17.810
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:18.945
Hey, you know, hey.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.646
The grumpy uncle
thing that you

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.615
said that you adopted from
your father, do you have that?

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:23.783
Absolutely.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:24.750
Are you that
guy with your kid?

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:25.585
- Absolutely.
- 100%?

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.385
Yeah.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.620
No nonsense, man.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.589
You know, no time
to babify people.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.456
Too much of that going on.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.324
No gray areas.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.125
No gray areas at all?

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:32.992
No, no gray areas.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:33.759
How old is your kid?

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.660
He's 25.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:35.795
- 20-- what?
- Yeah.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.096
And there's still
no gray areas?

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:38.297
- There's no gray areas.
- Goddamn, man.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.435
You know, hey,
they grow up so slow.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:46.272
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.840
Literally,
watching you onstage,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.675
it's a breath of fresh
air because you have

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:50.743
such a unique cadence, man.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.111
Thank you.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:55.081
And I think right
now, it is time for you

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.649
to go to the next level, man.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.818
There's no reason for you
to still be sitting here.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.454
Go to the next level, Marvin.
