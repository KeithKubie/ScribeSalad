00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.438
Uh, it's time for our next game,
Worst Red Carpet Questions.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.373
Worst Red Carpet
Questions.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:13.614
(charactery voice): The 88th
Academy Awards are this weekend,

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.349
and they're super important.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.351
-Uh, we're gonna...
-(laughter)

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.622
Everyone's very serious
at the 88th Academy Awards,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.691
the most important thing going
on in the world this weekend.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.693
Find out which white
will walk away

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.496
with a golden power trinket.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.232
The 88th Academy Awards!

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.902
Very, very fancy. But before
Hollywood's hungriest enter

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.237
the theater, they first have
to deal with the red carpet--

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.173
which, for the record,
does not match the drapes--

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.708
where they will face
uncomfortable questions

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.110
in their uncomfortable
evening attire

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.511
from uncomfortable-looking
reporters.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.246
But we can make the Oscars
more awkward,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.315
so I would like you to give me
the worst red carpet questions

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.785
you can think of in 60 seconds.
And begin. Katy.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.387
Who are you?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.988
Yeah, points.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.859
I-I get that a lot.
Points. Uh, Katie.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.594
Has fame filled the void?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.398
The answer to that is no.
Uh, Alison.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.133
Will you give your agent
my script

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.369
for <i>Paul Blart 3,
Fart Detective?</i>

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.307
Oh, wait a minute!

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.243
-There's yet to... -Why wasn't
<i>Paul Blart 2 Fart Detective?!</i>

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.445
It was bound to be a trilogy!

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.581
-I would've watched that.
-We've all been waiting!

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.584
Points. Uh, Katie O'Brien.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.586
Who's wearing <i>you?</i>

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.422
Yes, points. Points.
Alison Brie.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.757
What's Macaulay Culkin
really like?

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.693
Yeah, points. Katie O'Brien.

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.962
Where does your dick fall
on a scale of Shia LaBeouf

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.697
-to Jon Hamm?
-Points.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.033
-Ali. -Hey, uh,
are those things the same size?

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.169
Like, I'm thinkin' this one's
a little bigger than that one.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.505
-What you think? You-you agree?
-Points.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:47.508
-Katy. -Uh, what's your backup
plan if acting doesn't work out?

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.643
All right, points.
Katie O'Brien.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.311
Do you have a date tonight
or will you die alone?

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.046
-All right, points.
-Um...

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.882
Like a bald man in a hospital,

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.284
staring at a sunset. Katy.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.152
Has your face
always looked like that?

00:01:59.186 --> 00:01:59.253
Yes, points. Perfect.
