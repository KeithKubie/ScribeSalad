00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670
&gt;&gt; This is Rick Warren author of The Purpose
Driven Life and pastor of Saddleback Church.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.289
I'm here at Davos with a lot of my friends
and we're talking about what are the biggest

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.549
problems on the planet and how are we going
to solve them.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:20.179
Right now I think there are five that I call
global giants: extreme poverty, pandemic diseases,

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.160
illiteracy, corruption and the spiritual emptiness.
These problems are so big nobody's been able

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.640
to solve them. The US hasn't solved them,
the UN hasn't solved them, nobody's solved

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.789
them. And I think it's because it's going
to take a three-pronged strategy to do this.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.361
There is a role for the public sector, there
is a role for the private sector and there

00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:43.220
is a role for the faith sector. Each of them
can do something that none of the other three

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.340
can do.
Government has a role to set agenda, government

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.040
has a role to set priorities and things like
that and move nations. And there are some

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.929
things that only governments can do.
Businesses have a role which they have: they

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:06.150
bring expertise, they bring investments, they
bring all kinds of innovations to the market.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.740
But then, also, houses of worship have things
that businesses and government will never

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.930
have. In the first place, we have universal
distribution. The church was global 200 years

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.220
before Davos started talking about globalization.
I could take you to 10 million villages around

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.630
the world and the only thing in it is a church.
And we are in more locations than the United

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930
Nations, we speak more languages than the
United Nations, we're in a thousand more people

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.130
groups than the United Nations.
You see there are 600 million Buddhists in

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.400
the world, there are 800 million Hindus in
the world, there are a billion Muslims in

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.870
the world, but there are 2.3 billion Christians
in the world. If you take people of faith

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.670
out of the equation, you've ruled out five-sixths
of the world.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.540
So we have to mobilize this, these faith groups
to do, work together on these issues that

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.740
have been unsolvable. And the church has of
course the greatest distribution. They also

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.520
have the biggest manpower with 2.3 billion
people. That means the church, the Christian

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.730
church is bigger than China. It's bigger than
India. In fact, it's bigger than India and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.619
China put together. So nothing compares to
its size. We have hundreds of millions of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.180
people who volunteer around the world in villages
and cities on a weekly basis. And we don't

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.739
have to pay them.
The third thing that they have is that they

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.430
have local credibility. At the local level
people trust that priest or that pastor or

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.739
for that matter any mom or a rabbi; the religious
leader of their faith because he's marrying,

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.590
he's burying, he's helping them through the
stages of life. When the crisis comes NGO's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.959
come and go, nations come and go, but for
instance the church has a 2000 year track

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.379
record.
So I really think that what we need to do

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.939
here at Davos is work on a three-legged stool.
The problem we haven't solved these issues

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.940
before is because we've had a two-legged stool.
We had government and business trying to work

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.329
together and that's a good thing, but the
two-legged stool will fall over.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.390
You have to have the faith sector, you have
to have the public sector and you have to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.549
have the private sector. And frankly, I don't
care why you do good as long as you do good.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.849
You're motive may be politics. I'm a member
of the Council on Foreign Relations and I've

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.219
learned that, when you for instance, help
people get well if they've been unhealthy,

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.420
they like your nation. Now that's not my motivation
for doing good, but it's not a bad one.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.139
If you have a political motivation fine, do
it. You may have a profit motivation for doing

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.079
good, well you know, some businesses say "we
are going to make drugs and make money at

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.560
the same time and help people." Great. I wish
more people would to that. I wish more businesses

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.590
would make more money and do more good at
the same time. It's not my motivation, but

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.829
a profit motive's not bad.
You might have a personal motivation. Maybe

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.879
you had cancer, you had AIDS and so you care
about people with cancer and AIDS.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.499
My motivation is that Jesus said "love your
neighbor as yourself." It doesn't have to

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:52.569
be your motivation, I'm just encouraging you
to get involved. Do something now about the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.340
problems of the world.
