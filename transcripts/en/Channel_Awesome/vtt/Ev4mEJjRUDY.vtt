00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.489
Doug: It's the final in the now very poorly-named Star Wars Trilogy, "Return of the Jedi."

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.320
Everyone says this is the least of the original three Star Wars films. Not bad, just not as good as the other two and honestly,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320
I think it gets a little bit of a bum rap.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.900
Not to say the criticisms aren't right, it's just the stuff that's good in it I think is a lot better than some of the stuff in the other

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.730
films. But does that make it better than the other two? Well, let's take a look.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.810
Han Solo is kept captive by the evil gangster, Jabba the Hutt. Luke, Leia, and

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.659
Lando all tried to sneak in to break him out, but they get caught themselves. After several fight sequences and battling a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.149
bunch of monsters, they eventually escape and make it back to the Rebellion where they find out the empire is, once again,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.959
building another Death Star. Only this time the leader of the empire, the Emperor, will be on there for them to take it down.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.019
So the team tries to take down the shield generator that's on a nearby moon while the rest of the fighters try to fly in

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.049
to blow it up. The team on the moon comes across inhabitants called

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.039
Ewoks while Luke separates from the team to confront the Emperor and Darth Vader himself.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.620
Can the Rebels take down the evil Empire once and for all and will Luke ultimately find himself turning to the light side or the dark side?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.209
A fitting setup for a finale but the biggest problem everybody has

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.760
that I have to admit I have too is that there's way too many detours.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.120
The opening sequence with Jabba The Hutt and breaking Han Solo out, it goes on forever.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.880
There's a moment you can end it where Luke destroys this big monster but no!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000
They had to drag them to another monster for him to destroy!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.780
Truth be told you could cut everything having to do with Jabba out of these movies and you would miss nothing.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.900
Think about it. You could have Han Solo captured by anybody.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.500
Hell, you don't even really need to get rid of him. That's just sort of leaving it open for a cliffhanger.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.160
He could have been with the team, he didn't have to be sent away.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.540
Honestly, the Ewoks play a bigger part than the Jabba the Hutt scenes. I know that sounds crazy but really think about it:

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.400
The Ewoks helped take down the Empire. They play a part, they serve the story.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.720
And it also makes a well intended if not immaturely done message of nature versus technology

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.800
which is in a lot of stories and myths. So why do we put up with those Jabba scenes so much?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.900
Well to put simply, Jabba's a cool character. He's this big fat slug that just does whatever he wants.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.980
It's kind of the American dream. He's a gangster and he gets away with it.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.920
So why do so many people hate the Ewoks?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.360
Because one: We Already saw a ton of puppets and we're getting sick of them.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.920
Second: They're little teddy bears and after the last film, where everything was so dark and gritty, what?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.020
We suddenly got a bunch of little teddy bears? This is feeling more like a toy commercial.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.480
In my honest opinion, if you want to fix this Jabba should have been on the moon.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.120
Cut out the opening, save him until halfway, have him capture Solo wanting his money back

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.800
but then when he finds out the Empire is in his territory then he decides to fight him off and help the Rebellion.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.950
How much more fitting would that have been?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.940
Jabba would have been both the bad guy and the good guy at the same time and he would have had a purpose.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.340
And oh my God! Wouldn't it be so cool if you saw Jabba's people attacking those Stormtroopers instead of Ewoks?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.160
Also throw in a pointless motorcycle style chase,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.700
an all too similar retread of the destroying the Death Star in the first film

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.900
and little teddy bears throwing rocks and...

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.594
Yeaah, you can see how a lot of people would see this as the lesser of the films.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.140
But with that said not only are these some of the best effects that ever came out of the movies

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.700
but it has some of the most dramatic moments.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.240
The scenes where Luke is confronting Vader and the Emperor are some of the best in any of the movies.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.340
The guy they got to play the Emperor is perfect.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.280
He's old and frail but by God he has such presence and this deep crackling voice with these yellow eyes.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.140
It's almost something out of "The Exorcist".

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.909
At times his acting can be a little goofy but it's goofy in just the right way.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.080
He's taking a risk that you're in such a dark, uncomfortable mood that you're just going to accept that this is creepy.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.560
And for the most part it works. The whole atmosphere is just so dark and so brooding and so shadowy

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.660
you just feel like you've descended into hell.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100
The minute Luke walks in as their prisoner the Emperor just gets rid of the handcuffs like:

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.700
Yeah, we know there's nothing you can do here.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.060
And the longer it goes the more we dive deeper and deeper into the darker side.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.460
Of Luke's anger, of Luke's rage and the visuals all support it.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.400
The pacing supports it too. There's a fight going on but it's also very psychological.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.980
The music, the atmosphere, the acting, the dialog, everything. It's perfect!

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.840
It's about as pitch perfect a scene you can get in any Star Wars film.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.820
But does that make up for the other little mistakes in the film? Probably not.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.260
But like I said before: Even though a lot of it doesn't always connect, it's cool!

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.620
The scenes with Jabba are cool and yeah, I'll even say the Ewoks are not as bad as everybody says they are.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.680
They left us some okay jokes and I like the idea of wood trampling steel.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.920
By the end when everything wrapped up it just kind of felt right.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.430
When you see the final scene in the Ewok village you just kind of go:

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.250
Yeah, you know what? This is a good place to stop.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.050
Everybody seems happy. Everybody seems in the right place.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.200
Where there flaws? Sure but just like there were flaws in the other films too.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.420
I guess I just Don't get what everybody says: This is the light-hearted one.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.560
when there were such dark and gritty scenes in it.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.360
Some of them the best out of any of the movies.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.340
So yeah, is the first film technically told better?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.780
Yes but I still stand by the third has some of the best moments out of any of them.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.980
And like I said it's just a good ending. Not the best but still pretty damn impressive.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.240
And for a while this is all Star Wars fans thought they would ever get out of this.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.520
But little did they know that so much more good and bad was awaiting them in the future.
