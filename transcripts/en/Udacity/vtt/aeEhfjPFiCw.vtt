00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.230
Another type of conclusion you
might want to be able to draw,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.480
is to say that if you change one thing,
another thing is likely to change also.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.510
For example, you saw that students
who passed the first project

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.430
are more likely to visit the classroom
multiple times in their first week.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.250
This is a correlation.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.360
Passing the first project is
correlated with visiting the classroom

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.130
multiple times.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.870
Does this mean that visiting the
classroom multiple times in the first

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.030
week causes the students
to pass their project?

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.646
This would be a statement of causation.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:33.020
For example, suppose Udacity sent emails
to students during their first week

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.700
reminding them to come back.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.710
This caused more students
to visit multiple times.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.400
Would you expect this to increase
the number of students who complete

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.810
their project?

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.870
It certainly sounds plausible, but
we can't be sure based on this data.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.165
To see why,
let's take a look at this graph,

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.845
which shows per capita
cheese consumption in red.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:51.725
And the number of people

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:55.075
who died by becoming tangled
in their bedsheets in black.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.905
As you can see, these two
variables are highly correlated.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:01.190
As one increases,
the other tends to increase as well.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.140
However, do you think eating
cheese causes people to become

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.720
tangled in their bedsheets?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.260
Probably not.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.630
This could be a coincidence or there
could be some third factor causing both.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.620
In this case, it looks like
both cheese consumption and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.740
bed sheet tangling
are increasing over time.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.420
If this is the case,
then if you banned cheese,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.050
bedsheet tangling would probably
continue to increase overtime.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.180
So what are some third factors that
could be causing the correlation

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.750
between visiting the classroom and
passing projects?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240
One that I thought of
is level of interest.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.670
Maybe people who don't find the data
analysis courses very interesting,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.490
don't visit the site many times.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.130
And then they also don't pass the
project because they're not interested

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.750
in working on it.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.120
If you somehow convinced these students
to visit the site more, their lack of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.030
interest might still prevent them
from working on the project.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.200
A better approach might be for

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.320
the student to try learning something
else that they find more interesting.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.930
Another factor might be
background knowledge.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.760
Maybe some people don't have the
programming knowledge they need to take

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.420
the data analysis courses and
they get stuck and don't come back.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.340
If you convince these
students to come back and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.000
keep trying, they might remain stuck and
not be able to make forward progress.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150
In this case, a better solution might be
taking a programming course to fill in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.260
the missing background knowledge.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.340
On the other hand, this correlation
could be because of causation.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.950
And I actually find that
explanation pretty plausible.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.450
But the point is that we don't
know based on the data we have.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.420
To find out whether one change causes
another, you need to run an experiment,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.940
and online experiments
are frequently costed A/B tests.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.340
To learn more about how to
set these experiments up and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630
some common gotchas that can arise check
out Udacity's course on A/B testing

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.690
linked in the instructor's notes.
