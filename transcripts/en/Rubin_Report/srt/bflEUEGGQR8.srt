1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,010
All right.
What's going on people.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,520
I am caffeinated and ready to roll.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,430
So we were going to do this at
7:00 PM Pacific tonight. Uh,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,010
but then some scheduling things happen.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,470
I literally just landed from
Philadelphia this morning, uh,

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,670
Boston two days ago.
The Toronto,

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,730
the day before that just landed in
la a we're taping too shows today.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,790
I'm not going to reveal everything right
now. One of the guesses a little late.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,120
So we thought we'd do this now,
maxing out at the time here. Uh, I,

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,100
I have so many things that I
want to share with you guys.

11
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,950
There is so much good stuff
happening right now. Uh,

12
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,360
this tour with Jordan Peterson has been
amazing. Uh, my return to stand up,

13
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:40,890
there's so many signs and signals that
the things that we're talking about here

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,840
are,
are really taking root.

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,010
I think that this a intellectual dark
web article from Barry Weiss in the New

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,220
York Times two weeks ago really,
really leveled this thing up.

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,430
And it's just reached
all across everything.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,190
And it wouldn't even be just that.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,160
It's the good part of the article
that reached across everything.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,960
It's that the amount of hysteria and
angry people and misrepresentations of all

21
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,794
of our views and all that,

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,070
the amount of articles being written
about it and think pieces and all this

23
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,390
nonsense. It's like, man,

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,650
we must be doing something right over
here that all these people are just making

25
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:17,580
up this nonsense and to be on tour
with Jordan Peterson where literally

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,450
literally every day there is another
ridiculous hit piece written about him

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,360
often.
I've met the author of the piece,

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
The New York Times when they came out this
week about his enforced monogamy idea.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,300
I was in the green room on the first night
of the tour, I believe in Toronto, uh,

30
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:41,010
two weeks ago, uh, with, with the girl who
wrote the piece. And it's just like, man,

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,630
journalism is freaking dying and dead.
And by the way, with that in mind,

32
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:47,340
we're getting some new
allies in this space.

33
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:51,300
Alon Musk has been on a freaking
tear about mainstream media. Um,

34
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,520
so I think there's a lot of
interesting things happen.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,190
The Dalai Lama tweeted something
about individualism, uh,

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,830
and coming together as people.

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,800
I think there's so much cool stuff
happening right now. I'm totally enthused.

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,340
I'm meeting literally thousands of
you guys. Uh, you know, these events,

39
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,430
most of the theaters that we're doing
are about three to 5,000 people.

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,210
I think the biggest one we did
was the Apollo in, uh, London,

41
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,640
which was 5,000 people.
I mean, think about that.

42
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:19,641
5,000 people coming to hear a
psychologist talk about ideas,

43
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,790
you know, it's just awesome.
So I usually go up there,

44
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,490
I do about 10 to 15 minutes to stand up.
I get the crowd grown,

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,210
we're talking about lobsters and cleaning
your room and all this crazy stuff.

46
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,210
And I just get everybody
having a good time. And,

47
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:36,210
and the beauty is you can feel it
that for you watching this right now,

48
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,560
for most people watching this stuff,

49
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,690
it's like you're watching
this most likely on your,

50
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:43,770
on your phone or you're on a computer.
It's a pretty singular experience, right?

51
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,610
Maybe with somebody, but usually you're
not watching it. A whole group of people,

52
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,370
although I have heard that now some
students are watching the show and there's

53
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,750
some, uh, groups.

54
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,570
There's a group in India that I think
gets together on Sunday nights and watches

55
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,850
my show. It's amazing. Uh,
but generally speaking,

56
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,680
you're watching this as a solo
experience and you're kind of just,

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,690
we're doing this right.
Um,

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,280
but to be in a room with
5,000 people who agree,

59
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:10,270
disagree, black, white, gay,
straight, all of that stuff,

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,200
all of that diversity, uh, but are just
coming together to hear about ideas.

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,010
And then here Jordan talk
about why racism is not good,

62
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,750
why the alt right is bad,

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,170
why cultural Marxism and
progressivism are also bad.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,340
And just everybody getting on board
talking about personal responsibility is

65
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,490
just, it really, I feel like my
life, even from two weeks ago,

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,600
my life has changed because you can't be
around that kind of force for that long

67
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,190
and not feel something.
It just,

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,250
it feels real and honest
and good and I think we're,

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,660
we're challenging each other.

70
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,470
Jordan has made it very clear that
nothing is off limits during the Q and a.

71
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,600
So usually I take some questions
from the crowd, uh, that they there.

72
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,380
There's an APP that they
send questions in on,

73
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,660
but then I mix it up with
some of my own stuff.

74
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,060
He's challenged me a little bit
on some things. It's been a,

75
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,610
it's been a total learning
experience. I'm very cool. All right,

76
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,580
so here's what we're going to do here.
Uh,

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,210
so on top of the Jordan Peterson tour,
which I'm heading back out on,

78
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,790
our next stop is in Houston and in Dallas.
And then Austin,

79
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,100
we're doing a little Texas thing
starting in a couple of days,

80
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,960
but I am here for a couple of days.
Uh,

81
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,950
we're booking some standup stuff for
me around some of the tour stuff.

82
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,770
So I've got three shows that
I want to tell you guys about.

83
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:22,440
And for anyone that buys
a ticket during this with,

84
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,180
you're watching this right now
and you're one of the first, uh,

85
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,860
we're gonna do this for 20 people
at each one of these venues. Uh,

86
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,380
we've got DC coming up, we've
got Tempe, Arizona, and we've
got Seattle. Am I right?

87
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,520
Yes.
Okay.

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,450
If you are watching this and you're one
of the first 20 people to buy a ticket

89
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:40,090
to the show and the links are right
down below. While you're watching this,

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,760
we're going to let you into the,
to the meet and greet.

91
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,580
I do a meet and greet afterwards,
shake hands, say hi, take pictures,

92
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,580
all that good stuff. Uh, we'll,
we'll let you get in that for free.

93
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,310
There's a premium charge for that,
but we'll do it for free. So, uh,

94
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,360
the links to the show or right down below,
it's a Tempe, Arizona, the Tempe Improv,

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,890
uh, that is on June. Uh, Tempe
is June 3rd. Uh, so that's,

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,570
that's basically next week. Uh,
we got the DC Improv on June 7th,

97
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,830
and uh, the Seattle, uh, we're going
to be at the parlor live in Seattle.

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,300
That's on June 20th. So what you do
is if you buy a ticket, screenshot it,

99
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,390
send it to contact@rubenreport.com.

100
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,010
We're going to get you in on the meet
and greet after contact@rubenreport.com.

101
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:21,844
Just send your,

102
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,400
you're a screenshot that you bought
some tickets and we'll get you in.

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,900
We'll say hi,
we'll do all that good stuff.

104
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,060
Maybe I'll go out and hang out and
have drinks after. I don't know.

105
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,420
We'll see what, what's going
on. Um, okay. You know what?

106
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:35,290
I was supposed to say 10 people per, but
I said [inaudible], I'm a man of my word.

107
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,380
All right guys, it's 20 per
20 per show. So there's 60,

108
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,060
60 slots if you happened to be near
DC or Seattle or a Tempe, Arizona,

109
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,540
which is right by Phoenix where I'll
be with Jordan in a couple of days. Um,

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,940
so anyway, so I'm just, I'm
just as you can tell them,

111
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,420
I'm just psyched about what's going
on here. Um, these shows we were in,

112
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:56,080
we were in London last week, 5,000
people at the Apollo theater. Uh,

113
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,550
it was just incredible.
I got out.

114
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,060
So usually the way these theaters working
or these are huge, awesome old school,

115
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,660
you know, Phantom of the opera theater
is just beautiful, beautiful buildings,

116
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,290
most of them. And they usually have like
an artist entrance or something. Uh,

117
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,410
but for the one in London, I didn't
know where the artist entrance was.

118
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:15,810
So my Uber just dropped me off right
in front. There were out there,

119
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,600
2000 people outside. I got
stormed. I mean, it was crazy.

120
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:24,050
Like the amount of people that are
so excited about this stuff and,

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,460
and everyone talking about their
political awakening and the same shit that

122
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:33,420
you're thinking about that I talk about
here, about what it's like to, to, uh,

123
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,010
evolve politically and realize that you
were wrong about some things and want to

124
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,310
learn more. And everyone has like
an amazing life story to tell me.

125
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,290
And people always,
they want to give us stuff.

126
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,650
Everyone wants to give Jordan personal
written notes or some people have done

127
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,170
some incredible artwork and stuff
like that. Like it's just been,

128
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,910
it's been so cool.
But as I said before,

129
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,760
it's that it's that everyone's coming
together and people are looking around and

130
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,380
going, Whoa, you're, you're a Jordan
Peterson, a fan. You, oh, you know,

131
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:01,580
Dave Rubin, like, it's just
like, it's like real, it
really feels like real, real,

132
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:04,140
real and cool. All right. Let's see.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,630
So I'm going to take a couple
of questions by the way.

134
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,220
So we're going to do the super chat thing.

135
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,830
If you're watching right
now on the youtube,

136
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,430
we're doing super chat real quick on
youtube. I don't know if you saw this,

137
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,160
I guess they announced this yesterday.
I tweeted about it today,

138
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,181
but they're going to be,

139
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:21,560
they're experimenting with changing the
feed because we really want more of that

140
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,870
sort of thing where they're going to,

141
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,010
they're going to sort of rejigger your
feed to figure out what you might want to

142
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,650
watch instead of showing you
stuff in chronological order.

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,320
Now call me a conspiracy theorist,

144
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,980
but if they don't really like the stuff
that the content creator is putting out

145
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:41,420
there, it seems that they might, uh,
just hurt you in everyone else's feed.

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,030
Everyone wants just a chronological feed,
right?

147
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:47,630
You subscribe to things because you know,
you like them. And if you don't want,

148
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,070
if they put up a clip that you don't like,

149
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:51,710
if I put up an interview that you
don't like, you don't watch it.

150
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,420
But we don't need youtube or any more
of these algorithms to do more or hiding

151
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,130
things from us or promoting other things.

152
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:01,320
And we know that there's just so many
ways that that can be manipulated as,

153
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,950
but they're experimenting that right now.
And by the way,

154
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm not asking the government to come in
and fix the problem. I'm using my voice,

155
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,860
my free speech. I see this on Twitter
all the time. People will say, see Ruben,

156
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,780
your,
you don't want any regulation.

157
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,610
You don't want the government
to come in and fix anything.

158
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,900
Well now look what happened with you tube
and the NFL and blah, blah blah. And No,

159
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,210
I don't want the government to
come in and fix these things.

160
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,920
I don't think the
government can fix youtube.

161
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,800
I don't think the government can
fix the NFL or anything else.

162
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,180
The government can't do that much,

163
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:31,730
especially the federal government
as it certainly can't do it well or

164
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,850
efficiently.
Uh,

165
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,860
so what you can do and what is your right
and duty as an American is to use your

166
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,451
voice to express pleasure or displeasure
or whatever it else with any company.

167
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,620
So when I tweet about Youtube
People's, ah, you see,

168
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,190
you don't want the government of
all, so you can't whine about it. No,

169
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,750
that's the whole point. You
should complain. So that
hopefully someone up there,

170
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,800
some of the higher ups go,

171
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,020
Whoa know there's a bunch of creators out
there and it's not just me by the way,

172
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,350
uh,
uh,

173
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,890
that are complaining and these guys
seem to have some influence and they're

174
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,100
using our platform. Maybe we should think
about what our decision making is here.

175
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,860
That's what you do in a free society.
I can't,

176
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,400
nobody's forcing me to
be on Youtube, right? Uh,

177
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,410
and they don't have to
let me be on youtube,

178
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,850
but as long as they're
letting me be on youtube,

179
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,830
I can use my voice to affect the platform.

180
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,700
And that's exactly what you guys can
do. And by the way, one day, I assume,

181
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:24,150
and I have reason to believe that there's
plenty of competition coming down the

182
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,430
pike. Don't want to say too
much, you know what I mean?

183
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,480
But I just think there's opportunity
and competition and capitalism.

184
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:35,370
That's the answer to all of these
problems. All right, so here we go. Uh,

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,720
reminder though, you guys should click
that bell on the subscription thing.

186
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,690
If you click the bell and I think
it'll give you a couple of options,

187
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,690
like how much you want to be notified.
That way you hopefully,

188
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,550
if they're not manipulating
this thing too much,

189
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,040
you'll see the videos and all
that. That, that being said,

190
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,160
our subscriber growth has exploded in
the last month. Every now and again,

191
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,090
suddenly we see these odd anomalies and
then I contact them and they say, oh,

192
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:59,970
nothing's going on, but people
keep telling me there'll
be an unsubscribed, blah,

193
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,250
blah, blah. It's a bunch
of insider stuff. Okay.

194
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,860
Reminder one more time and then I'm
going to dive into some questions.

195
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,730
Any of you guys that are watching
this either live or, uh, or after,

196
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,050
depending on how many people jump in.
Uh,

197
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,160
we have 20 slots at each of the three
shows in Seattle and Tempe and in DC.

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,880
And if you screenshot your tickets that
you purchase while you are watching this,

199
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,150
uh, we will let you in to the meet
and greet after absolutely free.

200
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,110
They charge extra for that,

201
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,510
but we'll do it for free and I'll
say Heidi and all that good stuff.

202
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,370
The links to the shows are down below.
I've only done one hour long show so far.

203
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:36,390
It was the Irvine Improv couple of weeks
ago. Uh, it was, it was awesome. I,

204
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,050
I give you my word.
The,

205
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,940
the manager came up to me after she said
that was the first sold out standing

206
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,110
ovation. She had seen in 18 years of
working there. I'm not making this up. Um,

207
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,150
by the way, I may, it's a
little unclear right now.

208
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:52,620
Perhaps there will be a guest or two
from the intellectual dark web that will

209
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:56,010
join me on these, uh, on these
shows. But I do about, you know,

210
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,330
an hour and then I do some live Q and
a fiddle around if you guys will. All,

211
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,550
all kinds of fun stuff. It's great to just
get back to my old life of doing that.

212
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,970
It's, it's completely different than what
you guys know of me sort of doing the

213
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,630
interview thing. Uh, I'm also working on
the book again because I'd been signing,

214
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,000
because people come up
to me after the shows.

215
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,660
They want me to sign something
and they all have Jordan's book.

216
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:17,610
So I've been signing Jordan's book, which
seems unjust. Um, so I finally just,

217
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,040
cause I've been so busy it's, it's been
put on the back burner a little bit, uh,

218
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,790
finally really dove back into
it the last couple of days.

219
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,580
So we're working on that too. A
lot of good stuff happening. Okay.

220
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,210
A superchat patrion questions.
Let's do a little something.

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,780
What's an example of a view that
you've been challenged on? Well,

222
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:38,490
I think the one that everyone knows the
most, uh, is from, uh, last week's guest,

223
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,091
Larry elder.

224
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,120
Although this happened about two and a
half years ago when we were talking about

225
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,750
systemic racism way back when.

226
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:47,190
And that's when I still considered
myself sort of more part of the left or

227
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,650
progressive or whatever
you want to call it. Uh,

228
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,590
I was kind of just waking up
to a lot of that stuff and, uh,

229
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,250
and Larry just beat me senseless.
There are many clips of this.

230
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,370
I think on Youtube, one of the clips,
someone just took our clip straight up,

231
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,350
which we're fine with it. It
hasn't had a million views, uh,

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
of Larry just beating me.
That systemic racism,

233
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,890
meaning the laws that are built
into the system doesn't exist.

234
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,300
It doesn't mean that racism doesn't exist.
There are always going to be racists.

235
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,500
They are going to be bigots.

236
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,080
They're going to be people that don't
like black people and people that don't

237
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,870
like gay people and everything and
people who don't like white people and

238
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,910
everything else. Uh, but you can't,

239
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,570
you can't change everyone in a society.

240
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,100
And if you want to change
everyone to decide of,

241
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,530
you're probably a pretty
bad person actually. Uh,

242
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:34,531
but what you can do is make sure that
all the laws are equal so that everyone

243
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,420
has equal opportunity,
equality of opportunity.

244
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,300
You can't get to where we're going to
have equal outcomes because some people

245
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,520
are going to be more talented,
some people are going to work harder,

246
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,920
some people are going to be luckier.
Uh,

247
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,680
but you want equal
opportunity for everybody.

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,890
And I would say that the way
that you would deal with,
so people always say, well,

249
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:53,860
all right, well what about some historic
injustices and all that sort of thing?

250
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,120
Well then I would want education to be
focused on let's get it down to the state

251
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:02,560
level and let's make it slimmer
and trimmer and use money
better. And not, not, uh,

252
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,370
you know,

253
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,550
pour so much money into federal programs
that don't really work and having

254
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,384
everybody,
uh,

255
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,780
just learn so that they can pass the test
without actually learning and all that

256
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,390
stuff.
Uh,

257
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,190
so education I think is where you can
make a lot of movement if you want to get

258
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:19,390
people to be more actually equal but
watch. But Larry doing that, I think,

259
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,400
you know,
I've always said it's,

260
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,610
it was sort of the best moment and worst
moment of my career at the same time.

261
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,410
It was the worst moment because I went
into a conversation. I'm not ready,

262
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
not armed.

263
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,850
So when I said this thing about systemic
racism and he turned it back on me,

264
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,970
I was kind of like a deer in headlights.
So it was my worst moment for that,

265
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:40,060
but it was my best moment because
we let it be. I, you know,

266
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,160
I've told this many times,
Germany, you guys know this,

267
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,950
but we were at aura TV at
the time. We go into the, um,

268
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,470
the control we might after
the show and there was,

269
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:50,620
we had a bigger staff at the time and
one of the producers who said to me,

270
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,810
you know, you guys got to cut that
from the show. And I said, no,

271
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,860
we've got to leave that, that is a
human moment. That is a real moment.

272
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,570
I don't mind being wrong.

273
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:03,571
I don't mind being humbled and I don't
mind being shown up actually when it's

274
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,260
done the right way.
You know what I mean?

275
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,350
I don't want to be belittled
or attacked or something,

276
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,310
but he wasn't attacking me.
He was attacking my ideas
and my ideas were shaky.

277
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,930
So I think it was a good
lesson for me and I,

278
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,930
and I've heard from literally
hundreds if not thousands of you guys,

279
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,720
that it was a good lesson

the 22nd guys.

304
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,960
She will be 14 on June 22nd.
Uh,

305
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,030
she's a rescue from New Orleans,
from Hurricane Katrina.

306
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:49,760
She's just the greatest
dog in the world. Uh, and,

307
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:54,320
and still spry for a way at 14. What do
you like a 95 year old dog or something?

308
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,580
Uh, yeah, she's, she's great.
Thanks for asking. Um, uh,

309
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,150
someone on Facebook. Are
you? Hi. No, I'm not. I'm a,

310
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,040
I had been drinking a lot of coffee,
uh,

311
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,580
because it's hard to be on all
these flights. And you know,

312
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,390
last week when I came back from a London,

313
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,720
we had to tape a couple of shows like
that morning and I was way jet lag.

314
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,300
I didn't sleep on a 10 hour
flight for some reason. Uh,

315
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:20,540
so my caffeine levels are up.
Are you noticing a higher energy?

316
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,440
Is that what's going on here? No, I am
not high. And, and even if I was high,

317
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,500
I mean, I've mentioned this before,
I don't smoke weed that often,

318
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,200
maybe once or twice a week.
And I like indigo, which is,

319
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,520
that's the one that takes you down.

320
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,920
I don't need to be high to be more
in my head, you know what I mean?

321
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,190
I don't need any of these doors open more.
I would close a couple of them if,

322
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,260
if possible. Uh, so I,

323
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:44,240
I do like a hit of Endeca 11 o'clock
at night and I watched the Simpsons or

324
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,890
Seinfeld and go to sleep. So No, I'm
not high. I promise you. Okay. Uh,

325
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,020
let's see, uh, from Facebook,

326
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,890
any chance of continuing the founding
fathers slash historic figures series?

327
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,940
Yeah. So first off, I was so
thrilled that so many of you, uh,

328
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,320
like that as much as I did
where we did a president's week,

329
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,590
five different presidents with five
different scholars in five days and learn

330
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:10,280
liberty, uh, helped us produce that. I
just loved every second of it. I mean,

331
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,470
you guys know, I just love
that. Actually speaking of that,

332
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,980
I was in Philadelphia yesterday. I went
to the Liberty Bell, went to Constitution,

333
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,690
uh, center. I just love all
of that history. I loved
those documents. We just got,

334
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:24,430
you know, we'll post it on, um,
on Twitter right after it's,

335
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:28,320
and we'll post it on Facebook as well. Uh,
when I was at a turning point event, uh,

336
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,820
last month, there's a guy that
gives that prints these giant, uh,

337
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,970
prints of the declaration of
independence and the constitution.

338
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,790
So he sent them to us and we just
put them up in the green room.

339
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,030
So now we've got a massive old vintage
American flag and we've got those up

340
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:45,230
there. Uh, it's, it's all very
cool. Um, but I just love that.

341
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,250
I love history. I didn't, you know, I've
always loved history, but I think this,

342
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,760
you guys learning about this stuff,
I'm learning right with Ya.

343
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,510
So I loved that week. I love
being in Philadelphia. I
love when I go to DC and I,

344
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,980
you know, go to all the monuments and
all that stuff. Um, so yes, we're,

345
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,850
we're trying to figure out something
else we can do with learn liberty in that

346
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:06,390
vein. Uh, but for sure we'll do
more of those. And also I just,

347
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,540
to me it's like people are too upset
and obsessed more than upset there too

348
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:15,570
obsessed with the day to day
machinations of politics,

349
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
what a leak happened at the White House.

350
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:20,700
And this happened and that happened and
it's like, this isn't news, you know,

351
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:25,350
last night. So I saw an old
buddy of mine from college, Mike,

352
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:27,930
if you're watching this, I'm giving
you a live shout out. My friend Mike,

353
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,700
by the way, great guy. He wants
beat. We were sophomores in college.

354
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,020
He beat Super Mario Brothers,
I think in nine minutes and 47 seconds.

355
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,670
If you max warp to level four,

356
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,850
Max warp to eight and you plow
right through a eight three,

357
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,680
which I think is a tough one. Uh, yeah.

358
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,750
And then you've got to figure
out the Dungeon on eight four.

359
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,350
He beat it nine minutes and 40 some
odd seconds. Uh, anyway, great guy.

360
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,700
So I saw him last night and uh, he, uh,

361
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:56,100
I went out with him and some other people
and we were sitting at the hotel bar

362
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,220
and they had a huge, a
television screen, like not even,

363
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,750
it was like a huge wall of TVs
basically for four huge TVs on a,

364
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,591
on a big wall.

365
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:09,510
It's many screens and CNN was on one
and MSNBC was on the other or whatever,

366
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,740
like a ticker was on another one.

367
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,310
And I think the sports thing was
on the other and I was facing them.

368
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,360
So they were looking at me and I have
the TV kind of over over their shoulders

369
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,010
and I, I was just, I never watched that
crap anymore and he just seemed so dumb.

370
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
At one point I got up,
I was like,

371
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:27,600
I can't sit here anymore because I
keep being distracted by this dribble.

372
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,600
Another headline that Trump
is and it's just nothing.

373
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,460
So we actually switched seats.

374
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,330
Then they were bothered by it and then
we actually just shifted around all

375
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:38,130
together. Um, okay. Here we go. Let's see.

376
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,090
How long are you planning on doing the
Rubin report? That's a good question.

377
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,210
I mean, you know, it's
funny, I say this to a,

378
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:49,140
to a mirror until Alexis and to David and,
and to tell you all the time,

379
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,100
it's like I, we're just the
beginning again, it's crazy,

380
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:57,120
but like everything that we've worked for,
everything that we've talked about,

381
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,900
the conversations we're having,
it all fuels more relevant, right?

382
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,810
This very second than it's ever felt.

383
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,930
So I have no plans of doing anything else.

384
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:11,931
I've been meeting with a whole slew of
people about all kinds of other different

385
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,630
projects that I can be involved
with do on the side. I mean on,

386
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,350
people are reaching out to me with
all kinds of, uh, interesting offers.

387
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,620
I can't get into all of them right now
or I really can't get it to any of them

388
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,930
because you don't talk about
shit until the pain is dry. Um,

389
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,300
but I love doing this.

390
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:31,620
I really love doing this and I feel I
just feel more validated than ever while

391
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,041
doing it.

392
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,860
And it's great and I hope that I'll keep
getting better and all that good stuff.

393
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,710
Okay, here we go. What are
we doing here today? Uh,

394
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,020
we're talking about the Peterson tour,
which has just been,

395
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,830
just been spectacular and I'm so any
of you that are watching right now,

396
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,410
I hope I've met some of you out there.
It's just been great.

397
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,440
Just saying hi to people and people
from every walk of life and every age in

398
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,340
sexuality and color and all of that stuff,
and,

399
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,550
and high school people and people in the,

400
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,010
in their senior years and everything in
between. It's been so cool. Uh, but yes,

401
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm busting out the standup.
It's coming back.

Hey Dave, as a classical liberal,

415
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:50,830
what do you think about the NFL requiring
players to stand for the national

416
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,790
anthem? Is this a free speech issue
or an employee rights issue? Okay,

417
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,080
so I got into this today, uh, with David
from on Twitter. Uh, and by the way,

418
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:02,740
I invited him to come back on the show.
Uh, he's in La next week, but I'm on tour,

419
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,560
so I think we're going to do
it in October. That's when
he said he'll be back on.

420
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
But we had a little bit of a,

421
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,420
he compared this to the James DeMaurice
situation at Google and it's nothing

422
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,800
like the James Demora situation.

423
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:16,480
James Dimauro was invited to go to these
diversity training things and then told

424
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:20,590
afterwards to share his thoughts,
which he then did with Google.

425
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,260
Then they punished him
for sharing his thoughts.

426
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:28,261
They fired him for his political beliefs
and for doing exactly what they told

427
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:29,890
him to do.
And by the way,

428
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:33,370
it was just two or three months after
he had just gotten a promotion. Um,

429
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,140
this is not that case. No one has
been fired. Tap Renick was not hired.

430
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,830
He was a free agent. He wasn't hired
by any team, but he wasn't fired.

431
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,760
And you have to understand that these
things are all businesses. So let's,

432
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,850
let me just try to do this as
cleanly and clearly as possible.

433
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,740
And as Jordan says, every night, uh,

434
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:55,510
you have to be very precise with your
language. I am a free speech absolutist.

435
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,190
You can say whatever you want within the
constructs of the few things that under

436
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,730
the law you are not allowed to do.
So you can not make a direct threat.

437
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,870
I'm going to kill you. I'm going
to kill all of those people, right?

438
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:10,810
I'm going to blow up that.
You can't do that.

439
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,010
You can't yell fire in a crowded theater.
There's public safety issues.

440
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,420
And then we have extremely,
extremely specific,

441
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,720
very hard to prove libel laws.
Okay?

442
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,000
Which I believe in
actually because you can't,

443
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:29,290
especially nowadays with the
amount of just evil, noxious,

444
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:34,180
toxic journalism out there. And
social media and all that. Uh,

445
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,570
if you, you have to have some
protection around that. By the way,

446
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:42,400
these laws are virtually never used.
Um, and I believe they should exist.

447
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,280
But with those exceptions, you can say
whatever you, you're allowed to be mean.

448
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,480
You're allowed to say bad things, you're
allowed to upset people, etc. Etc.

449
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,910
You're allowed to say things
about protected groups.

450
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,280
You can't say we're going to kill him,
but you're allowed to say mean things.

451
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,060
I would prefer you didn't, I would prefer
everyone be real nice to each other.

452
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:02,690
Right? And that's what conversation's all
about. That's my feeling on free speech.

453
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,240
Okay. So that's one thing. Now, if,

454
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,560
if you watch the video that I did,
uh,

455
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,200
and I tweeted it out today so you can
find it on the NFL protests from seven

456
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,540
months ago, I stand by
everything that I said. You know,

457
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,930
everyone was treating this thing like
there was this massive assault on free

458
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,120
speech and that,
um,

459
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,330
that the government was stopping people
from speaking and all of this stuff.

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,180
So let's,
let's try to do it cleanly here.

461
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,210
The players can do what they want, right?
The players can either Neil or not.

462
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,410
This is, I'm getting up to
the point of yesterday, right?

463
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,030
Or I guess it happened today with the,

464
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,310
the new regulations that
they're going to have.

465
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,460
So we're just going back seven months.
At that point,

466
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,040
the players could do whatever you
want. You could kneel or not, Neil,

467
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,020
you can express yourself however you want.

468
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,530
The team then can do whatever it wants.

469
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,790
It can either find you are
not fine, you or um, you know,

470
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,400
put out a statement saying
they agree with you or not.

471
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,700
The owners can do whatever
they want with their business.

472
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,550
The League can do whatever it wants.
The president,

473
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,000
although I would prefer that Trump not
gotten involved in this in the first

474
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,990
place. He can say whatever he
wants. Now, he called the players,

475
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,580
I think he called the players
sons of bitches or something.

476
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,550
That's fricking ridiculous and
awful and he shouldn't do that.

477
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,590
But he is entitled to his free speech as
well. Even, even when at that level it's,

478
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,390
it's a pretty gross thing that he said,

479
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,980
but everyone's free speech in
this instance was x was respected.

480
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,990
Everyone was allowed to
do whatever they want.

481
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,960
Now that doesn't mean you aren't
gonna suffer repercussions.

482
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,820
So let's say at the end of the day an
owner looks and they go, you know what?

483
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:39,080
We've got these players kneeling.

484
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,950
Now we see our audience is turning against
us because our audience doesn't want

485
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:47,060
that. We see our TV ratings
dropping, we see attendance dropping.

486
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,050
Um, we see merchandise not selling
as well. While I'm in a business,

487
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,590
I'm a business owner, I own a
team. They own a team for a reason.

488
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,930
You're allowed to then not hire people.
You're allowed to fire people. I mean,

489
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,250
this again, this has nothing to do with
the government. So this was actually,

490
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:07,580
even though it all felt weird,
it was government working.

491
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:11,420
Now if Trump or the government or
any state official or whatever it is,

492
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,340
would have used coercion of the
government to say, you have to stand.

493
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,690
Of course people, of course I
would be absolutely against that.

494
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,280
But they did not do that.

495
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,460
Now what happened yesterday
or it was earlier today, I'm,

496
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,560
I've been traveling so much,
I'm a little unclear, uh,

497
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,200
is that it sounds like what they're going
to do is if you don't want to come out,

498
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,540
if you're a player and you don't want
to come out for the national anthem,

499
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,460
they're just going to ask you to
stay in the locker room. That's a Oh,

500
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,190
the league making its decision and the
players now can choose whether to abide

501
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:44,941
by that or not.

502
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,140
And if they don't abide by it and they
go out there and they meal and the League

503
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,310
has said, you cannot do that, well then
they're going to suffer the repercussions.

504
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,880
They are 100% as far as I could
tell from everything I read today.

505
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,090
You could spend the other six days of
the weekend and 21 some odd hours minus

506
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:05,610
the three hours that you're on the field
playing football. You can be protesting,

507
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,370
you can be tweeting, you can
do whatever you want. Um,

508
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,290
but the league has a right to say what
standards are just as youtube, by the way,

509
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,590
has a right to do whatever
it wants. Again, I mean,

510
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:20,220
I think I started this off by saying
that these companies can do whatever they

511
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:20,461
want.

512
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,270
The idea that the government can come
in and either fix them or tell them what

513
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:26,580
to do is just something that I
just simply don't believe in.

514
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,340
And I've never heard a compelling
argument for it. And by the way,

515
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:34,110
I know that I disagree with this on some
people that I absolutely respect. Um,

516
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,060
so my basic feeling,

517
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,700
so your question was how would a
classical liberal feel about this?

518
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,120
I'm in a classical liberal, basically,
you believe in laissez faire economics.

519
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:46,830
You want a very light if at all, touch
of the government on these decisions.

520
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,220
So as long as no one's rights
were infringed on, no one,

521
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,930
no one was stopped from speaking.
In other words, if you're, if, look,

522
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,230
I have a business here, right?
Let's say, uh, tomorrow, uh,

523
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,670
a mirror came in here and said,
you know,

524
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:03,390
for the first half hour that I'm
working every day I'm going to protest

525
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,360
something and I'm going to stand here
with a picket fence and I'm going to,

526
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,950
you know, the picket sign
and blah, blah, blah. Well, I
might be like, you know what,

527
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:14,760
you have a right to do that. You have
a right to express your free speech,

528
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:18,960
of course, but you can't do it on
my dime. Does anyone think that?

529
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,100
Me As a small businessman,

530
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,880
I would have to hire someone that
wasn't working the entire time,

531
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:27,960
the entire time that I was there doing
the expectations which I've set forth?

532
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,600
I don't think so. So again,
this is where freedom is messy.

533
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:31,620
It doesn't all feel good.

534
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:35,610
I don't want people to have to be left
in the locker room and all of all the

535
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:39,120
underlying reasons that they're doing
this protest in the first place. Uh,

536
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:43,860
but everyone in this case is allowed to
make their choice. The owners, the league,

537
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:48,060
the players, the fans, everyone is
expressing themselves accordingly.

538
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,400
And if you're not happy with the
League did, then don't watch.

539
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,010
And if you are happy then
do watch and buy stuff.

540
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:56,850
So he got to let freedom ring.
You've got to let it ring.

541
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,500
That's what I think about that.
Okay.

542
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,320
Are you staying on the Diet while
on the tour? I basically am.

543
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:04,350
It's been obviously a little bit tough
and I did have a cheese steak while I was

544
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,110
in Philly. I wasn't going to go to
Philly and not have a cheese steak. Uh,

545
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:10,590
but yeah, I've been doing it. And
uh, so since we started this thing,

546
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:12,580
which was a little bit,
I think it was right into the beginning,

547
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,780
first week of January of this
year, uh, I'm down about 20 pounds.

548
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:18,810
I'm going to try to go for about five
more. I know I don't really need it,

549
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,940
but it's like once you start,
you're like feeling real good and you,

550
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,700
you look in the mirror and
you see those differences. Uh,

551
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,880
and I just feel good in general. I
think really getting, getting sugar out.

552
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:30,630
So I'm doing this sort of slow carb,
Paleo thing, very, very low car.

553
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:34,950
But mostly just meat and fish and
vegetables really got sugar out more than

554
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:39,120
anything else and I feel good.
I feel clean. I feel clear.
I feel lighter for sure.

555
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:39,781
Uh,

556
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,880
so I'm going to just keep trying do it
and then I guess at some point when I get

557
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,430
to some magic number,
then I just got to figure out how to,

558
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,760
how to kind of balance it out. All
right. We got about 20, 20 minutes here.

559
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,020
What are we doing here?
People?

560
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,400
I got three stand up events come in and
I want you to come back stage for no

561
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,660
extra charge. Okay. That was
my best. I became a uh, 1980s,

562
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:02,410
a salesman right there. Um, Tempe Improv,

563
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,430
June 3rd DC and June 7th,
Seattle at the parlor live.

564
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,730
If you buy a ticket right now and you're
one of the first 20 people at any of

565
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:13,540
those events at any of
those specific locations,

566
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,690
screenshot it right now.
Screenshot that you bought the tickets,

567
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,460
send it to contact@rubenreport.com and
we're going to let you in the meet and

568
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:24,130
greet for free. I'll say, Heidi, I'll
give you a high five. We'll take a selfie,

569
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,390
all that good stuff. And we're doing
that for 20 people per event. Okay,

570
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,120
here we go.
Dig in the art in the background.

571
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,180
So we got a lot of compliments on the art.
So there's this blue one here,

572
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,910
right there. Uh, that's
Kaitlyn rose. Janet,

573
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,700
who's done a bunch of artwork in
my house and she did the paint,

574
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,830
the painting that's on the
other side of the guests.

575
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,700
A lot of people see that say that they
see Kurt Cobain in there. You see,

576
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:49,510
I can kind of see it like there's an I
and there is an eye and there's the nose

577
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:54,310
and a mouth over there. Yeah.
Um, uh, so that's that. Um,

578
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,230
I always forget who did a, who did this,
oops. I always forget who did the, uh,

579
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,430
that one right there. A mirror knows
we'll, we'll post it in the comments. Um,

580
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,130
yeah, it's, uh, I like having good art.
We may do some refreshing around here and,

581
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:12,310
and change a few things as time goes
by. But uh, yeah, there you go. Um,

582
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,350
let's see. Um, can you tell us who
the bad actors are specifically?

583
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm not sure what you're referring to.
I do talk about bad actors often,

584
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,160
but I don't know what you're
specifically talking about in general.

585
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:25,150
When I talk about bad actors,

586
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:28,060
I'm talking about people that are
just misquoting people, intentionally.

587
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,700
People who are doing clickbait titles,

588
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:35,440
whether it's on youtube or on a, you
know, just print, whatever it is.

589
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:38,320
People who are just lying about
what other people are saying.

590
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:41,740
People more than anything else. People
who are talking about people all the time.

591
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,930
I mean, think about what I've
done here for the last hour.

592
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,800
I've talked about ideas. I don't care
about talking about specific people,

593
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,330
even Trump that much. I would much rather
talk about the underlying ideas, the, uh,

594
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,970
the fact that there are so
many journalists who wake
up in the morning and they

595
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:55,211
were like,

596
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:59,410
today I'm going to get Rubin or I'm going
to get Sam Harris or I'm going to get

597
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,690
Jordan Peterson or anybody.
And it's like,

598
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:05,140
if you think that we're the
biggest problem out there, you're,

599
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,630
you're a little misguided
in what you're doing. Um,

600
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:10,810
so I don't like talking about people and
if your goal everyday is to talk about

601
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:14,260
people and attack people and, and smear
in Lyons slander and all that stuff,

602
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,470
I just don't think you're a good
actor in this space. And when I,

603
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,880
when I say this space, I mean just in
the space of people talking about ideas,

604
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm not perfect. I'm not always right.
Uh, but if you are acting in good faith,

605
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,290
then I'm, then I'm happy
to talk to you. Um, okay.

606
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:33,310
Let's see what else is going on here.
Is Mike Pence a Cyborg?

607
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,890
Um, there's, he's a little robotic.

608
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,290
There is no doubt that the guy's a
little stiff. Uh, so I think it's,

609
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,790
I'd say there he's key. Could be 10%
robot. Is Hillary Clinton a lizard?

610
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,040
I possibly, uh, both cannot be true.
Well, anything's possible. Good question.

611
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:53,660
Good question. Um, okay.
Let's see. Um, all right,

612
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,250
what else do I want to tell you?
I'm going to let a couple,

613
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:59,810
a couple of other questions, a load in
here on, on Patriot and super jet. Um,

614
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,110
you know, bouncing around this
thing and go into all these cities.

615
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,380
What also has been nice about it just
in the last couple of weeks beyond,

616
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,820
beyond doing London, which was
great. Oh, I spoke at a Oxford Union,

617
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:14,030
which hopefully the video will be
up on their channel in a day or two.

618
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,650
It was just wonderful. Uh, so Oxford
Union, it's in, it's in Oxford,

619
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:21,170
which is about an hour away from London.
And I didn't realize this,

620
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:24,710
but it's a small collection of colleges.
Some of the colleges are very small.

621
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,090
I think someone's gonna be one of the
colleges is like 14 people and then some

622
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:31,190
guy, some of hundreds, et cetera.
And it's in this really great,

623
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:34,530
quaint old town that you kind of
feel like you're in Harry Potter. Uh,

624
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,020
and it really is one of the last bastions
of free speech at the academic level.

625
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,510
Uh,
and it was just wonderful.

626
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:45,620
So what we did was they were probably
about diabetes. It was standing room only.

627
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:49,820
I don't know, maybe about 200 students
there. Uh, the president of Oxford Union,

628
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,450
a lovely young lady. Uh,
she asked me questions.

629
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:56,570
I didn't know anything in advance. They,
you, they let you do it however you want.

630
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:57,141
So she said,
you know,

631
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,050
I could give an opening statement and
then we could do a Q and a and then we'll

632
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,660
take questions from the crowd.
She could ask me questions,

633
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,580
interviewing me however you want
to do it. I said, you know what,

634
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm so used to being on this side of
the interview. Let me just sit down.

635
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:08,960
I don't need to make an opening statement.

636
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:10,340
Just start asking me whatever you think.

637
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,190
She asked some pretty challenging
questions right from beat one.

638
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:17,540
And the audience asked spectacular
questions and challenge me on some stuff.

639
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:22,400
And it was a true joy. Every second
of it, uh, was a joy. And then I, uh,

640
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,660
had a drink with,
uh,

641
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:27,290
with some of the students after and
it was like all of these kids again,

642
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,150
and I hate having to say this,

643
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:33,560
but I think it's important
because of all the smear pieces,

644
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,150
the diversity of color and ethnicity
and background and religion and all and,

645
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,760
and sexuality and all that stuff.
It's all there.

646
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,630
And stop thinking that people's
ideas are based on those things.

647
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:49,170
What a sad way to live, you
know, in a sad way to live. Uh,

648
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,720
it was just great. A super chat, mate. I
love what you're about. Thank you mate.

649
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,790
And I love your love. So thank you
very much for that. Um, yeah, so, uh,

650
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:00,550
so London, but then, uh,

651
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,290
we get back to the states and just in
the last couple of days, as I said,

652
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:08,120
we did Boston. We did Philly, we did
Toronto, we did Denver, we did, uh,

653
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,270
we're doing Texas bunch of
SOPs in Texas. We did. Oh Man,

654
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,430
we've been all over the place.
Like it's actually,

655
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,060
it's hard for me to even like
categorize exactly where we've been,

656
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,940
but what's been nice is that each,
we did San Francisco.

657
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,680
What's nice is that each city is
its own thing. We did Seattle.

658
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,050
It's like you can really get a
flavor for each thing. So the,

659
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:31,400
so the shows that I've enjoyed the most
so far, uh, San Francisco is spectacular.

660
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,360
Uh, because I brought up Eric Weinstein
as a surprise. So I did about 10 minutes,

661
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:37,800
get the crowd's going crazy. And
then I was like, you know what,

662
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,500
here's another member of the ID.
I bring out Eric Weinstein.

663
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,580
He plays the harmonica, he goes up there,
plays the harmonica for about a minute,

664
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,490
3000 people applauding.
And it was like, man,

665
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,640
I go backstage with him after and it's
like this guy is so accomplished in

666
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:53,280
mathematics and economics and you know,

667
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:58,330
he works with Peter Teal and it was like
the true joy on this guy's face that he

668
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:03,300
got to play the harmonica for
3000 people in that they loved it.

669
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:04,590
It was just so awesome.

670
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,580
What I found is that the cities that
lean a little more left, so a Seattle,

671
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:09,900
San Francisco for example,

672
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,380
that's where the crowds had
been the hottest because I
think because they're the

673
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,660
outliers there, they come
and they're like, holy cow,

674
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:20,460
we're here with other people kind of
think like us. So it's very exciting. Um,

675
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,770
but, but really all of the
shows have been good. They,

676
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:23,880
they're all sort of different.

677
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,190
Philly last night it was a little more of
a working class crowd. You can tell. Uh,

678
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,520
but it's great and people are coming,
they get dressed up,

679
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,960
people are wearing suits.
Um, and, and, and, you know,

680
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,990
girls are wearing dresses. It's just,
it really, it's just great. It's just,

681
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:41,130
it's just been a true joy.
All right. Couple of other
things here. Um, let's see.

682
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,270
Do you still open,

683
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:46,200
you're open yourself to having your mind
changed as the intellectual dark web

684
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,470
gains momentum. How do you
make sure you're not becoming
dogmatic and your views?

685
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,131
I mean,

686
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:55,050
all I can do is constantly
be open to ideas and,

687
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,500
and see where the best ones fall. I
don't think there's any, you know,

688
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,300
that's really the beauty
of this thing. I, you know,

689
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:04,050
I saw some of the hit pieces on this
where they tried to frame us as a mostly

690
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:07,830
white male group. Now first off, we
all just happened to come together.

691
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,630
I don't even know what
this thing is exactly.

692
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:12,390
I don't know what the
gatekeeping is. That's what a
lot of the discussions about.

693
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,790
We don't have a card. We don't
have the clubhouse. But yes,

694
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,660
are there a bunch of people? But by the
way, I would say that that, you know,

695
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:22,380
it obviously also includes, uh, you
know, it's as that it's white men,

696
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:26,370
which even if it was just white men,
straight white men,

697
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,860
and I'm not even one of them,
even if it was,

698
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,920
that has nothing to do
with the set of ideas.

699
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,400
So it's really interesting that the
same people who tell everyone else that

700
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,470
they're bigots and racists
and homophobia and all that,

701
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,860
they're the ones actually
practicing bigotry in this case.

702
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,270
But the group is truly diverse.

703
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,450
We've got ideas all over the place and
we've got men and women and gays and

704
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,410
straights and the rest of it.

705
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,810
So the best I can do is continually
be open to ideas. So by the way,

706
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,261
you know,

707
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:57,261
it's like two weeks ago I had a lipper
deep libertarian economics professor Don

708
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,880
Boudreaux from George Mason University on.

709
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:02,970
Now he happens to fall into a lot of
the ideas that I've come to really love.

710
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:03,804
I love you.

711
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,450
[inaudible] we did the little bit of
what the difference between a classical

712
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,600
liberal and a libertarian.
He's, he's into the AMCAP stuff,

713
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:13,260
which intellectually I just think it's
a fun exercise of if you want to follow

714
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,330
through your logic of where
small government leads,

715
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,300
I think it's a fun conversation to have.
So I really enjoyed that.

716
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,980
Then what did we do this past Monday?
Uh, we put up our interview with,

717
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,240
uh, who do we have on, on Monday,
man, I've been traveling a lot. Um,

718
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,150
Jenny Wilson Bank, you, uh, Jenny Wilson,

719
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:34,950
who's a Democrat running in a deep red
state of Utah and now obviously when it

720
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,240
to certain issues where
we talked about diversity,

721
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:41,260
we came to certain issues about economics.
We didn't agree and we agree.

722
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,170
I think at one point we actually said we
agreed to disagree and then we moved on

723
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,250
and it's like, I loved having
that conversation too. I,
this is what it's about.

724
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:50,740
And I think 80% of us,
I really believe this,

725
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,980
80% of us are in that same space and
it's the fringes on both sides that are

726
00:38:56,351 --> 00:39:00,610
loud and annoying. My concern is
much more, obviously with the,

727
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,170
with the extremes of the left because
they have so much to do with media and

728
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:09,910
television and politics and no one has
ever called far left in the media even

729
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,660
though most of the democratic
establishment at this point
is pretty far left and

730
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:17,760
everyone is smeared as far right
are all right. But, um, um,

731
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,820
I will keep doing it and call me out if
you think I'm becoming done that in my

732
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,240
approach. Uh, please call me out.
I guess that that would be, uh,

733
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,260
putting the job back on you guys.
Uh, let's see. Uh, superchat Dave,

734
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,110
your thoughts on the recent
monk debate between Jordan B.

735
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,930
Peterson and Michael Eric Dyson. Keep
up the good work and call Shapiro, uh,

736
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,020
when you need a lifeline
fighting the regressives.

737
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,440
I've got Shapiro on speed dial. Don't
worry. Um, so I didn't see the debate yet.

738
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:42,820
I've heard a tremendous amount about it.

739
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,970
Obviously I've been traveling and I was
with Jordan, so I just haven't had time.

740
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,950
Jordan did talk about it a little bit,

741
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,950
but I don't want to repeat any of that
here because I just don't want to, uh,

742
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,900
even slightly misquote him or
anything. Um, but it sounds like, look,

743
00:39:55,901 --> 00:40:00,901
it was him and Steven Fry verse
Michael Eric Dyson and um,

744
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,450
I think her name is Michelle Goldberg on
free speech and political correctness.

745
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,040
I suspect I'm going to agree more with
Stephen Fry and, and uh, Jordan. Uh,

746
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:13,600
but I will, I will check it out.
Um, all right, let's see. Uh,

747
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,660
I'm interested in getting in on the
conversation in the public light.

748
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:20,980
Any advice on where to start? Yeah.
Get on Youtube, man. Get on Youtube.

749
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,940
Just start saying what you think.
Start saying what you think.

750
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,880
That's what all of you guys are doing
and the more of these videos you share,

751
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,260
forget about what I'm doing for a second.

752
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:32,140
The more that you just in your own life,
say what you think.

753
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:35,710
That's all that I'm doing. Get out
there and do it. We need you out there.

754
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,840
The more they will realize that they
can't destroy us all with the mob,

755
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:42,370
that we're going to
stand up for ourselves.

756
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:46,750
We're not going to live in
fear and cowardice and that
we're not bad people and

757
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,690
that we're not bigots and racists and the
rest of the things that they say about

758
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:51,160
us and that we want all people,

759
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:55,900
black people and Muslim people and
Trans people and everything else to live

760
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:59,500
equally as I've repeatedly said at
the University of New Hampshire event,

761
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,230
although the, uh, the protesters
weren't that happy, you know,

762
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,870
that was a good example of what's
going on here. Actually, you know,

763
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,300
the protesters that came there,
they don't listen. Like I,

764
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,340
I could see who they were
from the beginning. Right.

765
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,920
You can figure it out cause they had noise
makers and they're kind of looking at

766
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:15,220
me dismissively and some,
some with just outright hatred,

767
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,030
which is really disturbing when you see
like a couple of young people, uh, I go,

768
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:22,330
or I suppose of any age just staring
at you with true hatred, like,

769
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,300
and I could see it in
them really. I could, um,

770
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,330
you're not going to affect those
people that much. You can't,

771
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,150
they have to break out of
that themselves at some point.

772
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,400
But all of the other people
that were there to be, uh,

773
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,600
to listen respectfully and hear about
ideas and engage in the conversations,

774
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,100
um, that's what it's all about. And
those are the people that you can get.

775
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,580
And I think in a weird way, the more
that these people become hysterical,

776
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,130
the more they're pushing people to us.
So again,

777
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,160
this is why whatever this group of
people is the reason we all keep getting

778
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:55,700
pushed together and the reason that a
guy on the left like Sam Harris can be

779
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:58,640
pushed this way and a guy like Ben
Shapiro or could be pushed this way,

780
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,420
is that what I think is in the middle is
it's not about politics, about freedom.

781
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,080
So when you take these two guys, I
mean, this to me is the best example.

782
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:10,700
They disagree on literally everything
from God and existential issues to taxes

783
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,900
and abortion and everything else.

784
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,770
But they're allies because they're both
fighting for their right to be able to

785
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,750
think freely and express
themselves freely.

786
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:21,710
And that is a beautiful thing and
that's what it's all about. Okay.

787
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,110
Real quick here. Uh Oh. Alright.

788
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,430
A lot of people still ask
them about the sweatshirt.

789
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:29,350
Rubin report.com/store we got, we
got sweatshirts, tee shirts, cutoffs.

790
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,140
I'll all kinds of stuff. And a while I'll
do, I'll do the pimp out one more time.

791
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,490
Uh, June 3rd, Tempe, Arizona
at the Tempe Improv, uh,

792
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,760
June 7th at the DC Improv and uh,

793
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,180
Seattle on June 20th at the parlor live.
Uh,

794
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,210
if you are watching this and you're one
of the first 20 people to buy tickets to

795
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,850
any of those events and the links
are right down below, uh, we,

796
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:52,850
we'll upgrade you for free to get into
the meet and greet with me after and we

797
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:54,650
can hang out and say hi
and all that good stuff.

798
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,200
All you gotta do is buy the ticket
and then just screenshot it,

799
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,730
send it to contact@rubenreport.com my
guys were on it and we'll take good care

800
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:05,000
of you. Um, what are your predictions
for the midterm election? So look,

801
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,470
I set a couple months,

802
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,520
maybe two months ago that I didn't think
it was going to be this, uh, you know,

803
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,520
they were talking about the blue wave
and the democratic wave and all that.

804
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,260
I just don't really see it.
Now you have to remember with midterms,

805
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:22,460
it's particularly hard to judge these
things properly because so few people vote

806
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,990
that it's only about voter turnout.
So it's a little hard,

807
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,440
harder to gauge, I think, than
a presidential election. Um,

808
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,640
what I would say is that I see a lot of
reason to think that there won't be a

809
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:36,590
blue wave. If anything,
there will be a red wave.

810
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:41,420
I think it partly has to do with
Kanye west and Candice Owens,

811
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,550
where I think the black community
is starting to break. I mean,

812
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:45,680
a poll came out right after
the Kanye West thing that said,

813
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:50,681
black male support for Trump doubled
from 11 to 22% within a week.

814
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,890
If that had been any other president
in the history of the world,

815
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,710
people would have gone bananas mainstream.

816
00:43:57,711 --> 00:44:02,711
Basically ignore that black male support
for the president doubled in a week and

817
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,920
barely anybody talked about
that. So I still think, you know,

818
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:07,970
I see people all the time,

819
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:10,610
people come up to me here in la where
you can't really say you're a Trump

820
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:13,790
supporter or republican or whatever,
and they know that I'm not in,

821
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,490
I don't even vote for the guy. And they'll
come up to me and say, you know, Dave,

822
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,830
I'm so sick of this
political correctness stuff.

823
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:21,860
I mean the same stuff that was happening
before the election that has just

824
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:25,130
ramped up even more, that they're
suddenly, they're like, I kinda, I'm,

825
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,840
it's starting to like Trump. It's
weird. It's really weird. Um,

826
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,300
so I don't that there's going to be a
blue wave again. It's all about turnout,

827
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,490
I think will happen. Is that
within the, we'll do some shows,

828
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:39,780
obviously you're leading up to it.

829
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:41,940
And I would say that about
two weeks before the election,

830
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,370
that's when we'll really be able
to figure out what's going on here.

831
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:49,170
Sort of around the 20th or so of October
because that's when we'll see really

832
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:54,150
like which base is more enthused and
which is, and, and just what is, I mean,

833
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,030
there's so many x factors. It's hard
to figure it out this, this early on.

834
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:58,890
So all these people that pretend
they know what they're saying,

835
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,300
I mean they just don't.
Okay. Let's see. Um,

836
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,390
what single book has had the greatest
impact on changing your way of thinking or

837
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:11,910
a worldview? Well, you know,
I've been traveling with, uh,

838
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,920
with on liberty by John Stuart Mill,

839
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,680
and it's a very easy read and I would
recommend that all of you guys get it.

840
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,520
But I think, you know, there's
so many great books here
from so many great people,

841
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,700
but one book that I do reference a lot,
and I,

842
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:26,100
and I think it was formative
for me for several reasons.

843
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:30,990
So I'm in 1997 I was a,
I think I was a junior,

844
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:34,950
I was either a sophomore or junior in
college. Uh, and I saw the movie contact,

845
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,200
the movie with Jodie foster
and Matthew mcconaughey.

846
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,320
It's the only book of fiction
ever written by Carl Sagan.

847
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,280
And I just thought it was
the most wonderful movie
about all of the things that

848
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:44,821
I care about,

849
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:49,740
the battle between science and religion
and government and belief and all of

850
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:52,450
these things. Uh, by the way, I just
watched it a few months ago now.

851
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,750
It's even more relevant in a
weird way than ever before.

852
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,610
And it's done by Robertson Atkins,
who's brilliant,

853
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,960
who did a Apollo 13 and Gump and
a bunch of other stuff. Anyway,

854
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:05,100
that movie got me to read the book,
a contact,

855
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:06,780
which is also a wonderful,
uh,

856
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,560
but then it got me to read many other
Carl Sagan books and his last book,

857
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,290
which a lot of people
don't even know about.

858
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,850
And he actually passed away before
he finished it. And then his wife,

859
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,280
Andrew [inaudible],
who's also a professor at Cornell,

860
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:20,940
she actually finished the book, uh,
or at least did the last paragraph.

861
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,020
It's called billions and billions.
And it's funny because, uh,

862
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,360
Carl opens the book by saying that,
you know,

863
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,980
for some of you guys
that are a little older,

864
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:33,630
you may remember Johnny Carson
doing an impression of, um,

865
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,740
of Carl Sagan saying billions and billions
talking about stars. Apparently he,

866
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,600
Carl Sagan actually never
even said that phrase,

867
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,130
but people used to attribute
it to him all the time.

868
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,690
But that's why you titled
it billions of billions.

869
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,140
And it's just a wonderful book
on tribalism and religion.

870
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,440
And he talks a little
bit about, um, about,

871
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:52,410
I think he talks a little bit about
marijuana, or maybe that's in cosmos.

872
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:55,020
It's just, it's just a
wonderful book. That's his,

873
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,050
his true gift was being able
to communicate science and
thoughtful ideas to sort

874
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:04,380
of regular people. So if you're
looking for just something readable,

875
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,360
that's not like hundreds of pages,

876
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:09,480
that's going to like slam
you with complex information,

877
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,360
but something that can open up
some of the doors for this stuff.

878
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:16,890
Billions and billions by
Carl Sagan. I can't, I can't
recommend it. Uh, any higher.

879
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,210
Alright. Uh, okay.

880
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,350
We gotta we gotta wrap this thing
up cause I got two guests come in.

881
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,980
I just came in from Philly this morning.
I got, I got two guys to come in, uh,

882
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,820
which you'll find out about it
and the next couple of days. Uh,

883
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:31,150
so just a reminder guys, uh,

885
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,950

886
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:42,730
part of their live.

887
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,100
The links are right down below and if

888
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,710
first people to buy tickets
while you're watching this,

889
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,890

contacted Ruben report.com.
Anyway. All right,

892
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,350
I'm going to take a few minutes to
throw a little water on my face,

893
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:03,940
collect myself. We got, we got two
shows coming up today. Uh, and uh,

894
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:04,501
and then I'm,

895
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:07,300
I'm home actually for the weekend where
I'm going to try to relax a little bit

896
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,490
and just chill out and not spend time
online or any of that other stuff. And,

897
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:16,840
uh, and then we're back out on the
road, uh, on Tuesday we're in Houston.

898
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,080
And then I think the next night we're
in Dallas and then Austin and we're just

899
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:25,060
rolling out. So we're doing this basically
the rest of May, the rest of June. Uh,

900
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:28,240
we're doing a ton of it in July.
I signed on for most of those.

901
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,420
And then Jordan's actually
gonna continue into August. Uh,

902
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:34,060
but I'm doing the off the grid for
August thing. So I had to say no to the,

903
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,330
to the rest of that. And I want
to talk more about my ideas for,

904
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,630
for me going off the grid and I want to
challenge some of you guys perhaps to

905
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,420
join me on this. Uh, many of
you know, I did this last year,

906
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,210
were locked my phone in a safe
and didn't watch the news,

907
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,980
didn't do anything online, no computers,
no. Uh, no television or anything,

908
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:53,110
nothing electronic. And it was
true. It was life changing.

909
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:55,570
And I'm going to do it again in August,
and I think this year I'm going to,

910
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,110
I'm going to challenge you guys to
maybe try a version of it for yourself,

911
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,470
if not for the month, maybe for a
week or whatever you can do. Anyway,

912
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,410
I'm super psyched about what's going on.
Uh,

913
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,430
make sure you subscribe to the channel.
Of course.

914
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,250
Make sure you're getting the
notifications with that little bell,

915
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:10,570
but who the hell knows what's going on?

916
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,780
And lots of cool stuff happening
and a that is all over and out.
