I'd like to set your puzzle the puzzle
is about a cat a mouse and as is

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200
is about a cat a mouse and as is
 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.990
is about a cat a mouse and as is
traditional in cat and mouse situations

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000

one is chasing the other the mouse is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
one is chasing the other the mouse is
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.410
one is chasing the other the mouse is
super quick compared to a cat even

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
super quick compared to a cat even
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.700
super quick compared to a cat even
though the cat is pretty quick but in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
though the cat is pretty quick but in
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.100
though the cat is pretty quick but in
this case to keep interesting the mouse

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
this case to keep interesting the mouse
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.350
this case to keep interesting the mouse
is without realizing run into a pond

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
is without realizing run into a pond
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.090
is without realizing run into a pond
there's this whiskers and little tail

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
there's this whiskers and little tail
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.590
there's this whiskers and little tail
and if you go anywhere in the pond

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
and if you go anywhere in the pond
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.890
and if you go anywhere in the pond
because the cat worst mouse it's got to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
because the cat worst mouse it's got to
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.720
because the cat worst mouse it's got to
be small isn't it like I could draw it

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
be small isn't it like I could draw it
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519
be small isn't it like I could draw it
big and then you'd be like worst pond

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
big and then you'd be like worst pond
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859
big and then you'd be like worst pond
ever compared to the mouse anyway to

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
ever compared to the mouse anyway to
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.640
ever compared to the mouse anyway to
scale then here is the cat good enough

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
scale then here is the cat good enough
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.720
scale then here is the cat good enough
No how's that it's gotta have ears all

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
No how's that it's gotta have ears all
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.049
No how's that it's gotta have ears all
right

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
right
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.869
right
yes it's not bad that's better so for

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
yes it's not bad that's better so for
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.250
yes it's not bad that's better so for
the sake of the puzzle the cat is gonna

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
the sake of the puzzle the cat is gonna
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.630
the sake of the puzzle the cat is gonna
sit on the edge but it can cruise around

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
sit on the edge but it can cruise around
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810
sit on the edge but it can cruise around
the edge waiting for the mouse to leave

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
the edge waiting for the mouse to leave
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.819

the pond that's like stalking the air

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
the pond that's like stalking the air
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459
the pond that's like stalking the air
exactly now I think it's believable that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
exactly now I think it's believable that
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959
exactly now I think it's believable that
even though the mouse could run quicker

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
even though the mouse could run quicker
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.229
even though the mouse could run quicker
than the cat on land in water it's going

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
than the cat on land in water it's going
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.790
than the cat on land in water it's going
to slow down it but it can swim we're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
to slow down it but it can swim we're
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.020
to slow down it but it can swim we're
not gonna we'll do the modeling

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
not gonna we'll do the modeling
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.340

situation you know Steve some things

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
situation you know Steve some things
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.679
situation you know Steve some things
like the mouse it's not going to drown

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689
like the mouse it's not going to drown
 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.480
like the mouse it's not going to drown
it can swim that assuming the cat

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
it can swim that assuming the cat
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.320
it can swim that assuming the cat
doesn't actually go in the water

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
doesn't actually go in the water
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.030
doesn't actually go in the water
although it probably could and swipe it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
although it probably could and swipe it
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.320
although it probably could and swipe it
from the edge all of that stuff let's

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
from the edge all of that stuff let's
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850
from the edge all of that stuff let's
just assume it sensibly for puzzle world

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
just assume it sensibly for puzzle world
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609
just assume it sensibly for puzzle world
and let's assume the cat can run four

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
and let's assume the cat can run four
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620
and let's assume the cat can run four
times quicker than the mouse can swim in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
times quicker than the mouse can swim in
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539
times quicker than the mouse can swim in
fact that's the only numerical detail

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
fact that's the only numerical detail
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429
fact that's the only numerical detail
I'm going to give the cat can walk or

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
I'm going to give the cat can walk or
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170
I'm going to give the cat can walk or
run four times quicker than the mouse

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
run four times quicker than the mouse
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999
run four times quicker than the mouse
can swim and that's it so the simple

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
can swim and that's it so the simple
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.010
can swim and that's it so the simple
question now is can the mouse escape

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020
question now is can the mouse escape
 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.510
question now is can the mouse escape

cat who runs around the edge luckily he

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
cat who runs around the edge luckily he
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.030
cat who runs around the edge luckily he
looks in the right direction I'm very

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
looks in the right direction I'm very
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.410

proud of that animation I'm very glad
that everyone else is appreciating that

the mouse can go anywhere he likes if he

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
the mouse can go anywhere he likes if he

the mouse can go anywhere he likes if he
goes the other side of the cat does

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830
goes the other side of the cat does
 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.940
goes the other side of the cat does
check where he's going but let's assume

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
check where he's going but let's assume
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.410
check where he's going but let's assume
he starts at the center and there's a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420
he starts at the center and there's a
 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.330

couple of things to sort out first is

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340
couple of things to sort out first is
 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.170
couple of things to sort out first is
that one tactic the mouse could do is

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180
that one tactic the mouse could do is
 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.680
that one tactic the mouse could do is
the obvious one of run away in this case

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690
the obvious one of run away in this case
 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.350
the obvious one of run away in this case
swim away but you could just say like

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
swim away but you could just say like
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120
swim away but you could just say like
why don't you as a mouse just swim away

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130
why don't you as a mouse just swim away
 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.160
why don't you as a mouse just swim away
from the cat and what I mean from that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
from the cat and what I mean from that
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.570
from the cat and what I mean from that
is like if you imagine a line from the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
is like if you imagine a line from the
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.250
is like if you imagine a line from the
cat to the mouse wherever that is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
cat to the mouse wherever that is
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.500
cat to the mouse wherever that is
imagine that line and the mouse swims in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
imagine that line and the mouse swims in
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.910
imagine that line and the mouse swims in
the opposite direction and I can show

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
the opposite direction and I can show
 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.960
the opposite direction and I can show
you that happening actually so I'm going

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970
you that happening actually so I'm going
 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.670
you that happening actually so I'm going
to click this button up here is the away

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
to click this button up here is the away
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740
to click this button up here is the away
tactic and the reason I'm showing you is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
tactic and the reason I'm showing you is
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.380
tactic and the reason I'm showing you is
that it doesn't work then you see the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
that it doesn't work then you see the
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.030
that it doesn't work then you see the
mouse is following this little arrow

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
mouse is following this little arrow
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.410
mouse is following this little arrow
which is moving around depending where

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
which is moving around depending where
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.000
which is moving around depending where
the case but the count is so quick that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
the case but the count is so quick that
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.400
the case but the count is so quick that
you can always kind of get around to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
you can always kind of get around to
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.930
you can always kind of get around to
head the mouse off even though it looks

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940
head the mouse off even though it looks
 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.550
head the mouse off even though it looks
like he was going to make it the cat

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560
like he was going to make it the cat
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.870
like he was going to make it the cat
camera was real quick and we get these

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880
camera was real quick and we get these
 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.520
camera was real quick and we get these
actually nice pans are turning up which

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
actually nice pans are turning up which
 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.070
actually nice pans are turning up which
are typical of these curves that pursuit

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
are typical of these curves that pursuit
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.110
are typical of these curves that pursuit
they're usually kind of curvy they're

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
they're usually kind of curvy they're
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.789
they're usually kind of curvy they're
not always easy to model mathematically

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799
not always easy to model mathematically
 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.770
not always easy to model mathematically
and these ones that you know they're

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
and these ones that you know they're
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.940
and these ones that you know they're
always getting symmetrical but there's a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
always getting symmetrical but there's a
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.470
always getting symmetrical but there's a
little bit of randomness you can see the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480
little bit of randomness you can see the
 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.750
little bit of randomness you can see the
cat wobbles when he gets in line cuz

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760
cat wobbles when he gets in line cuz
 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.310
cat wobbles when he gets in line cuz
he's he's constantly trying to move but

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320
he's he's constantly trying to move but
 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.479
he's he's constantly trying to move but
he doesn't need to move because he's

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
he doesn't need to move because he's
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.370
he doesn't need to move because he's
already as close as he can get to the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
already as close as he can get to the
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470
already as close as he can get to the
mouse but it's pretty obvious after

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
mouse but it's pretty obvious after
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.330
mouse but it's pretty obvious after
watching this for a few seconds this is

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340
watching this for a few seconds this is
 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.460
watching this for a few seconds this is
going to repeat even if it's not gonna

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470
going to repeat even if it's not gonna
 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.259
going to repeat even if it's not gonna
be exactly the same path the mouse looks

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
be exactly the same path the mouse looks
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.160
be exactly the same path the mouse looks
like he's doomed

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
like he's doomed
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.800
like he's doomed
so the runaway tactic or swim awake

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810
so the runaway tactic or swim awake
 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.630
so the runaway tactic or swim awake
tactic doesn't work which means if

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
tactic doesn't work which means if
 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.680
tactic doesn't work which means if
you've been thinking about that on your

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690
you've been thinking about that on your
 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.670
you've been thinking about that on your
little pause where you were just

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
little pause where you were just
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.050
little pause where you were just
thinking about it you should probably

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
thinking about it you should probably
 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.910
thinking about it you should probably
stop thinking about it because it's not

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
stop thinking about it because it's not
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.020
stop thinking about it because it's not
going to get there all right well I

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030
going to get there all right well I
 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.520
going to get there all right well I
think it's a pretty sensible tactic and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
think it's a pretty sensible tactic and
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.380
think it's a pretty sensible tactic and
we it'll be a stupid thing not to try it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390
we it'll be a stupid thing not to try it
 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.240
we it'll be a stupid thing not to try it
first and it's difficult to sort out in

gonna work so the nice thing to do quite

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
gonna work so the nice thing to do quite
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.020
gonna work so the nice thing to do quite
often for mathematicians even physicists

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
often for mathematicians even physicists
 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.789

doesn't work I'm gonna suggest a hint

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
doesn't work I'm gonna suggest a hint
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.330
doesn't work I'm gonna suggest a hint
now though that I think the mouse can't

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340
now though that I think the mouse can't
 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.400
now though that I think the mouse can't
escape and therefore it's instructed to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
escape and therefore it's instructed to
 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.690
escape and therefore it's instructed to
think if this isn't working

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
think if this isn't working
 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.150
think if this isn't working
how else could he possibly do it and get

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160
how else could he possibly do it and get
 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.410
how else could he possibly do it and get
away

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420
away
 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.540
away
okay so again if you want to have a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550
okay so again if you want to have a
 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.559
okay so again if you want to have a
think about it how think about Mouse has

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569
think about it how think about Mouse has
 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.360
think about it how think about Mouse has
not gone away yet the obvious tactic of

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370
not gone away yet the obvious tactic of
 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.800
not gone away yet the obvious tactic of
running away or swimming away doesn't

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810
running away or swimming away doesn't
 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.990
running away or swimming away doesn't
work and one other tactic which a lot of

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
work and one other tactic which a lot of
 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.370
work and one other tactic which a lot of
people tell me with this puzzle that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380
people tell me with this puzzle that
 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.809
people tell me with this puzzle that
might be sensible is instead of running

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819
might be sensible is instead of running
 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.350
might be sensible is instead of running
away from the cat maybe you should run

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360
away from the cat maybe you should run
 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.820
away from the cat maybe you should run
towards the point which is farthest away

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830
towards the point which is farthest away
 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.090
towards the point which is farthest away
from the cat so I think that's obviously

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100
from the cat so I think that's obviously
 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.100
from the cat so I think that's obviously
in this case the pond edge point

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110
in this case the pond edge point
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.560
in this case the pond edge point
opposite the cat no no it sounds like

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570
opposite the cat no no it sounds like
 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.060
opposite the cat no no it sounds like
that's the place you want to be if you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070
that's the place you want to be if you
 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.530
that's the place you want to be if you
can arrange it because the cat's not

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540
can arrange it because the cat's not
 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.390
can arrange it because the cat's not
anywhere near to eat you of course that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400
anywhere near to eat you of course that
 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.860
anywhere near to eat you of course that
the opposite point tactic so I'm going

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870
the opposite point tactic so I'm going
 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.000
the opposite point tactic so I'm going
to show you what happens if you try a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010
to show you what happens if you try a
 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.890
to show you what happens if you try a
mouse doing the opposite point tactic

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900
mouse doing the opposite point tactic
 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.110
mouse doing the opposite point tactic
here we go you see the green arrows I'm

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
here we go you see the green arrows I'm
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.310
here we go you see the green arrows I'm
heading towards the point opposite the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
heading towards the point opposite the
 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.170
heading towards the point opposite the
cat which is chugging away around

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
cat which is chugging away around
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.780
cat which is chugging away around
because the cat is quick and it keeps

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790
because the cat is quick and it keeps
 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.430
because the cat is quick and it keeps
chasing the mouse and this angle is

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440
chasing the mouse and this angle is
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.990
chasing the mouse and this angle is
trying to it's gonna close the angle and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000
trying to it's gonna close the angle and
 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.460
trying to it's gonna close the angle and
it just means the mouse goes in circles

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470
it just means the mouse goes in circles
 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.950
it just means the mouse goes in circles
because he's not moving quick enough

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
because he's not moving quick enough
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.790
because he's not moving quick enough
obviously the puzzle will be different

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800
obviously the puzzle will be different
 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.409
obviously the puzzle will be different
if the mouse was quicker but it wouldn't

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419
if the mouse was quicker but it wouldn't
 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.280
if the mouse was quicker but it wouldn't
be as interesting because the mouse

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290
be as interesting because the mouse
 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.110
be as interesting because the mouse
could just swim through so I just wanted

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120
could just swim through so I just wanted
 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.180
could just swim through so I just wanted
to point out another sensible tactic to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190
to point out another sensible tactic to
 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.180
to point out another sensible tactic to
try swim away from the cat towards the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190
try swim away from the cat towards the
 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.159
try swim away from the cat towards the
opposite edge doesn't work either and

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
opposite edge doesn't work either and
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.719
opposite edge doesn't work either and
this time he just goes around in circles

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729
 
 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.860
 
there are two more tactics I want to

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870
there are two more tactics I want to
 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.180
there are two more tactics I want to
show you neither of which really help

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190
show you neither of which really help
 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.270
show you neither of which really help
but together they're quite good so let

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
but together they're quite good so let
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.320
but together they're quite good so let
me introduce some vocab which I've just

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330
me introduce some vocab which I've just
 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.960
me introduce some vocab which I've just
made up which will help me refer to

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970
made up which will help me refer to
 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.250
made up which will help me refer to
these tactics what I'm going to call the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260
these tactics what I'm going to call the
 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.610
these tactics what I'm going to call the
dash tactic which is swim away but not

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620
dash tactic which is swim away but not
 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.260
dash tactic which is swim away but not
away from the cat or towards the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270
away from the cat or towards the
 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.520
away from the cat or towards the
opposite edge but just towards the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530
opposite edge but just towards the
 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.050
opposite edge but just towards the
nearest edge of the pond

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060
nearest edge of the pond
 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.580
nearest edge of the pond
I feel like sensible tactic you're in a

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590
I feel like sensible tactic you're in a
 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.409
I feel like sensible tactic you're in a
pond they wanna get out you don't swim

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419
pond they wanna get out you don't swim
 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.650
pond they wanna get out you don't swim
the long way so on the screen this looks

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660
the long way so on the screen this looks
 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.870
the long way so on the screen this looks
like this so I've got a dash tactic and

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880
like this so I've got a dash tactic and
 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.990
like this so I've got a dash tactic and
the moment my mouse is closest to that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000
the moment my mouse is closest to that
 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.700
the moment my mouse is closest to that
point over there it's kind of like the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710
point over there it's kind of like the
 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.230
point over there it's kind of like the
radius from the point through the mouse

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240
radius from the point through the mouse
 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.440
radius from the point through the mouse
to the edge and if I click on - he just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450
to the edge and if I click on - he just
 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.629
to the edge and if I click on - he just
heads towards the a

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639
 
 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.129
 
now obviously that wasn't very

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139
now obviously that wasn't very
 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.170
now obviously that wasn't very
successful but it depends where the

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180
successful but it depends where the
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.339
successful but it depends where the
mouse is to start with right if I put

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349
mouse is to start with right if I put
 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.469
mouse is to start with right if I put
the mouse on the other side a long way

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479
the mouse on the other side a long way
 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.240
the mouse on the other side a long way
away from the cat and he's close to the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250
away from the cat and he's close to the
 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.749
away from the cat and he's close to the
edge then a dash will get him out that

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759
edge then a dash will get him out that
 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.100
edge then a dash will get him out that
doesn't solve our problem but it means

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110
doesn't solve our problem but it means
 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.899
doesn't solve our problem but it means
there are some places in the pond where

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909
there are some places in the pond where
 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.149
there are some places in the pond where
if the mouse can get to I know he can

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159
if the mouse can get to I know he can
 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.790
if the mouse can get to I know he can
get out with a dash tactic second tactic

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800
get out with a dash tactic second tactic
 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.429
get out with a dash tactic second tactic
then is not a dash technique this is

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439
then is not a dash technique this is
 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.409
then is not a dash technique this is
circling tactic and this doesn't help

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419
circling tactic and this doesn't help
 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.779
circling tactic and this doesn't help
you get out but it does help you get

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789
you get out but it does help you get
 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.999
you get out but it does help you get
away so what I mean here is that the

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009
away so what I mean here is that the
 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.459
away so what I mean here is that the
mouse can move in a circle and this

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469
mouse can move in a circle and this
 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.089
mouse can move in a circle and this
point here is worse for the mouse then

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099
point here is worse for the mouse then
 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.350
point here is worse for the mouse then
this point despite being the same

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360
this point despite being the same
 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.149
this point despite being the same
distance from the edge so I think this

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159
distance from the edge so I think this
 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:19.619
distance from the edge so I think this
one's better because in terms of an

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629
one's better because in terms of an
 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.029
one's better because in terms of an
angle he's further away from the cat

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039
angle he's further away from the cat
 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.850
angle he's further away from the cat
which means measuring this angle just

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860
which means measuring this angle just
 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.649
which means measuring this angle just
drawn a line on here it's a good

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659
drawn a line on here it's a good
 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:27.600
drawn a line on here it's a good
indication of whether the mouse is far

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610
indication of whether the mouse is far
 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.809
indication of whether the mouse is far
away like opposite or close and actually

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819
away like opposite or close and actually
 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.309
away like opposite or close and actually
I think that kind of summarizes the

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319
I think that kind of summarizes the
 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.929
I think that kind of summarizes the
cat's technique as well the cat will try

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939
cat's technique as well the cat will try
 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.670
cat's technique as well the cat will try
and minimize this angle and if the mouse

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680
and minimize this angle and if the mouse
 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.379
and minimize this angle and if the mouse
has got any sense at all we should try

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389
has got any sense at all we should try
 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.140
has got any sense at all we should try
and maximize that angle but it doesn't

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150
and maximize that angle but it doesn't
 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.269
and maximize that angle but it doesn't
always work so here's a circling tactic

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279
always work so here's a circling tactic
 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.249
always work so here's a circling tactic
if you are near the edge of the pond

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259
if you are near the edge of the pond
 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.689
if you are near the edge of the pond
it's a problem because there mount the

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699
it's a problem because there mount the
 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:46.890
it's a problem because there mount the
cat is much quicker

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900
cat is much quicker
 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.950
cat is much quicker
for example the mouse is just circling

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960
for example the mouse is just circling
 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.329
for example the mouse is just circling
but it's clearly moving slower around

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339
but it's clearly moving slower around
 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:56.459
but it's clearly moving slower around
the angle than the cat and if the cat

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:56.469
the angle than the cat and if the cat
 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:57.689
the angle than the cat and if the cat
was actually doing something sensible

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699
was actually doing something sensible
 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.279
was actually doing something sensible
instead of is going round let's actually

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289
instead of is going round let's actually
 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.619
instead of is going round let's actually
make him pursue he will get to the mouse

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:01.629
make him pursue he will get to the mouse
 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.450
make him pursue he will get to the mouse
and it will stop and then the circling

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
and it will stop and then the circling
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.279
and it will stop and then the circling
tactic sump doesn't work anymore because

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.289
tactic sump doesn't work anymore because
 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.499
tactic sump doesn't work anymore because
whatever the mouse does the cat can keep

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509
whatever the mouse does the cat can keep
 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.769
whatever the mouse does the cat can keep
up but if I get further away from the

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779
up but if I get further away from the
 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.110
up but if I get further away from the
edge but I put it over here you can see

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120
edge but I put it over here you can see
 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.749
edge but I put it over here you can see
that the cat catches up but just not

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759
that the cat catches up but just not
 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.999
that the cat catches up but just not
quite as quick which might give you a

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:18.009
quite as quick which might give you a
 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.439
quite as quick which might give you a
clue that if I'm rightly in the middle

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449
clue that if I'm rightly in the middle
 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.219
clue that if I'm rightly in the middle
it's pretty obvious that even if the cat

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:23.229
it's pretty obvious that even if the cat
 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:24.390
it's pretty obvious that even if the cat
is really close in the angle the mouse

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400
is really close in the angle the mouse
 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.959
is really close in the angle the mouse
can get away now so the circling tactic

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969
can get away now so the circling tactic
 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.730
can get away now so the circling tactic
means sometimes I can get away from the

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740
means sometimes I can get away from the
 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.200
means sometimes I can get away from the
cat in terms of the angle and sometimes

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210
cat in terms of the angle and sometimes
 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.619
cat in terms of the angle and sometimes
I can't because the cat catches me and

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:33.629
I can't because the cat catches me and
 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:36.570
I can't because the cat catches me and
those two tactics maybe I maybe it's

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580
those two tactics maybe I maybe it's
 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.129
those two tactics maybe I maybe it's
time for another pause with those two

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.139
time for another pause with those two
 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.629
time for another pause with those two
tactics I think

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639
tactics I think
 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:48.850
tactics I think
there's a glimpse of a hope those two

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860
there's a glimpse of a hope those two
 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.800
there's a glimpse of a hope those two
tactics the - tactic and the circling

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:50.810
tactics the - tactic and the circling
 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.570
tactics the - tactic and the circling
tactic which sorts out whether you can

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.580
tactic which sorts out whether you can
 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.309
tactic which sorts out whether you can
get the cat opposite you or not and

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319
get the cat opposite you or not and
 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.110
get the cat opposite you or not and
let's sort them out one at a time so

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120
let's sort them out one at a time so
 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.659
let's sort them out one at a time so
then the - tactic let's assume the -

00:07:58.659 --> 00:07:58.669
then the - tactic let's assume the -
 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.990
then the - tactic let's assume the -
tactic we are opposite the cat so if the

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000
tactic we are opposite the cat so if the
 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.399
tactic we are opposite the cat so if the
cats here the mouse is on this line the

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:06.409
cats here the mouse is on this line the
 

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:09.610
cats here the mouse is on this line the
other side of the center but if he is at

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
other side of the center but if he is at
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.100
other side of the center but if he is at
the center I don't think he can make it

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.110
the center I don't think he can make it
 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.860
the center I don't think he can make it
and maybe you can think about why the

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:14.870
and maybe you can think about why the
 

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.899
and maybe you can think about why the
cat has to go around here let's assume

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:16.909
cat has to go around here let's assume
 

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:19.570
cat has to go around here let's assume
some things which includes this radius

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:19.580
some things which includes this radius
 

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.980
some things which includes this radius
of the pond which I've never told you

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:20.990
of the pond which I've never told you
 

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.719
of the pond which I've never told you
I'm going to assume it's one and you can

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:22.729
I'm going to assume it's one and you can
 

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:24.580
I'm going to assume it's one and you can
scale up if you want the distance the

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:24.590
scale up if you want the distance the
 

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.550
scale up if you want the distance the
cat has to go round is half of a

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560
cat has to go round is half of a
 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.390
cat has to go round is half of a
circumference so around is 2 pi times

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400
circumference so around is 2 pi times
 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.810
circumference so around is 2 pi times
1/2 it's PI meters let's go with meters

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.820
1/2 it's PI meters let's go with meters
 

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.519
1/2 it's PI meters let's go with meters
for the sake of unit and let's assume

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:36.529
for the sake of unit and let's assume
 

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:37.990
for the sake of unit and let's assume
there's some speeds going on let's seem

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000
there's some speeds going on let's seem
 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.630
there's some speeds going on let's seem
the cat speed for the sake of any other

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640
the cat speed for the sake of any other
 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.420
the cat speed for the sake of any other
argument is 4 meters per second that's a

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.430
argument is 4 meters per second that's a
 

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.840
argument is 4 meters per second that's a
quick cat and then house is therefore 1

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:46.850
quick cat and then house is therefore 1
 

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.910
quick cat and then house is therefore 1
meter per second and that's the only

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920
meter per second and that's the only
 

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.410
meter per second and that's the only
number we set this up with their cat is

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:50.420
number we set this up with their cat is
 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.880
number we set this up with their cat is
4 times quicker than the mouse can swim

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:51.890
4 times quicker than the mouse can swim
 

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.050
4 times quicker than the mouse can swim
and you can see that if the the mask

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.060
and you can see that if the the mask
 

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.050
and you can see that if the the mask
from the center will less says 1 is

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.060
from the center will less says 1 is
 

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.170
from the center will less says 1 is
going to take precisely one second to

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180
going to take precisely one second to
 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.730
going to take precisely one second to
get out

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.740
get out
 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.690
get out
but how long does the cat take to get

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700
but how long does the cat take to get
 

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.450
but how long does the cat take to get
around well yes this is everyone's like

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:08.460
around well yes this is everyone's like
 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.680
around well yes this is everyone's like
wow which how do you calculate this I

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:09.690
wow which how do you calculate this I
 

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.050
wow which how do you calculate this I
think the speed equals distance over

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060
think the speed equals distance over
 

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.970
think the speed equals distance over
time thing is a really basic equation

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980
time thing is a really basic equation
 

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.650
time thing is a really basic equation
that we really need to use carefully how

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660
that we really need to use carefully how
 

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.150
that we really need to use carefully how
long will it take the cat to get there

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160
long will it take the cat to get there
 

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.540
long will it take the cat to get there
time is distance over speed the distance

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:20.550
time is distance over speed the distance
 

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.890
time is distance over speed the distance
is pi so it's PI divided by speed which

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:24.900
is pi so it's PI divided by speed which
 

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.180
is pi so it's PI divided by speed which
is 4 is PI by 4 seconds so it's quicker

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.190
is 4 is PI by 4 seconds so it's quicker
 

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.730
is 4 is PI by 4 seconds so it's quicker
than a second it's because pi is less

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740
than a second it's because pi is less
 

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.100
than a second it's because pi is less
than 4 this is less than one second the

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.110
than 4 this is less than one second the
 

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.110
than 4 this is less than one second the
cat is there waiting first thing when

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120
cat is there waiting first thing when
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.700
cat is there waiting first thing when
the - tactic is clearly the mouse can't

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:37.710
the - tactic is clearly the mouse can't
 

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.040
the - tactic is clearly the mouse can't
depth from the center so the obvious

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.050
depth from the center so the obvious
 

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.720
depth from the center so the obvious
question is where can he desk from and

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:41.730
question is where can he desk from and
 

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.260
question is where can he desk from and
it's the same calculation right he's got

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.270
it's the same calculation right he's got
 

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.950
it's the same calculation right he's got
PI by 4 seconds at most to get out so

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:48.960
PI by 4 seconds at most to get out so
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.900
PI by 4 seconds at most to get out so
because the cat can get to any point on

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:50.910
because the cat can get to any point on
 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.700
because the cat can get to any point on
the circle within ya the farthest away

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.710
the circle within ya the farthest away
 

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.770
the circle within ya the farthest away
point is PI by 4 seconds away so

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:54.780
point is PI by 4 seconds away so
 

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.270
point is PI by 4 seconds away so
actually he can only get to the edge

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:58.280
actually he can only get to the edge
 

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.720
actually he can only get to the edge
when the edge is less than PI by 4 away

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:02.730
when the edge is less than PI by 4 away
 

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.490
when the edge is less than PI by 4 away
because he goes 1 meters per second

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500
because he goes 1 meters per second
 

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.990
because he goes 1 meters per second
we've set these numbers up to be quite

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000
we've set these numbers up to be quite
 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.080
we've set these numbers up to be quite
nice but that circle has distance PI by

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.090
nice but that circle has distance PI by
 

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.900
nice but that circle has distance PI by
4 there which means this dis in here is

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
4 there which means this dis in here is
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.080
4 there which means this dis in here is
1 minus PI by 4 and you begin to realize

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.090
1 minus PI by 4 and you begin to realize
 

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.780
1 minus PI by 4 and you begin to realize
very quickly that my scale historian is

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:17.790
very quickly that my scale historian is
 

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.820
very quickly that my scale historian is
terrible we need to know roughly where

terrible we need to know roughly where
 

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.740
terrible we need to know roughly where
that line is because outside that line

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:21.750
that line is because outside that line
 

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.210

you okay so now the question really is

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.030
you okay so now the question really is
 

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.500
you okay so now the question really is
can I get opposite the cat outside that

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:51.510
can I get opposite the cat outside that
 

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.660
can I get opposite the cat outside that
event horizon so we actually now you

recognize why the circling tactic is

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140
recognize why the circling tactic is
 

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.150
recognize why the circling tactic is
important because that's the one that

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160
important because that's the one that
 

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.350
important because that's the one that

the same thing as the cat so actually

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:37.790
the same thing as the cat so actually
 

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.520
the same thing as the cat so actually
this circle I've just gone here if

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:39.530
this circle I've just gone here if
 

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.110
this circle I've just gone here if
that's 4 times smaller than the big one

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120
that's 4 times smaller than the big one
 

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.060
that's 4 times smaller than the big one
the scale factor of 4 going on the

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.070
the scale factor of 4 going on the
 

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.500
the scale factor of 4 going on the
distance round it is 4 times shorter

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:44.510
distance round it is 4 times shorter
 

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.150
distance round it is 4 times shorter
than the big one that's how a scale

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160
than the big one that's how a scale
 

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.670
than the big one that's how a scale
factors work and so at that point which

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680
factors work and so at that point which
 

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.430
factors work and so at that point which
is a quarter of the size in which case

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440
is a quarter of the size in which case
 

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.670
is a quarter of the size in which case
that is 3/4 and the distance in there

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680
that is 3/4 and the distance in there
 

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.350
that is 3/4 and the distance in there
looking pretty messy thanks to my

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360
looking pretty messy thanks to my
 

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.160
looking pretty messy thanks to my
repeated drawing of mice but it is a 1/4

00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.170
repeated drawing of mice but it is a 1/4

repeated drawing of mice but it is a 1/4
on that circle I can keep up with the

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:02.780
on that circle I can keep up with the
 

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.470
on that circle I can keep up with the
cat in terms of angles which means

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480
cat in terms of angles which means
 

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.830
cat in terms of angles which means
inside that circle I can outpace it yet

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:08.840
inside that circle I can outpace it yet
 

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.380
inside that circle I can outpace it yet
in terms of angles so which means I

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:11.390
in terms of angles so which means I
 

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.400
in terms of angles so which means I

really lower than GCSE level maths and
yet it wasn't obvious to me at all when

I first started playing with the cat the

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:39.980
I first started playing with the cat the
 

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.920
I first started playing with the cat the
mouse but let me show you on the diagram

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:41.930
mouse but let me show you on the diagram
 

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.449
mouse but let me show you on the diagram
on the screen so now we've established

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:43.459
on the screen so now we've established
 

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:46.389
on the screen so now we've established
that the there are two event horizons if

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399
that the there are two event horizons if
 

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.679
that the there are two event horizons if
you like we can put the one here so the

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:47.689
you like we can put the one here so the
 

00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:50.019
you like we can put the one here so the

that was the boundary said was 0.21 away
 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.129
that was the boundary said was 0.21 away
from the center and you can see it's

from the center and you can see it's
 

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.780
from the center and you can see it's
about right and the circling boundary is

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:57.790
about right and the circling boundary is
 

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.480
about right and the circling boundary is
the outer line there so inside that I

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.490
the outer line there so inside that I
 

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.759
the outer line there so inside that I
can circle okay and outside the -

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:03.769

mouse sweet spot if it can get in there
 

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:16.179
mouse sweet spot if it can get in there
then not only can it circle to get away

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:16.189
then not only can it circle to get away
 

00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:18.790
then not only can it circle to get away
from the cat it can also when it's ready

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800
from the cat it can also when it's ready
 

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.499
from the cat it can also when it's ready
i opposite the cat it can just peg it

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:20.509
i opposite the cat it can just peg it
 

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:24.009
i opposite the cat it can just peg it
and it should make it which is weird

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:24.019
and it should make it which is weird
 

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:25.600
and it should make it which is weird
because just swimming away from the cat

you you can only - from a point where
 

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.650
you you can only - from a point where
you can't a circle whereas we had a

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:28.660
you can't a circle whereas we had a
 

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.269
you can't a circle whereas we had a
sweet spot and actually I've got a

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279
sweet spot and actually I've got a
 

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.829
sweet spot and actually I've got a
slider on Joe Dubrow so I can change the

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839
slider on Joe Dubrow so I can change the
 

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.180
slider on Joe Dubrow so I can change the
ratio of the speeds and you can see

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.190
ratio of the speeds and you can see
 

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.740
ratio of the speeds and you can see
whether the sweet spot increases or

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.750
whether the sweet spot increases or
 

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.939
whether the sweet spot increases or
decreases so since you asked let's let's
