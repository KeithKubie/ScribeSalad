00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.900
When we encounter a stressful event there are two ways we can assess the event.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.986
The first is called Primary Appraisal. Here we're talking about a quick

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:13.931
assessment of the meaning of a given environmental event for an individual. For

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.636
example you may become very stressed about the fact that your shower's broken

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:22.192
and you have to call somebody to get it fixed. And everything that it's

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:25.312
going to take to get the shower fixed, planning someone to fix it, having to

00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:30.136
pay for it cleaning up the house so someone can come in. These things are

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:34.310
really stressful. So that might be the first reaction or assessment of what the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.648
situation means to you. So the shower handle broke, so that means you're

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:43.886
going to have to do all of this other stuff just to fix it. So, this was an

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:47.054
example of primary appraisal, our first reaction or assessment of a situation

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.596
and what it means to us. Now, it's important to note, if we appraise the

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:55.160
situation as being contrary to our well-being, then it will produce a negative

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.100
emotion and the negative emotion can cause stress.
