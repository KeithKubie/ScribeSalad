00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.413
To to

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.660
to to Radiolab from NPR and W, N, Y,

3
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.340
c ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.940
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.680
<v 0>June 26 2010 19:00 AM the White House.</v>

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.570
This is the moment race died.

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.533
Good morning.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.240
We're here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human

9
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:42.241
genome or the entire human genome of the entire see for a hundred years

10
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.150
scientists or at least a certain group of scientists had been trying to prove

11
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:50.020
that race is weird. It's not just something that we see with our eyes,

12
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:54.310
but in fact there is something fundamentally different between a person who is

13
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:58.330
white and a person who is black or Asian and they looked at blood differences,

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.020
nothing. They looked at differences in musculature, the size of our heads,

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.400
nothing. They couldn't really say, this is this and that is that.

16
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.390
Then the entire human genome in 2000 it is my great pleasure.

17
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.480
Bill Clinton introduces two of the most important scientists in the world.

18
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:17.650
Dr. Francis Collins and Craig venter. Both of them get up to the podium and say,

19
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.800
look, we have searched all the way down to our DNA.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.530
Can't get any deeper than that and when it comes to race,

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.520
the concept of race as no genetic or scientific basis,

22
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.033
<v 2>it's just not there.</v>

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
What that means is that modern science is confirmed what we first learned from

24
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:37.460
ancient sites.

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.530
The most important fact of life on this earth is our common humanity.

26
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.510
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.480
<v 0>a couple of years down the road, if you fast forward,</v>

28
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.580
we began to look more closely and we began to notice some subtle differences

29
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.340
based on ethnic background differences,

30
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.810
differences in people's health and raped and the differences seemed like they

31
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:05.920
could be important that some genetic diseases target racial or ethnic groups

32
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:09.370
more than others so that now, just a couple of years later,

33
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.970
even some of the scientists who were on the podium that day saying it was all

34
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:17.730
over even they have started to rethink. Are we rolling?

35
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.610
Yes, we're rolling. We are rolling. All right. That's Francis Collins,

36
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.950
head of the human genome project.

37
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.340
And then in 2000 you were standing with Bill Clinton and um, and Craig Venter,

38
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.560
you remember this day? I do remember June 26 2000 yes.

39
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.900
I'm pretty hard to forget that one. What was the weather like out of curiosity?

40
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.760
That was really hot that morning,

41
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.100
but really we didn't want to talk to Francis about that day.

42
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.460
We actually wanted to ask him about something he said couple of years

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.560
afterwards, something he wrote in a medical journal. Jack,

44
00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:47.590
could you read the not defensive saying not this. Oh,

45
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:51.280
well I'll just read it to you. This is you talking. Okay, here it,

46
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.680
this increasing scientific evidence, however,

47
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:57.610
indicates that genetic variation can be used to make a reasonably accurate

48
00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.080
prediction of geographic origins.

49
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.270
It is not strictly true that race or ethnicity has no biological connection.

50
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.390
So that's what we're kind of wandering it.

51
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.840
That it's not strictly true that it has no biological connection.

52
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.420
Is it here fully live though?

53
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.230
I won't defend that as being the world's best sentence construction.

54
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.700
But there's something that you want to say that you don't quite pass through

55
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.630
your lips, it sounds like, but, well, let me try again here.

56
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.220
I think there are two points you can make about race and genetics.

57
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.760
One is we're really all very much alike, incredibly alike,

58
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.110
but you can also say even that small amount of difference turns out to be

59
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:38.944
revealing.

60
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.860
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.880
<v 3>So that's our show today. What exactly can science reveal about race?</v>

62
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.620
Does it exist? Does it not exist? What really can you say about it?

63
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.340
Yes, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.

64
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.860
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.530
<v 3>okay, ready? Three, two, one.</v>

66
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.590
<v 4>So let's go back and consider Francis Collins is state.</v>

67
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.810
It is not strictly stop. Stop.

68
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.960
So it's not strictly speaking true that race has no biological connection.

69
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.370
Who are you? I'm Nell Greenfield boys.

70
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.820
I'm a science reporter with National Public Radio. But for the moment I'm your,

71
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:24.230
I'm your grammar instructor.

72
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.840
So take this double negative and make it into a sentence that is without the

73
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:33.200
double negative. [inaudible] says no, it is sort of,

74
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.030
it's sort of true that race has something to do with biology. Right, right,

75
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.420
right, right. But while he is tiptoeing around with his fancy double negatives,

76
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.780
some people out in the real world sounds like a cell phone.

77
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:45.890
I'm getting rid of that right now.

78
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.850
Are taking that concept and they're just running with it. Hello.

79
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.510
Can you hear me? Hello? Hello. Who's, who's running with it? Exactly.

80
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.630
And how good, well I talked with one detective in Louisiana. I,

81
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.610
let me just make sure I have your name pronounced correctly.

82
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.270
My name is Kip Judy's.

83
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.080
I am the a patrol commander at the Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office at the rank

84
00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:10.580
of captain who says that he actually used DNA to say something about race.

85
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.170
When was this all going down? I'm see 2002, 2003 and that,

86
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:17.710
that helped him catch a serial killer. Um,

87
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.420
w we had a victim who had been bludgeoned. Yes.

88
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.280
<v 0>Ronisha column was only 23 years old.</v>

89
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.350
She was left in a field and found by some hunters.

90
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.400
It is believed her final moments alive were spent visiting her mother's grave,

91
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.730
her abandoned car, discovered her vehicle, was found,

92
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:36.410
abandoned the cemetery right near her mother's grave site. And just over a year,

93
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.880
four women have been murdered in Louisiana. Their deaths linked by DNA evidence,

94
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.750
no evidence at all of the crime scenes that point through a single killer serial

95
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:48.020
killer. The media dubbed him the Baton Rouge serial killer.

96
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.430
He was in the news almost daily self defense classes are filling with frightened

97
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:56.060
women. Where will he strike next? Based on some witness information,

98
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.160
this suspected is believed

99
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.550
<v 5>to be a white male. He is described as a white male, white male</v>

100
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.550
<v 4>in a white truck. Everything at that point they had made,</v>

101
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.110
it seemed like it was probably a white guy. Yes.

102
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.670
I mean they had this eyewitness report.

103
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.360
The fact that there seemed to be a serial killer and most serial killers are

104
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.660
thought to be white guys and they started testing hundreds of white men.

105
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.370
<v 5>Police have launched an extraordinary effort to take DNA samples,</v>

106
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:20.770
DNA samples from nearly a thousand men.

107
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.800
They were doing kind of a genetic dragnet dragnet for a serial killer in an area

108
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.090
where crime tape is becoming part of the landscape. Bob McNamara,

109
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.560
CBS News, Baton Rouge did. It

110
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.550
<v 4>wasn't looking very, very promising. So they went and they asked,</v>

111
00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:39.450
you know, their crime lab,

112
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.970
is there anything in a DNA profile that identifies race?

113
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.850
And then we have the perpetrator's DNA.

114
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.090
Can we look at that and say whether it's a white guy or a black guy?

115
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.320
The immediate answer we had was no, it's not. You can't do that. Not a,

116
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.890
there's not a marker.

117
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:56.970
There's not a gene because you know race is not biological. Right. However,

118
00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.940
there was some technology out there that was looking into it.

119
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.760
<v 5>We're the first company I,</v>

120
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.640
I think in the world is in for phenotypes for forensics cases. Oh,

121
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.090
that's Tony for daycares. He owns a company in Florida that sells tests,

122
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:15.680
genetic tests that he claims can be like an eye witness and tell you something

123
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.180
about a person, what they look like.

124
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:21.020
Characteristics like eye colors and hair colors and skin color.

125
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.420
And the cops in Louisiana took him up on it.

126
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.320
We submitted the suspect profile to them and when the test came back,

127
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.550
this particular case, the individual is primarily of

128
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.850
African ancestry. A black guy? Yes.

129
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.490
<v 4>Over 90% likely that it was a black male.</v>

130
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.270
I do think it's important to note that there were other lines of evidence that

131
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:43.970
had been developing that made them think a black eye was likely,

132
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.080
but the DNA result,

133
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:49.270
I mean that was science within three or four days after that state police called

134
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:50.830
and said, we have a match.

135
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.820
<v 5>The rest is history. He's since been convicted of two of the murders to wait.</v>

136
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.990
They caught the guy and he was in fact black. Yes.

137
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.520
So does that mean that Tony for

138
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.560
<v 4>free debt free, what is it for daycares?</v>

139
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.070
Tony for Degas has somehow found the gene for race

140
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.320
<v 5>that there is a race gene.</v>

141
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.210
<v 4>It's much more complicated than that and,</v>

142
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.830
and it all boils down to this idea of ancestry

143
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.510
<v 5>ancestry by dna.com you can go online and his company DNA print and again and</v>

144
00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.480
they will send you a kit with just a simple mal swab you do at home.

145
00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:21.430
You can discover your unique genetic ancestry. Okay.

146
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.800
My kid and it's like a little science

147
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.140
<v 4>kit. Yeah. We're listening to Chad.</v>

148
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.660
I taking a DNA test while being interrupted by his wife taking a DNA test and

149
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:36.661
it's got these like swabs in one of these sterols swabs and you like,

150
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:38.020
you know, rub your cheek with it.

151
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.120
<v 6>Ah Huh.</v>

152
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.200
<v 5>You literally just send this through the mail to the DNA print corporate</v>

153
00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:49.350
headquarters in Sarasota, Florida and I went there.

154
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.170
Hi. Good. I'm now greenfield voice. Okay,

155
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.360
so after the cheek cells arrive in Florida,

156
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.110
and this is where items of evidence come [inaudible] state run it through a

157
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.190
bunch of machines.

158
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.200
What exactly in the end are they looking at that gives them like some sense of

159
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:12.070
my race. Well, in your DNA there's lots of information.

160
00:09:12.071 --> 00:09:16.660
There's billions of different little DNA letters, letters, letters,

161
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.150
letters, letters, letters, letters, letters.

162
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.770
Can we play with this just for a second?

163
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.540
If I were to have you recite all the letters in your DNA, one letter per second,

164
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.990
know how long it would take you to spell yourself our, no, no.

165
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.780
It would take you six months. A century,

166
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.650
[inaudible] century to make it even more interesting instead of just you.

167
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.610
Let's have you compared to me. I mean like if we both read it at one per second,

168
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.000
yeah.

169
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We would be absolutely identical for about 17 minutes before there'd be any

170
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:51.240
difference between us. Wow. And every difference that there is,

171
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.980
or whether it's like a little chemical tea or a little chemical g or,

172
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.790
or whatever has a story behind it. How do you mean? Well,

173
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 7>we all started in the same place together. Well,</v>

174
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.570
the evidence is very good that the human race, as we currently know,

175
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:11.010
it had its origins in Africa according to Francis Collins,

176
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:14.310
head of the human genome project in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand years

177
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.320
ago with as few as 10,000 people. But soon after that,

178
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.710
<v 8>humans began to fan out across the world. Some of us went east into Arabia.</v>

179
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.980
Some of us went up north across the Sahara into the Mediterranean area.

180
00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:30.490
All the while, all these people are having baby

181
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.480
and in the process, the DNA is getting copied over and over and over,

182
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.400
parent to parent the kid. But sometimes the copying isn't exactly perfect.

183
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:45.190
So every so often you'll find it company error.

184
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.020
<v 7>Whoo. Hey, hey, no, yes. That one right there.</v>

185
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.100
Let's imagine that error. Hey, no,

186
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.690
occurred in Asia about 25,000 years ago. Imagine a Chinese woman,

187
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.960
Pat ABB, and the baby was one letter different from the mommy.

188
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:05.610
I'm accident the a and the mom became ah,

189
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.570
in the baby and then that c was handed down.

190
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.460
<v 8>Well, you like to see any other seat.</v>

191
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.850
And a thousand years down the road I look into your DNA.

192
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.700
I see that same mistake in the same spot. You know what?

193
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:22.701
I know what I now have a hunch and if I show to a family tree really hard,

194
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.000
<v 5>some Chinese ancestors would pop out.</v>

195
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.040
It's sort of like a souvenir that your ancestors handed you down in your blood

196
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:33.200
that you carry with you in every cell in your body.

197
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.510
So they've identified about 180 little variations in the DNA,

198
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.950
little souvenirs that people who share ancestry, um,

199
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.540
share. This is the way to put it. We sample. Did you send him? Was It yours?

200
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.440
Oh, I'm not going to tell you. Yeah, that's all right. You tell me. Yeah,

201
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.940
we'll show you. We've got it on a CD. So we leave the,

202
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.160
and we go down this hallway to his office, determine that it is of alien origin.

203
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.910
That would explain a lot actually.

204
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.250
He pulls these things up on his computer screen.

205
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.910
I'll show you what your results were. So what does it say? I'm dying here. Well,

206
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:10.200
I guess before I tell you, okay, that sample was determined to be,

207
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.310
<v 0>I want to know what you, what you think, what do you think it's going to be?</v>

208
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.750
Um, well my folks are Arab light-skin both of them.

209
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:23.780
My Dad's got some darker skin people on his side of the family.

210
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.850
So if I had to guess, probably some European in there. And then my dad's side,

211
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:29.481
I was thinking, well,

212
00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:32.830
they're probably like Greek or Turkish way back when I don't,

213
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.840
I wasn't really sure and I consciously didn't sort of look into it. Okay.

214
00:12:35.841 --> 00:12:38.060
Well let me just tell you that this test you took is not going to tell you

215
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:42.860
countries. Right, right. Okay. I'm oddly kind of nervous weirdly.

216
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.190
Really? Yeah. Just a little bit. So a,

217
00:12:46.191 --> 00:12:50.510
your sub Saharan African ancestry, what percentage are you thinking?

218
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.790
I'm going to guess 12 0% zero 0% huh?

219
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.100
All right. Native American ancestry,

220
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.010
1% one east Asian, 5% wow.

221
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.180
European,

222
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.610
94% really 94% 94%

223
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.690
<v 5>European. Oh 94% pounds.</v>

224
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.550
They note that the words that we're using here are pretty arbitrary.

225
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.580
You should understand that his definition of quote unquote European includes the

226
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.460
fertile crescent or the Middle East. Wow. So, so wait a second.

227
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.930
If I'm a police member,

228
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:29.500
we started this conversation and a cop was looking to describe a perpetrator,

229
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.170
right? So if I find out that Jen at boom rod is European,

230
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.360
then I'm looking for someone who could be a huge range.

231
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.580
We're looking at the computer screen now and for example,

232
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:42.850
you've pulled up a bunch of digital photos when Tony foodic has pulled up

233
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.490
pictures of people with my exact ancestral mix from the database,

234
00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:51.640
a database. Here's um, some males,

235
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.450
here's a female, he brought up people with blonde hair, blue eyes.

236
00:13:56.451 --> 00:13:58.660
These are all people that had this sort of mix.

237
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:01.870
Even people from Poland who had like really red cheeks.

238
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.050
So the these folks just look like pretty much like white folks to me.

239
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.400
Run of the mill. Cause I got to tell,

240
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.340
let me show you the picture of the guy who actually gave the sample

241
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.580
that Mr [inaudible] does not know that Chad is a dark curly hair swarthy man.

242
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.590
So this is the guy and he doesn't really know anything about his ancestry but

243
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:22.870
his mother and father I believe are from Lebanon.

244
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.450
Although in this sample of maybe 20 people,

245
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.750
it's just that we don't have any samples of Lebanese and [inaudible] for a cop.

246
00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:32.650
Someone who describes themselves as Lebanese versus Polish.

247
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:36.160
I mean that would be a really big difference. Oh yeah. And and to,

248
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.510
to make that sort of a distinction, you need different markers set. Well,

249
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.950
so then what, what does DNA actually tell you then? Well, not a lot.

250
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.830
<v 0>That's direct.</v>

251
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.150
What he's doing basically is playing a guessing game based on ancestral

252
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:53.660
percentages. Like for instance, I'm 90% European, 0% subsaharan.

253
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.160
He can plug that in to his database,

254
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:58.730
pull up the pictures and he will notice that nobody with those percentages is

255
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.810
black. So he can tell. He'll tell police this guy, probably not black.

256
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:04.400
Just like at the beginning we just had that.

257
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.410
That perpetrator there was pretty much not why. Yeah.

258
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.670
Now there is one thing he can read directly in our DNA.

259
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.960
What eye color? Hmm. So at the end of the day he can say,

260
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:19.490
I am not black and I have brown eyes. That's it. That's as far as he can go.

261
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:22.220
That's all he can tell you is a scientist. He does take it further. Oh,

262
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.600
what did he do? Well, if he's got a DNA sample of a perp,

263
00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:27.410
he can go to his computer database. You can say, okay, database,

264
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.680
show me everybody who's got these exact same percentages.

265
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:31.610
Show me their pictures.

266
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.320
Now tell me what all of these faces have in common visually,

267
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.250
<v 3>like what's their average nose wet, what's their average shape of the ears?</v>

268
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.380
How big are their skulls? Skull Shave.

269
00:15:43.381 --> 00:15:46.060
You see where this is going and then what he tells the police look for.

270
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.610
It's for people who have, you know, this type of head kind of ear.

271
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.310
This isn't genetics. Now, this is just photo average photo averaging.

272
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.770
This is in sciences or something else. Great.

273
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.920
But when you hear things like measuring skulls, measuring ears,

274
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:04.010
it's hard not to think back to pretty nasty periods of our history.

275
00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:08.130
Like the Eugenesis, they tried to composite pictures into one face,

276
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.150
they measured skulls and they ended up inspiring the number

277
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.070
<v 5>if people called you a racist, not once,</v>

278
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.070
not once have I been called a racist.

279
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.323
<v 1>Not once.</v>

280
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.500
<v 0>That kind of surprises me. I'm just sort of wondering how,</v>

281
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.230
how do you think you've escaped that?

282
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.463
<v 1>Hmm?</v>

283
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.760
<v 5>Are People critical of this? Uh, yeah.</v>

284
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:37.180
I think a lot of scientists are first knee jerk reaction is,

285
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.550
is that the poor masses out there aren't intelligent enough to handle this sort

286
00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:43.384
of information.

287
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.950
They all start climbing over one another and killing themselves so that we

288
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.521
either, you know,

289
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:53.521
the smart ones need to sort of obfuscate and I don't think that works very well.

290
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.610
People may be a lot smarter than we might give them credit for being,

291
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.180
<v 0>I think he's onto something there. What do you mean? Well,</v>

292
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.630
there is a tendency that people have when this subject comes up to say we don't

293
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:11.230
talk about that.

294
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.760
Maybe I think people can talk about the real world and real differences

295
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.230
respectfully and even with a certain amount of delicious interest. Sure.

296
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.550
Yeah. Well you say sure, but there are lots of shutters everywhere.

297
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.660
You're not going to get me to stand on the side of shushing. It's just, I mean,

298
00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:31.540
science complicates things. Even now, this whole, you know,

299
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.320
definition that science has of race being like ancestry or whatever, it just,

300
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.830
it, it just doesn't jive with how people live. Race.

301
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.260
You mean how people talk about it? Really? Yeah. Look it. Look here.

302
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.200
Take a look at this photo. This one here? Yup. Yeah. You see the guy there? Yes.

303
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.030
What race do you think he is? He's back. Definitely black, definitely. Oh yeah.

304
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.240
How black is he? How black is he? What kind of a question? Just for a visual.

305
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.560
Black. Black. How about Obama? Black? No, he's not. He's blacker than that.

306
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.670
So he's unequivocally black, right? I don't know. My parents

307
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.650
<v 10>taught us because they came from the segregated south.</v>

308
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.570
You were either black or you are white. There was no in between.

309
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.000
<v 0>So the guy you're looking at, the guy we just heard, that's a Wayne Joseph.</v>

310
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:16.830
He's in an education director in La and he also on the side writes essays about

311
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:21.420
race, mostly for national magazines. And one day, a couple of years back,

312
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.700
he was watching TV

313
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:27.810
<v 10>and I happened to see a TV program highlighting the fact that a couple of DNA</v>

314
00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:32.890
labs were actually doing racial testing on DNA. Light Bulb went on.

315
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.170
I said, well, this will be perfect for this essay.

316
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.430
<v 0>He thought he tests himself,</v>

317
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.140
see what percentage of him was black versus other stuff and then write about it,

318
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.120
but what, what number did you think you would be?

319
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.120
<v 10>The number I was thinking was 70 or 75% or more.</v>

320
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.870
<v 0>75% African and 25% who knows what, sorry.</v>

321
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.660
I sent away for the kids, swap both cheeks, put it in a vial, sent it back,

322
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.523
and then

323
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.960
<v 10>a few weeks later I get back the results.</v>

324
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.040
First thing I did was I checked the kit number to make sure that they hadn't

325
00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:09.020
made a mistake and sent me someone else's results. But the kit number matched,

326
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:10.850
I couldn't believe it.

327
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.960
57% Indo-European 39% native American,

328
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.890
4% Asian and 0% African,

329
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.710
<v 0>0% as in as in zero. Nothing.</v>

330
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.713
<v 10>I mean I've,</v>

331
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.880
I've lived 50 years as a black man and I have no African genetically

332
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.890
[inaudible].

333
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.520
<v 0>How did you make sense of that? Did you, did it sick and all at once?</v>

334
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.510
<v 10>Um, no. What happened was after a couple of days,</v>

335
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.160
I hadn't told my wife anything yet. I went to see my mother and I said, look,

336
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.030
there's only one really logical explanation I can live with.

337
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.560
It's okay. I love you. Just tell me the truth.

338
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.750
I'm adopted. She kind of giggled and she said, look,

339
00:19:55.751 --> 00:20:00.010
I can remember every pain I had having you. I can still remember it.

340
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.750
I said, well, but then this doesn't make any sense.

341
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.010
She said, yeah, it's a little surprising but I'm too old,

342
00:20:09.011 --> 00:20:10.540
too tired to be anything else.

343
00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.410
So that's just the way it is for my brother.

344
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.820
When I told him the results, he said, why not your DNA?

345
00:20:18.821 --> 00:20:23.660
That's not my DNA. I'm a black man and that's the end of it for him. Hmm.

346
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.630
What about your wife? Well, my second wife happens to be Jewish.

347
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.410
Her response was, what do you mean you're a black man?

348
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.290
I defied my mother to marry you. You've got to be black. Whoa.

349
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.540
So she needed you to be black? Absolutely,

350
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.230
because she had told her mother at the time, look, I'm marrying Wayne.

351
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:49.240
You're going to have to decide whether you're going to him or looser daughter.

352
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.370
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

353
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.120
<v 10>it really threw me for a loop. You start thinking about your life.</v>

354
00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.020
There are certain decisions that are made in life based on who you think you

355
00:21:00.021 --> 00:21:03.680
are. Would I have married a black woman the first time?

356
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.380
Would I have decided to go to a black high school?

357
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.190
Do you have answers to those questions? Would you have married a black woman?

358
00:21:10.191 --> 00:21:12.440
Would you have gone to a black high school? Maybe not.

359
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.190
How different would my life have been if I'd have known this 45 years ago?

360
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:26.683
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

361
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.510
<v 11>Wayne Joseph is the director of alternative education for the Chino Valley</v>

362
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.530
School district in California.

363
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.090
<v 12>A radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation and the</v>

364
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:40.540
corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation.

365
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.220
<v 0>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Apple. I'm Rod and I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

366
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:51.550
Today's program is about race. Okay, so where are we literally learn?

367
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.070
We've learned that scientists, when they talk about race,

368
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.810
they don't really mean race. No,

369
00:21:55.811 --> 00:22:00.160
they mean that you have a set of ancestors who lived in a particular place on

370
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:03.460
this planet for a while. While they were there, they acquired certain features,

371
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:05.320
skin color, hair texture, whatever,

372
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.680
and scientists won't go much further than just that. But here's the thing,

373
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.380
if you forget the lab scientist for a second,

374
00:22:11.381 --> 00:22:14.050
if you're a doctor and your job is to save lives,

375
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.260
you can't help but notice that there are real differences between groups in

376
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:21.580
terms of how healthy people are. And if you want to treat that,

377
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.210
you end up talking about race and it never goes well. Let me tell you,

378
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.880
the story now comes from our producer, Soren Wheeler,

379
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.660
and it's about a drug called Bidell. So you popped a few vital this morning.

380
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.850
I did. I just wanted to test it out.

381
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.900
That you're supposed to is it loosens up the arteries that's supposedly so it's

382
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:41.950
easier for the heart to pump as a white man that's about to talk about race on

383
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:46.150
the radio. I figured it's time to loosen up. Okay.

384
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.310
To introduce me to, to, to our main dude here. I'm Dr Jay cone,

385
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.710
a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School.

386
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.290
This is him. And what did you have for breakfast this morning?

387
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.550
I don't eat breakfast. Tell me what it looks like. Well, he's a stocky,

388
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:02.080
he's got a white beard.

389
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.120
He's Kinda got that wearied grave doctor look probably because he spent his

390
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.870
entire career worrying about how to help people with heart failure.

391
00:23:09.871 --> 00:23:13.560
That's right. Which for a really long time was kind of a lost cause. Oh yeah.

392
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.180
It was a hopeless disease and that once it developed, uh, uh,

393
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.670
the implication was that the patient would die. You're done.

394
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.910
There was nothing much we could do, but keep the patient comfortable.

395
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.380
But then back in the early seventies, [inaudible] had kind of a breakthrough.

396
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.140
The aha moment was the first patient bedridden.

397
00:23:37.521 --> 00:23:42.380
Patient can breathe easily bubbling up with fluid in the lungs.

398
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.820
Jake gave this patient a combination of two and the moment we did that,

399
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.090
this patients suddenly said, Mike, come on,

400
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.740
I can breathe easily for the first time in months that fast. Oh,

401
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:56.000
it's dream. It's immediate.

402
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.690
You confirms the effect. In a longer term trial over five years,

403
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.400
he gets a patent, he finds a company,

404
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.480
they put it in a pill and they take it to the FDA. And that's when the FDA said,

405
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:12.380
no, no, no, that's what they said. Why? No,

406
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.710
you just said it worked really well. Well, the doctor's on the review board,

407
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.030
they said they thought the drug was pretty good. Yeah,

408
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.760
they even started using it with some of their patients,

409
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.440
but they denied approval because it was not a big study study was just too

410
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.760
small. In the entire trial. There were only 86 people that got the drug.

411
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.290
We were disappointed, frustrated, and we were using it.

412
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:35.960
I was using it in my patients brag. Yeah,

413
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.990
so he goes back to what he was doing before all this started,

414
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:41.780
which was trying to figure out what the hell is going on with heart failure?

415
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.210
<v 15>What the hell? What's going on with heart failure at that point? Well,</v>

416
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:51.211
at the time scientists were just starting to look at racial differences when it

417
00:24:51.491 --> 00:24:55.690
comes to things like high blood pressure and heart problems that that black

418
00:24:55.691 --> 00:24:58.620
Americans were suffering a lot more than white Americans as he,

419
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.070
so he must've been hearing all this stuff.

420
00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:03.100
This debate was going on out there and Jay was listening,

421
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.820
<v 3>so Jay started thinking, you know,</v>

422
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.480
he had all that old data and they had actually broken it up by race.

423
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:11.930
Everyone checked a box, black, white, American, Indian, all that.

424
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:15.770
They'd never bothered to look at that stuff. Never teased it out. And I said,

425
00:25:15.771 --> 00:25:20.510
we should go back into our database. Just maybe,

426
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.630
maybe black people respond differently to Bidell. Well,

427
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:26.450
we thought it would be worthwhile to go back and look.

428
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.550
We didn't know what we were going to find.

429
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:32.840
We just went back and checked off those people who had said they were black.

430
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:33.510
Jesus, we

431
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.370
<v 0>gathered up the data and when they looked at the numbers, oh my God,</v>

432
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.060
he saw a bump. What do you mean? Well, still just a small trial.

433
00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:46.380
But in that trial, the black patients did better, significantly better. Really.

434
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.900
So we published and a couple of weeks later,

435
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.480
he gets a call from a drug company and they say,

436
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.190
we'd like to do something with Bidell.

437
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.220
They would be willing to do a trial to demonstrate the efficacy of Baidu.

438
00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.340
But here's the thing,

439
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:04.050
they wanted to do the trial just with black people that seem to be the path of

440
00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:05.550
least resistance. Why would they,

441
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.100
why would they want to eliminate just a black people? Well,

442
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.410
they could do a smaller study, so it would be cheaper.

443
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.250
And when it came time to sell the drug, ready-made market. All right,

444
00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:17.370
so they do this big study only in black people and black people.

445
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.160
And what do they find? An amazing result?

446
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.630
We get a 43% reduction in mortality by what? In other words,

447
00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:27.450
if you were a black person in this trial and you took vital,

448
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.710
your chance of dying from heart failure was cutting half. Whoa, roughly.

449
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.030
That's huge. Huge. Yeah. So they go back and in 2005 that's Troy duster,

450
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.740
a sociologist at NYU,

451
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.940
the FDA approves this as a first racialized drug.

452
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.820
Think about that. The first racialized drug,

453
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.240
the first drug ever approved for racialized subpopulation

454
00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:53.470
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

455
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.850
<v 3>after hundreds of years of looking for differences between black people and</v>

456
00:26:57.851 --> 00:27:02.850
white people after the mapping of the human genome, here's the FDA saying

457
00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.190
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

458
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.710
<v 3>we're different. So some of us said this is a huge mistake.</v>

459
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.120
We knew this was a terribly sensitive issues.

460
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.280
Move into the 21st century.

461
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:17.370
Well aware of the terrible history of racial and ethnic categories.

462
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.520
What should we do? Yeah.

463
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.540
We had a symposium to welcome you all program here at the University of

464
00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:25.360
Minnesota.

465
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.800
We actually have a sold out crowd today than it was mainly aimed at attacking

466
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:30.940
[inaudible].

467
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.940
I just don't think race is a scientific category that there was a very well

468
00:27:37.121 --> 00:27:38.680
known law professor,

469
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.820
so patients so hostile to the idea that she said I would rather die from heart

470
00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:48.700
failure then take by doing, well that's not quite what she said.

471
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.760
I'd be terrified about a doctor making a diagnosis like that based on their view

472
00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:57.920
of me as belonging to a particular racial category.

473
00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.520
But it goes on all the [inaudible] that doesn't make it right.

474
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.970
That's why I say that does that right? It does.

475
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.550
If of these categories have, you know,

476
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.860
[inaudible] look [inaudible] Jack then to a doctor seeing an African American

477
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:17.680
with anemia. I said if you went into the doctor's office and were anemic,

478
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.850
the doctor would appropriately check you for sickle cell.

479
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.830
Just a natural everyday phenomenon. Right. And she insisted, well that's wrong.

480
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:27.941
I, I, you know,

481
00:28:27.941 --> 00:28:32.941
there's cause sickle cell disease is not confined to black and misdiagnosed well

482
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.750
as she is right, of course.

483
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:39.990
But the statistical likelihood of a white person with sickle cell disease is so

484
00:28:40.091 --> 00:28:44.020
low damaging their prevalence issues. There is a higher,

485
00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.190
we can look at a patient and help identify some, uh,

486
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.560
processes of diagnosis and treatment that might improve our precision to

487
00:28:53.561 --> 00:28:58.210
disregard that we need a better way to do it. But that's year 2005.

488
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.090
But you know what? I think that if we,

489
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:06.120
if seems to me that these racial categories are impeding good medical care and

490
00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:10.480
good biomedical research, they're not assisting it.

491
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.810
<v 0>Well I don't get that at all.</v>

492
00:29:11.811 --> 00:29:16.190
Why would the clearing a difference impede it seems exactly the opposite.

493
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.820
If you know that a group of people are likely to get sick in a certain way,

494
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.690
then you should target them and help them do them. Do you know what you think?

495
00:29:23.691 --> 00:29:27.230
You know, I think is what she's saying. And by looking at one target group,

496
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.010
are you somehow shutting yourself off from the real target group that you should

497
00:29:31.011 --> 00:29:32.870
be looking? I don't know what you're talking. Okay.

498
00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:35.630
Let me give you know that black, let me give you an example. Okay.

499
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.040
When you go to the doctor, yes.

500
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:40.580
And they put that thing around your bicep and they go, yes,

501
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:42.310
the squeeze blood pressure. Okay.

502
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.480
It's well known in the black Americans have much higher rates of high blood

503
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.140
pressure. Hypertension. Yes. It is. Then generic,

504
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.710
which is my point that so know that hold up help.

505
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.450
It can seem like it's caused by race or it's purely a racial phenomenon,

506
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.230
but then I mentioned this to Troy duster. I said, how do you explain this?

507
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.110
Black Americans suffer like twice the amount of hypertension than white

508
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:02.561
Americans.

509
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:06.070
Make the argument from me that this is somehow not an innate difference. Okay.

510
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.560
<v 16>The best argument here is Richard Cooper's. Yeah,</v>

511
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.770
<v 0>I'm Richard Cooper,</v>

512
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.640
I'm sure the Department of Preventive Medicine and epidemiology here at Loyola,

513
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.400
which Cooper is a doctor and a researcher, and here's what he did.

514
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.380
He went to poor neighborhoods in Chicago and methodically taking blood samples,

515
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.670
measured people's blood pressure,

516
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.630
and then you took that data and compared it to other countries. Spain,

517
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.720
<v 16>Italy, United Kingdom is huge. Germany,</v>

518
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.520
eight nations sampling 85,000 people, 80,000 people,

519
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.570
85,000 and he then arrays nations in terms of hypertension

520
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.790
<v 0>because he wants to know like who's got the highest rates? Who's got the lowest,</v>

521
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.340
and does this really have anything to do with race, right?

522
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.570
<v 17>Mm mm, mm, mm.</v>

523
00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.690
<v 16>And at the very end, the nation with the highest rate of hypertension.</v>

524
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.250
No tremor. Oh please.

525
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:56.623
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

526
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.070
<v 16>it's Germany, Germany, Germany. Actually Richard Cooper says that Finland,</v>

527
00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:03.950
Poland, and Russia are even worse. Right. Okay.

528
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.160
How many black people are in Russia? Seven.

529
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.750
Probably seven in the nation with the lowest rate of hypertension known as

530
00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:15.830
Nigeria. No kidding. Yeah. And it's like this, it's not like this.

531
00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.620
It's like you're putting your hands away. Yeah. Are for each other. Okay.

532
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.350
Your point being here, what exactly

533
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.341
<v 0>not obvious. I mean,</v>

534
00:31:23.341 --> 00:31:27.030
if you're a doctor and you're just focused on the United States data,

535
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:29.940
you would assume that it has something to do with race.

536
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.540
He's high blood pressure disparities. So good. Therefore a miss.

537
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.360
All the Russians and fins that came into your office. B,

538
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.270
you would over-treat the American blacks and see,

539
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.480
God forbid a Nigerian should walk in because you're gonna give him all these

540
00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:46.230
drugs he doesn't even need. Well then what does cause the differences?

541
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.040
Like if it's not race, what is it? If not race, what? Diet?

542
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.280
Yeah, Diet will really, Courtney, Richard Cooper. I know it's not that exciting,

543
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.540
but that's what he says. Well then what about bind all that.

544
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.140
You think that's wrong too? No, I mean,

545
00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:03.820
but if you are the first drug ever to be approved for black people,

546
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.180
when you want to know that your drug works better for black people,

547
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:11.500
that's compared to other groups. Yes, and you want to be sure, right? Yes. Well,

548
00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:13.690
they only ever tested it in black people.

549
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:17.260
They never actually compared blacks to whites. Yeah, well that's true.

550
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:21.280
We don't know and we haven't gone back and studied a large white population.

551
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.660
I personally believe that by deal will work in white people as well.

552
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:30.520
Maybe not to the same frequency, but I use it in my white patients.

553
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.820
Are you at all then upset that it's that certain wheeler, again,

554
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.360
it's FDA approved only for blacks. It's not getting to blacks.

555
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.160
I mean that's the real, what's he talking

556
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.940
<v 7>about? Well, in the end, vital kind of tanked by, you know,</v>

557
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:46.580
the way they priced and marketed the drug, all that kind of stuff.

558
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:50.090
But according to the Jay was also because of opposition to the idea

559
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.340
<v 16>concept of vital that this is a drug for blacks,</v>

560
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.760
it's a crime and that this life saving drug is not being as widely used as it

561
00:32:59.881 --> 00:33:00.714
should be.

562
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.020
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

563
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.970
<v 16>I'm very discouraged about that.</v>

564
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.810
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

565
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:17.810
<v 16>so the takeaway here I guess is if a doctor or a scientist or a pharmaceutical</v>

566
00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:22.950
company announces that there is a racial difference in the human family,

567
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.490
check the footnotes. Exactly. On the other hand,

568
00:33:26.491 --> 00:33:31.230
I think an awful lot of us in our regular life get all excited about racial

569
00:33:31.231 --> 00:33:35.640
differences. When we watch sports, I mean ha everyone notices for example,

570
00:33:35.641 --> 00:33:38.910
in track and field. Like why you all did you make in swim? Yeah, yeah.

571
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.240
In the hallways. Jamaican. So we found the Jamaican, I Roland Jamaican,

572
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.370
Malcolm Gladwell, a writer, Sota Jamaica.

573
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.910
He's Canadian Jamaican English,

574
00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.190
also the author of the tipping point and I don't know all those bestselling

575
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.680
books we talked to him about his uh, his early days as a runner.

576
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.590
<v 7>Am I running weight when I was 13 and 14 was about 105 hundred.</v>

577
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.000
So you like just kind of danced on the grind?

578
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:06.370
I am 30 pounds heavier than I was in my running prime. Are you good? Uh,

579
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.400
you can be at that age. Yeah. Am I good in the global sense? No. Yeah.

580
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.860
Was I good at 13? I was really good. I was, I was all Canadian. Yeah.

581
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.670
Oh you are, you're number one in your country. And what event 1500 meters

582
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.510
and your age, class,

583
00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:26.511
track and field in Ontario in the 1970s was so overwhelmingly west Indian.

584
00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:30.360
It was in retrospect, it's hilarious. Think back on it.

585
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:34.950
I mean you would go to these track meets and there's like reggae music playing

586
00:34:34.951 --> 00:34:39.570
in the end cause the entire time and the stands are full of Jamaicans.

587
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.020
So you are dealing with this fact, you know,

588
00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:46.580
you're 13 you're not very sophisticated. You're dealing with this fact that

589
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.300
there just aren't any white people. It's all Jamaicans in lanes,

590
00:34:52.301 --> 00:34:56.480
one through eight are all Jamaicans right off the boat Tobago.

591
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.590
And so you, you begin. And when you see it was really funny.

592
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:02.020
I remember there was a guy named Arnold Stotts and novels,

593
00:35:02.021 --> 00:35:05.230
dots dominated the quarter mile for years in age class running.

594
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.400
Oh I don't start. Where's the white guy?

595
00:35:06.401 --> 00:35:08.920
He was a white guy and we all looked at Arnold and we said,

596
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.140
it's not going to last, right? Can't last. Sure not it didn't.

597
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.650
You thought Arnold won't make it because he doesn't have the right stuff,

598
00:35:17.651 --> 00:35:19.810
the right stuff being whatever it is that you make to make it.

599
00:35:19.811 --> 00:35:22.240
The question was how long can Arnold keep beating the Jamaicans?

600
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.820
And the answer is it can't be for that much longer.

601
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.290
And he was a tremendous spinner,

602
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:31.210
but we had this kind of unspoken prejudice that said, if you weren't Jamaican,

603
00:35:31.211 --> 00:35:34.540
it was hopeless. [inaudible] and did you ever have an opportunity at your,

604
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.130
at the age of 14 to ascribe this to anything? I'm mean,

605
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.380
I began to kind of process it in a very, very crude,

606
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.330
unsophisticated way.

607
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.300
And then I would look at the world and I would see in the world,

608
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.880
black people went all sprints. So I figured, well,

609
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:50.700
maybe just black people are faster than white people

610
00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:59.190
in a very primitive young guy kind of way. Malcolm was,

611
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:02.640
I don't know exactly what the blade word for this is, but he was a racist,

612
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.540
chauvinist maybe. Or just somebody who sees west Indians winning everythings.

613
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:09.810
We figured there's gotta be a genetic advantage here because he could feel it in

614
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:13.350
himself. Listen, I had that gift. I was really,

615
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:16.920
really good when I was 15 and 14 and 30. I was the best in Canada.

616
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.150
I used to beat Dave Reed. Dave Reed went on. You beat Dave Reed, Dave,

617
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:25.320
even under the, and the Canadian Olympic team. Oh really? That was the thing.

618
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.270
That was the caliber of runner. I was,

619
00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.920
will you and Dave Reed at the time when you were beating him? Uh, four, 14,

620
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.250
okay, let's make that clear. But now that he's older and slower and so, uh,

621
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.040
he's revised his thinking in this area.

622
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:46.041
I know longer and all that enamored of a kind of a genetic case for black

623
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:49.860
athletic superiority. I think it maybe explained some tiny amount,

624
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:51.480
but it's not the real issue.

625
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.400
Nature takes care of the fundamental things in the beginning. And then as we,

626
00:36:56.401 --> 00:37:00.840
as activities grow more involved in more complex individual choice starts to

627
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:04.200
matter more and more and more and more. And when he says individual choice,

628
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:07.260
he's thinking of the moment when you're an athlete and it's the last turn or

629
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:09.060
maybe the last lap of a race.

630
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.640
<v 18>When you've run 1200 meters in a 1500 meter race, oh,</v>

631
00:37:12.641 --> 00:37:14.950
you run six miles of a seven mile cross country race,

632
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:19.510
you're beginning to suffer. Pain is about to start.

633
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.320
You're in a position where you possibly can win if you exert yourself.

634
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.250
And that's the moment as Malcolm went, every athlete has to ask,

635
00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.140
how much do I care?

636
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.690
<v 7>There's always a struggle. Do I really care though?</v>

637
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.640
Does it matter to me or do you think that Mickey Mantle or or, Oh,

638
00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:41.480
I think everyone has it. You think all athletes have that question?

639
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.300
Some people say I do care and some people say I don't.

640
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.190
And how you answered that question,

641
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:50.210
yes or no has very little to do with jeans says mouth.

642
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.210
That's not the critical difference between me and tiger woods. You know,

643
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:53.930
it's the,

644
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.070
it's the tiger gets up at five in the morning and hits 10,000 golf balls before

645
00:37:58.071 --> 00:37:59.480
breakfast. That's the difference.

646
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.930
Why does he want to do that and why is that inconceivable for me to do?

647
00:38:02.931 --> 00:38:07.310
There's your interesting story. In Malcolm's case, he says he did love running.

648
00:38:07.311 --> 00:38:10.070
You know when you're that age you really can't run forever.

649
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:11.150
I'll never forget the feeling,

650
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.540
but he also loved reading books and he loved going to school and he loved

651
00:38:14.541 --> 00:38:17.720
thinking, it ain't like bring Bronx, I don't know.

652
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.950
My father comes from that glorious tradition of English amateurism which says

653
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.860
you should do many things and none of them. Well,

654
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.230
which in that critical moment made answering. Yes,

655
00:38:30.231 --> 00:38:34.430
I will put up with the pain and win this race a little bit more difficult.

656
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:35.800
I struggled with it and I,

657
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.390
there was a moment when I had that conversation and I decided I didn't care.

658
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.290
And the moment happened when he was preparing for the Canadian national

659
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.220
championship, Canadian Championship, two of his friends who were also black.

660
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.800
I go for a run with this guy, Dave Reed, who's a great runner. [inaudible] yeah.

661
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.710
And another guy named Chris Brewster, another great runner of my generation.

662
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:57.160
At the time we would've thought of ourselves as equals,

663
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:02.190
but those guys didn't have as many options as Malcolm is a famous hill,

664
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.940
um, called Telegraph Hill. I know signal hill steep is the steepest.

665
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.580
It's like running up the steepest flight of steps you've ever,

666
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.310
I mean it goes up from my, like San Francisco, Steve. Yeah. Yeah.

667
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.270
It goes up forever.

668
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.560
And the first day I think we ran up it and I just thought this is ridiculous

669
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.650
cause you're huffing and puffing or because just like, why would we do this?

670
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.080
Like it just seemed crazy. And then the next day we went there, he went,

671
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.680
we ran like seven miles to signal hill and then Dave Reed and Chris Bruser

672
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.690
decided they want to run up the hill backwards. Really? Which is, you know,

673
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:36.370
you just run seven miles at probably five 45 pace.

674
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.430
It's six in the morning and they want to run up this huge hill backers and I,

675
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.640
I said no. And I went home. I didn't want to run anymore.

676
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.330
I wanted to be on the debating team and I wanted to read books and I wanted to

677
00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:53.520
hang out with my friend Terry. I quit.

678
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.550
<v 16>So what is left to say about these genetically based racial differences in your</v>

679
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.410
mind? Very little.

680
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.030
So all the things that we've been talking about in this show that maybe there is

681
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:12.310
a tendency to get sick in a certain way.

682
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.520
Maybe some medicine's working with a better for one group than another.

683
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.790
Let's say it's still true. Yeah. You say it's true,

684
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.510
but it's not true enough to me when you think about a very short story.

685
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:27.390
<v 7>Yeah, it's, I don't, I mean, I'll grant you all those things and then I'll,</v>

686
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.130
I'll roll my eyes and say, I don't really care.

687
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.430
<v 5>Nelson Gladwell's latest book is called outliers and radio lab will turn it in a</v>

688
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:39.364
moment.

689
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.410
<v 19>This is Chad [inaudible] calling you from my living room in Cincinnati, Ohio.</v>

694
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.170
<v 16>Hey, I'm Jad I boom rod and I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.</v>

695
00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:13.980
Our topic today is race. What signs can or cannot tell us about race?

696
00:41:13.981 --> 00:41:16.150
Now that we're at the, towards the back end of the program,

697
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.310
the front end or back end,

698
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.820
we're at the front end of the back and we can confess to what we asked before.

699
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.440
What could a scientist tell us that's hard and true about the biology of race?

700
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.470
Nothing. No. It's better than nothing, right? Something.

701
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.760
But once you dropped the science part of race and think of it as just a way of

702
00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:34.000
sorting into us

703
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.880
<v 0>as and them's,</v>

704
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.960
then it gets interesting or at the very least more complicated. I didn't know.

705
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.880
Here's an example. We're uptown Manhattan.

706
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.120
1:00 PM third period's about to start where to charter school called facing

707
00:41:48.121 --> 00:41:50.970
history, which has about 150 kids, mostly Hispanic,

708
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.930
and we'd come because we'd heard did every year in the ninth grade they do this

709
00:41:54.931 --> 00:41:58.690
particular guessing exercise. Okay?

710
00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.450
All these microphones and other people that you guys see today,

711
00:42:01.451 --> 00:42:02.530
they are not in the room.

712
00:42:02.531 --> 00:42:05.600
You can ignore them like sometimes you want to ignore me. All right?

713
00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.300
First Year teacher, David Sharon,

714
00:42:07.301 --> 00:42:10.990
he tells his class with about 12 freshmen to pull up their seats into a

715
00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:13.750
semicircle. Same class style is always,

716
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.720
let's go get on their race goggles. All right,

717
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.320
so we have an activity here called sorting people.

718
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:25.660
I didn't say, hey, after handing out some worksheets, David kills the lights,

719
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:27.250
flips on his overhead projector,

720
00:42:27.251 --> 00:42:31.120
and immediately eight faces up here projected onto the wall.

721
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:34.750
What I want us to do is go kind of one by one and try to decide,

722
00:42:34.751 --> 00:42:39.460
try to come to a consensus. Okay, what race are these people based on?

723
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.910
Looking at them and then we'll test it out.

724
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:47.680
He explains they've got four choices. That black, white, Asian, native American.

725
00:42:47.681 --> 00:42:51.970
So why don't we start that with the first one? The woman on the top left.

726
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.340
Pink cheeks. Light-Skin bushy hair.

727
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.210
Big Philippina nose. At least that's how it looked to me tomorrow.

728
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.830
What do you think? White Richard Black got her money back.

729
00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:06.990
She just seems white. But then when you look at her hair,

730
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:10.470
it seems like wishing she's right, baby. I'm gonna go with white.

731
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.180
So what do we think for the man on the bottom left mustache. Borderline Afro.

732
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:20.130
Asian. Native American. Vaguely ethnic version of Tom Selleck.

733
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.070
I'm picking between white and the Asian.

734
00:43:23.071 --> 00:43:28.050
White or Asian or native American? I think he's black. Black,

735
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.630
Hispanic. We're actually not gonna use Hispanic.

736
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.360
So let's take a vote here. How many people say uh, black? Three.

737
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.730
OK. White or how many people say native American? All right.

738
00:43:42.731 --> 00:43:45.820
Just cut to the chase. After eight of these faces, David revealed the results.

739
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.680
Turned out pink face girl was black,

740
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.040
Tom Selleck was Asian and all in all the class got three right out of eight,

741
00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.910
which thrilled. David, what does this tell us?

742
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.660
One of the kids in the back of the class, the girl named Bianca finally says,

743
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.100
well, what it tells us that this activity retarded. Sorry.

744
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:17.900
It's still why? Cause it's stupid. We have to be more specific.

745
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.760
Okay, so let's say that you had a white mother and a black father.

746
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.110
The child will come out brown. No, come on gray. How would it come out? Great.

747
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.220
No, it will come out brown. Okay. I'm not white or black. I'm Dominican.

748
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.213
Mother is

749
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.920
<v 20>light-skin like David's color and my father is dark skin and I came out on mixed</v>

750
00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:40.860
color. I am Brown, so is Brown and race. So I guess I'm Brown. Done.

751
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.670
<v 0>Interestingly in the cafeteria after class,</v>

752
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:46.860
when we asked people how do they identify,

753
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.390
it's gonna sound like a dumb question,

754
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.780
but what race are you most people said something like this.

755
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:55.320
Trinidadian Ecuadorian Dominicans. They named the country Mexican. I'm making,

756
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:57.000
I'm Colombian. Puerto Rican, almost.

757
00:44:57.001 --> 00:44:59.180
No one said I'm one of those four official categories.

758
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.180
If they mentioned it at all,

759
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:03.150
it was just to say that they're somewhere in between.

760
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.540
Where did they switch back and forth? Half Puerto Rican, half Salvadorian.

761
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.150
I'm a mixture of black people and Spanish. I'm Mexican,

762
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:11.790
but I'm not a hundred percent Michigan. My spirit is black.

763
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.860
They what I'm saying, if I'm like in my neighborhood,

764
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.180
people will see me a Spanish, but if I go like to my grandma's block,

765
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:21.630
people will see me as like white. When I go back home to Cuba, everybody, oh,

766
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:23.100
that's the black end. When I come here,

767
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:26.520
all of a sudden I changed my race so I become a Spanish. You do that too.

768
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.690
<v 16>Do I shift like these kids? No. I mean I get, I get confused a lot.</v>

769
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.390
I mean you could pass as a Jew, I think even though you're an Arab. Oh yeah,

770
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.690
in New York, forget it. But what's interesting is these kids,

771
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:39.510
it wasn't like they were unaware of race. I mean they're aware of it.

772
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.290
It's just fluid for them because I guess so many of them can pass for different

773
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:46.560
things. It just, it becomes then all about like what you were,

774
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.320
what you listened to, like small things in the end.

775
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.930
But in some circumstances we all know this.

776
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:57.000
The tiniest differences can suddenly mean everything we talked to.

777
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.540
We're going to switch locations here from New York to Baghdad in Iraq.

778
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.650
We talked to any rocky guy named Ali Abbas who worked as a translator.

779
00:46:04.651 --> 00:46:08.250
As a journalist in Baghdad. Yeah. With NPR, back that office.

780
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.590
And when you were growing up in Baghdad, when you were a kid,

781
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:12.660
did you know whether you were she or Sunni?

782
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.290
<v 21>No. No, no.</v>

783
00:46:14.291 --> 00:46:19.240
The first time I knew that I was a senior Shia effect,

784
00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:21.520
it was sixth grade.

785
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.580
We were sitting after class break and someone asked me if I'm a senior,

786
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.930
Shia, like another kid. I remember it was a decree, the kid, the place,

787
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.120
the village we were at. Where should I [inaudible] yeah,

788
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.070
that's the town where sit down grew up. What did you answer? Um, I answered.

789
00:46:37.071 --> 00:46:41.000
I don't know because you really didn't know. I really didn't know.

790
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:45.450
So they made fun of me, um, and their 10th home and they said to my mom, um,

791
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:50.300
am I as Tsuneo Shia? The first answer from my mum was a slap on my face.

792
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.690
Weirdly. Yeah. She, she said, never ask about these things.

793
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.400
You're a Muslim and that's all what you care.

794
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.240
<v 1>[inaudible] but that was then, this is now,</v>

795
00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.010
<v 16>today's is all the in Baghdad. You can't go around saying, I don't know who I am</v>

796
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.653
<v 1>now.</v>

797
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.230
<v 16>You'll have to choose. Yeah. Even if you don't want to.</v>

798
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.790
<v 21>2007, a friend of mine, close friend of mine, he calls me and says, Ellie,</v>

799
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:17.400
did you hear about what happened to me? And I'm like, no. What happened?

800
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.540
He said, my father, they kidnapped him. His father is an old guy.

801
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.470
62 was just the end in his neighborhood buying candies for his, uh,

802
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:30.160
grandson. And then he disappeared. Just disappeared. No one knows.

803
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.330
And in Baghdad, when someone's kidnapped, they usually don't come back.

804
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.360
Usually the body just shows up in a more so what alleys friend wanted is he

805
00:47:39.711 --> 00:47:43.540
wanted to go to bag Denmark to go and you know, find his father.

806
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.180
But the problem was his friend couldn't go alone because he suddenly,

807
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.470
his name is Ahmad and the Marc is completely controlled by sheer,

808
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.950
if as Sunni man was trying to get his relatives body out of the morgue,

809
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:56.620
somewhere along the line, the Shia militia,

810
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.740
they would check the names and they would ask them about something, you know,

811
00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:04.180
shit deep. She had religion questions and if he fails that so they would just,

812
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.900
you know, lunch him, they would, what?

813
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.990
They would take him out of the hospital to somewhere and they probably killed

814
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.130
and dump his body somewhere.

815
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.080
Can I ask a really dumb question? Sure. You walking through Baghdad,

816
00:48:19.081 --> 00:48:21.450
you walk into this hospital and you see a Sunni, you see a Shia.

817
00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.230
Can you tell the difference with your eyes at all? Um,

818
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:30.360
sometimes you can't really know. [inaudible]

819
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.270
<v 22>sometimes you could take advantage of this confusion to help a friend,</v>

820
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.590
Ali, after all was always helping journalists get around Baghdad.

821
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.260
And you never knew who was going to be asking you questions.

822
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.620
Sometimes it would be a Sunni malicious, sometimes a Shia militia.

823
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.520
It's very hard to know.

824
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.890
So journalists would go around the town with two ideas simultaneously.

825
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.240
One would be a sheer id, the other a SUNY item

826
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.010
<v 21>and they're putting it like somewhere in their pockets.</v>

827
00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.490
You know the right is the Sydney, the left is this year. Wait a second.

828
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.810
The riders, the Sunni, the the left is this year. Yeah.

829
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.410
So if in that split second you think this Guy Sunni,

830
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.350
you go right and the few share your go left. That's new. If it were me, I just,

831
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.190
I know that, I know how I thought. I know what happened just to shoot a gun.

832
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.110
Right. But it's not traded. It's not really fun though.

833
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.560
<v 22>Especially when your job on this particular day is to take your Sunni friend</v>

834
00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:27.080
into a hospital controlled by Shia militia.

835
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.380
So our lead decided that to protect his Sunni friend Amar,

836
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.980
maybe the best protection would be a slight name change.

837
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.450
When they went to the hospital, they would call him Amar,

838
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.380
not Amare Amato.

839
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.590
<v 21>Is that a pure suddenly name? Amar is something in the middle.</v>

840
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.860
Could be senior condition as the same as the different spellings,

841
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.940
different spelling. Yeah, different spellings. They said almost identical,

842
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:55.290
but just the LF or the a in the middle.

843
00:49:55.291 --> 00:49:56.700
And by adding that one letter,

844
00:49:56.701 --> 00:50:00.780
that one extra a really hoped that would keep his friend alive.

845
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.280
So we went there, I took him and my brother was here who's also a physician. Um,

846
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.780
at that time came with us.

847
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.380
He came with us and I told him not to call Omar Omar.

848
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.970
I told him to call [inaudible].

849
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:18.150
So Ali and his friend and his brother using this new name that into the morgue

850
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:21.340
where they were taken to a room where everybody sits to look at pictures of

851
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:24.790
people who, who are dead. We sat them that computer room, they call it,

852
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.720
where they're like seven computer monitors and there's someone on the side of

853
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.340
the room while he's holding the, uh, the mouse and he's moving with his finger.

854
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:37.910
The, the pictures changing the pictures and pupils sitting on the ground.

855
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:42.140
Probably 35 or 40 other people on the ground looking at the pictures,

856
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:43.580
hoping not to see

857
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.980
<v 22>a picture of their brother or their mother or their father.</v>

858
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.460
<v 21>So whenever there's a picture of one of their relatives,</v>

859
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.870
you will hear someone crying, shouting, wailing.

860
00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.900
We were looking at the pictures, looking at the pictures

861
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.130
<v 22>too. After picture after picture,</v>

862
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.740
<v 21>you know, we finally found,</v>

863
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.920
reached a decision that his father wasn't among the pictures.

864
00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.870
Suddenly his father's picture comes out,

865
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.600
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

866
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.580
<v 21>Delmar, burst out crying and you know, and my brother would say,</v>

867
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:16.730
Omar, don't worry, I'm won't, don't Amar. This is guts decision.

868
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:20.420
This is guts that Dah Dah, Dah. And then you'd say that you take now Amar, Amar,

869
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:23.780
and Marla and our, you know, hit him on his chest. Don't say this word,

870
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.780
don't say it, because not only Omar will be killed, it will be us.

871
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.833
<v 1>Well,</v>

872
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.570
<v 22>but nobody in the room apparently heard him say Amare the wrong pronunciation.</v>

873
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.050
So they got a number from the picture and then they had to go to a different

874
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:40.540
part of the morgue to actually locate the body.

875
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.550
Then of course bring it home for proper burial.

876
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.040
<v 21>So we, we walked out from the computer room, we went to the, uh,</v>

877
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.470
to their frigerator, which is actually not that refrigerator,

878
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.000
it's just hallways.

879
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.170
All these buddies dumped on both sides of the hallway and as soon as you enter

880
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:59.120
these hallways, you can barely hold your breath. The smell,

881
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.690
the auto is so, so stringent.

882
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:06.700
It's like it's impossible to bear and the whole ground is full of a thick layer

883
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:12.800
of, of greasy blood, you know, it sticks to your foot when you work.

884
00:52:12.801 --> 00:52:14.900
It's like chicks chicks

885
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.390
<v 22>and it was a very long hallway.</v>

886
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.170
<v 21>Omar was, um,</v>

887
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:26.920
he actually fell twice and we would stop him from falling down and we would slap

888
00:52:26.921 --> 00:52:29.560
him on his face, wake up. We've got to keep going.

889
00:52:29.561 --> 00:52:33.760
So we would walk all the way down to find all these piles of buddy.

890
00:52:33.761 --> 00:52:36.460
Then in one pile, the guy who's wearing boots,

891
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.320
the worker there who will tell us,

892
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.580
I think our father is within this pile and he's like talking normally

893
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:44.320
[inaudible] and bothered by all of this.

894
00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:48.040
Who through the buddies from this side or from this side.

895
00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:53.041
And then he took a Omar's father from his arms and he just pulled him from

896
00:52:53.231 --> 00:52:54.370
underneath the pile.

897
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.700
And I'm didn't want to believe that this was his father.

898
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.760
He didn't want to believe. He said, I don't know. I,

899
00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:02.600
I don't think this is my father. I don't see him,

900
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:06.770
but the tag number was there and because the tag number was there,

901
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:12.080
they knew it was Kumar's father. We came out and we thought, you know, that's,

902
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.720
that's it. We're going to take the buddy and go home.

903
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.270
And at that moment

904
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:23.310
they were suddenly approached by two Shia militiamen over.

905
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.800
Very obvious. They're shits from the media,

906
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.490
<v 22>from one of the most radical groups in Baghdad. And um,</v>

907
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:35.540
one of them said, let me see your id though.

908
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:37.760
I'm going to have to give him his physician's ID.

909
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:43.370
But that ID had his real name, his SUNY name on it. He looked at it,

910
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:48.520
so I'm not, he said, Huh? He said, Oh, Ma.

911
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.130
Huh.

912
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.660
<v 23>So he knew. Anyway, you're saying is yeah,</v>

913
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.710
he talked to his friend next to him.

914
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:59.670
They kept whispering to each other about the nit and we realized probably that's

915
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.090
the moment when we're all going to die. Yeah, we're done.

916
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:05.410
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

917
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.520
<v 23>so immediately, immediately we started talking to them in a very loud voice.</v>

918
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.450
Listen guys, we are your colleagues here. Whatever you need,

919
00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:17.470
come to the emergency room. Ask for me. I'm Dr Ali Abbas and this is,

920
00:54:17.471 --> 00:54:19.990
my brother has such a bus, you know, to show them that we're shit.

921
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.960
We started talking in a very, uh, heavy sheer accent, you know. Um, yeah,

922
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.210
you can come at any moment if you wanted the, uh, if you have anything,

923
00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:31.270
just tell us. Let us know. We're your brothers. Help us here.

924
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.420
And then they waited.

925
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.800
[inaudible] kept looking at their eyes when they're doing it and

926
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:41.640
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

927
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.050
<v 22>God, they gave us the papers back.</v>

928
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.490
We've got the ominous father out and he took him and buried him.

929
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.343
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

930
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.880
<v 22>Ali Abbas has now left back that he's moved to Brooklyn, New York neighborhood.</v>

931
00:55:03.881 --> 00:55:07.330
Very proud of its mix of races and people from all over the world.

932
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:12.010
But remember, Baghdad was a multicultural city as well,

933
00:55:12.011 --> 00:55:15.160
for hundreds of years longer than Brooklyn. So I asked him,

934
00:55:15.161 --> 00:55:17.980
now that you're here, I mean, given what you've, what you've seen,

935
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:22.880
what do you think about us that would tell you something? The subway is my,

936
00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.500
I would sit in a subway car, you know, and, and, and looking at the people,

937
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:32.840
African Americans, Hispanic, white, you know, I question myself, he's a Jew.

938
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.370
He's not a Jew, he's Christian.

939
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:38.810
And I'm looking at the people and it's exactly this question that comes in my

940
00:55:38.811 --> 00:55:42.200
mind, who, how they're living together.

941
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.070
How does it seem like something that could explode? Oh yeah.

942
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.350
It's something that I always think, I mean,

943
00:55:48.351 --> 00:55:53.351
I look at them and look at all kinds of phrases and I'm wondering how can this

944
00:55:53.991 --> 00:55:55.940
country hold them together?

945
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.323
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

946
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.460
<v 22>that was Ali Abbas, often a translator for national public radio. Okay.</v>

947
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:18.530
