00:00:00.034 --> 00:00:02.149
And the answer is scan.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.923
Actually, if you want to be a little bit more precise, it is exclusive sum scan.

00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:08.223
And we already know how to do a scan efficiently.

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:12.897
This predicate is our input. This black line here is the output of our scan.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:19.020
And note that it corresponds precisely to the addresses we need, to scatter the input to the output.
