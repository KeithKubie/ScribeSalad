00:00:00.845 --> 00:00:02.494
- [Instructor] We're told
that Elena wants to build

00:00:02.494 --> 00:00:05.953
a one-sample z interval to
estimate what proportion

00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:09.831
of computers produced at a
factory have a certain defect.

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:14.011
She chooses a confidence level of 94%.

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.751
A random sample of 200
computers shows that

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:18.933
12 computers have the defect.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:23.206
What critical value z
star should Elena use

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.992
to construct this confidence interval?

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.943
So before I even ask
you to pause this video,

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:29.661
let me just give you a
little reminder of what

00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:31.379
a critical value is.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.375
Remember, the whole point
behind confidence intervals are

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.393
we have some true population parameter,

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:40.296
in this case it is the
proportion of computers

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.898
that have a defect.

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:44.359
So there's some true
population proportion.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.611
We don't know what that is,
but we try to estimate it.

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.026
We take a sample, in
this case it's a sample,

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:51.070
a random sample of 200 computers,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.579
we take a random sample,

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.181
and then we estimate this by calculating

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:56.014
the sample proportion.

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.265
But then we also wanna
construct a confidence interval.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:01.472
And remember a confidence interval,

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:04.816
at a 94% confidence level means

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:07.068
that if we were to keep doing this,

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.297
and if we were to keep
creating intervals around

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:12.293
these statistics, so maybe
that's the confidence

00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:13.825
interval around that one,

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:15.427
maybe if we were to do it again,

00:01:15.427 --> 00:01:17.842
that's the confidence
interval around that one,

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:22.695
that 94% that roughly as
I keep doing this over

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:23.717
and over again,

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.527
that 90, that roughly
94% of these intervals

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:31.449
are going to overlap with our
true population parameter.

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:34.328
And the way that we do this
is we take the statistic.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.070
Let me just write this in general form,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.742
even if we're not talking
about a proportion.

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:42.386
It could be if we're trying to
estimate the population mean.

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:45.386
So we take our statistic, statistic,

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.397
and then we go plus or
minus around that statistic,

00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:52.742
plus or minus around that statistic,

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:55.366
and then we say okay how
many standard deviations

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.291
for the sampling
distribution do we wanna go

00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.801
above or beyond?

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.705
So the number of standard
deviations we wanna go,

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.771
that is our critical value,

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.024
and then we multiply
that times the standard

00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:07.024
deviation of

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:10.784
the statistic,

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:12.293
of the statistic.

00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:15.103
Now in this particular situation,

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:18.888
our statistic is p hat
from this one sample

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:20.699
that Elena made.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.371
So it's that one sample proportion

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.740
that she was able to calculate,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.782
plus or minus z star, and
we're gonna think about

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.872
which z star because that's
essentially the question,

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:30.381
the critical value.

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.634
So plus or minus some critical value

00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:35.815
times and what we do
because in order to actually

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:38.578
calculate the true standard deviation of

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:42.200
the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.501
well then you actually have to know

00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:44.662
the population parameter.

00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:45.707
But we don't know that,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.423
so we multiply that
times the standard error

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:49.840
of the statistic.

00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:53.392
And we've done this in previous videos.

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:54.855
But the key question here is,

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.131
what is our z star?

00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:59.058
And what we really
needed to think about is,

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:03.748
assuming that the sampling
distribution is roughly normal,

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:06.628
and this is the mean of
it which would actually

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:08.137
be our true population parameter,

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:10.343
which we do not know.

00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:12.758
But how many standard
deviations above and below

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.916
the mean in order to capture

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:18.249
94% of the probability?

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.009
94% of the area.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.369
So this distance right over here,

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.286
where this is 94%,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.106
this number of standard deviations,

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:31.241
that is z star right over here.

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.470
Now all we have to really do is look it up

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.049
on a z-table,

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.512
but even there we have to be careful.

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.532
And you should always
be careful which type

00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:40.529
of z-table you're using or
if you're using a calculator

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.317
function what your
calculator function does.

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:45.034
Because a lot of z-tables will actually

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:46.659
do something like this.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.981
For a given z, they'll say,

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:51.976
what is the total area going all the way

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.623
from negative infinity up to including

00:03:54.623 --> 00:03:56.956
z standard deviations above,

00:03:57.874 --> 00:03:59.360
above the mean?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.916
So when you look up a lot of z-tables,

00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:04.585
they will give you, they
will give you this area.

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:06.512
So one way to think about this,

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.764
we wanna find the critical value,

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.738
we wanna find the z,

00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:13.733
that leaves not 6% unshaded in,

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:15.846
but leaves 3% unshaded in.

00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:17.147
Where did I get that from?

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:20.699
Well 100% minus 94% is 6%.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.348
But remember this is going to be symmetric

00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:23.555
on the left and the right,

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.947
so you're gonna want 3%
not shaded in over here

00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:28.942
and 3% not shaded in over here.

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:30.986
So when I look at a traditional z-table,

00:04:30.986 --> 00:04:33.819
that is viewing it from
this point of view,

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.235
this cumulative area,

00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:37.696
what I really wanna do is find the z

00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:40.413
that is leaving 3% open over here,

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:44.580
which would mean the z that
is filling in 97% over here,

00:04:45.707 --> 00:04:47.426
not 94%.

00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:48.981
But if I find this z,

00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.001
but if I were to stop it
right over there as well,

00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:53.393
then I would have 3% available there,

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.344
and then the true area
that we're filling in

00:04:55.344 --> 00:04:57.642
would be 94%.

00:04:57.642 --> 00:04:59.175
So that out of the way let's look that up.

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:03.342
What z gives us fills us,
fills in 97% of the area?

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.837
So I got a z-table.

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:08.416
This is actually the
one that you would see

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.553
if you were say taking AP Statistics.

00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:14.523
And we would just look up
where do we get to 97%.

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.273
And so it is 97%

00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:20.444
looks like it is right about here.

00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:22.116
That looks like the closest number.

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:24.624
This is .0006 above it.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.876
This is only .0001 below it.

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:28.455
And so this is,

00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:30.870
let's see you would look at the row first.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.537
If we look at the row it is 1.8,

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:35.488
1.88

00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:38.344
is our z.

00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:41.551
So going back to

00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.107
this right over here,

00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:45.274
if our z is equal to 1.88,

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.232
so this is equal to 1.88,

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.952
then all of this area
up to and including 1.88

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.624
standard deviations above the mean,

00:05:54.624 --> 00:05:56.876
that would be 97%.

00:05:56.876 --> 00:05:59.268
But if you were to go
1.88 standard deviations

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.985
above the mean and 1.88
standard deviations

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:03.262
below the mean,

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.445
that would leave 3% open on either side,

00:06:05.445 --> 00:06:07.945
and so this would be 94%.

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:11.853
So this would be 94%.

00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:14.686
But to answer their question
what critical z value

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.312
or what critical value is z star?

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:19.353
Well this is going to be 1.88,

00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:20.603
and we're done.
