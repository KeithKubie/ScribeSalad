00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.160
Let's do another example where
we have some data.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.880
We want to fit a line to that
data, and maybe use that to

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.870
estimate some of the
data that we didn't

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.440
collect, so to speak.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.010
So the first thing they ask us,
let's look at the chart

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.490
first of all.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.480
This is birth year.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.680
They started in 1930.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.720
They go all the way up
to the year 2000 in

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.720
increments of 10 years.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990
They tell us the life
expectancy in years.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.470
So a good thing for us.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.660
I think this is the
United States.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.930
The life expectancy has been
steadily increasing.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.560
The first thing they ask us to
do is to make a scatter plot

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.540
of the data.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.510
I did this on Excel
ahead of time.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.900
This is what I got.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.940
As you can see in 1930
it was 59.7.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.970
In 1940 it was 62.9.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.340
These blue dots are
just plotting each

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.600
of these data points.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.270
1930 is 57.9.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.230
It's that data point
right there.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.770
In 1940 it was 62.9.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.410
It's that data point
right there.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.820
So I just went ahead and
plotted all of them.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.060
Then I let Excel figure out
a line of best fit.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.970
I didn't go into the math
of how to do this.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.610
We'll do that in
future videos.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.310
It's out of the scope of
introductory algebra.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.480
But Excel figured out that the
line of best fit, the line

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.290
that is least far away from
all of these points, that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.930
minimizes the distance from all
of these points, is y is

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.150
equal to 0.2395x minus 400.99.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.170
I'm not going to go into what
r squared is just yet.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.680
But it's a measure of how good
this line is actually fitting.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.300
So let's use that.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300
Let's use this table.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.480
Let's use our line of best
fit to answer the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.760
rest of their questions.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.730
So the second question is, use
the line of best fit to

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.210
estimate the life expectancy
of a person born in 1955.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.130
So we have two options.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.170
We could just eyeball it.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.610
1955 is right there.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.590
So if you go up from 1955 you're
going to hit the line

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.880
of best fit.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.360
Let me do it in different color,
because that's the same

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.220
color as the dots.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.590
In 1955 you're going
to hit the line of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.340
best fit right there.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.990
If I were to just eyeball
it, it looks

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.810
like it's right there.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.070
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.600
So these are increments of 2.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.690
So it looks like
about 77 years.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.320
So 1955, it looks roughly equal
to 77-- no, no sorry--

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.550
67 years-- let me be clear, it
sounded suspicious-- a 67 year

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.400
life expectancy.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.330
Now we can use the equation of
this line of best fit to come

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.820
up with the exact value.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.940
When x is equal to
1955, what is y?

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.930
What is the life expectancy
in years?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.280
Let's get our calculator
out for this.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.240
Actually let me use a graphing
calculator for

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.195
this one right now.

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.950
So let me clear this.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.740
Let me clear everything.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.950
Then let's just punch
in 1955 for x.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.900
So we have 0.2395 times 1955,
that's our x-value, minus

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.040
400.99 is equal to 67.23.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.900
So our line of best fit
gives us the exact

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.750
answer of 67.23 years.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.990
So our eyeballing it wasn't
that far off.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.260
So that's what our line of best
fit would predict, if we

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.010
assume that a linear model
is a good model to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.500
describe this data.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.070
All we know right now are
linear models, so

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.000
that's what we'll use.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.180
It actually looks pretty good.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.280
It seems like it fits the data
pretty, pretty good.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.970
Let's do the next part.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.410
Use linear interpolation to
estimate the life expectancy

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.890
of a person born in 1955.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.430
Now linear interpolation means
let's take the data points

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.010
around 1955.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.780
So you have this data
point from 1950.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.390
You have this data
point from 1960.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.120
Let's draw a line between those
two data points and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.900
assume that the 1955 number
would be right in between on

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.310
the line there.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.510
Now we could figure out the
equation of that line.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.640
We have two points.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.000
We have the 1950 data and
we have the 1960 data.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.500
We could figure out the
slope of the line.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.240
We could figure out
its y-intercept.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.980
Then we can substitute
1955 in there.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.260
But this is a line, and
1955 is right in

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.130
between these two points.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.740
It's 5 from either one.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.400
So on this point right here,
that's on that linear

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.630
interpolation, on that orange,
will just be halfway

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.550
between these two.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.290
So we can even average those.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.960
So let's do that.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:58.780
So if we just average those,
68.2 plus 69.7 is equal, and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.000
then we want to divide it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.900
That answer means our
previous answer.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.040
So that number divided by
2 is equal to 68.95.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.640
So part 2, through linear
interpolation we get 68.95.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.670
Is that what I got?

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.580
68.95, so that is this
point right here.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:29.530
So linear interpolation is
giving us a slightly higher

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.770
estimate than our line of best
fit across all of the data.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.210
You can even eyeball it if you
look at it right there.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.990
Let's do the next one.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.720
Use a line of best fit to
estimate the life expectancy

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.370
of a person born in 1976.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.740
Once again, we can use the
equation of the line of best

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.820
fit, plug in 1976 here and
see what it gets us.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.640
We can eyeball it.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.840
1975 is there.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.790
1976 is there.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.440
It'll be right around there.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.130
Let's actually use the
actual equation.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.300
So in 1976, this is going to be
the line of best fit, the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.320
line of best fit is going to
give us, if we actually figure

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.080
out what this line value gives
us, so we get 0.2395 times

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.560
1976 minus 400.99.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.340
So 72.26 years, so it gives
us 72.26 years.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.580
So it equals 72.26.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.370
Let me make this clear here.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.280
These columns, this one right
here, is line of best fit.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.755
This one right here
is interpolation.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.450
Now they want to use linear
interpolation to estimate the

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.500
life expectancy of a person
born in 1976.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.000
So what they want us to do is
draw a line between these two

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.030
points, and then use that line,
not the whole line of

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.890
best fit, to figure out what
1976 might have been.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.310
Now before, 1955 was right in
between those two values.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.180
1976 is not right in between
those values.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.140
So let's actually figure out
the equation of this line

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:21.370
using the points, these two
points, 1970 comma 70.8, and

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.280
1980 comma 73.7.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.070
Let's figure out the slope
of that line, of

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.170
this line right here.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.060
So the slope is the change
in y over change in x.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:42.660
It's going to be 73.7
minus 70.8.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.980
That's how much we change in
the y direction, divided by

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:53.640
how much we change in the x
direction, 1980 minus 1970.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:02.380
So this is going to be equal
to 3.7 minus 0.8 is 2.9.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.515
So it's 2.9 over 10.

00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:08.420
So it's equal to 0.29.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.030
We changed 2.9 years in life
expectancy every 10 years over

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.040
that time period right there,
or 0.29 per year.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.770
Now what's the equation
of that line?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:29.780
Well we know that the point 1970
and 70.8 is on that line.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.880
So if we say the equation is y
is equal to mx plus b, we know

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:46.970
that y is equal to 70.8 when--
we know m is 0.29-- when x is

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.800
equal to, or when the year
is equal to 1970,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.830
times 1970 plus b.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.240
Now we can calculate
our y-intercept.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.385
So what is our y-intercept?

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:00.950
We'll get our calculator out.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.550
We have to subtract this
from both sides.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:13.060
So b is equal to 70.8 minus
0.29 times 1970.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.420
Let's get our calculator out.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.780
There we go.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:29.460
All right, 70.8 minus
0.29 times 1970 is

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.070
equal to minus 500.5.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.620
So this is equal to
negative 500.5.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.140
So the equation of our
interpolation line-- remember

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.920
we're just finding the equation
of this line between

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.150
1970 and 1980-- is, that
equation is y is equal to

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:57.360
0.29x minus 500.5.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.615
Now if we want to figure out
what that line, if we want to

00:10:00.615 --> 00:10:05.060
interpolate 1976, we just have
to put 1976 in there for x.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.460
So what is life expectancy
in 1976?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.230
Get our calculator out again.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:23.120
0.29 times 1976 minus 500.5
is equal to 72.54.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.200
So we get 72.54 is
what happens?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.720
It's the number we get when
we do linear interpolation

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.930
between those two data points.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.210
All we did is we figured out
the equation of the line

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.080
between those two points.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.370
Then we plugged in the number
1976 to get 72.54.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.490
That's a slightly, slightly
higher number than what the

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.920
line of best fit gave us.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.880
But it's pretty, pretty close
in either scenario.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.890
Now let's do this last part.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.340
Use the line of best fit to
estimate the life expectancy

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.960
of a person born 2012.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.540
This is what's cool about
the line of best fit.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.250
We don't have 2012 here.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.470
2012 goes off the table.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.830
But we could just keep
continuing on with this line

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.400
right here-- now I'm using the
wrong color-- keep continuing

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.320
with this line right here and
see what does this line equal

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.540
when the year is
equal to 2012?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.370
So all we have to do is put 2012
in for x and we'll get

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.640
what the line of best
fits tells us.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.840
We'll get the calculator
out again.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:36.780
So we have 0.2395
times 2012 minus

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:46.430
400.99 is equal to 80.88.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.090
So this last part, in 2012 if
you were to use a line of best

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.940
fit, the average life expectancy
in the U.S. will be

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.240
80.88 years.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.620
Anyway, hopefully you found
that to be interesting.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.550
Sometimes dealing with data
can be a little bit hairy.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.730
These aren't nice,
clean numbers.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.680
But it gives you a little sense
of why slope, and y-

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.750
intercept, and interpolation,
and fitting a line, is

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.670
actually very important to
analyzing data and coming to

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.350
conclusions from that data.
