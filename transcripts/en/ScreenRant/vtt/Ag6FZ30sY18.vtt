00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.440
Suicide Squad was one of the most anticipated
movies of all time and when fans finally got

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.050
to see it, their opinions were very divided.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.330
Some people were mad about the lack of The
Joker, others were thrilled with Margot Robbie’s

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.680
Harley Quinn and Will Smith’s Deadshot and
some people didn’t know what to think.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.859
Regardless of where you stand, Suicide Squad’s
marketing made sure that people knew about

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.509
some of the crazy stuff that was happening
during it’s production.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.920

interesting tidbits in our list of 10 Suicide

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.869
Harley and Joker Scenes
Suicide Squad was met with very divisive reviews

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.869
but one thing that pretty much everyone seemed
to agree on was that Margot Robbie was awesome

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.549
in the role of Harley Quinn.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.430
Before the release of the film, Robbie actually
revealed she and Jared Leto did not rehearse

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
prior to filming their scenes and that all
of her reactions to his insanity were genuine.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.860
This was a decision made by Robbie and director
David Ayer as they felt it would add a level

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.370
of danger and unpredictability to the Joker
and Harley relationship.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.720
It seemed to have worked well as friends were
hungry for more Joker and of course, more

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.940
Harley.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.810
Croc Story
Suicide Squad had a very big vast to deal

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.260
with and introduce and they did a pretty thorough
job of providing back-stories for all of the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.560
main Squad members.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.060
Unfortunately many of Killer Croc's backstory
scenes were removed from the final cut, including

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.350
scenes depicting his entire life as a social
outcast due to his physical appearance.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.270
These scenes also would have shown Croc crossing
paths with Batman while he worked for various

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940
crime bosses in Gotham.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.350
One interesting scene would have even shown
Croc as a sculptor, but it didn’t make it

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.530
into the final cut.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.060
The final film only gave us a small window
into Croc, which is too bad, because it seems

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.350
like he’s one interesting dude.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.600
Joker Laugh
Most of the time, if you are lucky enough

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.500
to see a professional actor in the streets,
you want to go say hi and maybe even get a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500
photo.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.840
This probably would not have been the case
if you had bumped into Jared Leto while he

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.320
was getting into character in the streets
of New York City and Toronto.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.529
Leto reportedly was working on his Joker laugh
and was walking the streets testing out different

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:20.870
types of laughs, while studying which style
made people the most uncomfortable.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.969
Joker Casting
These days fans follow the production of their

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.329
favorite movies from the moment they are announced
until they finally make it to the big screen.

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.750
Suicide Squad was no different as fans of
the series stayed informed on everything from

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.599
reshoots to casting rumors.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.400
One thing that was kept rather quiet was that
Jared Leto wasn’t actually David Ayer’s

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.670
first choice to play the clown prince of Gothan.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.400
In fact, Ryan Gosling was sought out first
for the role of The Joker.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.349
It was reported that he turned down the role
because he didn’t want to sign on to a multi-movie

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.349
contract.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.180
Jared Leto ended up in the role, and the rest
is history.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.719
Body Hair
As one of the many bizarre things Jared Leto

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.069
did to prepare for his role as the Joker,
he also decided to shave his eyebrows in an

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.719
effort to make him look more deranged.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.849
He wasn’t the only one who did this for
the movie, coincidentally, Jay Hernandez,

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.359
who played El Diablo, shaved his eyebrows
for his role since his character was designed

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.299
to have no hair on his body.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.040
This choice saved Hernandez half an hour a
day in the makeup chair.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.150
Unfortunately, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje wasn’t
so lucky as it took the makeup team five hours

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.700
for the prosthetic make-up to be applied to
his head body each time he needed to shoot

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.859
a scene.

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.829
Harley Casting
While reading the comic books in preparation

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.439
to direct the film, David Ayer had Margot
Robbie in mind for the role of Harley Quinn.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.159
This seemed like a good fit as she was just
coming off the major success of The Wolf Of

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.590
Wall Street and was beginning to shoot up
as a bankable broad.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.709
However, Warner Bros offered Emma Roberts
the role first, but she turned it down to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.549
star in Scream Queens.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.120
Some other big actresses such as Alison Brie,
Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, Emma Watson, Zooey

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.909
Deschanel and many more were also considered
for the role of Harley Quinn.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.859
Ultimately, Ayer got his way and Margot Robbie
became an amazing Harley Quinn.

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.349
Enchantress Prep
Cara Delevingne has had a very successful

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.459
modeling career and she has only lately starting
transitioning into more of an actor.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.719
David Ayer is known for taking risks with
his movies and it he actually cast Cara Delevingne

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.559
before there was an actual script for Suicide
Squad.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.680
It was reported that Ayer asked her to prepare
for her role as Enchantress by stripping naked

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.330
in the woods, preferably underneath a full
moon, and walking around in the dirt.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.479
She obliged, in the privacy of her sister’s
country home and Ayer felt that she was right

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.510
for the role.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.500
We aren’t sure if this is super creepy or
genius directing, we will let you decide.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.650
SKWAD Tatoos
The marketing around Suicide Squad made sure

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.210
to let fans knows the crew of DC criminals
really were a solid squad, but it turns out

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.800
the actors took things one step further.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.990
During the production of the film the majority
of the cast decided to get the word “SKWAD”

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.090
tattooed on them as a gesture of solidarity.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.379
While most of them got it professionally done,
some people opted to let stars Margot Robbie

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.810
and Will Smith actually give them their tats.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.550
While method acting is intense, it seems pretty
tame compared to permanently marking your

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060
body for a role like the Suicide Squad did.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.150
Footage Leak
Back in 2015, the first footage of Suicide

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.610
Squad was shown in a teaser trailer during
the Warner Bros. panel at San Diego Comic-Con.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.150
The trailer was meant to be a glorified sizzle
reel, just showing off some of the best stuff

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.460
they had shot so far and Warner Bros. has
no intention of releasing this teaser to the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460
public.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.090
Unfortunately, a low quality version was filmed
on someone’s phone and surfaced online.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.180
This put Warner Bros in a very tough spot
and they felt obligated to release the footage

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.800
in HD and call it their first official trailer.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.020
With how Suicide Squad turned out, maybe this
leak was the first indication that trouble

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.909
was a brewing.

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.729
Leto On Set
By this point it is pretty common knowledge

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.909
that Jared Leto got up to some crazy stuff
while getting in character for his role as

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:47.909
The Joker.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.960
Anyone who was on set with Leto was happy
to tell the press how uncomfortable he made

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.909
everyone feel and how he refused to break
character between scenes.

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.330
Will Smith has even stated that he feels like
he has never truly met the real Jared Leto.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.539
Leto also famously sent his cast-mates some
pretty unorthodox gifts such as a dead hog,

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.349
used condoms, creepy poems and a ton more.

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.460
This all seems like a lot of work to get into
character, but Leto is an academy award winner

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.080
so we will have to trust him!

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.639

Suicide Squad facts that you need to know!
