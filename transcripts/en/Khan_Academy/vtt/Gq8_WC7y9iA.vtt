00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.718
- [Voiceover] There is a lot
of content on Khan Academy,

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:04.084
especially in math and science,

00:00:04.084 --> 00:00:07.684
and we're continuing to add
more and more content everyday

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:09.517
in math and science and in other areas

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.117
like history and art
history and wherever else.

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:15.484
But I want to do in this
video is make sense of

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:18.484
some potential progressions,
especially in math and science.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.284
And see how all of these
different topics relate

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:23.217
to each other in ways that
we can use Khan Academy.

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:27.818
In blue here, I have a
proposed math progression.

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:30.151
So we have a mission on Khan Academy,

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.184
it's called early math, it's
also called the K-2 mission.

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:34.750
When I talk about missions, this is where

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.784
you take a diagnostic and
based on that it starts

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.384
recommending things and then
there are master challenges,

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.817
all of these game
mechanics, and you can work

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:43.051
at your own time and pace.

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.684
You can also access these,
what we call in library mode,

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:47.151
where you can just pick and choose

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:48.751
which exercises you want to practice,

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.251
or which videos or articles
you want to take a look at.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.484
What I recommend a student
do, if they haven't already,

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:59.551
master the early learning mission,

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.051
finish that all the way
to one hundred percent,

00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:02.984
then do third grade,
fourth grade, fifth grade,

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.417
sixth grade and then seventh grade.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:06.984
Once you start getting into the

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:08.585
sixth and seventh grade range,

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.318
you're starting to do a
little bit of pre-algebra.

00:01:11.318 --> 00:01:13.918
And as you see, once you
get past seventh grade,

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:16.984
a whole new world starts to open up.

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.651
So once you get past seventh
grade, you start getting into

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.517
some real algebra and my map here

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:26.518
starts to get a little more complex.

00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.517
But what you see going on here is,

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:30.017
you have an algebra basics mission,

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:33.051
and the idea of that, that's
actually a bit of a subset

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.650
of what you would see in the eighth grade

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
algebra one, algebra two missions,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.218
although there's a few
extra things relative

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:40.217
to the eighth grade mission.

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:43.917
But it's the very core of algebra,

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:46.418
and you can see that if you
were to finish that mission

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.217
all sorts of extra things open up.

00:01:49.217 --> 00:01:51.085
Now if you want to know your algebra

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:53.617
more comprehensibly, and
I encourage you to do so,

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:55.884
you should complete the
eighth grade mission,

00:01:55.884 --> 00:01:58.984
the algebra one mission and
the algebra two missions.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.351
And what you'll see is if you finish

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:02.051
the algebra basics mission,
the eighth grade mission

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.051
isn't that much incremental
work or vice versa.

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:07.250
And if you finish these
and the algebra one mission

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.884
isn't that much incremental work,

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.984
it gives you credit
for where they overlap.

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:13.051
And if you finish these
three, the algebra two mission

00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:15.184
isn't that much incremental work.

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:16.784
But if you were to do this collection,

00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:20.017
you have a really solid
foundation for algebra

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:24.767
and all sorts of things start
to become available for you.

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.584
If you're going to do the
algebra basics mission,

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:29.016
you are fairly well
equipped to start thinking

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.752
about things like finance
and capital markets,

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:35.417
microeconomics, macroeconomics.

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:37.218
If you do the algebra basics mission

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:39.151
you're also ready for biology,

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.050
a lot of biology doesn't
have mathematics in it,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.917
but there is some algebra once

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.584
you start getting in to biology.

00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:46.253
In fact there some
probability and statistics,

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.417
some basics probability and statistics

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.718
once you start getting
into things like genetics.

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:53.584
So I encourage you to have that
nice foundation in algebra.

00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:56.951
Chemistry too, there
isn't math throughout it,

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:58.384
there isn't algebra throughout it,

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:00.684
there actually is math
throughout chemistry,

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:02.484
but the algebra will help you go into,

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:05.717
you will start seeing
some types of problems

00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:06.819
where you will have to solve

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.251
a quadratic or things like that.

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:11.417
So it is useful to have a
solid foundation in algebra.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:13.283
If you want to go into physics,

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:14.717
this is where the algebra,

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:18.317
the physics on Khan Academy is
currently non-calculus based,

00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:20.317
we're going to add calculus based soon,

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:21.851
but in order to engage with it,

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.718
you have to have a very
solid foundation in algebra,

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.217
that's where this arrow comes from,

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:28.384
and you need to know the
basics of trigonometry,

00:03:28.384 --> 00:03:29.784
that's why I drew this dotted arrow.

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:34.217
You should know what a sine,
cosine, tangent of angles are,

00:03:34.217 --> 00:03:36.918
and the kind of right triangle definitions

00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:40.850
or the unit circle definitions
of those trig functions,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.152
and that's just the very
basics of trigonometry.

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:44.884
But once you know that,
the basics of algebra,

00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.517
the basics of trigonometry,

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.450
you're ready to engage in physics.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.784
And related to physics of course,

00:03:49.784 --> 00:03:53.158
and really based on physics,
is cosmology and astronomy.

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:55.017
Once again if you have
the basics of algebra,

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:59.551
you're really ready to start
engaging on that front.

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.284
What about math, well
you can just keep going.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.618
If you have the basics of algebra,

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.451
you can start going into
probability and statistics

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:07.018
which is also super foundational.

00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:08.984
If you were to go to
graduate school one day

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:10.984
or do research in almost anything,

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.518
probability and statistics is core.

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.651
Frankly, any profession that you go into

00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:19.764
there will be a lot of
probability and statistics.

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:24.217
We can keep going, geometry is neat area,

00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:28.295
is a neat subject because
not only will you be

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:31.451
studying things we traditionally
associate with geometry,

00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:35.550
but it's really the first
domain that you will see where

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.017
you're going to think about
proofing things rigorously.

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:43.188
So once you get this good
foundation in algebra and geometry

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:46.451
you're ready to really
dive into trigonometry,

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.051
and once you have all of that built out

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:49.950
you can go to calculus.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.684
Which will you find fascinating,

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:54.584
which opens up the world
up multi variable calculus,

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:57.151
differential equations and linear algebra

00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.650
is typically taken when you're
in college after calculus.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.918
But really to engage in linear algebra

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.518
you need a solid foundation in algebra

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:09.351
and a bit of foundation in trigonometry.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.751
So I encourage you to
go on that progression.

00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:14.318
Now we also see things like SAT,

00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:16.650
of course the standardized test,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.284
that's a big part of college admissions.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:22.251
And I encourage you to
engage on the test prep

00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:24.350
for the SAT on Khan Academy that

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.652
we do in conjunction
with the college board.

00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:30.250
Not just because it will
hopefully improve your SAT score,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.617
but the SAT is a measure
of college readiness.

00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:35.484
So the better that you're
able to do on this,

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:38.817
this is a solid indicator
of your college readiness.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:41.584
You can really start to
engage on that SAT practice

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:44.451
as soon as you have a solid
foundation of the algebra.

00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:47.217
So as soon as you have the
algebra basics mission done,

00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:49.417
I encourage you to go
into the SAT mission.

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:52.817
To really engage in
everything on the SAT mission,

00:05:52.817 --> 00:05:57.084
especially on the math
side or the SAT prep,

00:05:57.084 --> 00:05:59.551
I encourage you to also
get through the algebra two

00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:02.407
because there are going
to be some functions

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:05.250
and the other pieces here
that I haven't talked about.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.686
Here are the programming,
and you can start programming

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.618
on Khan Academy for those
of you who haven't seen it

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:12.884
it's a lot of fun, you
get to work on projects

00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:14.117
and share it with your friends,

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:16.218
and there's even a peer review mechanism.

00:06:16.218 --> 00:06:18.051
You can start engaging with
that at a fairly early level.

00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.684
Once you have some of
your core arithmetic done,

00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:23.351
but obviously the more math
you have behind you the better.

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:27.985
But then once you get through
some of these core subjects

00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:31.251
that we've been talking about,
especially basic algebra,

00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.617
the very basics of trigonometry then

00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:35.684
you can start going into
advanced JavaScript.

00:06:35.684 --> 00:06:37.351
And algorithms.

00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:39.651
Advanced JavaScript
you'll especially enjoy

00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.251
because here you can do
simulations of nature,

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:44.351
simulations of some of
the things you will learn

00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:45.884
in these science topics.

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:49.250
Or you can really start
to make video games.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.451
Hopefully this gives you a
good sense of what's available,

00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:54.018
especially on the math,
science side of Khan Academy.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.117
And in a way that you
can progress through it.

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:58.934
And if you really, all of these things,

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:00.468
the things in blue from early math

00:07:00.468 --> 00:07:03.817
all the way through calculus,
there are missions for.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.984
So all of this stuff right over here,

00:07:06.984 --> 00:07:08.584
there's these missions for which are these

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.084
interactive, give you as
many exercises as you need,

00:07:11.084 --> 00:07:12.684
all of these game mechanics,

00:07:12.684 --> 00:07:16.050
SAT also has an interactive tool for,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.717
but the things where we
don't have missions yet,

00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:21.251
I encourage you to go through the videos,

00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:23.550
go one by one, if I'm going to go work,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.084
or whoever in the video who
is doing a work example,

00:07:26.084 --> 00:07:28.517
try to pause the video and see
if you can do it on your own.

00:07:28.517 --> 00:07:32.218
If you see me do it, look at
the video then stop the video

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.152
and try to do that work over again,

00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:36.884
do the exercises there, I
think you'll be surprised

00:07:36.884 --> 00:07:38.784
by how much you can actually learn.

00:07:38.784 --> 00:07:40.317
We get a lot of testimonials every day,

00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:42.118
from people all walks of life

00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:44.017
who thought that they
weren't good at math,

00:07:44.017 --> 00:07:45.717
or who thought they
weren't good at science,

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:47.584
but when they worked step by step,

00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:48.951
they build their foundations,

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.184
they go back to any gaps
that they might have,

00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:53.550
over and over again people are surprised

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.117
by how much they are
actually able to progress.

00:07:56.117 --> 00:07:58.218
And just as a reminder, this
isn't all the content on

00:07:58.218 --> 00:08:02.051
Khan Academy, we have some
great content on the humanities,

00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:04.018
history, art history, we're adding

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:05.851
a whole set of partner content,

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:07.817
and we're working on a
whole bunch of things

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:10.000
as we speak, so enjoy.
