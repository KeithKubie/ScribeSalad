00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.109
Now here's a bit of a complex question. If a quadratic equation does not have 0

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.204
solutions with an imaginary component, how many solutions with an imaginary

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:12.354
component does it have? Think really carefully about this. In fact, you might

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:16.514
want to think about the quadratic formula and what kinds of solutions it gives

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:19.150
us, and how those solutions relate to on another.
