00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.694
Hi.

00:00:01.694 --> 00:00:04.110
My name is Marc Wandschneider,
and I'm a software engineer

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.304
here at Google.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.220
I'd like to take a moment
to talk to you today

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.430
about using the Nearby
Messages API and beacons.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.450
Nearby Messages is a new
API that enables your device

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.480
to react to nearby objects
and microlocations,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.360
such as bus stops,
train platforms,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.560
or even indoor locations
such as exhibits in a museum.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.090
It makes use of a whole
host of technologies,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.690
including Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, audio,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.880
and most interestingly
for us today,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.560
Bluetooth beacons
powered by Eddystone.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.070
Now, for more information on
the whole beacon platform,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.050
check out our video
Developing with Beacons.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
However, here are a
few quick reminders.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.660
This is a beacon, as is
this, as is this, this,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.330
and all of these.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.090
In the most simple
of terms, beacons

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.370
are little Bluetooth
Low Energy, or BLE,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.620
devices that sit around yelling
loudly-- well, if radio waves

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.840
could yell-- that they're here.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.000
And that's it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.720
There's just this little
guy saying I'm beacon 12345,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.510
and this one saying
I'm beacon 54321.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.470
There's typically a
little battery in them,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.180
and they'll broadcast that
information one to ten times

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.610
a second.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.120
Now your mobile phone,
or tablet, or laptop,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.700
if it chooses, can
scan for these devices

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.340
and use whatever it knows about
those beacons when it sees one.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.670
And that's the catch.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.720
Beacon 12345 isn't necessarily
super interesting by itself.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.750
It's far more interesting,
or far more useful,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.850
if I know that beacon 12345 is
sitting on my desk in London

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.540
on Buckingham Palace road.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.090
But BLE devices can't
really communicate

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.650
that much information.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.729
Again, all they can really do
is say, hi, I'm beacon 246810.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.680
To get past this, we have to
register some data to associate

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.540
or store with this beacon
so that when we see it,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.490
we can fetch the data
associated with it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.130
and use it for whatever we want,
like identifying our bus stop.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.930
Not unexpectedly, since I'm
up here recording this video,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.720
we have a solution
that does exactly

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.190
this: the Nearby Messages API.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.940
Once it sees a
beacon and determines

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.410
that it's one of yours, it
will fetch the data for it

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.320
and return that
information to your app.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.930
Let's look at how that works.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.690
First, we have a beacon sitting
around announcing its presence

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.420
to, well, anybody
who's listening.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.360
Next you walk past with your
mobile device running an app

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
using Nearby Messages,
and it sees that beacon.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.160
Nearby Messages then
goes to the server

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.430
to see if it knows
about that beacon,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
and any information about
that is returned to your app.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.470
If the beacon is
one you know about,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.880
the app can start to
use that information.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.330
Getting started with
the Nearby Messages API

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.800
and your beacons does
have a few steps,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.120
but fortunately they're
all pretty straightforward.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.610
So we'll walk through those now.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.190
First, you need some beacons.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.510
Eddystone is an open
format, and anybody

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.490
can support in their
beacon hardware,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.100
so you have lots of choices when
you choose from whom to buy.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.620
Make sure the ones
you're purchasing

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.302
support the Eddystone format
for maximal interoperability.

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:36.760
And then you can
work with a vendor

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.430
to address other things,
like battery life, weather

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.680
conditions, and
broadcast frequency.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.100
Second, provision and
register the beacons.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.170
This will be a combination
of using the beacon

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.320
vendors provisioning
applications to activate

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.400
the beacon and configure
just how often it broadcasts

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.310
and at what signal strength.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.510
And then you'll need to register
some data with the Proximity

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.120
Beacon API for that beacon.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.540
This register data is
what the Nearby Messages

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.130
API will return to you when
it sees one of your beacons.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.090
To help you use the Proximity
Beacon API to register data

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.260
for your beacons, there's a
website with documentation

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.980
as well as a GitHub
repository with a sample app

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.160
to show you how it's done.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.010
Finally, you integrate
the Nearby Messages API

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.650
into your application to start
looking for those beacons

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.950
that you provisioned
and registered.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.940
This is known as subscribing
to messages for those beacons.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.300
So on Android you'll set up the
subscription for those messages

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.440
by using the
message filter class

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.980
and adding Eddystone
device filters.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.100
This message filter forms part
of your subscription options

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.360
that you then pass to
nearby .messages .subscribe.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.480
For iOS it's going
to be quite similar.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.570
You'll be working with a DNS
strategy object and telling it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.020
you want beacon messages.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.580
And then you set up the
subscription to those messages.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.310
But really, rather
than bore you to death

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.560
here with screenshots
of IDEs, and websites,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.910
and documentation,
and code, I'm going

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.210
to point you at the
excellent Getting Started

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.400
page, along with samples
and other documentation,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.430
for the Nearby Messages API.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.590
Using Nearby Messages
together with beacons

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.440
allows you to open up a
whole new world of context

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.510
sensitivity in your apps.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.270
Let's take a quick
look at some of places

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.370
you can go for more
information about what

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.420
I've talked about today.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.330
For information
on using beacons,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.630
such as Eddystones
in general, visit

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.340
developers.google.com/beacons.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.020
For nearby and the
Nearby Messages API,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.450
visit
developers.android.com/nearby

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.400
and developers.andro
id.com/nearby/messages.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.230
Now, for the registering data
part of working with beacons,

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.980
you'll use the Proxy Beacon
API, and you can get more

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.520
information at developers.googl
e.com/beacons/proximity as well

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.380
as checking out our
GitHub repository

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.887
at github.com/google/eddystone.

00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:13.470
We've got a bunch
of sample apps there

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.030
that have both iOS and Android
versions for maximal choice

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.470
and will hopefully
get you started

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.560
doing a lot of cool things.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.750
So I hope this
video has helped you

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.590
learn how to go about
using the Nearby Messages

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.410
API, along with your
beacons, and pointed you

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.770
in the right direction.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.220
I certainly had fun making it.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.010
