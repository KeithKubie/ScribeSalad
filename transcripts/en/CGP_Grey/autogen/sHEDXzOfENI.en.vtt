00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.750
 In the US, the president is elected by the "Electoral College," with 538 votes distributed 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 about the population (for the most part) of the 50 States and Washington DC To become president, you have to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.520
 get the majority of the votes. But 538 is an even number, so what happens if there is one 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.350
 of a draw? 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.699
 No worries, there is an 18th century solution to this problem: If there is a tie at the 'Electoral College' 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.710
 then the House of Representative breaks the tie. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.029
 As the name implies, the House is represented with delegates from every state. How 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.390
 The more residents a state has, the more delegates it has with a total of 435 - thankfully 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 an odd number and therefore the possibility to break the tie. however, there is a snag: every delegate 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.770
 does not get one vote, but every * State * gets one vote. So the 27 delegates from Florida 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.030
 must mutually determine who they support before they cast Florida's vote 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 trying to break the tie. 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 In the meantime, the only delegates from sparsely populated Alaska only need to consult themselves 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.489
 before he casts Alaska's vote. 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.109
 This is an incredibly disproportionate system because only ten states, California, Texas, 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.360
 New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.030
 houses more than half of the American population but only receives 20% of the votes 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.470
 if there is a tie in the race for the presidency and the other 40 states with less than half the population 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.290
 gets 80% of the votes. 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 Although an exact draw is unlikely, this system is also used if there are more than two candidates 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.080
 to become president and none of them gets the majority in the 'Electoral College'. 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.400
 What exactly happened when there were four candidates in 1824. Andrew Jackson 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.490
 got the most votes from the Americans and in the 'Electoral College', but none 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.829
 majority, so the result was then determined by the House of Representatives who voted as states 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.310
 and chose John Quiny Adams instead. 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.590
 In today's America with more states, a race with three candidates would give terribly disproportionate results. 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.149
 Suppose there is a third (smaller) candidate who really likes the smaller states 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850
 and the smaller states love him mutually. 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.060
 He gets the least votes in the 'Electoral College', but enough to be sure that neither one of them 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.229
 more popular candidates get a majority so the House of Representatives must choose a winner - and the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.140
 26 smallest states representing only 17% of the population can appoint 'their' candidate as president 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.869
 Although 83% of Americans did not vote for him. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.250
 It is unlikely, but it should not even be possible. 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 Anyway, because of all this talk about presidents, we have not yet mentioned the Vice President: a rational 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.650
 person assumes that this is chosen together with the President, but no. 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.440
 When there is a tie, the * Senate * independently chooses the Vice President leaving the US 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.739
 can get a President from one party and a Vice President from the other party, 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.569
 Which may cause very uncomfortable encounters. 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.590
 But even this insane system to resolve draw is not watertight because there 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 100 members are in the Senate and the House of Representatives is obliged to vote as 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.060
 50 states, and many of those states have 10 or 8 delegates representing the entire system 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.290
 as leaky as a basket (due to the frequent occurrence of a draw), thanks to all even numbers. 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.660
 So if the House of Representatives cannot elect a President but the Senate can choose a Vice President 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 the Vice-President acts when the President has been able to make a choice to the House of Representatives. But 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.550
 If neither the House of Representatives can elect a President nor the Senate a Vice President 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.230
 then the president of the House of Representatives becomes president until one part of Congress elects * someone *. 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.950
 So this is the system by which the US resolves a draw in the race for the presidency, 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.950
 despite the fact that it may be faster (a fairer) to just throw a coin in. 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.459
 Of course you could get rid of the 'Electoral College, and therefore this insane system 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.180
 and instead hold national elections, perhaps even with something chic like preferential votes 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.980
 but that's just a crazy idea.
