Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Man da. Um, April 4th, 2016. How's it going? How, why? Yeah. I am an Ottawa, Canada right now. Oh, can uh, uh, it's fucking freezing here. Every time I come, I know Australia's Dick Together. Um, yeah, we came, we did fucking, um, almost said Wichita. I don't know what the fuck. Damn Police Windsor. If we did Windsor, me Versie and fucking Joey be Joe Barton. We did a Windsor the first day. Not even know what day that is yet. Friday we did it on Friday and um, I brought this little fucking bitchy coat. Yup. Nia calls it the Kleenex coat. It's just a saline. All those little ones. Babylon in the 70s, when they had the big puffy coats, well, they're still making the puffy coats to not just like Dylan Little ones, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       They look like little, uh, you know, like you, you're a rib shack in the open a little think and then giving a little morsel. Talent looks like there's a bunch of those sewn into the code. You know that. Thank you know what the fuck coat I'm talking about when I was a little north north face numbers. So it got down in a hoodie because they looked at the fucking forecast and it said that um, you know, it's going to be like 50 degrees and that coach good down to 40 site. Donna was fine. I was fine. I was snuggling a little bug in the rug with first. Was it two days?

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Well now was I the second day?

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Oh the second day I was at Casino Rama. That's right. And that's when it started the snow and that's when I started questioning my, my jacket game is the young kids say my jacket game was not on point. However, by the way, I didn't bring any of my fucking podcast equipment because you know this trip is a mother fucker. All right. This is one of these, it's known in my businesses is thrash. All right. Sometimes you go on the road, it's a fucking cake walk. All right. Whatever the fuck that means. What is a cake walk? I know. I've never even looked that up. Is there a certain kind of way you walk when you fucking carrying a cake? Maybe that's what it is. Sorry if I'm fucking, the levels are too high year. Just trying to talk to him. I recorded like a microphone. Um, that's going to be my guess.

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       Is that when you have a fucking kick, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       If you have a cake, you're going to be walking a little gingerly. No offense to me, right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       So you walk a little lately with it. Maybe you know what you're walking like you walking like Paul Versey when he puts on his fucking Jordan fours for the first time, you should have seen him walking down the casino. He was walking like on his heels because he didn't want to create some, I gotta tell you something. I don't fucking understand. People who fucking stand in line and then stab each other over a fucking pair of sneakers. I just really, dude, did you see the gut to new Jordans? Three's arou dude, that fucking crazy. The new Jordan trees are fucking crazy. I swear to God, they all look like nurse shoes to me. Big Stupid, bulky look and fuck it takes, I think I have a pair of Jordan ones. I like the colors. I never liked those fucking things either. When they came out and they were red and black, I thought those were the ugliest fucking things ever. I told you before, I'm, I'm part of the back in the day. I like those Bruce Jenner. Um, the cattle on shoes, you know, just simple pair with fucking three stripes on the side. I was cool with sneakers right through towards the end of the eighties when they started having like the fucking Bo Jackson, the neon Deon fucking whatever that neon green and neon pink, those fucking sunglasses to second and went into that shit. Those pastel colors and the stupid fucking Reebok pump. Oh, maybe if I put some more air in my sneakers, I won't have white guy legs.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       The Reebok pumps were, we're as stupid is Batman versus Superman there. Alright. Okay Shirley, here we go with this cake walk. Surely you've heard the term cakewalk. Did somebody write a whole fucking article on this?

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:45       Good Lord. Cut to the fucking chase. All right. I'll read this as fast as I can. Surely you've heard the term cakewalk used to describe some sort of challenge or task that is reckoned to be pitifully easy. Surely you have, will you stop saying that? Stop calling me. Surely. Surely you have. Please. Please don't lie. Good Lord. Who fucking wrote this?

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       The figurative definition has been around since the early 19th century. As long as the literal one, in fact it appeared in print, but did you know that the term is actually pretty racist, racist, racist, racist. I'll bet you didn't. What the fuck is wrong with this idiot who this is such a classic, you know, if you actually had to get a real job writing, you wouldn't have one. You know, everybody on the Internet fancies themselves like there's some sort of journalist, you know when they're writing, this is just no, you just fucking write it on a w.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       It's like acting in a web series

Speaker 1:          00:05:51       and you're upset. You didn't get nominated for a fucking Oscar. Um, nor did I. Okay. Did you, it was pretty racist. Um, I bet you didn't. What? Because you don't know some shit and that means everybody else doesn't you fucking cunt. I mean, I didn't know it, but I'm a moron. I really don't like this person. Uh, he said, nor did I. Okay. That's the first humble thing. This person said, maybe you can come around. Maybe I was wrong. I still don't think I could drive cross country with this person. Um, nor did I until I looked into the origin of the term and found out it had roots in the,

Speaker 2:          00:06:26       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       I don't know how to say this word. Antebellum south of the early 19th century. Can you just tell me what the fuck it means? How it started during this era of firmly entrenched slavery in the states, the cake walk was a dance event where slaves were invited to dress up in the fine clothes and took on the heirs of the white aristocracy. Oh, so this is like when the Wayans brothers did white chicks. What are they doing? Is this like the first def jam comedy? They started doing the white guy voice. I said, get out in the field to do the work that I should be doing. And everybody starts flipping out, dying, laughing. The next wave coming to the stage. Um, all right. They were held in the plantation home and the same rooms where the risks, splendid balls were held among whites of society.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       Oh my God. How much did those people fucking stink back then? Putting on all those extra layers of clothes? No such thing as deodorant. Right. Just joined you. That's one of those things where you're wash yourself in the same fucking trough. The goddamn horses drank out of the cakewalk was similar. It was a ball held for the slaves. Oh, so this is a Christmas party. I didn't know they did that. I didn't see that in roots. You know, it wasn't all bad. Every once in awhile they had like a company party after 364 and a half days of absolute horror than they would. They let them in the house. Yeah. Hey, sorry about all that other shit. Uh, would you like some pumpernickel wife just made it, oh, let's get them out of the house. Uh, they seem to be a little restless. That's fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Oh, what an ugly period. Um, the cake, like, you know, like it's not, I'm prepared now, but you know, it's less ugly. All right, let's continue. Okay. The cake walk was similar. It was a bald ball held for the slaves. Couples promoted, promulgated, sorry, through the ballroom, bowing deeply and frequently. Chins and noses held highly a loft. If you're going to tell me, they finally gave him a fucking party and they still were assholes about it. The couple who performed the best interpretation of how the white folks did it want a cake baked one imagines by a slave. I, I didn't imagine that stuff. Words in my mouth. I would figure the white people after all that fucking time. But yeah, I mean, you know what, uh, consider we ruined their fucking lives. I think we can make them a cake once a year, but we're only given it to one of them. Jesus crave time. You think you've found the depths of how evil that shit was. He, you find another layer. True. Oh my God. Another layer. Just like a cake. Jesus. I'm an artist this morning. All right. The cake walk looks similar, but it was also very different. It's intent was to emulate white society in order to market or the Jesus, there's a dangerous fucking gave me, I told you this is like the first def jam comedy and much the same way as

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Oh Jesus Christ. Saturnalia the ancient Rome winters solstice festival. Oh yeah, exactly. Watching the same fucking way, uh, where the rules of some of social order were turned upside down in the slaves and laborers became the rulers and Matt and masters attended attend their servants. Oh they did this in Rome.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       this is just all fucking weird. Can you imagine the tension during that? So then the master's fucking tended to the slaves and you know, the slaves wanted to be just as fucking mean. But then they were like, well we got to kind of aggregate around this shit cause it goes back to the regular way tomorrow. And then I would think the master be like, alright, you want me to wade into that sea of hatred towards me? Um, uh, just keep an eye on me. Please stay tight. Okay. Bye. A itch the left side of my nose, that means a, I'm fearing for my life. Uh, the slaves involved did indeed mark the ridiculously refined customs of the aristocracy. Yes. And they surely meant it. But during the cakewalk,

Speaker 2:          00:10:52       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       they were allowed to mock them. And by ruling over even the very event that should undermine his authority, the plantation owners, it to assert is at 30. You know something? I was in such a fucking good mood. I hate this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       it's a fucking cake walk while you know what I already clicked off. So how does that mean? It's easy. What does that mean? It's, it's a cheap laugh and all I got to go back. I gotta I just closed the fucking window. I've got to go back and,

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       so how the fuck did that become? That does not sound easy to me. Being a slave all year and then doing one. Do you get to do one fucking day where you get to make fun of this? The master? It's not a cakewalk and struck a difficult. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       All right. As if its roots in slavery don't make the cakewalk racially charged enough. It transitioned in the minstrel show.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       How did it transition into meaning something easy of the Jim Crow era or even are even worse? Um, God was even the power. A lot of to the slaves too by the mark and just have the original cakewalk in stage. Reproductions of balls of the balls. White performers in black face performed as blacks who made sincere clumsy attempts at emulating whites out of a desire to be like them, not to undermine them. Ah, okay. And then it became that. I still don't understand why it's easy. The original cakewalk walks being local affairs. How that, you know what? Fuck the fucking Internet. Yeah. All right. Can I fast forward to this?

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       Oh God. He used the word apparently.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       There's no other word. Alternative comics like to use more than that apparently. All right. Clumsy attempt. So I thought the original cake walks for being local affairs held in the confines of the set southern plantation, the minstrel shows traveling as a matter of course, it was later interpretation. They became just find the concepts of the rest of the country in the world. And what you could describe perhaps a deep desire to stop being so incredibly racist, American societies of all the banner, the racial basis of the cakewalk in favor of, it's simply describing something so easy that just walking could yield the reward of a cake. There. It is. The definition is still vaguely racist.

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       It isn't racist if you think the definition means it's going to be easy. You're not even being remotely vaguely racist. You just don't know the history,

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       Yeah. Jesus Christ. All right, well there's that was fucking depressing. Um, well, fortunately I'm up here in Canada where, you know, they have all the angelic white people according to Michael Morrison, you know, up here, they're all a bunch of angels that nobody has to lock the doors. Uh, what's your costs? We don't, that's true. Just generally speaking, people don't get along with one another. Um, all right, so that was an excruciating 15 minutes. I don't know how you guys enjoyed it. So anyways, kind of fuck, did I get onto that shit? Oh, because yeah, I taught the whole, um, I thought the, uh, I taught this whole trip was going to be a muffin dance about that. Can I say something like that and say, ah, that was going to be a little muffin dance. Did you know that? The origins of Moffat dance.

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       Um, you actually are pro domestic violence. I bet you didn't. Surely you've heard the term muffin dance before. Please, please, please don't tell me you have not.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       The origin of Muffin dance comes from the early 19 hundreds when women, when they asked can we vote to, were forced to show their clams and dance out of the voting booths as people through desserts at the, uh, this became known as the muffin dance because clam indicated that their pussy stunk and turn men off. Later in 1929, the great, great grandson of Abraham Lincoln said, I cannot tell a lie. Some of these bitches clamps to stink, but there's still reason to make them do a muffin. Dads, they should be allowed to vote to, and all the guys said, yeah, you know what? You're right. And everybody had muffins. So next time you use the term muffin dance, just know that you're being vaguely sexist. Um, okay. All right. I'm sorry. Why am I doing this? Why am I talking like this? Why of why am I sitting here in this fucking freezing cold hotel room? I can't find where the fucking heat is. I'm saying in one of these um, red rum. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       Well just one of those, you know, I like old shit to a point, you know, I like, I thought I liked having an old house until I fucking had to deal with it. Oh, all the bullshit of how on in an old house, old hotels, I kind of like, I loved the lobbies, but the second you fucking go up to your room, you start walking down the hall. You know, you feel like you should be riding a big wheel and you're going to come around the corner and those too creepy fucking chicks are going to be standing there.

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       God Damn it. That fucking movie freaked me out. That would be still got, it's still disturbing. That's just a disturbance fucking movie, you know. And it's not the fact that he goes completely fucking insane. It's just as a comedian watching the man's suffering through writer's block like that, and having that woman coming up who's face is shaped like a fucking parking meter, asking you how it's going every fucking 20 minutes. I love how they blame the fucking hotel rather than that, you know? What would you say she means? Well, yeah, they just were a bad couple. I think that that's what it was. And when they were down in society, they could go to events and they could sort of watered down. They're awful relationship by interacting with others. And then once they just got, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       let's say would just stand there at the fucking hotel, you know, for the whole goddamn winter. I don't understand why they had to be there to watch it. You know what I mean? Like what do you, what are you going to be doing up there? I mean it's, it's some, it's the level with which said, it's gonna fucking snow. No asshole. He's going to go up there and vandalize the place if they come there because they need shelter. It was really no reason

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       for it, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:17:54       And that was also a vaguely racist movie, wasn't it? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       Saying that reverse racist, that white people will be like, oh yeah. Oh the fucking snow's 50 feet in the fucking air. Oh yeah, I got to write a book. Yeah. Why don't I fuck it. Go up there. Y'All hang out there and I'll, I'll do my own room service every fucking day. I'll stay in room fucking 706 in everyday. I'll take a fucking elevator all the way downstairs to the kitchen. How, who the fuck would sign up for that free? You didn't have any separately for

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       I'm just fucking with you. I think it's a great movie. I'm just in a grumpy goddamn moved cause today I get to drive from fucking Ottawa all the way up to Sudbury. And then right after this show I got my travels all fucked up. I drive over to fuck Detroit, which is like a fucking eight hour drive. You know, it takes me back to the days when I was doing college kicks and I remember one time I had this gig in the upper peninsula of Michigan, right. Some fucking town up there. The began with an h. All right, so like an asshole. I'm like, all right, I'm in Michigan and I didn't look on the map to see where, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       okay

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       to see where, you know, basically the fucking college was at and I just, I just flew right into fucking Detroit and then I realized that the upper peninsula as actually it's sort of, you know, it's the Dick of Wisconsin. I should have flown into fucking Milwaukee and driven up, but I didn't, I flew into Detroit and I had to go drive all the way all up the whole fucking state. It was pretty cool cause I got to drive over to whatever bridge that is, the MACKINAC bridge or whatever the fuck it is. I'm trying to look it up right now, but I can't remember the name of the fucking, I think it was Marquette. Oh, you said it began with an age maybe. I was thinking Lake Huron. I think it was in Marquette. I did a fucking gig up there. Yeah. And I had like a, I forget what time my flight was, but I had to basically, it was an early morning flight in Detroit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       It was like a fucking eight hour drive or some shit, seven hour drive. And the show didn't start till nine I was done at 10 o'clock and I'd like a six or 7:00 AM flight. I can't remember. And I just, I was just like, you know, all right. Goodnight everybody. And I jumped in my fucking car and just drove like a fucking lunatic after already having done the drive, drove all the way back, just like nodding off. Almost falling asleep is one of the dumbest things I ever did just to save like the fucking $50 change for you or some shit like that. So you would think that I would learn from that. Not all freckles, but this time we actually have a, again like Barnett and you to help me with the fucking drive. Oh my God, Dude. Sudbury is,

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Yeah. It's as high up as fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       The upper peninsula. Michigan. What a fucking ass off for some reason they're going. Yeah, there's no really no airports around here. I don't know why we didn't just take a couple of puddle jumper so I have no fucking, oh, I know why. I know why. Initially I was picking up a rental car in Detroit and I was going to drive this whole thing and then at the last second they like, you know, it's a pretty long fucking drive. So I said I will fly most of it and then we'll do the thing, you know, then we'll get the rental car, I'll get the rental car and fucking Ottawa, blah blah blah. We'll do it one way. But then I was still leaving out of Detroit. This is so fucking stupid. Oh this is going to suck. But anyways, what will be, because tonight I'm playing a, a small like a hockey arena and a, I was going to be great.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       Ask Him fucking good time. I played one of those last night here in Ottawa, Yellow Silk Center, whatever the fuck it was called. Uh, anyways, this isn't what the fuck I wanted to talk about. I have something else I want, I want to talk about. I gotta read the fucking advertising here. I know this podcast is all over the place. Okay. I can't say it's a fucking cake walk anymore. Can't say a cake walk anymore because now I know it's fucking racist. All right, well actually I go, I can't say it to you guys, but I could say it somewhere else. You know who's kidding? Who I'm going to say I'm going to say it cause I've been saying it my whole fucking life. You know, it's just going to cut that. That's how you've looked at how you become an old person. Where someone's going like grandpa.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       Do you know the origin of that? Oh, shut up your first year. Freshman. All right. Fucking concept. Been around 80 years. Stop breaking my balls. If I'm going to say 23 Skidoo Goddamn. And I've got to say you do you want me to cue you almost kill your fucking grandfather. Tried to get them to stop saying something. All right, let me, let me get to the uh, advertising here. Oh yeah, we go, oh, the old trunk club. Trunk Club. Everybody. Do you hate going to the mall? Sure. We all do. You surely you've been to a mall. Surely you're not going to sit there and say you haven't. Um, trunk club shopping takes forever and no one has time for it. Well, people who enjoy it too, they live for it. Let's go shopping. Eagle is fucking dopes. It just go down and they would sit there and look at outfits, you know, never once putting their ear up to the shirt and hearing the crying child that's sewed it together. You know, throwing out their old fucking clothes just end up in the ocean or in some hipsters back who pretends he had the job you had. Right. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       shopping. You know, I used to always drop off clothes at goodwill. Who's kidding? Who I still do. And I thought it went to fucking homeless people and it doesn't, it just goes right on their racks and they've turned around and they sell them, which makes me feel good knowing that they don't end up in a goddamn ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       I anyways, and now it's spring. So you need pastel polos and boat shoes. Right. And it'd be nice to have your own personal stylist too. I think that it has to be a joke. Nobody needs pastel polos and boat shoes. I think that those should only be for the upper 1% of this country. You know what I mean? It's for the Robert Baron's in their date rape his children, you know, and they can walk around and what'd be great is you make an exclusive for them. So they'll feel like, oh, look at us. We are a cut above. It'll be like a status symbol. But really what it is is it's a warning for anyone that dates their children.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       You know what I mean? It was set out, have aware wearing the scarlet a, that euro whore. You just have those pastel colors.

That's a level of freedom that I, I've never heard, I've never felt, you know, I live in the city where there's noise ordinances, you know, which basically noise on my property should not carry over. Like you can basically call the cops if somebody splash around that pool too loud. He's marketing the fact I don't have one. Um, the cops go over there and he just started beating people, right? Or air quote, getting the situation under control. Um, Christ, what the fuck was I just talking about? Oh yeah. Riding around, you know, so I watched this, this new thing that they do, they take this some sort of explosives and they put it in these old cars and then hopefully they stand far enough away and the fucking thing blows up. Well this fucking guy, right? Redneck blows. Look at this shit right here it goes. Redneck blows himself up, blows up house, blows himself up in a bonfire, blows up pigs almost blows his head off.

Now they're getting rid of it. They're blowing them up. So they put this Tanner right over the fuck you said it's just explosive and there's some sort of formula like basically forever, forever. You such and such amount, you need to be like a hundred feet back. All right, so let's say whatever, what it will just say this guys, if he's got a handful of this fucking Tanner out, God, we're doing math now, Bill. All right.

I mean, what am I, he's got gotta tell that story for the rest of, at what point does that, can he laugh along with everybody else? You know, I bet he's considered like a tragic, tragic figure now in the redneck community. You know, like he'll probably, you know, at the next cross burning the, they let him late it, he hobbles up and everybody gives him a round of applies. Like they're all fucking sad. Like what happened to him with some sort of a terrorist act rather than self imposed fucking stupidity. Jesus Christ. You know, I feel bad for the guy, but

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       the tour year. So the first, the first day we were in Windsor, right across from Detroit and um, it was awesome. Our upstairs is great hotel and you could look right across the, uh, what are the fucker was, I guess it is in Lake Eerie, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:37       Is it just a river?

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       I dunno what the fuck you call it. Is it a sound? Oh, the Detroit river. And you see beautiful downtown Detroit and Detroit never looks more beautiful when you're not in Detroit. When you crossed the fucking river looking at it from Windsor. And I just kept asking a bunch of people like, cause I'm going to invest, I'm going to buy something in Detroit. I'm going to do it. God dammit. You know, invest back in America. I think I totally believe in that city. I know it's going to come back. And I was asking people where to fucking invest and they would just all laugh. And you're like about 40 miles north. Like nobody believes in it, which is what's making me want to fucking buy. They're even more, you know, it's fucking dirt. Goddamn cheap. It's going to come back at some point and it has to come back. Sit right there on the river. I know the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers guy bought up a bunch of fucking skyscrapers there has gotta you know, he put like the people from Google and one of them, I have no idea, but the shit is so cheap there. I don't, I don't get how you fucking loose. And I like the idea. You go in there, right? You fixed the fucking place up that you buy and then you don't kick the people out that live in there. And then they got a nice place to live.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       Right, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       Maybe that gets them in a better mood. Slowly but surely you just start turning it around. I think any American, right, what we should do with these fucking cities, cause God knows the government's not going to do anything. I don't think they can because it bitches to the fucking Federal Reserve bankers. Right. I don't have any fucking money. They're robbing Peter to pay Paul. So I think with whatever money they let us keep, we ought to just don't fucking, you know, fine up some shit and Detroit, turn it around, don't kick the people out,

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       get it. Go on and get,

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       maybe then they can start making American cars right again.

Speaker 2:          00:38:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       Start fucking with the Audis. And it's a fucking travesty that we don't really have anything they can fuck with those cars. The fact that they're going to allegate around the base level Cadillac, the base level, Lincoln continental, all right, are going to pale in comparison to what those maniacs in Germany are doing. I mean, I don't understand why, you know, you know, we can fucking do it. I guess Buicks are selling like fucking hotcakes. Is that a racist? It's a racist thing. Anything we'd cakes in that I think is racist. Hotcakes. Uh, back in the day when they were actually every 10 years, let us slave of a birthday, one of the things the slave owners would do was actually heat up the cake so we would burn and burn their mouths because they were that evil. Here's another chapter of white evil that you didn't know existed.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Um, selling like hotcakes. I guess high kicks were pancakes back in the day and you know, God damn well, you know, having pancakes must've been a fucking tree. Cause I remember back when you read The Times, Sawyer book, right? Uncle Barry Fen is fucking kids paint a fence just to get an apple. Like that was considered like a treat because all day long you would just sitting around eating fucking, I don't know if she went on shrubs, I don't know what the fuck you doin. So anyways, I'm, I want to buy there, man. I want to buy something there and uh, not become the fucking evil person that boots the people out that are in their need is fixed the fucking place up. It gives a shit, you know, that's of course the people in there than fuck the whole place. Something I would be upset, you know how much that plastic because it was trying to do something nice.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Um, whatever. Eventually I'm going to look into that. Um, so we did wait Wednesday and uh, we had a great time and Rosie was there. So of course I smoked a cigar. So, you know, you know, I only do two cigars a month now. So last month I only smoked one. February I had two and a half because we started to smoke one and it wasn't smoking well and we have got halfway through and like this fucking cigar sucks. So actually smoked two and a half. So I smoked two in January. I flicked it fucking rain man right now. So then four and a half, five and a half. So I'm actually half a cigar under my goal for this year. So April 1st and he's already smoked a cigar. So now I can only have one more are technically one and a half more. But I'm actually going to try and get down to one a month.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       And to be honest with you, I'd Kinda like to go all the way to my birthday in June and not smoke another one. Alright. Uh, God damn. And I enjoy him. I joined, enjoy the fucking lifestyle. I enjoy the whole fucking thing about it. I love going in. I love picking them out. I love the excitement. I love the smell. I love the old fucking chairs. You sit there. I love that there's no fucking young people there, you know? And by young people, I mean anybody 39 in younger, I used don't run into, you know, everybody's just chilling the fuck out. Smoking a cigar. I don't care what kind of a maniac you work. All these fucking kids that they put on Ritalin and all this type of shit. You just give these kids a cigar. Sam, sit down, puff, you know the casino. You just, you thinking about.

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       Just think about how great life is. December smoked a cigar. That's how you start taking out. Upgraded is graded as he can enjoy the fucking day. You start planning your retirement. How the fuck are you going to get out of this bullshit so you can just sit around in whatever zen you've somehow come into. I mean, I swear to God, if cigarettes make you feel like that, I understand why people do that shit. It's funny, but you know, nonsmokers like myself, you know, I actually am a smoker now with the fucking cigars, but um,

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       yeah know he's always looked down on those fucking people that smoke cigarettes. They were huddled outside knowledge shit.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       I don't know. Maybe, maybe they, maybe they know something. I don't, I'm not advocating smoking. I don't know what I'm saying. By the way, Canada, Windsor Airport, Jesus Christ. What a fucking gem that is. I love small airports. There's nothing better than that little ass fucking airport. Then when I went to Toronto, we flew into, we flew over, um, the propeller plane. Jesus Christ. If you sub Rosie walk into that, he's, he's one of those guys. I don't, I don't want give you sees propellers. He feels like he's riding in like a model t Ford, you know? Um, I always just say to myself, oh, well, it's, uh, it's gonna fly better. Well, we have much less of a chance because there's less working parts here for something to go bad, you know? I don't know. That's what I tell myself. So anyways, um, we went to Toronto.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       We didn't fly into their nightmare of fucking airport. We flew to the TR Toronto islands, which I'd never heard of, is a fucking little ass airport there. We get picked up and we took a little fairy, you know, it's fucking hilarious. I crossed at Western channel. It literally, like we started to go and I started videotaping it. And by the time I pay and from out my side window to the front window, we had already gotten to cross it. You get across it in like 30 seconds. Um, or they have a tunnel, you can walk underneath the western channel. We did that on the way back. It's a nice little ass airport. Um, after all these years of traveling, I love a little mom and pop airport, get in, get the fuck out. It's hilarious. She show up. They still have the old school metal detectors.

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       So you don't have to go through that fucking radiation shower that for some reason, I just don't understand that. So to stop terrorism, you're going to give all of your countryman cancer. Well, if we fucking kill everybody who they gonna blow up. Um, so anyways, how far into this fucking town? 45 minutes. Um, anyways, but these shows cannot, it cannot have, uh, been going any better. And, um, I've been working my ass off in Los Angeles, um, for a reason that I'm not allowed to say yet for whatever fucking reason. So I've been worried that I, I can't, um, you know, I can't fucking, uh, do standup as much as I'd liked, but us, I've been doing a bunch of spots, like little 10 minute spots trying to see shap they just do a little bit of my act. Even the jokes they here to make judge fucking see it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       So you remember how it goes. And um, I could not be having more fun up here, Matt. Just having a fucking great time. Um, just figuring out my act even figured out this new way to trash women that like in his fucking mean as they used to do it. But I still get to make the same points, so I just still come off, you know, it was a complete fucking lunatic all the time and I don't want to be that guy, you know what I mean? As much, you know, something I realized I never finished reading the [inaudible] think that, you know, okay. Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats, you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear, but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday clothes, your underwear is probably boring. We, and he's about to change that. Oh yeah, they're, they're about ready to take your balls to the next level.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       They're going to go hang a little disco ball. You know, it's called the third eye, the third ball right now, if you're fucking nuts, you know, can you imagine her excited face when she sees a disco ball hanging off the end of your Dick? Right? She'd probably get that checked. Uh, please include all of the following. No Mo modal is pronounced modal. Every pair of me undies is made from sustainable source modal, modal fabric that's twice as soft as cotton. Uh, nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies, but once you try them on, you understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear. Um, then if you don't love your first pair of me undies, they're free. No questions asked me. And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a statement with your underwear. Whether anyone could see them or not.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       Remember Superman. I don't like that joke. I remember Superman worth that. He's fighting Batman. You know somebody on Worldstar hip hop, one of my favorite fucking websites. You know, why don't you people funny veins, you know, music that I am completely not even aware of. I get to learn about that shit. And then, uh, to some of the most fucking insane fights you're ever going to see. And there's always a tipping point when you watch fights on Worldstar is there's always the amazement and then somewhere it just starts to become sad. If you just start thinking, what is wrong with human beings? Why do we do this shit? Why can't we just go out to a fucking McDonald's? Or if I dance club, you know, and not have like a 50 on 55. I do have to tell you the respect I have for someone that actually would go into one of those modern day Braveheart fucking things.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       I mean, I don't give a fuck how many martial arts classes you've taken in your life. There is nothing that they teach you in those fucking classes other than to turn around and run, which you already know how to do when you get in the middle of a fucking Malay like that. It's just inevitable. The fucking odds, you know, that's the fight version of being like the helicopter gunner in Vietnam where they had like a fucking a life expectancy of two fucking weeks. It's just, you're just standing there and you know it's going to happen. All right? You're going to, you're going to, something's going to fucking hit you. You're going to get knocked out and I have to tell you the influence of MMA on these fucking street fights. Now, back in the day, I seem to remember when you knock somebody out, that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       You didn't sit on their chest and throw another 40 punches to their head wedding for big John to come over and fucking, you know, usher you out of there. There's no ref, that fucking shit. We already knock somebody out and then your boot him in their head. I mean at that point that's like attempted murder man. You want, you're knocked him out. He'd come up, you can do this. You sit on that chess and do a fucking speed back then. Fucking brutal. But anyways, you know these me undies, I'm going to get through this shipping is free in the u s and Canada and you save up to $8 a pair with me undies subscription plan a get the subscription, you know it's like a fucking end zone dance. I always thought it was cooler when you fucking just scored a touchdown. You flip the ball to the ref like yeah, I'm going to be doing this all day if you knock somebody out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       Yeah. He just turned around like yeah, my job's done here. You walk away like Clint Eastwood, one of those drifter movies, you know, you sit on that to like, you fucking just kind of spazz out screaming. What did I tell you bitch? You know with your voice goes up nine octaves when your voice goes up like nine octaves like that. You kind of portray your Badass and thus he kinda is ye here a level of excitement? Like, oh my God, I can't believe I won. That's what I always hear. Um, having said that, I wouldn't want to fight anybody in those videos and it's not even the fact that I knew I would lose. I just know that after I was knocked out, you do irreparable plucking. I can't even say the word brain damage, which is unnecessary. If I could brain damage, you're knocked me up.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       You want, I'm laying there. Okay. My hands are pointing out into outer space. Um, uh, knocked out.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       You know, it looks like an action movie. Like I'm sitting there, but he was telly Savalas was holding the gun. I'm holding a microphone.

And then it was like this coming, you know, I was supposed to be at this movie poster, so I don't think the casinos understood it. They took away all of the, uh, the, the words, whatever the fuck you call it, all the tax. They took all of it away and they just have this stand alone poster.

Speaker 1:          00:54:28       And now I just looked like a magician. Like is he going to come in and the helicopter and make a truck disappear? Like it doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       I'm enough. I'm such a control freak. I can't even handle people who are given me money telling me what the fuck did do. Um, 55 minutes. All right. This whole days get away from me having been read any of the fucking questions and I haven't even talked about the Bruins, how we're one point out. We beat St Louis and then we lost to Chicago. Um, of course they'd see any games because I was fucking traveling. Um, you know, it's funny, I had like five or six country Chicago fans talk and shit. You know, it's so funny. Last time we played them, we beat them. I don't talk any shit. Do I talk any shit? No. Right? Hate these fucking people eat these, these whack them all fans that, you know, we could euros today than they ducked back down. They're nowhere to be found. You know when you fucking lose like Chicago's gun and doing the playoffs, you fucking Goddamn cons.

Speaker 1:          00:56:13       I actually liked the Blackhawks had fans like that make me fucking root root against them. So anyways, I'm coming up this week, my Bruins, my beloved Bruins. All right, we are playing. Our next game is uh, uh, where the fuck is that? I think we're playing to, no, we played Carolina I believe. I think we played Carolina next street. I get the schedule right here. Where is the schedule? All right, we play Carolina on Tuesday. It's at the TD bank, north fucking Home Depot Garden. Whatever the fuck they call it, the Carolina and notoriously plays as tough. They always match up well. It's always a tough game. And then we have Detroit, which is huge. They're one point against the ahead of us on Thursday. And then our last game is against Ottawa on Saturday. All right. So basically the two teams in front of us are, uh, Detroit and Philly both one point ahead of us, I believe.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       So the great thing is during this week, Detroit in Philly play each other. So no, I think Philly's a few points they had. So I, I'm just rude fulfilling to just when the rest of the way out. Right. I, I, at this point, I have to root against Detroit. I don't have anything against Detroit other than their fucking country fans. And they really are conti fence. You know what I mean? The funny thing about them is they don't realize that they're run is over and that it's now all about Chicago and La and they're wearing the crown. You know what I mean? For some reason Detroit is still living off like an Aes Herman, you know, I guess they won one last decade to Oh, actually they went to, yeah, but you can just see, you can see it in Detroit. It's over. You know, it's something that I'm going to experience what Brady and Bella Checker gone and I'm going to be like, yeah, but where are the Patriots?

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       It's like, yeah, but they're gone and yeah, they're wearing the same uniform, but it's not the same. I'm fucking with the, I actually love Detroit. I love the franchise. I don't like the fence. Um, you know, and I've never been that way as I like to think with all the success that I only talk shit. If people give me shit. That's how I try to be, you know, I don't try to act like, because my teams are successful. That means somehow in my own personal life, I'm a success. Like some people do those. You know what I'm really judging all black cocks in, in Redwing fans, by half a dozen people, which isn't fair. So, you know what, good luck to all you. And uh, I hope to Bruins fucking pull it out. And if we don't, we got no one to blame but ourselves just fucking good Lord. What a fucking sees it up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. That's what the fuck is spent. Now. I just need up for the last two, three up, just fucking these three game winning streak and no one will remember any of this shit. Dead Shyness is sitting there with the fucking hard on being like, I can finally write an article about hockey that I understand.

Speaker 1:          00:59:17       Somebody blew it. Oh yeah, I can write this off like in. Dang. All right, let's get to the questions then. I gotta get the fuck out of here. All right. Um, the all star Cafe, uh, on March 28 podcast, you briefly mentioned you were regular muncher and Nia was a waitress. The old state, not the all star, uh, bef from easy road all star up here. And then I'll state before she got pink slipped and now and now and the now closed down Allstate cafe on the upper west side. I thought your listeners might be intrigued to learn that your meeting place was also a meeting place for a young teacher and her murderer in January of 1973 during a one night stand, murdering a partner guarantees there ain't no second night, right? Jesus Christ. They didn't know that the grotesque multi stabbing crime got so much infamous publicity that the pub, his name from the Wm tweets to the Allstate, the murderer inspired the book and subsequent movies starring the then scantily clad Diane Keaton also. Apparently Kevin Bacon had once tended bar there too. I wonder if they fired him also. I didn't know that. Jesus, that's fucking creepy. I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that. Not even remotely, but that type of shit is just scary by the way. I love here in a body history, even as much as they fucking that cakewalk thing I was trashed and that guy, I liked that type of shit. I'm all right. Girlfriend bothered and annoyed by sexy TV show character. Uh, dear Billy blank balls.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       My girlfriend and I were recently watching the new season of daredevil and, and we're enjoying it. However, one character electra was introduced and uh, she bothered the hell out and my girlfriend for a reference, Electra is this character that is sexy, provocative and an all around Badass Ninja woman. Electra is also like a, that weird sort of, isn't that that mythology thing? What is the, uh, what is that weird fucking thing? Isn't that where I'm aiming going to say it because of I'm wrong. Asked to do with some sort of creepy sexual relations within the family, doesn't it, you know, died her father. And then the other one is son, mother with a son kills the doubt or some shit. It's just fucking weird when I see those types of stories actually start believing in Adam and eve. Well, yeah, there was just two people and they banged and then they had this incestuous fucking horse shit for a couple of generations until we fucked ourselves up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:04       Maybe that did up and maybe that's why the neanderthals and all like or whatever the, uh, the original cavemen, their heads are all fucked up looking is because everyone was related. Um, who the fuck knows? Anyways? She was a cool character, but my girlfriend hated her. I noticed that it wasn't anything against the characters since she couldn't tell me why she didn't like her other than she just bothers her. Other people have told me that their girlfriends slash wives are the same way with the electro when watching this show with their significant other. I know it isn't just this character because any female that is in a sexy, Badass role, I have noticed women specifically ones with boyfriends don't like, uh, is this just some kind of insecurity women have that they really disliked their boyfriends? Seeing someone that may be sexier than them? Um, well yeah, if you fucking put it that way, they're going to be annoyed.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       Okay honey, you know, they see that girl look how much sexier she is. Then, you know, when she watched his fight club, you know, does she say how well fucking much better or Brad Pitt's looking anyways. Are they worried that this fictional TV characters is going to steal me away from her? I am wondering if I should say anything because quite frankly it's starting to get on my nerves. She will root against the character for no reasons besides the ones listed above. Um, I don't know if I would just make her move, make her more pissed off though. Have you ever been in a situation like this? Love the show and as always go fuck yourself. Here's the thing, one of the worst things you can do when you get into a relationship with the woman is to start having your behavior be dictated by just trying to keep them in a good mood.

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       All right? I'm not saying walk around and be an Asshole, but if you're not being a fucking asshole and they're just being moody, fucking assholes. Like you got to call him out on it. Yeah. Like, and, and this is another thing too. You gotta treat them like adults rather than treating them like children, which is what a lot of guys do because physically we're stronger than them. So you feel like if you say anything to them, it's like a yelling at a child. You're not, not only is that an adult and a lot of ways they're more advanced because they can't beat the fuck out of you. They have to go, they have to go with their mental, right. That's why they consist manipulate you like a fucking little puppet there because they can just play Jedi mind games because they, they, they're not gonna they from day one they're like, all right, this fucking thing is going to be stronger than me at some point.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       So I need to learn how to control it. Just using my brain. Right. That's how you end. End Up holding fucking yarn owes can hook no woman's cells anymore. Right. They barely even cook. So you end up at fucking brunch. This is what you got to say. Um, you've just got to just hit pause and just, I would just be like, what is your problem with this character? You're ruining this show for me. Okay. If you look at and look at daredevil, he's got abs. You see me acting like a fucking baby about this. You know, if you don't like the way you look, go to the gym at the once you be inspired by this fog there. That's, that's what I've failed when I, when I watch a superhero movie other than I the other, other than like a, when the fuck is his dumb horse, Shit gonna be over and always makes me feel like, yeah, I gotta hit the gym.

Speaker 2:          01:05:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       I could literally sit there and watch Thor who's probably a foot taller than me, a thousand times better looking than I'm ever going to be. And all that dude does is make me want to go to the gym. But then again, if you look at our roles, like all I need to do is earn enough money where I can get a Ferrari in a toupee and next thing you know, I can bank some core that's been an a fucking magazine. And that's basically how it works. If I drive the car in the right part of the world, right? Drive around fucking French Riviera Jesus Christ, you have no idea what you're going to be banging. They don't have that option. You know what I mean? They can't be like, well I'm a six, but you know, if I start making money I can go get myself a Brad Pitt. You can't, Eh, you know what? You can't blame society. You've got to blame the good Lord for that one. So maybe that's why.

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       Maybe that's why.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       Because no matter what she does, she can. I don't know. I don't fucking know. Ask Her, but you know something I wouldn't be on, you know, she's ruining your show. You got to call her out on it. Um, all right. Okay. Going bald. Dear Billy bald cap. I'm 24 and I'm going bald. This runs in my family is both my grandfathers were bald so I don't have any sort of identity crisis about it. In fact, I'm leaning into it and we'll joke about it when appropriate. My question to you is, when do I finally start buzzing my ev buzzing everything away. The last thing I want to do is rocket. George could stand the kid cause stanza look, but we'd like to have a full head of hair while I can before I look like I'm in denial. No comb overs for this cut. My hair is thin but still covers everything on top though. My Barbara did crack more jokes than usual at my last, at my expense last time I went to get a cut. No, I didn't provide a picture because this isn't a fucking Rogaine commercial. Given your experience, I'd love to hear your input on what, when you pulled the trigger to buzzard all, all away and possibly the input of the lovely Nia. When Jesus Christ, what am I? You fucking stylists.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       well I think you know something. If you, Barbara starts making jokes, you know what I mean? I feel like there's not enough time left on the clock for you to make it come back. That's basically like now you're lining up and the dude across the is talking shit about how they're moving on to the next round of the playoffs and you're not. So it sounds like it's already over,

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       you know,

Speaker 1:          01:07:51       I dunno dude. Why and what am I, what kind of a fucking man asks another man a question like this? Just fucking, you know, shave your fucking head or go get a hair plugs or put Rogaine on it, or a diet, a different fucking cover. I don't give a fuck what you do with it. What is my experience? My experience was when I was just sick of it, I was sick of the slow and I was just like, you know what? Let's just put this thing out of its misery. Um, and I gotta tell you it's not nearly as bad as everybody fucking thanks. Who's kidding? Who? Everybody would love to have a full head of hair, but you know, stuff that I gotta be honest with you. Once you start buzzing in your head, it's kind of fucking awesome. You know what's great about having a shaved head? You're always ready to go.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       I got to tell you, as much as I would love to still have a full head of hair, I love the fact that I'm always ready to go. All I gotta do is throw a shirt on, splash a little water on my face, and you have no fucking idea that I was laying in my sweatpants five minutes earlier. Oh, speaking of which, I'm just kidding. I always make sure I get ready. You know, there was this fucking person, you know, I went out, you know, I took some pictures with people after the show and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Did these fucking people that have like this fucking guy comes up, I can already smell him. Alright. And then he goes to put his arm around me during the fucking picture and I'm telling you like literally could make paint, peel off the fucking walls was how bad this guy's body odor was. And he's with other people and they don't smell. It's like, why don't you say something to them? Because I'm not going to say it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       You paid money to see me, right? I gave you show. And then I come out there and take a picture and then I tell you, you smell bad. I wouldn't do that to somebody, but Jesus fucking question you was fucking hilarious about this person too. I kept running into him.

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       And then this person just loved to tell a story that somehow involved, you know, lifting his arms up past his fucking shoulders. Jesus. Fuck man. I never noticed how much you lift your arms during telling a story until I ran into this guy fucking raped fucking rate.

Speaker 2:          01:10:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       Just completely fucking unacceptable. Well into his fucking twenties. And he's standing, he's got a couple of friends with them who don't reek. Oh my God. You know, a bad, I would shade one of those old school fucking, you know, the spray on deodorant. And as he was telling this story, I'd be like, yeah. And just holding my nose and Jay, I would just spray under one arm pit, no. Keeps telling this story and then spray under the other one and then I just hand them the cad. Do the math there. Fuck Go. Alright. Psycho girlfriend.

Speaker 2:          01:10:45       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       Um, alright. Psycho girlfriend. Uh, where am I? Okay. So my girlfriend and I have been together for about five years and lately I've been feeling the get engaged pressure from her family. Well, yeah, I'm 23 and she's 21. All right, let me rephrase that. Well, no, um, I thought you guys were older. Uh, we've been together since high school and I haven't experienced much else besides, of course the young middle school, tug job girlfriends. I'm afraid of Sunday regretting missing out on meeting a ton of different girls. Like all my buddies have been, I mean you're only young once, right? My girlfriend flips out on me about watching porn because I'm thinking about other girls and she acts like I'm cheating on her and half the time when we're out she thinks I'm checking out other girls cause you probably are dude because you want to cause you want to break up with her as what? I'm guessing she's a drop dead gorgeous girls so I don't get what she's so insecure about. But like I said, she's crazy. She gets abusive with me. I just kind of sit there and take it all the time. Um, she's Latina by the way. Honduran Nicaraguan. She's got that wild temper. Um, all right. I was that considered racist to see that Latino chicks are a little crazier than, than what? Unlike what pasty drunken Irish chicks. Oh yeah. They're always so even keeled.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       When I asked for space, I woke up the next day and my car was keyed. She claimed she had nothing to do with it. I love the girl, she's all I've ever known and she's amazing most of the time, but I'm not sure if I can live like this forever with their temperament or jealousy. What would you do anyways? Love the podcast. Thanks for the advice and go fuck yourself. P s good luck with the home gym. Everybody knows you got no business in irregularly. I go fuck yourself. I got business in a regular gym. Oh, when you do what? You sitting here and you're a fucking God. Damn. You know something? I actually had fucking, I actually had sympathy for you. I was going to give you some good advice. You know what? Go Fuck Yourself. You know what your problem is in this thing. You know you're just, you're allowed to.

Speaker 1:          01:13:03       You're young. I'm not going to be a dick to you. Okay? Cause you're young. This is the deal. All right? You got yourself a hot girl. All right, and you did not have set up the relationship. She fucking rolled all over you. You're, I see what I do in your situation. If I was 23, I'd be doing what you were doing. I'd be staying in the relationship, wanting to get out, um, and dealing with this bullshit. But I can tell you this right now, her looks aren't always going to be there, but she's always going to have keys. You know what I mean? So that's what you're signing up for. The looks. Go out the fucking window. You're marrying the fucking person at this fucking lunatic every time, you know, God forbid your mailman is a fucking woman who's younger than her at that point, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:13:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       I th I don't know. I don't know. I can use too wishy washy. I can't tell whether you fucking want to be in it or not, but I can tell you this right now. Um, any woman keys your car, that's it. It's fucking over.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       Okay. That is a, the level of being a complete fucking psycho, a complete disrespect for your own property. And that when she was a child, she was never told no. The fact that you would go out and do something like that. Yeah, I dunno. It sounds to me like you want to go fucking get some notches on your belt and you're afraid that if you do and you break up with this girl that she's going to fucking stab you. Um, I dunno, I got claustrophobic reading it if that means anything, but I'm a fucking load of tech. Alright. Sketchy ex-girlfriend. Hey you can t leprechaun, Jason. Everybody's staring into the red head shit this week. Every, every once in a while. I got to give you guys shit to get. Can you be a little more original? I liked that Billy blank ball. That was fucking funny. 58 fucking, you know, fucking redhead jokes in a row, but I get it. You know, I get it. You don't have an hour's time. You can do a 10 minutes set your a showcase comic. Uh, all right. Hey, you cut t leprechaun. I am 16 years old and my girlfriend is 15 today. She texted me, she texted me with a picture of a tattoo asking if I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       it is what it is. The date of her grandfather's death. Personally, I hate tattoos and thinks if she keeps getting them, she will look like a fucking phone book. I also think her mother is irresponsible, spelled with a bunch of fees. He responsible for letting her get a tattoo spelled with one. Oh so young. What are your thoughts about this and how she, how,

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       What's your thoughts about this and how she didn't tell me till after she got it. Thank you. And I love your shows and your podcast. Um, yeah. All right. She's 15. She already got her first tattoo, which you got to do is close your eyes and age or when is she getting the face tattoo and the nose ring and the fucking Olympic fucking rings in our ears to be different. Um, yeah, I'm not into tattoos. You know, I think as a certain type of person can pull it off. Um, and that's not 98% of the population, but 98% of the population for some reason has tattoos.
