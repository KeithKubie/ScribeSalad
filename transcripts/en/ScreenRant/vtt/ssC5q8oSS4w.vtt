00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.950
The galaxy far far away has enjoyed one of
the biggest and most complicated world of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.090
extended universe stories in history, even
if the movies themselves are the only canon

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.460
future films will follow.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.090
You might think that just seven movies would
put a limit on the wild theories fans could

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.550
create to show the Star Wars saga in a whole
new light – but you would be wrong.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.640
Here are 10 Star Wars Theories That Change
Everything.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.480
Chewbacca: The Rebel Spy

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.620
Think about it: if Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke
Skywalker hadn’t stumbled onto Han Solo

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.060
in the first movie, the pilot never would
have joined the rebellion, or become one of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.489
its top generals.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.489
What if it wasn’t a coincidence?

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.739
Chewbacca is actually the first person Obi-Wan
talks to in the Tatooine cantina, and winds

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.340
up joining the rebellion along with his pilot
– the same rebellion born out of the slaughter

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.940
of the Jedi that Chewbacca witnessed firsthand
in Revenge of the Sith.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.519
If he knew Yoda, he could have known any number
of Jedi, including Anakin Skywalker.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.920
Did Obi-Wan tell him Luke’s true power and
importance, and Chewie made sure Han joined

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
the fight?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:10.810
We’ll never know, but it’s too good to
a theory to ignore.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.140
Luke Was The Emperor’s True Apprentice

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.540
It seems pretty stupid in hindsight that Obi-Wan
hid Luke from his father by leaving him with

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.030
Anakin’s family on his home planet.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.680
Even if Anakin couldn’t bring himself to
track his children down, the Emperor definitely

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.000
would have – but what if the Emperor didn’t
want Luke killed?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.369
He was in no hurry to die at his apprentice’s
hands, and even tried to recruit Luke as his

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.940
new student before he died at Vader’s hands.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.390
Vader wound up scarred, missing limbs and
close to death, so the Emperor keeping him

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.290
close to eventually lure his more powerful
son into the open makes a lot of sense.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.899
The Ewoks Ate The Stormtroopers

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.430
When the Rebels first meet the Ewoks, it’s
only C-3PO who keeps the adorable creatures

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.140
from cooking and eating them.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.189
Keep that in mind when you get to the original
saga’s finale, and the Ewoks are celebrating

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.179
their victory, dancing, drinking, and playing
Stormtrooper helmets li9ke drums.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.280
But… they totally just took those helmets
and left the bodies in the forest… right?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.590
We’re half convinced you can spot piles
of chewed-clean bones somewhere in the scene,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.670
but realize that plenty of the Stormtroopers
were injured, not killed in the battle, and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:29.110
those Ewoks become a lot less cute.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.110
Darth Jar Jar

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.160
Sure, it’s a silly theory, but trying to
make sense out of the most hated Star Wars

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.940
character is understandable.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.310
How can Jar Jar Binks be so stupid, yet so
lucky and important all at the same time?

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.390
Easy: he was working with the Sith the whole
time.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.890
How else do you explain his decision to hand
power of the Senate over to the future Emperor?

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.890
Pure cluelessness?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.840
Nope, we see a secret alliance between two
cold hearted political operatives.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.240
And his friends never saw it coming.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.250
Boba Fett Killed Luke’s Family

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.130
Every fan remembers the moment Luke returns
home to find his aunt and uncle burned down

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.810
to skeletons, their bodies literally disintegrated
off of the bones while their home sits in

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.810
flames.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.160
But it doesn’t look like anything the Stormtroopers
did before or since, leading some to think

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.730
that killing the family was hired out to a
bounty hunter who happened to be in the area

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.560
– the legendary Boba Fett.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.160
Besides making the bounty hunter’s role
in the saga a bit more meaningful, it also

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.030
turns his exchange with Vader in Empire Strikes
Back an inside joke (insert clip of Vader

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.030
with the bounty hunters, turning to Boba when
he says “NO distintegrations”).

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.970
They learned the hard way: burning Skywalkers
down to their skeletons is a great motivation

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.980
for a nearby hero.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.960
Padme Never Loved Anakin

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.010
Sure, this one might be a bit of a reach,
but you can’t blame fans for trying to explain

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.180
why Padme Amidala would ever fall in love
with the awkward, stalker-ish Anakin Skywalker.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.690
The theory basically says that Anakin slowly
used the Force to manipulate Padme into caring

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.900
for him, whether on purpose or by accident.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.500
Or, you could look at it another way: if Anakin
was created out of the Force to bring balance,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.620
the Force may have sensed his turn to the
Dark Side

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.480
ahead of time – and got to work on making
some children to fix their father’s mistakes.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.460
Han Solo is a Force User

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.470
He may not believe in The Force when he first
meets the movie’s star Jedi, but Han Solo

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.919
sure fights like someone sensitive to it.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.260
Think about it: how many times did Han seem
to escape inescapable situations, avoid death

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.020
by inches, or dodge blaster fire with style?

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280
The Force Awakens showed Rey was just as good
a pilot as Han before she even KNEW she was

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.460
channeling the Force, so the same could be
true for Han.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
And considering how important he is to the
Rebel victory, The Force making sure he lived

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.539
to achieve it makes sense.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.259
Rey’s a Kenobi, Not a Skywalker

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.539
From the first looks at Rey in The Force Awakens,
fans speculated that she was truly the daughter

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.180
of Luke Skywalker, and there were plenty of
hints to fuel the rumors.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.301
But one theory suggests Rey wasn’t left
on a backwater planet by a Skywalker, but

00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:06.740
a Kenobi – specifically, Obi-Wan’s child.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.490
After all, it’s Obi-Wan’s voice that Rey
hears when she touches Luke’s lightsaber,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.499
and the former Jedi Master has had romances
in the Clone Wars TV series.

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.540
If the theory was true, it would make the
Star Wars sage not just about the Skywalkers,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.900
but Anakin and Obi-Wan – two friends who
became like brothers, betrayed eachother,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.040
only for their grandchildren (Kylo and Rey)
to finally restore a balance.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.870
Not to mention giving Luke Skywalker a version
of ‘the student becoming the master’ that

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.080
no fan would ever forget.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.979
The Jedi Weren’t The Heroes

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.040
We all know the story: the Jedi are betrayed
from within by the evil Sith, and the people

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.160
of the galaxy suffer as a result.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.229
But that story has some problems.

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.280
For starters, the Jedi Code said they weren’t
supposed to attack or rule over anyone, and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.990
must respect all life, even that of their
enemies.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.430
Now look at the galaxy they lived in: attacking
everywhere they felt it right, leading an

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.879
army on distant battlefields, and even deciding
to attack and kill a democratically appointed

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.160
leader because he was the sole survivor of
their ancient enemies.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.150
They may not be the villains of the Star Wars
universe, but they’re not the heroes, either.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.014
If The Force wasn’t there to help them prevent
their end – maybe it was for a reason.

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:16.229
The Rebels Killed Trillions

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.300
There’s one major problem in depicting the
Empire and Emperor as purely evil: mainly,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.999
that the galactic senate was an absolute mess,
with the so-called peaceful Jedi looking to

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.240
stop a coalition of planets from actually
separating legally.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.139
The theory that the Emperor was actually on
the right track gets even bigger, too, since

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.289
his use of The Force allowed him to see things
the Jedi missed – which may have included

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.240
the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong, an alien
civilization that spent thousands of years

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.180
reaching the Star Wars galaxy, and emerging
just 25 years after the Rebels won… by blowing

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.210
up not one, but two moon-sized superweapons.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.960
That left the galaxy undefended, and while
they won the war in the end, it cost the lives

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.749
of over 600 TRILLION sentient beings.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.039
Was the Emperor trying to fortify the galaxy
to prevent such a slaughter?

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.419
We’ll never know, since Disney erased that
bit of the story for The Force Awakens…

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.150
for obvious reasons.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.889
