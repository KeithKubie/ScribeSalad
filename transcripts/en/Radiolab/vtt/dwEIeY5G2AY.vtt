00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.450
OK, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.010
<v 1>In United States,</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.060
we keep the supreme court the power to find justice for people come with boats.

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.810
People who've been abused and manipulated, oh, sure. Bought it. I mean they,

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.890
they knock on their door. That power extends beyond state borders.

6
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:25.891
He can with [inaudible] sometimes even beyond national borders with common show

7
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.940
you who your Yam question is, how far do we want it to go?

8
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.920
<v 0>Should our supreme court be the Supreme Court of the world?</v>

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.260
<v 2>The honorable,</v>

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.270
the chief justice and the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.780
Oh, Yay. Yay.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.380
Having business before the honorable,

13
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:54.820
the Supreme Court of the United States are admonished to draw near and give

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.470
their intent.

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.843
[inaudible]

16
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.363
<v 3>yeah,</v>

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.103
<v 2>yeah.</v>

18
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.043
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

19
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.911
<v 1>okay,</v>

20
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:29.620
so I grew up at a time when a lot of people genuinely saw America differently

21
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:33.970
than they do now. This is the 70s and eighties Carter Reagan years.

22
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.070
And there was this sense particularly for you or new arrival that America was

23
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:43.750
special, exceptional, that we held the world to a higher standard.

24
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.070
Certainly what brought my family to America. Okay. So it's not that way anymore.

25
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.870
So much, and it seems like every day, at least in my lifetime,

26
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:58.850
we're asking the question, how should we feel about that?

27
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.580
Whatever that is, that higher calling,

28
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.810
that somehow for better or worse embedded in the idea of being an American,

29
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.811
is that stupidly wrong-headed and arrogant or is there something in that that we

30
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.820
still should embrace?

31
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.180
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

32
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.800
<v 1>turns out that argument is happening,</v>

33
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
has been happening in a totally fascinating way at the supreme court,

34
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.730
centered around this teeny, teeny little,

35
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.223
<v 6>whoa.</v>

36
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.730
<v 0>It seems to ask some pretty big questions about who we are.</v>

37
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.180
We want to be story comes from two KPS Kelsey paget high and Kelly prime KP two

38
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.990
k p one I believe you are now KPV one. Okay. You have ascended the ranks.

39
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.040
I am now KP two or three year old [inaudible] seven stop.

40
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.990
It can't be 12. Okay, so Kelly start us off. Yeah. So,

41
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.370
uh, this story begins appropriately enough. Not In America,

42
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400
but it starts in 1976 with a this woman I have to get used to.

43
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.860
Yeah. Okay. So I guess the first thing,

44
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.240
if you could just introduce yourself. My name is [inaudible].

45
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.940
I am from [inaudible]. Why

46
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.650
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

47
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.700
<v 0>Paraguay. It's a small country, right on top of Argentina and Dolly's family.</v>

48
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:21.630
The Florida NGOs

49
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.920
are a pretty big deal over there.

50
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.070
What happened in my family was that my grandfather was very rich.

51
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.920
The Florida has made their money exporting tobacco to Europe for big cigarette

52
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:41.360
companies like them. Cause you Tom [inaudible],

53
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.280
a family that owns a beautiful house in the country side,

54
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.320
lots of land do airplane.

55
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.370
Now this could have been Dolly's life,

56
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.660
but it will say Sam going to be like that and it wasn't because of her father.

57
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.830
I'm your father. What's his name or what? Boyd Coil. And what,

58
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.300
what did your dad do for a living? He said though,

59
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.450
Darn her dad very famously turned his back on his fancy upbringing and moved the

60
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.040
entire family to the countryside.

61
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.670
The old world was short on money and there he set up a clinic to give medical

62
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:20.790
care to the poor indigenous farmers in that area. He,

63
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.580
they get off lay 47,000 people.

64
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.850
He was the only doctor in a lot of cities.

65
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.210
Her Dad became kind of like a patron saint of the countryside.

66
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.600
Not only would he give the medical treatment, but when they came in,

67
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:35.370
he would tell them, go vote,

68
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.360
rise above your station and as you can imagine as word got out,

69
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.620
this really pissed off Paraguay's ruler at the time,

70
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.100
a guy named Alfredo strossner's,

71
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.110
<v 9>he was called the [inaudible],</v>

72
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:52.710
the octopus because he said he had arms and tentacles that reach into

73
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.370
everybody's lives there in the country. That's her name, Horst.

74
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.090
I'm a professor of Latin American history here at Appalachian State University.

75
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.940
<v 0>When Dolly was growing up, Rooney live next door and for Mosa, Argentina,</v>

76
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
right across the river from Paraguay and Renee says at that time,

77
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:13.001
both Argentina and Paraguay were part of this like big network of dictators all

78
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:16.460
across Latin America and it was called Operation Condor.

79
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.730
<v 9>Operation Condor was a network that linked together military dictatorships of</v>

80
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:25.060
Latin America, so Brazil, Argentina, Chile,

81
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.630
<v 0>Bolivia, Oregon, Paraguay,</v>

82
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.160
<v 9>and it was all masterminded by Pinochet in Chile.</v>

83
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.320
<v 0>Renee said the operation condor was a lot like a spider web with Pinochet as the</v>

84
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.940
master weaver, the spider,

85
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.540
the communist revolution in Cuba had just happened.

86
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:42.570
And so these six super militaristic dictatorships,

87
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.160
they banded together to pretty much trap communism and keep it out of South

88
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:48.360
America. Remember,

89
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:52.230
this was the Cold War and America really wanted to keep communism out of the

90
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:53.064
continent too.

91
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.340
So it's really likely that the CIA was involved and the result was a network of

92
00:05:58.461 --> 00:05:59.750
state sponsored terror.

93
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.010
<v 9>In the darkest part of the night,</v>

94
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:05.310
they would come to your apartment and drag you out and stuff.

95
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.750
You're in the trunk of a Ford Falcon car and you would disappear forever.

96
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.500
<v 10>My father used to tell the Pesa,</v>

97
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.470
don't vote for a restaurant.

98
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.340
<v 0>No. So this was these. The context behind Dr Florida goes rebellion.</v>

99
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.070
Dolly said he travel all over the world, giving talks,

100
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:29.970
trying to show everything what astronomer was doing in the country.

101
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.880
[inaudible] tells patients when the government comes to buy your crops,

102
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.460
put it away. Don't sell it, don't give them a thing.

103
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.160
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

104
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.910
<v 0>Dolly tried her best to ignore all this. We didn't get that loan with my father.</v>

105
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.080
I have to say that.

106
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.100
So when I get all there,

107
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.120
she moved away from the country and I can't do the CT to leave.

108
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.240
What city was it? As soon as she worked to put herself through school and then

109
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.400
[inaudible] follow me after and then Dolly says she worked upon her two siblings

110
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:07.234
through school.

111
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600
Her sister Ali at the time was 14 and her brother Halito was 17 love Carlito

112
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.750
love Corleto. He was her favorite.

113
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.970
<v 10>Carlito looked named my mother green eyes cause Daniel hair light hair.</v>

114
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.440
I know that he had

115
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.090
<v 0>a lot of girls that crust on him. This is Dolly's daughter. Paloma.</v>

116
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.680
Very handsome. Yes. But he wasn't a player. Anything in what was,

117
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.920
what was halitosis personality like? Was He loud? Was He quiet?

118
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.040
<v 10>You see those people that say things and you laugh. Fico,</v>

119
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.610
he's so funny all the time. Just people that they jogged comedian,

120
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.530
comedian, we always saw that he would become a call me Yak. He was very funny.

121
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.940
<v 0>So, so you two were close. Very close. So that's the backdrop.</v>

122
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.530
1970 $6 in the city with their two siblings or her dad's out in the country

123
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.700
jumping up opposition to the regime at that time who I lead,

124
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.430
<v 10>he tells many friends that he felt like he was being fallow.</v>

125
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.350
He didn't want to tell us because we always tell him to be careful.

126
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.780
Even my father coil used to tell him,

127
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.640
be careful because you are who I my son. And he was

128
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.280
<v 0>and at that time in Paraguay,</v>

129
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.800
it was well known that there were spies everywhere.

130
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.940
<v 10>The put away put away is an expression in what I nee person with hairy feet with</v>

131
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.140
hair is call it Peter way, it's a nickname for informers of the regime.

132
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.650
<v 0>So things were already tense.</v>

133
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.580
And then on March 29th,

134
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.160
1976 Dolly and her siblings are turning in for the night.

135
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.510
Around 11 maybe Dolly and Emily both sleep in one bed.

136
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.160
<v 10>Carlito has his room. And so he went to his teeth.</v>

137
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:52.750
And then when I go night

138
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.140
<v 0>and what happened was</v>

139
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 10>we've, we here in the middle of the night,</v>

140
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.680
maybe three o clock was

141
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.910
<v 0>the bomb being in that door.</v>

142
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.400
[inaudible] and she wakes up like what's happening.

143
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.690
She throws on a coat over her nightgown to cover myself and she goes to the door

144
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.290
where she finds a cop. He say, you'll have to come with me.

145
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.880
That is a little problem.

146
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.320
Was your brother as bang your house at Penny's house?

147
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:25.830
Remember that name is [inaudible]. I mainly got Pena.

148
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.410
He lived two doors down and she didn't know him too well,

149
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.680
but he was a policemen and she'd always had suspicions about him.

150
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.060
So Dolly steps out into the chilly night in her nightgown.

151
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.090
This street was for all police man car.

152
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.930
The officer who was at the door walked her over to Pena's house into the house

153
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.740
down a long hallway that she says was lined with even more policemen.

154
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.330
They may be Walsh,

155
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.211
<v 10>I don't know,</v>

156
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:57.211
70 and then 35 and 35 one close to another.

157
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.200
<v 0>She says she walked down the hall, the policemen sort of parted for her</v>

158
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:04.790
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

159
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.510
<v 0>and guided her to a room in the back of the house. A went into that room,</v>

160
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.710
open that door. And so Harley,

161
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.180
<v 10>he was lying on his back on a mattress and this</v>

162
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.130
gorgeous human being. My brother was so beautiful.

163
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.480
His body is covered in gashes.

164
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:32.481
You can see where he's been stabbed over and over again and maybe tied up.

165
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.830
They were here. They cut him. I found the, the, the, the,

166
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.420
these out. These, there was an electrical wire attached to his genitals.

167
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.220
Most drawshop. Terrible, terrible.

168
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.110
[inaudible]. I don't know how to spray. How, how other human being can do,

169
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.000
can do that to another one who never did anything to you to, to,

170
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.270
to, I don't know.

171
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.420
<v 0>Dolly says she bolted out of the room and immediately ran into Inspector General</v>

172
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.253
Pena.

173
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.490
<v 10>He was standing in the doorway. I saw Pena in my wife. Pena told me,</v>

174
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.330
[inaudible] you better shut up.

175
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.570
He is the thing that you the surf and you better get quiet because nick mu will

176
00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:21.160
be used something. Lands.

177
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.500
<v 0>He told you next time it would be you.</v>

178
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.720
<v 10>Yeah. In your farm. Maybe. You bet there. Shut up. I say I am.</v>

179
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:33.590
Don't you feel that? You don't know why? I know.

180
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.430
Don't you feel that? [inaudible] you made me shut up today,

181
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:41.750
but tomorrow I will valley. We'll know what you did to my brother.

182
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.000
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

183
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.690
<v 0>over the next three years, the family tried to get justice.</v>

184
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.440
They sued Pena in the Paraguayan courts, but their lawyers were threatened.

185
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:56.441
One was disbarred when Dolly and her mom testified against Pena [inaudible] so

186
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:00.370
we went through jet when Dolly and her mom got out of jail,

187
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.310
they raised publicity and was showing what they did to my brother.

188
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.070
They convinced reporters to write newspaper articles to call for an

189
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.100
investigation. But before anything could happen,

190
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.200
Pena, he disappear. He vanished. He fled the country altogether.

191
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.790
So the question is, if you're Dolly, what do you do?

192
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.250
Your brother has just been brutally murdered. You know who did it? But you know,

193
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:29.580
you can't get just as in Paraguay because the whole court systems in with the

194
00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:33.390
regime and you can't go to the international criminal court because it doesn't

195
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.960
exist yet. And even if it did exist, your case is way too small.

196
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.160
So what do you do when I say we have to do something?

197
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.360
Fast forward to 1979 I moved to Washington,

198
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.720
Dolly's living in D C cleaning, cooking, cleaning houses,

199
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:50.190
working part time at a law firm.

200
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.750
All this time she's had feelers out with her dad's connections at NGOs.

201
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.930
Just trying to find out at least where Pena is living.

202
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.980
I only have communication with [inaudible]. Finally,

203
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.270
one day that spring,

204
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.080
she got a phone call from one of those connections they found Benya they told me

205
00:13:09.511 --> 00:13:12.260
that Pena was leaving Katie in Brooklyn.

206
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.870
He'd been working at a furniture store in Brooklyn when a fellow Paraguayan had

207
00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:20.130
recognized him out at him. Ivy know what I was going to do,

208
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.650
but they wanted justice.

209
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:23.970
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.590
<v 0>how do you get justice in this case?</v>

211
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.000
I with this [inaudible] you got a pair of Gwen responsible for the death of

212
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:31.920
another Paraguayan in Paraguay.

213
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.200
Both people are to the scenes that'll happen in fire wise,

214
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.050
like even if he did something wrong, don't why? Which it seems like he did.

215
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.080
There's not like this has nothing to do with America. Not Seen

216
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.230
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

217
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.660
<v 0>what'd I say? We have to do something. So I was looking for help.</v>

218
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.170
Deli contacts. A lawyer who gets her in touch with this guy, Dan Peter, wise,

219
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.730
wise, Jennifer Constitution Center for constitutional rights.

220
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.040
Peter says even before Dali showed up,

221
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.300
we were trying to figure out how to sue people committing crimes against

222
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:10.210
humanity and war crimes. For example,

223
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.000
504 on armed Vietnamese women,

224
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:18.001
children and old men were massacred over a four hour period by US troops.

225
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.330
This was around the time of the me lie mask in central Vietnam when that

226
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.590
happened by colleagues at the center and I had been wondering was there a way

227
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.860
for them to bring a case against the u s military on behalf of one of the

228
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.970
victims in an American Colette if the crime was committed abroad.

229
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.710
So I came and met Peter and asked for help.

230
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.420
So I called an emergency meeting of the center staff and he asked them like,

231
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.790
is there a way we can help?

232
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.110
Is there some like wormhole in American law that would let us bring non

233
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.250
Americans and crimes

234
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.600
<v 11>into American courts?</v>

235
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.930
<v 4>One of us at the center was obviously a good researcher</v>

236
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.110
<v 11>and they said, hey, you know, there's this super old super obscure law,</v>

237
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.710
<v 4>something called the Alien Tort Statute.</v>

238
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.220
<v 11>The what? The Alien Tort Statute.</v>

239
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.970
<v 4>And it seemed a just right for that case.</v>

240
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.150
<v 11>I don't know how many hours and hours and hours and hours they tried to find</v>

241
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.090
Nally. They found these low that they used to use against the

242
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.410
[inaudible] [inaudible] pirates. Vida. Thank you. Pirates. Yeah.

243
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.020
Would a pirates have to do with anything? Oh, who yet? What? What?

244
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.520
Are you straight to me or do you want to go kill?

245
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.470
It's a handoff to someone answering my questions. Sure. By the way,

246
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.380
I'm Chelsea pageant a reporter and yes, this story has to do with pirates.

247
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.620
Definitely. We'll get there before that.

248
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.900
There's this even crazier background. Okay. You gotta you gotta buy it.

249
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.070
You gotta go with me on this journey because you know, it's, it's, it's, it's,

250
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.180
it's a lot different. [inaudible] the rest of the story.

251
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.340
So ready to go on this journey. Take my hand.

252
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.830
We'll go into a little a belt

253
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.280
all the way back in 1784 granola and a banana.

254
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.280
This is William Casto, he's a law professor at Texas Tech.

255
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.760
He told me this story and it's really a story of like, like,

256
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.790
yeah, here's the situation.

257
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.580
It's 1784 you've got this guy, Mr Delong Champs,

258
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.170
Charles Julian Delong chumps and he's a French guy and he's living in Philly.

259
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.600
He was,

260
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.400
apparently it was an officer in a French cavalry regiment and a nobleman by

261
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.730
birth, by the way. Some people didn't like him.

262
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.810
Thomas Jefferson said he's an obs quote,

263
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.770
obscure and worthless character. Okay. Why? Why do you say that?

264
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.550
It doesn't matter. What's important is that he is here in America,

265
00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:01.990
has a bad reputation and he ends up meeting this guy, girl,

266
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.870
a nice young Quaker girl,

267
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.640
a quote Eris to a competent fortune. Oh yeah.

268
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:14.850
And her friends disapproved very much so and so they started circulating rumors

269
00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:22.210
around town around Philadelphia that long. John was a liar,

270
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:27.100
that he was not of noble birth and wasn't even an officer and he was just

271
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.430
probably gold digging, you know, since she had this money,

272
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.640
delong shops is really mad about this.

273
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.640
He was incensed and he put on his uniform that he stormed over to the French

274
00:17:39.131 --> 00:17:42.250
embassy. He goes to the embassy.

275
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.240
Larry spoke with Francoise, Barb Mar Bois,

276
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.330
another French guy who was the embassy's first secretary.

277
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.930
And here's an aside. Yeah.

278
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.860
Marwan later was Napoleon's minister of finance. Oh,

279
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.970
and he negotiated the Louisiana purchase.

280
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.430
But that's just an aside point is mar Bois is like unimportant dude.

281
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.760
But you know the other French guy, delong chomps, the maybe scoundrel guy,

282
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:12.150
he walks in and he's like, I guess he doesn't show a lot of respect. He's like,

283
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.330
you know, I need you to drop everything and help me out with this situation.

284
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.830
Cause people are spreading rumors about me.

285
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.950
They're saying I'm not a noblemen or whatever. I need you to stand up for me.

286
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.600
And Martin Bois refused. We don't know why. At any rate,

287
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:29.250
in response long, chomp shouted at Marwan I'll translate it.

288
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.500
I will dishonor you. And then he called him,

289
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.370
and this is a translation, a laughable scam,

290
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.093
which is kind of,

291
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.690
can you imagine people calling someone a laughable scam today?

292
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.350
It seems tame, honestly, Very Tang.

293
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.230
But those words would create a national crisis.

294
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.423
[inaudible]

295
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.610
the fact everything we're talking about today goes back to this little

296
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.660
confrontation.

297
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.710
How white sibling honor was this big deal back in the tape.

298
00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:09.710
Like it's why Hamilton dies, right?

299
00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:13.160
Something like calling someone a laughable scamp Ooh. Could cause a death.

300
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.830
You know what I mean? Like that's the kind of thing you do a duel over.

301
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.520
It was an indignity. Marvel.

302
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:21.170
I was so pissed at the moment and he did the right thing in that time period,

303
00:19:21.171 --> 00:19:25.340
which is instead of having a dual with the man, he contacted his bosses,

304
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.240
he wrote a letter, you know, across the scenes to France and said, y'all,

305
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.670
what are we gonna do about this? Now the French don't like what's going on.

306
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.120
The French want us to put him on a ship back to France and have France punish

307
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.520
their long champs. And the, uh,

308
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.910
Pennsylvania executive council agreed,

309
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.680
but the judges refuse. They say, we're not gonna do that. That's ridiculous.

310
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.710
All that causes France to say, you know what,

311
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.390
if we can't be sure that America is going to take care of this,

312
00:19:58.391 --> 00:19:59.710
that they're going to punish this guy.

313
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.830
Maybe we can't take this brand new country. Seriously.

314
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.900
Maybe it's a land of no law. Uh, so it really escalate.

315
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.470
Yeah. Becomes this huge thing. And you got to keep in mind, at that time,

316
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.880
United States was a third world nation. We were weak.

317
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:20.881
France had been our buddy during the revolution and the feeling was we

318
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:24.730
desperately needed the help of other countries because we were just this baby

319
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:28.870
little country. By the way, the Dutch ambassador was furious too,

320
00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:32.530
because he said, if you don't punish long jobs,

321
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.190
I'm leaving the state. He actually threatened to leave the state.

322
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.930
It really created problems. So we had to do something.

323
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.620
But the question was what the national government had no authority whatsoever to

324
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:49.870
deal with or punish it, a personal,

325
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.580
lifelong jobs because it wasn't a crime to just say, I will dishonor you.

326
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.020
And even if it were,

327
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.070
the insult happened at what was essentially the French embassy.

328
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:05.071
Some have argued that that made it this a situation outside of the United

329
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.070
States. Oh, so I step in there and I'm a suddenly under the rules of friends.

330
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.230
Yeah, yeah. That's the argument. You know,

331
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.270
did we have jurisdiction over that space?

332
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.530
Did we not point is that the new US government, they were just powerless.

333
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.550
They didn't know what to do. What happened? Well, so the case goes to court.

334
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.160
The judge, in that case he's trying to figure out what to do.

335
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.560
He's in a really bad political situation.

336
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.770
He's got to punish this guy and he's looking at his books, no law,

337
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.540
he's got no laws to charge this guy vendor. And then it occurs to him. You know,

338
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.930
there are some other laws that aren't explicitly written down,

339
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.010
but that all people across the world agree are bad things.

340
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.490
All nations agree that this is bad and can be punished.

341
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.900
And the classic example of that is pirates.

342
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.530
Pirates are out there on the open seas, are pillaging, pondering, killing,

343
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.800
and they are not really subject to any one nation's laws.

344
00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:03.510
They're not doing this in a nation.

345
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.290
No one had specific jurisdiction over them and going all the way back to Roman

346
00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:10.950
times, pirates were designated as universal enemies.

347
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.930
The hostess who money generous,

348
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.720
that same l Moines history professor at Yale University,

349
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.430
<v 12>the phrase in Latin is hostess who? Moni generous,</v>

350
00:22:19.431 --> 00:22:23.300
which means the enemy of the human kind or race.

351
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.860
And it means that maybe there's things that are so heinous.

352
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.390
Um,

353
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:34.100
you don't have to pass a law to make them illegal and you don't have to be

354
00:22:34.101 --> 00:22:35.420
empowered to,

355
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.450
to stop or punish the perpetrator of such crimes because they're just so bad.

356
00:22:40.821 --> 00:22:42.980
And piracy was the classic example.

357
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.740
<v 11>Okay.</v>

358
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.740
So what the judge decides is that this French guy in Philadelphia who insults

359
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:52.570
the fancy French guy in Philadelphia,

360
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.680
the way that we're going to solve this is by saying that the insulator,

361
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.370
he's a little bit like a pirate. No, he doesn't use the term pirates,

362
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:02.620
but it's the same concept. He said that that guy,

363
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:06.580
delong Trump has broken international norms.

364
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.960
He is guilty of an atrocious violation of the law of nations.

365
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:13.240
He not only fronts the sovereign he represents,

366
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.970
but also hurts the common safety and wellbeing of nations.

367
00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:19.870
He is guilty of a crime against the whole world and that's a quote from the

368
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:20.290
ruling.

369
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.290
They then find him a hundred French crowns and two years in jail,

370
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.670
two years, two years per same odd for bays. I will dishonor you.

371
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.350
Wow. Okay. This move by the judge, it basically works.

372
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.280
I'm Mar Bois and fence feel good. Their honor's been protected.

373
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.560
The Dutch ambassador doesn't leave. He stays.

374
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.360
But more importantly for our story,

375
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.940
in 1789 congress passes some of their very first laws.

376
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:51.410
There's like this one big bill about courts and in there is this thing called

377
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:53.540
the alien tort statute,

378
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.990
the Alien Tort Statute. You know,

379
00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:01.010
it was written into law to deal with this kind of situation where a diplomat is

380
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.350
insulted or attacked or something like that,

381
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.330
but more generally it was meant to connect us law to international law.

382
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.900
The law basically says, and I'm simplifying this a bunch,

383
00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:16.220
but it basically says like if somebody violates international norms, you know,

384
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:20.750
like a crime against the whole world, they can be sued in u s civil courts.

385
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:21.861
<v 0>Wait,</v>

386
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:26.370
you're saying there was a law from the beginning that allows a non u s people to

387
00:24:26.371 --> 00:24:30.510
sue each other for non u s crimes in u s courts? Yeah.

388
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.950
It's so weird. But, but like the thing is this is, this is Kelly again.

389
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.700
Hello Kelly. When it comes to this law, like forever, no one actually used it.

390
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.170
It was barely mentioned for 200 years. Why?

391
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.380
Why wouldn't it come up if you think about it though? It kind of makes sense.

392
00:24:46.381 --> 00:24:49.650
It wasn't used because it was a super specific law.

393
00:24:49.651 --> 00:24:52.860
Like this was a weird circumstance in which we really needed to bring

394
00:24:52.861 --> 00:24:57.150
international law and use it inside our borders. But that kind of thing,

395
00:24:57.151 --> 00:25:01.440
like diplomatic fights, like that didn't happen very often. Yeah.

396
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.680
And more generally the prevailing idea at the time was that internationally we

397
00:25:07.201 --> 00:25:08.850
should kind of stay in our lane. Like,

398
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.570
if you're gonna come into our country and mess with our citizens, like, yeah,

399
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:14.040
we're going to do something about that.

400
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:17.550
But if you want to do something to your own citizens,

401
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.300
that's not my business.

402
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.080
<v 13>There's an old idea that in every country the government can do to its people,</v>

403
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:30.840
whatever it wants. And nobody in any foreign country,

404
00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:33.780
no foreign government has any business telling them what to do.

405
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.120
<v 0>This is Eric Posner,</v>

406
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.730
<v 13>professor of law at the University of Chicago.</v>

407
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.371
<v 0>And he says,</v>

408
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:42.030
the reason that the alien tort statute was pretty much ignored is because of

409
00:25:42.031 --> 00:25:42.750
this idea,

410
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.120
<v 13>this idea of sovereignty</v>

411
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.240
<v 0>that we're not going to tell you what to do in your borders.</v>

412
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.820
So don't you come into our country and tell us what to do.

413
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.220
<v 13>Most people don't know this,</v>

414
00:25:51.221 --> 00:25:56.200
but there was actually a humanitarian basis for this harsh sounding principle

415
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.850
<v 0>came about in the 17th century. He says,</v>

416
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.920
<v 13>the problem back in the 17th century were a religious wars.</v>

417
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.870
<v 0>Protestants invade the Catholics, Catholics invade the Protestants,</v>

418
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.930
<v 13>you know, endless strife. And so the idea was, um,</v>

419
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.360
let's simplify things and just understand that in foreign countries people have

420
00:26:14.581 --> 00:26:18.600
different values and ideas and it's just not practical or good in the long run.

421
00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:22.530
If we try to tell people in foreign countries how they should behave,

422
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.700
and this was the dominant view for hundreds of years

423
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.730
<v 0>until World War II really, but</v>

424
00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.550
<v 13>the Holocaust changed everything. No words can express the world.</v>

425
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.150
At Germany's organized Carney,

426
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:41.570
one of the defenses that Nazis gave to the specific charge of massacring Jews is

427
00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:47.230
that they're protected by the principle of sovereignty. That was, uh, you know,

428
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.350
considered an unacceptable argument.

429
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.820
And countries around the world basically agreed that limits had to be put on

430
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:57.240
sovereignty and those limits would be known as human rights.

431
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.330
<v 14>And just a few years later, in 1948,</v>

432
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.330
you get the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

433
00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.970
<v 15>on which the organized can be a little nice, my,</v>

434
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.370
the declaration of him and rights.

435
00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.730
<v 16>And suddenly all eyes turn to human rights. It's a golden moment.</v>

436
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.510
Professor Samuel Mine again, he says, if you fast forward to the seventies

437
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.360
<v 4>Americans having fought Vietnam,</v>

438
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.420
having solid themselves and doing so want to bring human rights to the world

439
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.980
<v 14>and the human rights movement was very exciting. You know,</v>

440
00:27:36.981 --> 00:27:41.600
there were rock concerts and gentlemen, a lot of famous people, you know, it's

441
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.890
Joan Baez and a lot of, you know,

442
00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:49.670
rock stars and pop culture icons get involved.

443
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:54.110
[inaudible] the notion international amnesty wins the peace prize peace prize

444
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.120
for 1972. So, um,

445
00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.100
as long as I am prejudiced Jimmy Carter's and fighting the government of the

446
00:28:01.101 --> 00:28:05.150
United States dissidents from eastern Europe to visit the White House and you

447
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:10.010
throughout the world to enhance human rights, it's a lit,

448
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.600
it's a new cause that's very exciting to a lot of people and rightly so.

449
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:19.400
<v 4>It would be great if America could make the world a better place.</v>

450
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:31.400
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

451
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.670
<v 16>so this brings us back to Dali.</v>

452
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.700
So I came and met Peter in Peter Weiss for constitutional rights,

453
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.160
trying to figure out how to bring dallies case to u s courts.

454
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.150
That's the context. America is having this moment with human rights.

455
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.580
And we want to bring it to the rest of the world.

456
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.690
So when someone in Peter's office suggest using this old little law to get

457
00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:56.660
justice for Dolly, it seems obvious like of course.

458
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.590
<v 4>So I called an emergency meeting of the center staff.</v>

459
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.420
<v 16>Basically their idea was that some crimes like piracy were so bad that the</v>

460
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:12.510
borders didn't matter. Like anyone should be able to prosecute them.

461
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.990
And the U s should be able to bring these people to court on behalf of the

462
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:16.824
world.

463
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.470
<v 4>Would I?</v>

464
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:22.280
I have to tell you that the majority of you are calling status on where you were

465
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.840
slightly insane. Did your boss say like what? Yeah.

466
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.960
People said you're never gonna get anywhere with this.

467
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.040
It's all about Paraguard.

468
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160
<v 16>So Dolly's lawyers,</v>

469
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.900
they filed their papers and eventually this case gets in front of a federal

470
00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:36.734
circuit court.

471
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.650
<v 4>So the federal court, Eastern District [inaudible] Glenn,</v>

472
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.520
<v 16>in the day of the trial, you saw Pena in the elevator</v>

473
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.260
<v 0>at court.</v>

474
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.120
<v 10>Yes, I met [inaudible] and I asked him,</v>

475
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.860
why do you do that to my brother? Why did you do that to him?

476
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.290
Why he couldn't answer? He was shaking

477
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.340
anyway. We were in the car. He [inaudible]

478
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:11.230
<v 0>what in the court. They submitted autopsy reports. We ran their photographer</v>

479
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.980
<v 10>for, for for Tog rougher pictures. We,</v>

480
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:20.010
we bring a picture of him with the mattress or Lita was in the mattress time,

481
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.010
their feet and the hands. Ladies.

482
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.530
<v 0>And Peter says that after he made his argument, an interesting thing happened.</v>

483
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.480
<v 4>When I finished my argument,</v>

484
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.610
the judge started to go back to his chambers and before he got out of the code

485
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.260
from, he turned around and said,

486
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.620
interesting case.

487
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:46.610
<v 0>Hm. Ooh. So what happened? Well, the judge ruled against them.</v>

488
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.500
Ah, but they appeal.

489
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.440
<v 4>It goes up to the second circuit</v>

490
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.580
<v 0>and ultimately a judge orders Pena to pay $10 million to Dolly and her family,</v>

491
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.890
they won. Yeah.

492
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.643
<v 10>What happened</v>

493
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.490
<v 12>was like a miracle.</v>

494
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:10.190
I was able to get justice in United States in the Florida case.

495
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.840
They convinced the second circuit that the alien tort statute,

496
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.470
it wasn't just for stuffy diplomats anymore, was for human rights period.

497
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:21.530
They say, look,

498
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.840
torture isn't now like piracy and this ruling sets off and then we're off to the

499
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:27.350
races.

500
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:28.850
<v 16>An explosion of cases.</v>

501
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.660
I mean in 1984 you had Taliban v,

502
00:31:32.661 --> 00:31:37.430
Libyan Arab Republic and east I believe, or 85 the Soviet Union, Ben Dardo,

503
00:31:37.431 --> 00:31:42.380
the USSR. In 87 there was a case from Argentina called 40 v Suarez Mason.

504
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.030
He Swan, therefore 1991 Guatemala, 1993, Ecuador and Peru,

505
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.120
95 former Yugoslavia in 1999. Sheila [inaudible].

506
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.300
Basically what you saw in the eighties and nineties and into the early two

507
00:32:05.301 --> 00:32:10.301
thousands is that cases from all over the world started just like flooding into

508
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:11.780
American court.

509
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.140
<v 12>The reason this statute is so important is that it, it's American law.</v>

510
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.220
It gives American lawyers who want to use their legal training,

511
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.280
something to do as part of this because lawyers can save the world while

512
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.030
practicing law.

513
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.880
<v 16>Since looking at the role of the TS, um,</v>

514
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.730
it's hard to underestimate just how much impact it's had.

515
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.660
This is Katherine Gallagher also from the Center for constitutional rights.

516
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.523
The [inaudible]

517
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:44.530
<v 17>statute over the last 35 years has become the source of almost all six,</v>

518
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.860
<v 16>the African human rights litigation in the United States and indeed in the</v>

519
00:32:50.861 --> 00:32:51.580
world.

520
00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:56.500
And that's John Bellinger legal advisor for the Department of state from 2005 to

521
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:58.500
2009 before filler Dukkha,

522
00:32:58.501 --> 00:33:03.460
there was very little that victims of human rights violations could do.

523
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.930
There were a lot of folks,

524
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:09.880
especially in the American legal system who felt like America had never been a

525
00:33:09.881 --> 00:33:11.500
greater force for good in the world.

526
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:18.580
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

527
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.630
<v 16>but the rest of the world wasn't so sure.</v>

528
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.483
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

529
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.670
<v 17>that's coming up. Yeah. Perfect. We'll continue in a moment.</v>

530
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.983
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

531
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.170
<v 0>cut</v>

532
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:54.170
<v 18>a new podcast about juvenile justice from w NYC studios follows a group of kids</v>

533
00:33:54.271 --> 00:33:57.360
as they navigate their way through our criminal justice system.

534
00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.950
These aren't stories about innocence. They ask once the kid is caught,

535
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.120
what happens next?

536
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.570
I don't want to even wish like jail on nobody like cause there's not a nice

537
00:34:06.571 --> 00:34:10.860
place to be because if you do something or say something wrong and you're going

538
00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:14.370
to get in more trouble or like down on copyright, the host of caught,

539
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.420
listen and subscribe to caught [inaudible]

540
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.820
<v 0>wherever you get your podcasts,</v>

541
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.430
this is more perfect. I'm jet out. Boom. Run back to the two KPS,

542
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.670
Kelsey paget and Kelly prime. Here's Kelly, where we left it.

543
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.400
Florida just happened. We had an explosion of cases.

544
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.700
American human rights lawyers were feeling really good about themselves.

545
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:38.510
But diplomacy is a delicate thing.

546
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.460
<v 17>Many foreign governments, uh,</v>

547
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.810
including many Western democracies. That's John Ballenger again,

548
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.300
Great Britain, Australia, Germany,

549
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:52.390
Switzerland would regularly complain to me as the legal advisor of the State

550
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:58.450
Department that they thought that the alien tort statute was in fact itself a

551
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:03.941
violation of international law because it allowed us judges to have jurisdiction

552
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.100
over actions that had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.

553
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.000
<v 0>But instead of dialing it back, human rights lawyers,</v>

554
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.660
they decided why not push it even further?

555
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.040
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

556
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.590
<v 16>so around 1995, they made a big leap.</v>

557
00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:30.160
They decided that instead of just going after individuals like foreign

558
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:31.060
government officials,

559
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.050
they were going to use this law to go after foreign corporations.

560
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.780
When the first alien tort statute cases were filed against corporations,

561
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.800
these cases were really seen as, um,

562
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.540
slightly crazy. How can you do this? These are corporations.

563
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.690
These are not governments. These are not dictators.

564
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.880
How can you see them under this law?

565
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:59.060
But what human rights lawyers said was [inaudible] Dolly's case showed us that

566
00:35:59.061 --> 00:36:01.010
this law is about modern day pirates.

567
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.390
What better example of pirates do we have nowadays than multinational

568
00:36:05.391 --> 00:36:08.090
corporations? If you want to go all the way,

569
00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:12.530
you could say do these big massive entities that just can reach out their

570
00:36:12.531 --> 00:36:15.920
tentacles into any country and they float between jurisdictions,

571
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.100
move from one to the next to the next and come a brutal crimes.

572
00:36:19.101 --> 00:36:23.510
Like sometimes they empower dictators to commit those crimes and when you try

573
00:36:23.511 --> 00:36:25.730
and pin them down, like when you want to hold them accountable,

574
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.490
they can just vanish.

575
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.530
<v 11>So yeah, all of that sounds, you know, really abstract.</v>

576
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.090
For me, it didn't really register like why you would go after a corporation.

577
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.020
Until I heard this story, the story of Ken, Sarah Wheela.

578
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.290
<v 2>I mean I grew up in a political household that my father was a,</v>

579
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.910
was a national figure because he was a writer and a commentator in newspapers.

580
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.480
<v 11>Just like Dolly. Ken had this famously outspoken dad, very much a social critic.</v>

581
00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.910
He was a famous thorn in the side of the regime.

582
00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.530
The regime in this case is this military dictatorship in Nigeria.

583
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.623
<v 2>You Use eve?</v>

584
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.860
The military depends on the civilian democratically elected president sugary in

585
00:37:08.861 --> 00:37:13.570
the eighties and nineties Nigeria went through a series of military coups and

586
00:37:13.571 --> 00:37:18.571
Ken's dad who actually wrote a sitcom that was like very famous,

587
00:37:18.641 --> 00:37:20.290
millions of people around the country watched it.

588
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.870
He would make jokes about the regimes.

589
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.070
He would write articles about them and you know the subject of his birth,

590
00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:29.470
his columns and his and his television program,

591
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.710
the inequalities of Nigeria's political system.

592
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.340
<v 11>The situation at the time in Nigeria was that you had tons of oil under the</v>

593
00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:41.870
ground [inaudible] estimated $30 billion worth of oil and in order for the

594
00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:45.290
military regime to get that out, they partnered with a division of shell

595
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.120
<v 2>shell companies in my jewelry, right.</v>

596
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.430
I'll supplying domestic gas and generating electricity from was

597
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.070
<v 11>the people who lived on the land where the oil was,</v>

598
00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:00.940
they're really poor and they weren't given barely any of this money

599
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.711
<v 2>against that.</v>

600
00:38:02.711 --> 00:38:07.711
To add insult to injury on Chet oil production or was creating an environmental

601
00:38:08.591 --> 00:38:09.970
disaster in our community.

602
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
What we're working on now is crude oil and this land is lost or the next

603
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:16.660
thousand years,

604
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.560
this is a clip of kin's father showing a reporter ruined farmlands and oil pipe

605
00:38:20.561 --> 00:38:24.610
burst here in 1970 oil still seeps to the surface.

606
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.630
Nothing is going to grow here. You know, it's, it's, it's,

607
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.030
the land has been devastated by all production in some places.

608
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:36.031
Surface water contains 900 times the accepted level of which causes

609
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.780
<v 11>cancer. So Ken's Dad, you know, he was writing articles about this,</v>

610
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:44.950
he was speaking out about it, but eventually he decided that wasn't enough.

611
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.420
And uh, and I decided,

612
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:48.730
I think in the late eighties that he was going to take to this

613
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.583
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

614
00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.280
<v 19>indigenous people have been cheated [inaudible] laws</v>

615
00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.560
<v 11>in 1993 organized Ogoni Day where 300,000 people came out to protest.</v>

616
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.310
<v 19>We are going to demand that rights, this swollen one violently.</v>

617
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:07.870
And we shot with

618
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:13.920
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

619
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.820
<v 20>over the next month. The protests kept going, they escalated as tension,</v>

620
00:39:17.821 --> 00:39:22.170
increased an oil worker was badly beaten and then shell pulled out of the region

621
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.750
resulting in the closure of oil operations in the area.

622
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:29.490
And they took millions of dollars with them and the government depended almost

623
00:39:29.491 --> 00:39:34.380
solely on the revenues from that one economic activity. And so

624
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.380
<v 11>not long after the protests,</v>

625
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:42.100
Ken's dad was thrown into jail and can junior, he,

626
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.650
he begins frantically traveling the world trying to raise awareness about his

627
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:47.960
dad's situation to publicly put pressure on,

628
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.000
on general a bash and an IJ is head of state. And on November 10th, 1995,

629
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:55.310
two years after his dad had been arrested,

630
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.620
Ken is at this international conference,

631
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.680
New Zealand trying to sort of lobby world leaders and he says that after dinner

632
00:40:02.841 --> 00:40:05.510
he just got this funny feeling walking,

633
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:10.190
walking across one of the streets and I just saw the sunset that evening.

634
00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:11.660
It was a beautiful sunset actually.

635
00:40:11.661 --> 00:40:15.920
Those are those a big Red Sun just sinking into the day.

636
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.570
And um

637
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.873
<v 5>hm.</v>

638
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.580
<v 11>I felt something going in my chest</v>

639
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.690
<v 2>and I think I knew</v>

640
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.883
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

641
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:38.730
<v 2>I knew then that something had happened. Ken, sorry, we weren't writer.</v>

642
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.170
Human rights activist campaigner on behalf of his fellow tribesmen hang this

643
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.220
morning in a Nigerian prison.

644
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.850
Ken says that world leaders spoke out the prime minister of England,

645
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.290
even Nelson Mandela on, and it was to no avail. Nothing happened,

646
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.200
but it's difficult to know what to do with all of that.

647
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.290
<v 11>How'd you, how'd you get justice for what? What happened to your father?</v>

648
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:02.910
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

649
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.670
<v 11>you could argue, and this is what lawyers' leader did,</v>

650
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:10.540
argue that the only way to get justice was, was not to go after the regime,

651
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.250
but to go after Shell and its parent company, Royal Dutch Petroleum.

652
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.360
In going after Shell,

653
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:20.740
they claimed that they helped the Nigerian government do some horrendous things.

654
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:25.420
They claimed that shell aided and abetted the Nigerian government and kidnapping

655
00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:29.650
and torture and [inaudible] directly did this stuff or, or aided and embedded.

656
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.410
So the claim is that they would supply guns, that they actually supply guns.

657
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:37.130
Well actually the allegation, the claim is that a, it's just ammo,

658
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.850
but still that's an, that's not right. That's, and there were other things too,

659
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:45.500
like they claimed that Shell would call in a dis sort of special forces unit of

660
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.510
the Nigerian government that that colloquially everybody was calling the kill

661
00:41:48.511 --> 00:41:51.290
and go mob. Oh they're claiming shell is calling it hits. Yeah.

662
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:53.150
Basically that Shell was like, you know,

663
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:56.420
hand in hand with the government on this. Of course, Sheldon eyes, all this.

664
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.890
And in 2002 people like Ken who had lost brothers,

665
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.610
was family, you know, and also surviving victims of all this violence.

666
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:08.570
They banded together with some American lawyers and brought a case under the

667
00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:09.530
alien tort statute.

668
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.980
They alleged that Shell was essentially the hostess who Mani Generous the enemy

669
00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:15.910
of,

670
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:20.910
of the human kind or race and therefore could be tried in American courts.

671
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.980
Yeah. And as you can imagine, they got pushed back in this case,

672
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:28.040
got challenged all the way up to the supreme court.

673
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.600
<v 16>We will hear argument first this morning in case 10 1491 he obo versus Royal</v>

674
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.710
Dutch petroleum. Okay. This case was actually argued twice about,

675
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:38.330
we're combining them here for simplicity.

676
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.320
So the basic issue in this case seemed really simple at first.

677
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.930
Can you use this law against corporations?

678
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.090
Like if you read the Florida decision,

679
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:51.470
the torture has become like the pirate and slave trader before him.

680
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.420
An enemy of all mankind.

681
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.650
This is justice Kagan actually reading from the Florida decision and saying,

682
00:42:57.651 --> 00:43:01.520
you know, we gave the stamp of approval. The courts have said this is okay.

683
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.630
There were certain categories of offenders, the word today's pirates.

684
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.810
So the question was our corporations in that category,

685
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.930
can they be considered today's pirates?

686
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.750
<v 21>The principle issue before this court is whether a corporation can ever be held</v>

687
00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:20.370
liable for violating fundamental human rights norms under the alien tort

688
00:43:20.371 --> 00:43:21.070
statute. Okay,

689
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.160
<v 16>Paul Hoffman, the lawyer representing the Nigerians bringing the case</v>

690
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:27.800
<v 21>and and, well, let me start by saying that the,</v>

691
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.740
the international human rights norms that are at the basis of this case,

692
00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:35.620
<v 16>like all the terrible crimes that we've all already agreed are crimes against</v>

693
00:43:35.621 --> 00:43:36.360
humanity.

694
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.530
<v 21>All of those using the rights norms are defined by actions.</v>

695
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.160
They're not defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a corporation

696
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.790
<v 16>in a Florida says that tortures are today's pirates.</v>

697
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.320
What about a group of tortures? What about pirates and corporates?

698
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.090
<v 14>Do you think in the 18th century,</v>

699
00:43:55.150 --> 00:44:00.150
if they brought pirates incorporated and we get all there and gold and the black

700
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:03.100
beard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me, it's the corporation.

701
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.810
Do you think that a, they would have then said, oh, it's icy.

702
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.740
It's a cooperation. Goodbye. Go home.

703
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.380
<v 16>That's justice briar.</v>

704
00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:15.670
Basically agreeing that in this case to differentiate between like a corporation

705
00:44:15.671 --> 00:44:18.640
doing bad things and a person doing bad things, it's, it's kind of silly.

706
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.980
<v 14>This case clearly struck justice briar powerfully.</v>

707
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.190
The question to me is who are today's pirates? He says,

708
00:44:25.191 --> 00:44:29.420
Adolf Hitler was like a pirate. Hitler is the pirate who is there,

709
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:32.480
the dread pirates of our, and we have treaties

710
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.490
<v 21>that say there is universal jurisdiction.</v>

711
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:39.670
The alien twist Fascia as it was applied to human rights cases from Florida on

712
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.800
is part of a trend in, in the world today.

713
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:47.300
The trend in the world today is towards universal justice.

714
00:44:47.301 --> 00:44:51.890
For people that and and, and corporations that violate these kinds of norms.

715
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.630
That's the trend. In fact,

716
00:44:53.631 --> 00:44:57.320
the United States has been the leader in that our government has proclaimed our

717
00:44:57.321 --> 00:44:58.460
leadership position.

718
00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.580
We thought the argument went extremely well and we really did not see how we

719
00:45:05.361 --> 00:45:06.290
should lose,

720
00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.440
<v 0>but then it was shells turn.</v>

721
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.450
<v 12>The trouble is that the choice to pursue corporations semi mine again might've</v>

722
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.010
killed the goose that laid the golden eggs because on the one hand it makes

723
00:45:18.011 --> 00:45:22.420
sense to shift to corporations. They have the money. On the other hand,

724
00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:27.220
corporations will use their money to hire the best lawyers they can buy

725
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.280
<v 16>lawyers like the stolen Kathleen Sullivan,</v>

726
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.830
MR chief justice and may it please the court.

727
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.480
<v 0>When Kathleen Sullivan got up there,</v>

728
00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:38.320
she in the defense team basically sidestep the whole issue of whether

729
00:45:38.321 --> 00:45:41.320
corporations should or should not be considered pirates.

730
00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:44.110
Whether this law should or should not be applied to corporations,

731
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.630
they actually went bigger.

732
00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.490
They started talking about all the reasons why actually using the ATS for

733
00:45:51.491 --> 00:45:56.020
non-American crimes might be a really bad idea for anyone.

734
00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.760
It came down to three main points. One reciprocity.

735
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.810
<v 16>We fear that if we say that a United States court can be open to try any accused</v>

736
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.910
law of nations violator for anywhere in the world,

737
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:12.760
regardless of the place of the conduct the other nations of the world might see

738
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.790
to do the same to us. Basically,

739
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.880
if we can take people from other countries and try them in our courts,

740
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:22.560
what's stopping them from doing that to us should inform your decision today and

741
00:46:22.561 --> 00:46:26.550
the second point made by Shell through the offense to the principle against

742
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:30.240
international friction is that its highest international friction like this

743
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:33.720
could cause a diplomatic nightmare. You're basically saying other countries,

744
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.780
these judges that you didn't elect, we didn't like them either. Frankly,

745
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.520
I didn't vote for them. You didn't vote for them.

746
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:43.550
They were appointed and now they're going to be patrolling international law.

747
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:46.740
Are we really comfortable with that?

748
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.540
And I want to stress that our point is that the u s is projecting here our law

749
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.910
onto foreign countries and finally

750
00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:58.700
<v 0>and the statement of the case is really striking this case on the most basic</v>

751
00:46:58.701 --> 00:47:00.350
level. What does a case like that?

752
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:05.120
What business does a case like that have in the courts of the United States?

753
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:10.040
How is this any of our business, no connection to the United States whatsoever.

754
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.380
It's a point that really jive with Justice Alito.

755
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.110
Why does this case belong in the courts of the United States? Well,

756
00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:18.110
there's nothing to do with the United States other than in fact,

757
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.900
in a way a subsidiary. In that moment,

758
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.340
he sort of captured how America had shifted.

759
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.500
We didn't want to pretend to be that shining city on the hill anymore.

760
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.473
That was over.

761
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:38.110
<v 22>I have the opinion for the court and case number 10 1491 Keough bull and others</v>

762
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:41.390
versus Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and others.

763
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.220
<v 0>In the end,</v>

764
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.910
the court decided to rule in favor of Shell and Royal Dutch petroleum.

765
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.240
<v 12>The chief justice wrote the decision</v>

766
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:53.350
<v 22>Justice Story wrote in 1822 that no nation has ever yet pretended to be the</v>

767
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:55.670
customers more. I'm of the whole world,

768
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:59.270
the guardian of morals of the whole world. First,

769
00:47:59.271 --> 00:48:02.510
it's just a matter of common sense that when Congress passes a law,

770
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.900
it is passing the law that applies in the United States and not some other

771
00:48:05.901 --> 00:48:10.220
country unless the law tells us otherwise. Second,

772
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.440
regulating conduct abroad risks,

773
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:17.470
serious foreign policy consequences and courts are and should be reluctant to

774
00:48:17.751 --> 00:48:22.751
invite such consequences unless that is what Congress clearly intended and we

775
00:48:23.571 --> 00:48:24.310
see no reason.

776
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:29.310
<v 12>He says that extra territorial conduct conduct that's outside the United States</v>

777
00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.080
isn't going to count it.

778
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.590
There has to be some relationship to the United States.

779
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:40.330
<v 1>Basically they took the ATS and they clipped its wings. Do you feel like the,</v>

780
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.740
I'll tell you the reason that the thought brewing in my mind and I'm wondering

781
00:48:45.741 --> 00:48:48.590
if you would agree or you think it's stupid. Um, the,

782
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.160
the sense that I have with the ATS is that it came about at a moment of great

783
00:48:55.191 --> 00:49:00.020
idealism and hope [inaudible] and now after the fog is cleared, so to speak,

784
00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:05.570
it seems to represent not just hope but naive Tay [inaudible] the fact that we

785
00:49:05.571 --> 00:49:09.290
think we can change the world did it's that easy.

786
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.670
The ATS and Ha, it's falling out of favor somehow represents in a way,

787
00:49:13.671 --> 00:49:18.620
the way in which we fall had a kind of sober awakening. I wonder,

788
00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:20.300
do you feel like human rights

789
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.810
in the way we understood it is dead?

790
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.720
<v 12>No, it's, I think it's transformed our, our idealism,</v>

791
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:29.550
but maybe the,

792
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:34.500
the disaster and Keough ball was a moment of kind of stepping back to think a

793
00:49:34.501 --> 00:49:38.190
bit more broadly about how we can make the world a better place.

794
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:42.740
<v 0>And Samuel Moine says we do need to rethink some things. Frankly,</v>

795
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.190
it's a little dishonest to just pretend

796
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.440
<v 12>that America brings justice to the world.</v>

797
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.320
Air America was founded on the idea of human rights,

798
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.800
which was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded explicitly

799
00:49:54.801 --> 00:49:57.740
on such an idea, which is, is not really true. And,

800
00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.500
and as Dave presented their cases,

801
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:05.360
the human rights movement leaves out how much the United States has often been

802
00:50:05.361 --> 00:50:08.300
involved in the eval they're portraying in court.

803
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.570
<v 0>So at the very least,</v>

804
00:50:09.571 --> 00:50:13.920
he says that what this decision shows us is that before we run around judging

805
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.340
other countries, we should take a hard look at ourselves. Absolutely.

806
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.430
But more importantly,

807
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:23.140
<v 12>in the end, we can avoid the question, what's the Best Bang for our buck?</v>

808
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.710
It's just not proven yet that ATS is it

809
00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.080
<v 0>he all you really had</v>

810
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.230
<v 10>was a few individuals who won cases. And by the way,</v>

811
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.740
most of them never got any money. Really? Yeah.

812
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:40.320
Dolly didn't get paid. You know, after she won, Pena fled again.

813
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:45.450
And so in a way that alien tort statute didn't have far to fall to begin with.

814
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.620
Oh. So they're just symbolic victories.

815
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.460
<v 0>You could definitely see it that way. Do you feel like you got justice?</v>

816
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:56.000
Did what? Did you get after this? Yes. Yes. But Dolly,

817
00:50:56.001 --> 00:51:00.530
Florida doesn't, you didn't get any money back, correct?

818
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:04.400
<v 10>Yeah. But it never was for, for, for the money. This,</v>

819
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:09.570
the money won't pay who don't remove backward Leto I fine

820
00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:12.780
<v 0>that were Leto</v>

821
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.690
<v 10>no normal [inaudible]</v>

822
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:16.940
<v 0>yeah,</v>

823
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.770
<v 10>I know how to say that they named sometime, but that there was a reason.</v>

824
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.780
Yes, yes. I lost a brother,

825
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.300
but when we won that case,

826
00:51:31.301 --> 00:51:36.301
he in in knew your in United day I get so many other brothers and sisters

827
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:40.420
through all lover the war that they find

828
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.560
that Lito DVN diet

829
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.550
and don't leave for them.

830
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:26.650
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

831
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.870
<v 1>pretty serious. Kelsey Padgett and Kelly prime,</v>

832
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:34.660
so the debate about the ATS and the America's role in the world continues.

833
00:52:34.661 --> 00:52:38.110
The court just heard arguments in another ATS case.

834
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:40.570
This term it's called Jester v Arab Bank.

835
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.030
It's a suit brought by nearly 6,000 plaintiffs against a Jordan based bank

836
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.640
accused of financing terrorism.

837
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.920
Odds are that the court will use the case to further limit the ATS,

838
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.570
but that remains to be seen

839
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:18.230
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

840
