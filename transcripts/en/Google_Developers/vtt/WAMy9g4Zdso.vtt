00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.580
BRANDON BADGER: All right.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.460
Come on in.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.940
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.630
My name is Brandon.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.140
I can't tell you what my real
last name is, but let's just

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.060
say that it's Badger.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.780
I've worked for the NIA, and my
more recent cover is as a

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.370
"Product Manager" for Google.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.680
All of you in this room are
chosen, have been pre-screened

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.350
to share this confidential
information.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.770
As you can imagine, this is a
very sensitive topic for a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.490
corporation like Google since
we're dealing with mind

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.250
control viruses and shapeware
technology

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.080
from another dimension.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.750
It is very important that none
of this information leaks to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.580
the press, so for that reason,
the real Ingress Tech Talk,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.380
the official one, is happening
in Room Seven, but that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.110
government-censored talk will be
the one that's recorded and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.730
we'll get into the real details
here in this room.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.220
And we'll dive deeper into
rabbit hole in this room.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.440
But before we start, can I see a
show of hands of how many of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.790
you are members of
The Resistance?

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:16.740
All right.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.092
And how many of you are members
of The Enlightened?

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:23.950
[CHEERING]

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.250
BRANDON BADGER: All right.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.920
Now, you two settle down.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.750
I know this is a lot of Smurfs
and frogs in the same room,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.580
but this is considered neutral
territory during this talk.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.060
So I want all of you to put your
scanners in your pockets.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.070
It's very important
to not fire any

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.370
XMPs during this meeting.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.920
In the event that there is an
accidental XMP discharge,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.500
please exit the room swiftly but
calmly from the rear and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.430
any Level Eights can leave
with me through this more

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.040
secure door up front.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.990
All right.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.110
Let's get started.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.260
For the sake of this tech talk,
we're all just going to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.220
go under the premise that
Ingress is "just a game." And

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.750
I can't teach you all in 30
minutes all of the technical

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.210
aspects of building ingress, but
my goal today is more to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.550
spark your creativity and talk
about some of the product

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.250
design principles and lessons
learned that our team has had

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.980
developing Ingress.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.770
And my hope is that you will
leave Google I/O within

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.090
exposure to lots of new
technologies and Google Glass,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.710
all the other cool things that
you've seen today and will see

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.890
tomorrow, and that you also have
lots of creative ideas

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.300
for the next generations of
games that you yourselves and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.575
your friends can build using
this technology.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.570
So my first quote is that
"with change comes

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.990
opportunity." Throughout
history, we've had many

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.120
technological leaps forward.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.440
We had the semiconductor, we've
had the steam engine.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.100
If you go back further in
history, we have the time when

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.410
our ancestors first found the
obelisk and it kick started

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.660
our creativity.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.740
And humans have always played
games, but the way that we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.050
play games has evolved.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.520
So we might have started off
kicking rocks, and then it got

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.260
a little bit better and we could
bat a rubber ball around

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.180
in the king's court, and then
that turned into the digital

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.090
version upon of Pong.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.360
We get Nintendo tennis there.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.110
But as technology marches
forward, the gaming technology

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.610
marches forward in step with
that, and each generation of

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.550
games has its leaders.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.450
In one generation, it might
have been Atari.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.470
Later, it might have been
Nintendo, then Sony.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.370
But with each leap forward
in technology, there's

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.750
opportunities to take over, to
be a leader in that new space,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.025
to design whole new types
of gaming experiences.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.140
For example, there was a man
who in 1961, invented the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.390
transistor-transistor
logic circuit.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.810
And I'm sure that when he was
working on this for his

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.680
dissertation and invented this
technology, he wasn't doing it

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.390
so that we could play an
electronic version of tennis.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.610
But 10 years later, the gaming
industry was able to use this

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.040
technology and create a whole
new gaming experience.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.420
Things like the Wii Remote.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.800
Seemed like Nintendo was kind of
in a lull there, it was all

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.080
about the Sony PlayStation, but
they used this technology

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.640
to really come up with something
completely out of

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.200
the box and a whole new way of
playing games in a much more

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.130
physical manner.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.220
You had examples of the social
graph as a technological tool,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.700
being able to interact
with other people.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.650
Even though in this case, it was
limited to sharing virtual

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.730
baskets of corn or whatnot, so
I don't know how much of a

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.370
technological leap that was,
but there was something

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.150
powerful and being able to
interact with other people--

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.840
friends and your
mother-in-law--

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.040
as you play a game.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800
And it seems like the smartphone
generation just

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.540
came out of the blue as well.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.420
You had companies like Sony and
Nintendo who had really

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.560
dominated with consoles, and
they tried to have their

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.140
portable gaming devices.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.980
But all of a sudden your Nexus
device, your iPhone became a

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.170
much better gaming platform for
that type of snack type

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.290
gaming, and you had all the new
leaders like Angry Birds

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.650
create new experiences.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.040
So basically, I wanted to just
show you that there's these

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.410
technological leaps and each one
of those is an opportunity

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.960
for you and your company and
your friends to create

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.200
something that the world hasn't
seen before in gaming.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.650
We live in a really powerful
environment right now where

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.380
these smartphones are getting
out to the hands

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.950
of billions of people.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.940
So you have billions of people
now with this supercomputer,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.680
basically, in their pocket
that's connected to the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.210
network and it has all
sorts of sensors.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.960
It's got a proximity sensor
and a motion sensor, an

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.430
ambient light sensor gyroscopes,
NFC chips,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.060
cameras, GPS, Wi-Fi.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.120
These are all ingredients that
you guys are going to be able

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.720
to put together in whole new
ways to create whole new types

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.650
of experiences, and
we're really just

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.870
starting to tap into that.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.070
It's not all about just
doing Angry Birds.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.110
So I just want to really
challenge you guys to, as you

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.420
spend time in Google I/O today,
really think about the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.950
technology that you see whether,
it be Google Glass or

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.300
other devices.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.380
Just think through, what new
types of gaming experiences

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.770
can that make possible?

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.220
How can we experience
the world in a

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.530
different way via gaming?

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.740
I just want to take one step
back and just talk about why

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.590
do humans play, and why
is this a field

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.410
that should even matter?

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.040
There's so many other important
things in the world

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.850
that we could be using
technology for, but why does

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.920
play matter?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.140
First of all, play creates
new neural

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.990
connections in the brain.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.630
It helps us develop.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.390
I've got two twins
and it's amazing.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.430
They're five years old now, but
they can play Angry Birds

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.375
and Plants Versus Zombies and
all these different things,

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:17.390
and it's just it's a way to form
connections in the brain

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.950
and learn about our
environment.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.950
It's also an arena for social
interaction and learning.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.590
It's sort of on the schoolyard
where we learn how to make

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.590
friends and to confront that
bully and to make alliances

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.920
and factions and connect with
other human beings.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.810
That's an important social skill
for humans that we learn

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.060
while playing.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.770
It's also a safe place to
discover and develop talents

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.220
and skills.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.640
So sort of like in Ender's Game,
gaming can be a safe

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.360
environment or a safe simulation
for you to maybe

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.550
learn leadership skills.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.600
We've seen this in Ingress where
there's people who are

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.080
organizing their own events or
organizing the tactics of

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.800
their squadron or
their faction.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.200
It might be learning other types
of skills, how to just

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.410
organize plans and implement
those or execute events.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.920
So gaming really gives us a safe
environment where, if you

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.920
mess up, it's not that
big of a deal.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.490
You can restart the game.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.640
But you can still build these
skills and then use those

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.770
skills in your day
to day life.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.760
But in many ways, games
still fall short.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.870
So while they might make us
smarter, I don't really want

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.409
my twins to be playing video
games all day long

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.210
necessarily, right?

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.909
And I don't want my kids doing
that if it means they're going

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.030
to be sitting in the basement
eating Cheetos and playing

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.970
first person shooters all day,
tethered to a screen.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.680
So we wanted to think about,
how can we make gaming even

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.690
better for humanity and
more interesting?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.510
So that's where Niantic
Labs came into being.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.580
We're a small autonomous group
within Google, and we were

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.010
formed with this mission to
create adventures on foot.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.110
When we started off, the team
really wanted to explore

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.100
opportunities to use this
new technology--

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.850
things like Google Glass, things
like these smartphones

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.590
with really great maps behind
them, and really think about

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.630
how we could use augmented
reality to create a new gaming

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.900
experience.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.640
And honestly, we really
did want to get

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.380
people off the couch.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.700
It's a really important epidemic
in many developed

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.250
countries, just health and the
importance of getting out and

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.010
not being stuck to a chair.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.970
And also, to reconnect people
with their local community.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.110
So technology can bring us
together, but it can also

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.740
isolate us if the technology
isn't developed right where we

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.880
spend more and more time at
home at night playing with

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.440
virtual friends but
not really rubbing

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.690
shoulders with real people.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.420
We don't need to necessarily
be tethered to a desk by

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.100
technology.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.860
Technology should help
further our needs and

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.860
our goals as humans.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.400
It should make us better.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.680
We don't need to necessarily
adapt who we are as people to

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.610
the technology.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.950
I think there's a great
opportunity

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.770
for contextual computing.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.350
So when I was a kid, I would
write a book report about a

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.030
European city or I might
just read a book about

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.300
it and write something.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.410
But how much better is it to
actually visit that city but

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.580
then have at your fingertips
access to the world's greatest

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.000
encyclopedia of information
about exactly

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840
where you're standing?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.910
So at your fingertips, the
information about that

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.250
sculpture, that statue, that
mural that you're right in

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.540
front, and how interesting could
it be that that's maybe

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.220
pushed to you?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.890
You don't even know that you're
interested in that

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.550
sculpture, but this smart system
can basically detect

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.590
that you're standing near
something that we think that

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.620
you might be interested in
and be able to push that

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.465
notification to you.

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:02.200
And for you to have an aha
moment is very powerful as a

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.840
concept to us.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.250
Here's an example of someone at
a historical grave marker

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.340
to be able to pull up more
information about that person.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.720
So it's another way to not
only connect with people

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.260
around us, but also connect
with our history and our

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.410
culture, which is also
very important.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.830
And this is just a funny joke.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.590
I don't even know who created
it, but someone on the

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.020
internet posted this to G+.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.720
The mom is telling the kid,
go outside and play.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.600
And he's like, but I don't have
my Ingress invite yet.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.390
So we definitely wanted to try
to build a gaming experience

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.880
that would get kids and adults
and families back out into

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.640
their neighborhoods and out,
honestly burning calories and

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.370
exercising.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.050
Another goal was this feeling
that we could get people out

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.650
into their neighborhood
and connecting

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.080
with their local community.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.660
So there was a really touching
post that one of the Ingress

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.510
players posted about
this park.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.270
This is a park in Las Vegas, and
I guess he had lived there

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.620
for six years but had never
gone into this park.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.280
It wasn't in good repair, it was
closed at night, it wasn't

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.470
seen as safe.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.230
But as soon as he started
playing Ingress, of course

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.530
there were some sculptures in
this park, and so there were

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.000
some portals in our game.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.290
So he went through that park
for the first time and he

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.280
discovered it was actually a
nice, quiet green space in his

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.210
city, but now he
cared about it.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.630
Now he wanted to talk to his
city councilmen about, hey,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.000
maybe we can clean
up the graffiti.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.750
Maybe we can work to keep
it open at night.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.990
And so I think there's a real
opportunity that when you get

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.050
out of your basement and you
start intermingling with other

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.590
people in your local community,
that you start

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.860
caring about the locations
in your community.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.070
So that was another important
goal for our project.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.250
So let me tell you about-- it
seems like you guys are all

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.950
into Ingress, but for the few
of you who haven't played it

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.730
and don't know what I've been
talking about for the last 10

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.960
minutes, I'll briefly go through
what Ingress is, and

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.740
then I'll talk about some of the
design principles and what

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.100
we've learned building it.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.960
So the world around you
is not as it seems.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.520
The whole point of Ingress is
that there's this veil that

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.420
blocks our vision about what's
really happening, and those of

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.680
you who are chosen and are sort
of part of this secret

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.040
society have the technology to
be able to unlock and see

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.630
what's happening beneath the
covers, and basically play the

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.540
game of Ingress throughout
your daily life.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.940
So the fiction here is that
there's a mysterious energy

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.830
that has been unearthed by a
team of scientists, and really

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.980
its purpose and force is
unknown, and it has a way of

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.690
influencing us.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.070
It's said that it's actually
what sparks the creativity in

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.490
the minds of artists.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.380
When they go to create a
sculpture, that creative

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.750
influence comes from the XM
that flows around there.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.470
And in Ingress, there's of
course the two sides.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.390
There's The Enlightened who seek
to embrace the power that

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.920
this energy may bestow
upon us.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.810
They like the idea that as
humans, we can evolve, we can

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.270
get better.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.950
And then The Resistance.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.540
They struggle to defend and
protect what in their mind is

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.250
left of our humanity.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.360
They really want to keep
us who we are.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.380
They feel like we don't
need to change.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.310
And really, the idea here is
that the world is a game.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.390
So instead of just playing on
a small virtual world or a

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.140
virtual board, we really
have the whole globe.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.860
That was one of the powerful
aspects of our game was

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.410
launching it worldwide, and
it's so fun to see the

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.450
international nature
of the game.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.150
Basically, as you walk around in
the real world, you pick up

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.660
the XM, the energy to power
your technology.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.900
You visit these portals or these
public art installations

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.810
and you do battle for control
of these locations.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.550
And one of the interesting
things as we were designing

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.450
the game was thinking about,
well, what should be the

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.190
locations that people
can test?

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.820
And I think it was interesting
that we picked public art.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.560
It worked out well because they
tend to be in locations

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.890
that are accessible, usually
day or night,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.650
relatively safe locations.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.720
And also, it's just a bonus that
they're very interesting

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.720
and oftentimes overlooked.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.770
I've noticed that by playing
Ingress, all of a sudden, I'm

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.950
noticing sculptures that I never
would have seen before

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.360
because my eyes are opened
to looking for that.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.100
And it's a cool experience to
find something new in your

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.490
neighborhood.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.150
Maybe you've walked that street
hundreds of times but

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.230
never really looked about what
you were walking past.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.370
So it was an interesting synergy
there to combine this

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.360
game element of a portal
with real world art.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.490
And then the basics
of the strategy.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.800
It continues to evolve and get
more interesting and complex,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.500
but the basics of it are to
control these locations on the

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.360
map and then create lines or
links between them which can

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.220
form a triangle, which
is a Control Field.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.450
And the idea is that you're
trying to control the minds of

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.660
the humans who live under that
Control Field, and so the

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.510
scoring is based upon the
population data under those

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.110
Control Fields.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.720
So if you build a really large
Control Field in the deserts

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.800
of Nevada, it's not going to
be worth as many points as,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.520
say, if you were able this
weekend to build an amazing

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.850
Control Field over the
population of San Francisco.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.820
One of the fun elements of the
game is that we have an

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.790
Investigation Board.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.820
So this is at
nianticproject.com, and every

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.840
day, we post new elements
of the story.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.220
These might be video clips.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:39.180
They might be redacted CIA type
documents that fill in

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.100
all the pieces of the story
and the back story.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.080
It's an interesting storytelling
medium.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.870
It's very different than just
reading a book cover to cover.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.910
It sort of unfolds day to day
and you sort of dive right

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.310
into it to get a sense of this
alternate universe that's

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.170
happening around us.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.350
And then there's also a gaming
element to it as well where

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.530
there are puzzles and passcodes
hidden in it that

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:08.119
you can unlock to power up
in the regular game.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.349
And then another fun element of
Ingress is this ability to

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.750
form alliances, and it's been
fun to see people cooperating

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.510
across neighborhoods and
cities and countries to

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.569
exchange portal keys and to work
together at these large

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:25.150
events and really meet
each other in person.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.679
So that's sort of the basics of
Ingress, and hopefully you

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:30.250
all get a chance to
play it this week.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.250
We have a number of events
happening concurrently with

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:38.630
Google I/O, and so come visit
us at our desk there to get

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.330
more information about
the schedule.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.630
So now I'd like to take a step
back and talk about some of

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.800
the key learnings that our team
had developing the game

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.760
and also seeing it unfold
as we've launched

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.380
in this beta period.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.670
There's a lot of stuff that we
didn't even think about in

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.050
advance that we've learned
through this period that can

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.490
be applicable to you guys, as
many of you guys are game

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.440
designers or game developers,
that can help you as you think

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.540
about the types of games that
you want to build, whether it

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.840
be using Google Glass or the
latest Nexus phone device.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.880
So one of the things that was
interesting is just how the

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.210
two elements of the game-- you
have the story, but then you

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.640
have the game mechanics, so
the rules, the things that

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.770
you're allowed to do.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.500
And it was really interesting to
see how adjusting the game

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.850
mechanics has a direct
impact on how social

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.250
your game can be.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.990
So for example, we started
testing the game with

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.160
Googlers, I think back in August
of this last year, with

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.350
a much smaller group of people
who are Google employees.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.940
And in the first version of the
game, one individual could

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.920
power up a portal, basically,
to the full

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.670
power on their own.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.690
So constantly during this alpha
period, we've making

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.210
adjustments.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.120
So it's very interesting to see
when we had the insight to

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.480
change the rules such that you
actually needed eight players

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.150
now to build the highest level,
the most powerful

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.650
portal, it was really fun to
see all of a sudden it

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.720
instantly went from players
playing on their own around

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.400
Mountain View campus to these
squads of groups of eight

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.870
Googlers roaming in packs
at lunch time.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.150
So it was very powerful
and it was instant.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.480
It was the next day, you
saw this change.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.370
So the learning here was just,
if that stickiness of that

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.460
cooperation is something that
you're looking for, you can

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.570
definitely think about ways that
you can tune your game to

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.570
encourage that type of behavior
that you want to see.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.640
Another thing that we've learned
is just the importance

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.940
of balancing and tuning all
the various variables.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.360
So I think the key learning
here that we had is the

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.880
importance of investing the
engineering work to make all

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.450
of your variables configurable
knobs that are easy to change

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.740
without an update
to your server.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.730
You want to be able to tune
these things really quickly

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.400
and do it based upon feedback
from your players.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.530
And it takes a little bit more
work to architect your

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.230
software such that you can do
that, but it's also really

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.560
nice because then you could have
people playing more of a

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.360
game design role--

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.370
maybe not your engineering
team--

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.090
who then can use an
admin console to

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.320
change the various values.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.090
Because it can dramatically
change the playability of your

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.290
game, just with these variables
that you do.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.070
So for example, attack
versus defence.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.260
That's something that we're
always fine tuning and it's

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.400
very hard to get right.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.700
How difficult should it
be to defend a portal

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.620
once you have it?

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.370
If you make it too difficult
to defend, you very quickly

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.710
can get just a static game board
where everything just

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.460
locks up and any new players,
they can't do anything.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.780
There's no turnover.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.180
And if you err on the other side
and make it too easy to

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.790
attack, then there's this sense
that what's the point?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.350
I built this great Control
Field, these portals, but it's

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.300
so easy to take down.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.620
That doesn't feel fair either.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.845
So you're constantly
going to need to

00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:02.210
balance things like that.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.090
And you're also going to need
to tune all the variables as

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.990
far as, how do you balance the
magnitude of the power of a

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.070
high level player versus
a low level player?

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.340
You're constantly going to be
having, in a game like this,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.060
new players joining
this world.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.070
They need to feel powerful
enough that they can have fun,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.530
but at the same time, you need
to reward the players who have

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.220
invested the time developing
their skills and building

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.440
their capabilities so that they
can feel like they are

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.160
more powerful.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.620
So that's something that
you'll need to balance.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.710
And as I said, we think it's
important to build a social

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.210
experience.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.320
Not every game has to be social,
but we've found with

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.730
our data, as we look at our
retention rates and activity

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.790
with players as they progress
through the game, that those

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.110
players who come to these
events, who make friends with

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.090
their faction team members,
they actually stick in the

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.390
game a lot better.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.880
So that's an interesting insight
for you guys as you

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.260
design your games because you
want to get as many new

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.540
players to start your game as
possible, but you also want as

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.320
many as possible to stick
around and continue

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.020
to play your game.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.180
So for example, I don't
necessarily

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.730
play Angry Birds anymore.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.370
I'm over that.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.640
There's a lot of games
like that.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.510
So it's very easy to design a
game that's fun for a few

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.290
days, maybe, but it's much more
difficult to design a

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.390
game that people will continue
to play over and over again.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.250
And so this was just one of the
things that we've learned

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.260
is that we've found with our
data that if you can build a

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.130
game where people can make real
friends, I think people

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.760
stick around and will
play much longer.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.330
And I felt like this was very
rewarding to just see people

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.450
meeting each other, having
beers together, and

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.900
meeting in real life.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.720
There had been a lot of talk
over the last couple of years

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.810
of "social gaming," and it was
more in a context of Facebook

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.860
games and things like that.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.620
But to me, this feels real.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.600
This feels like a much different
experience where

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.480
you're meeting people
in real life.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.020
This was just another thing that
sort of shocked us, was

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.960
just the creativity
of the community.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.610
We did this thing that when we
launched the game, we weren't

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.600
sure exactly how much server
capacity we had, so we decided

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.400
to use a beta approach
where we'd have an

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.470
activation code system.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.840
And at first, we started off
where you would just submit

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.650
your email address at
ingress.com and as space was

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.000
made available, we would send
you an email with the

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.470
activation code.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.050
But we had this insight on G+.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.860
We saw a fan basically create
some artwork for Ingress, and

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.410
so we had this insight
to reward him with

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.260
an activation code.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.170
And it sort of just snowballed
from there where fans started

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.440
posting all sorts of artwork
in exchange for these

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.740
activation codes.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.780
So we found that the fans who
went through that process,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.750
they were also much more likely
to stick around with

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.710
the game because they had
invested something in it.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.610
They'd sort of embodied some of
the fiction and the story

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.250
elements before they had
even started the game.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.180
So I don't think every game
needs to do that, but for us,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.890
we felt like it was definitely
a positive experience having

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.520
that and just seeing that
creativity of the players in

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.200
the community.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.420
This was actually an example of
an image that fans created,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.450
and I just thought it was just
a cool piece of artwork.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.180
But this was in the context of
you sort of describe the

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.330
attributes of the
various levels.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.210
So you had a new player who was
just starting out, maybe

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.570
didn't quite know the optimal
strategy for deploying

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.550
resonators or for linking
portals together.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.860
He might have been that annoying
new player that put

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.480
the link in the wrong spot that
blocked your really great

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.380
link that you were planning.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.000
And then you had players
progressing, and they kind of

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.720
got the hang of it.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.640
Maybe they had a few friends.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.010
Maybe they belonged to the G+
local community, and so they

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.570
were strategizing
on the weekend.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.130
And then you had your Ninja
Level Eight player who had

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.420
built his own wearable harness
for his scanner

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.340
and all these things.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.560
So I think it is important to
build a game where you feel

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.510
like there's this progression.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.470
We're still tuning this
ourselves, but you can make it

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.990
fun for a new player, but also
make it something that players

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.850
don't get bored of too easy
and they can continue to

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.160
progress as well.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.020
This is really basic to gaming
design, but one way to think

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.530
about it is there's lots of
different types of people,

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.530
different types of psychology,
they play games

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.050
for different reasons.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.850
So we have an example
here of Bartle's

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.820
Taxonomy of Player Types.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.330
On the y-axis on the upper
left, you have Killers.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.920
So these are people who really
just get a sick pleasure out

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:41.110
of destroying your portal or
attacking your field, not that

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.570
there's necessarily anything
wrong with that.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.110
And then on the lower left,
you have Socializers.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.870
So that's the equivalent of
beer league softball where

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.290
you're not there necessarily
to win.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.970
You're there to have some beers
with your friends and

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.890
play and meet new people and
have fun, and that's a great

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.960
way to experience
games as well.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.710
On the lower right, you
have the Explorers.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.950
So in a game like Ingress, these
are the people who just

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:06.100
really love finding the new
artwork in their city and

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.130
exploring new types of areas,
but also exploring new

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.980
experiences, meeting new
types of people, that

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.160
kind of thing as well.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.950
And then achievers.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.860
So to the extent that there
are missions, they want to

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.930
accomplish all the missions.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.510
They want to get to Level Eight
as quick as possible.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.480
And that's a different
type of player.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.610
So I'll talk about how we think
about these different

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.600
groups for the game.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.490
Your game doesn't necessarily
have to hit square on in any

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.880
of these quadrants, but it's
nice to think about this, to

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.620
think about ways your game can
reach a broader audience and

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.710
you have different ways
of playing your game.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.190
So for example, Portal Discovery
is almost a game in

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.860
and of itself.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.860
So in our game, we use public
art installations or

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:57.060
architecture or murals as
the locations, and we've

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.980
outsourced that and let the
players, you guys, themselves,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.490
find this art and take photos of
it and upload it, but that

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.000
in itself is a game.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.380
When I was traveling, I was in
Park City skiing this last

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.070
winter, and we didn't have
as much portal data.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.060
So I just spent an afternoon
walking down Main Street there

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.890
in Park City, and there was
all these sculptures, and

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.510
taking a photo.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.780
It was actually a really fun
way to experience a new

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.820
location and it became a
game in and of itself.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.610
So this really scratches the
itch for that explorer type

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.260
personality.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:36.090
And it's also reaching different
demographics.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.750
I think this appeals
to people that you

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.500
don't think of as gamers.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.650
This isn't first person shooter
type thing, but it's

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.540
just a fun way to experience
the game.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.080
Another element that we're
working into Ingress is sort

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.990
of a collect them all
type element.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.090
In a lot of ways, these Portal
Keys are tradeable and

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.110
interesting.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.600
I think back to G+ and Facebook,
people really like

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.210
those maps where it's all the
countries you visited or all

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.700
the states you visited.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.070
And whenever you see something
like that, we have this

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.130
impulse to fill in whole
map, or we want to

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.510
collect them all.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.320
And Portal Keys are kind
of like that, too.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.190
I like this idea of having
missions where maybe you're

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.330
here in San Francisco
for the weekend.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.890
I feel like it would be kind
of fun to be like, can you

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.560
collect a Portal Key from each
of the 20 most iconic

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.200
locations in San Francisco?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.900
I feel like that in
itself is a game.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.990
It has nothing to do with
battling The Enlightened or

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.930
The Resistance, but it's sort
of an offshoot of the game

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.170
that's fun in and of itself.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.290
It's also funny, we've seen
examples of people trading

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.100
Portal Keys in airports.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.350
So it was very international
drug trade kind of thing going

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.982
on, where people were meeting at
Chicago O'Hare airport and

00:28:50.982 --> 00:28:53.240
you had one guy flying from one
city, and then he'd drop

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.175
of the Portal Key.

00:28:54.175 --> 00:28:55.720
Another guy would pick
it up and transfer

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.610
it to another city.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.900
So very cool to think of these
virtual drops, these drops of

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.550
virtual items.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.380
You could almost imagine
them flying in

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.280
their luggage on airplanes.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.710
There's something cool about
how, I went to Paris and I

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.742
brought back the Portal Key from
the Eiffel Tower, and you

00:29:12.742 --> 00:29:13.530
can show your friends.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.160
So I think that's
an interesting

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.300
way to play the game.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.690
Another interesting thing that
we learned is that players can

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.200
help build the game.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.590
The "Who the bleep suggested
this portal," that was a

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.710
really popular meme on G+.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.610
So there's all the
Ingress-related posts that

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.800
happened there, and that
was one of the

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.810
most re-shared ones.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.070
I thought that was funny.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.710
So we launched these tools
in the game where

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.770
you can snap a photo--

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.690
that first photo is our office
in Venice, California, it's

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.730
like this binoculars thing--

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.490
any sort of interesting
architecture or art.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.370
And also, users, in addition to
submitting a portal to help

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:56.490
build out the game set, you can
suggest edits to the title

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.710
or the description or you can
submit a better photo and that

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.480
kind of thing.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.870
It's interesting.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.340
The talk before this talk was
the talk from the Google Maps

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.880
team, and they have also used
this a lot, too, where if

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.770
Google Maps has your street
labeled incorrectly, you can

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.460
go to Google and you can edit
that, and everyone's

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.690
contributions build up and
they add to a better

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.720
experience for everyone
in the game.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.920
We know that our portal data
set isn't perfect, but it's

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.500
getting better every day
from your submissions.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.760
And we have an operations team
that reviews those submissions

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:36.070
and helps remove duplicate data
and fixes bad photos and

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.030
things like that.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.540
So I feel like not every game
needs to use this type of

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.380
system, but it was definitely
an interesting insight, an

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.470
interesting tool that
we used for Ingress.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.870
Another interesting topic, and
we had a lot of discussion

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.550
about this, is just the notion
of, should you have all of

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.820
your players play in one world
or should you have many

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.290
virtual dimensions or worlds?

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:06.740
So this is interesting and,
going back to that slide about

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.980
tuning and balancing, it's very
difficult to balance your

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.420
game so that it feels fun for
a new player versus the

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.660
advanced players who already are
very powerful in the game.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.540
One way to deal with that is
to just create different

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.350
virtual worlds.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.020
So maybe all the new players
play together in their

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.650
sandbox, and then maybe the
advanced players play in a

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.920
different virtual world, these
different dimensions.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.160
And we sort of debated that back
and forth as a team, but

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.600
we really wanted this idea.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.060
I guess I felt more epic that
we all played in the same

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.960
virtual world so that when your
friend went to Paris and

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.430
got that Portal Key from the
Eiffel Tower and brought it

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.140
back, it was meaningful to you
versus something where

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.740
everyone was playing in
this disjoint world.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.170
So it's just something
to think about.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.580
We're still struggling to
balance things properly, but

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.390
that's one of the decisions that
you'll have to make if

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.770
you build a similar
type of game.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.870
And think about how you
want to juggle that.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.250
And also, another topic was
launching global versus local.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.010
With some of our apps like Field
Trip, we had a strategy

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.050
where we were just going to
focus on where we had good

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.650
data in the United States and
launch Field Trip first in the

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.830
United States, and then
as we got better data

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.080
internationally, we would
roll that out.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.070
With Ingress, we actually
decided to launch

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.300
international.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.530
With your games, I think you'll
have to weigh the pros

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:32.210
and cons of that, focusing on
an area that you know versus

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.170
spreading yourself out.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.260
But also, the opportunity with
the global game is it can feel

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.480
more epic as well.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.680
I love this screenshot of--

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.960
I love just occasionally going
to the Com in Ingress and just

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.630
looking at all the different
languages, some that I don't

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.220
even know what language they
are, and it's fun to think of

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.120
all these people in all these
different cultures and all

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.430
these different countries
playing the game.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:56.660
And I think on G+ especially,
you definitely build some

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.800
momentum there getting that
critical mass of players if

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.030
you launch globally.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:06.880
Another more technical, but an
interesting thing, is to build

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.290
so that your game can scale.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.880
I mean, we all want our games
to be popular, but it's very

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.560
difficult to do.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.750
But in the case that it does
grow very quickly, you want to

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.830
be prepared for that.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.990
So this is just a pitch for
using Google technologies.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.660
We use Google technologies and
these same technologies are

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.540
available to you as developers
as well.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.310
So definitely make use of Google
I/O to learn more about

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.770
the cloud infrastructure and
App Engine and all the

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.080
different services that Google
makes because these are

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.480
technologies that we use and
they do grow with your game as

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.790
it develops.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.690
Another interesting learning
that we had from our game was

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:47.260
just the importance
of the story.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:51.180
The game, it's not just about
the dots and the lines.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.440
The story can help make these
dots and lines feel more

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.830
meaningful to you, so you don't
necessarily need to

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.740
build an investigation board
like this, but it's definitely

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.850
fun to think about, as you think
about equipping your

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.590
team of developers-- your
engineers and your game

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.100
designers--

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.750
you might also want to think
about making sure that you

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.100
have someone who's creative and
can help write and craft

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.460
that story for your game because
I do think that it

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.610
adds a richness to the game.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.230
And then once you have that
story, another tool that I

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.710
would pitch is just the use
of YouTube, another Google

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.989
company, another Google
technology.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.460
It's a great medium for
reaching people.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.300
It's very easy to have these
videos shared on G+.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.780
We've been doing this Ingress
Report where it's this news

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.120
report of that week's events in
Ingress, and it's been very

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.290
fun to see the contributions
from players to that, and then

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.409
having us basically highlight
the best of

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.520
that week on YouTube.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.980
It's been a good way
to reach new users.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.969
We even had a book.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.530
I think this is the first book
published by Google.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.250
We had an author write a whole
story about the Ingress back

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.200
story, which was a lot of fun.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.330
$2.99 in the Play
Store available.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.460
Another interesting thing you
can do is you can combine the

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.370
story with the game.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.710
We had some events where the
outcome on the battlefield on

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.180
the game would actually have a
direct impact on the story.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:19.050
So we had one where we have this
character named Klue, who

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.540
had some videos on YouTube, and
so we had this event in

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.620
Scotland and the idea was that
if The Resistance controlled

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.410
the William Wallace Memorial at
sundown on a certain day,

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.610
then the story would shift and
it was sort of a choose your

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.100
own adventure.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.050
So then Klue would be aligned
with The Resistance, and if

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.520
The Enlightened controlled that
portal at that time, then

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.300
the story would shift and she
would join The Enlightened.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.520
So we felt like it was
definitely an finishing way to

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.170
help merge the story with the
game mechanics as well.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.970
And then finally, another
pitch for G+.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:57.010
We really weren't sure what the
impact would be on G+, but

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.890
I mentioned the art contest
that we ran, and it's just

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:06.580
been amazing to see the new
Communities tool on Google+.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.270
It seems like there must
be more Ingress-related

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.880
communities than any
other topic.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.110
There's global Ingress
communities, but then down to

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.990
local cities and areas for
Resistance and Enlightened.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:22.220
So Google+ is just a great tool
for meeting new people.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.450
Maybe these aren't already your
existing friends, but

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.010
it's a way to meet other
people who share an

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.980
interest with you.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.440
So as you're designing your
game, you might want to think

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.470
about how you can use Google+ to
get exposure for your game,

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:37.050
but also to build a richer
community with your players.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.180
This was just some
examples of that.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.110
I was always amazed just
to see how dedicated.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.230
The one on the left is actually
a fake tattoo, but

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.790
the one on the right
looks real to me.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:50.960
So that idea of building a
community where your players

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.580
can feel a connection
with the game.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.130
And these were just some great
art contributions that I

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.450
really liked from G+.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:05.670
Whenever we were having a bad
day, or there was just a bug,

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.350
or things just weren't going
well, you just go to G+ and

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.830
you just see stuff like this and
it would just refresh you

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.510
as a game designer.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.700
It's so fun to see all the
creative stuff that people

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.910
were posting there, and even
more so because it really

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.820
aligns with the creativity
and art theme of Ingress.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.640
Art's really the core of Ingress
with the sculptures

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.970
and whatnot, So it was
fun to see that.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.850
We had things where people were
knitting things, they

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.940
were making things with
physical objects,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.500
photography, cartoons.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.560
Some different memes.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.970
This is another way
to basically get

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:41.770
exposure for your game.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.670
Just embrace those quirky,
funny things that

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.820
your fans can do.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.960
We had our team create Ingress
gear, basically anything that

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.050
you can do to build that
community with your fans.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.960
Then interactive feedback.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.370
It's hard to see, but this is
a chart of the XM economy in

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.360
the game that some player did.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.190
That's something that maybe I
should have done as a product

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.600
manager, but I was too
lazy to do that.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.410
So it was fun to see the players
be able to contribute.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.420
And as we tune adjustments,
we listen to the feedback.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.650
So people will say, oh, I hate
what you've done there or I

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.490
like what you've done.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.020
We weigh through that and are
able to quickly iterate on the

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.110
game and hopefully make
it better every week.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.060
And then G+ is also a great tool
for organizing events.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.600
So we have our Operation
Bowstring

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.010
event, of course, tomorrow.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.820
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.670
We have a great party
afterwards.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.590
Make sure you get your drink
ticket downstairs and

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.470
everything.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.790
But G+ is a great way to
organize that, get the word

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.510
out, and get people
to your events.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.310
And the events, as I mentioned,
is just a great way

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.330
to really engage your players
and make them active.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:48.320
And finally, kind of want to
think about games as a sport.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.200
We were thinking about, how can
you make this so it's fun?

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.340
And I thought the example every
weekend, I play in a

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.940
weekend tennis league, or you go
to a local park and there's

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.750
pickup basketball.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.190
So I'd just challenge you to
think about, how can you think

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.130
about a little bit of the
merging between what you think

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.120
as video games and what you
think about sports.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.530
Because there's sports like
soccer that they're not that

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.110
complicated, but you don't
get bored of soccer.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.490
You play soccer every week.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.705
So especially when you get
these physical games when

00:39:14.705 --> 00:39:18.120
you're out moving around, I
challenge you to think about

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.980
how you can make a game that
really is simple but is fun.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.760
So we've thought about
incorporating four quarter

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.250
periods, different scoring
mechanisms, basically trying

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.340
to learn from games like
football and soccer and

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.190
thinking about it
in that context.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.790
Think about unique partnership
opportunities in our world.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.000
You can get power ups from
different products.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.800
One option, you could
obviously charge a

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.580
subscription for your game or
you could just charge for

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.120
game, but I think with these
types of devices and the

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.300
technology, there's lots of
opportunities for you to think

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.800
creatively about how you can
monetize your game still and

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.390
maybe make it free to users.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.120
And then finally, I challenge
you to think about games that

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.240
can have a positive impact in
the world, bringing people

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.620
together, improving health,
helping people develop

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.340
leaderships and skills.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.640
I think that's very rewarding.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.220
And then what's next?

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.120
Just challenging you to really
soak it all in here at Google

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.680
I/O. Check out Google Glass.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.270
Check out all the devices
and technology, all the

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.820
software and tools.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.970
I think as I mentioned earlier,
there's those

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.780
technological breakthroughs that
allow whole new groups of

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.980
game developers to leapfrog the
current leaders, and so

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.030
just think about a whole new
types of gaming experiences

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.910
that you can create
using these tools.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.150
And that is it.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:42.040
So I'll answer some questions,
and then be sure to check out

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.390
the game event this week
while you're in town.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.950
And also, we have a booth
downstairs so come talk to us

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:47.430
about the game.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.412
Thank you.

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:54.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.700
BRANDON BADGER: All right.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.700
First question in the back.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.260
AUDIENCE: So, what is Google
doing with all this data?

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.920
What are you ulterior
motives here?

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.800
BRANDON BADGER: This is the
classified talk, right?

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.000
Honestly, it's to build a fun
experience and a fun game.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.860
I know there's been speculation,
oh, Google could

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.100
use this data to improve maps,
and maybe that's the case, but

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.850
we haven't even thought
about that, honestly.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.760
I think we're taking the
approach, can we build a new

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.070
type of gaming experience?

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.340
Some of it is to showcase
the technology.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.740
So something like Google Glass,
there's definitely a

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.900
good synergy with these types of
games and Nexus phones and

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.460
different types of technology.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.870
I think that's more
what drives it.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.120
Go ahead.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.570
AUDIENCE: A couple questions
both relating to money.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.400
Have you figured out how much
your run rate is for this

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.600
game, if you had to actually pay
for it not being Google?

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.220
And then also, have
you figured out--

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.260
BRANDON BADGER: We just
use fake money.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.400
AUDIENCE: No, I mean, but you
get your services for free, I

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.360
would suspect.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.340
I'm just wondering if you've
figured out what the run rate

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.020
would be if you were
an outside company.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.670
BRANDON BADGER: I don't know.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.080
AUDIENCE: And then also, how
have you thought about how you

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.690
would monetize the game if
you decided to do that?

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.680
BRANDON BADGER: We're still
focused on building a great,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.460
fun game and growing
the user base.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.900
We're confident that if you
build a game like this, that

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.080
we can come up with ways
to monetize it.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.870
So as I mentioned earlier, it
might be charging for the

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.100
game, it might be subscriptions,
but we're

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.580
really trying to avoid that and
we're trying to keep the

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.180
game free because we're Google
and we come to things from

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.580
more of an advertising
point of view.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.210
So we've been doing some
partnerships with some local

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.020
businesses like Jamba Juice.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.330
We think there's something
powerful in helping influence

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.980
and encouraging people to go
to a retail location, so we

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.860
made the Jamba Juices, we did
an experiment where we made

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.090
them portals in the game,
and so we're still

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.190
collecting data from that.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:02.220
We've done a partnership with
Hint bottled water where

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.750
there's power codes underneath
the bottle caps that you can

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.940
type into your Ingress
app to get power ups.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.320
So I think maybe that's
a way to do it.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.770
But to be honest, we're still
brainstorming what the

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.020
business models might be.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.700
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm
surprised you haven't

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.460
mentioned one of the key
findings, and that is that the

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.710
Invite Codes should actually
come with spare

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.640
batteries as well.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.410
BRANDON BADGER: We could have a
partnership with the battery

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.420
makers, right, and just sell
a whole bunch of batteries.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.050
I've got one in my bag, too.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.280
AUDIENCE: Actually, two
questions I had were answered

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.650
already, but any plans for
above Level Eight?

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.420
BRANDON BADGER: We're
thinking about it.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.280
We're thinking about different
types of missions and

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:55.950
achievements and things.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.850
I mean, it's sort of a rat
race where we could do 16

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.200
levels and then 32 levels.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.420
I think you could just
keep doing that.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.110
So we're trying to think of
other ways where we can build

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.290
enough head room where you
feel like there's a

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.120
progression there, but we're
still debating how far we want

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.240
to take it with just leveling
up on the point.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.500
We're still figuring it out.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:17.850
AUDIENCE: Cheers.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.772
Thanks.

00:44:20.772 --> 00:44:23.560
AUDIENCE: So I think one of the
hardest things to scale is

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.980
the human aspect of the game.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.695
So you mentioned that you have
a team of people that's

00:44:26.695 --> 00:44:28.410
approving portals.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.660
What's a good strategy
of scaling that?

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.790
And I guess the second question
is, how long does

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.100
typically a portal get approved

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:34.820
right now in the game?

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.740
BRANDON BADGER: It's definitely
taking too long to

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.260
approve portals.

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.860
There's a couple things that
we're doing to improve that.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.340
One is we're building better
administration tools.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:48.120
So it was very primitive what
they were using before, but

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.460
we're building some better back
end tools where they can

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.460
see the photo of the submission,
they can quickly

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.650
edit the data and approve
or reject it.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.090
So those tools, they're actually
much more productive

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:00.180
with those tools.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.470
And then we're also hiring
out that team.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:05.520
I mean, there's different
strategies where maybe you

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.770
could have fewer people review
items and whatnot.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.400
But we're trying to balance
the speed of approval with

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.740
also quality.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.690
So I think we'll find a better
balance there where we can get

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.370
them done a little faster, but
we don't want to start

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.150
approving photos of a rock
in your backyard.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:25.030
We want it to really
still be art.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.530
AUDIENCE: I'm sure a lot of dev
players here have the same

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.990
question as me, but can we
expect to settle for sure APIs

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.120
coming soon?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.770
BRANDON BADGER: It's something
that we've talked about I

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.640
think maybe in the future,
but we don't have

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.475
any plans right now.

00:45:39.475 --> 00:45:42.620
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple questions.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:48.230
First off, you had commented on
how a lot of portals are at

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:54.080
works of art, but I know at my
college campus, we initially

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.850
submitted works of art and one
person went around submitting

00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:59.410
just about everything.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.660
Some of the portals didn't get
approved, some of them did.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.000
So now we have these random
buildings that don't make

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.880
sense as portals.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:14.310
Is there are going to be some
process to suggest portals

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.600
possibly be removed?

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.910
The issue is now, we're running
into portal saturation

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.620
where you can't walk
five feet without

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.510
tripping over a portal.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.970
BRANDON BADGER: Yeah.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.000
So the one complaint is the
portals aren't getting

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.580
approved and added
fast enough.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.850
The other complaint is when
there's bad quality and things

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.010
are getting approved that
shouldn't be approved.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.800
There is a tool in the game now
where you can report what

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.190
you think is a bad portal.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.490
If you go into the Portal Info
View and you click on the

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.880
photo, and you can report it,
and then that goes to one of

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.830
our operators who can review
that and remove it.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.580
It's still a slow process, but
I can promise that it's

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.770
something that will improve
and speed up.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:51.050
AUDIENCE: I saw Bad Title
and Bad Description.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.190
Is there actually just Delete
Portal option in there?

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:59.100
BRANDON BADGER: I think right
now, just flag it just in

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.450
general as either a bad
description or a bad portal.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.000
AUDIENCE: My other question
is, what are the plans for

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.650
Level Nine and above?

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.700
BRANDON BADGER: So as I
mentioned, we're still

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.610
debating that internally.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.930
We don't want to turn it into
a rat race where we go to

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:13.430
Level 128, but we're trying to
think of other ways where we

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:16.500
can have progression.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.555
We're thinking about it.

00:47:17.555 --> 00:47:19.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.600
AUDIENCE: Going back to the
battery pack comment, I'm

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.050
wondering if there's anything
being done to

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.050
improve battery life.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:27.220
BRANDON BADGER: It's something
that our engineering team

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.500
works really hard on.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:35.180
I mean, I think a lot of the
energy is probably taken up by

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.220
just actually the display
being on.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.900
I think we're brainstorming
ideas, different types of game

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.290
mechanics where maybe you can
play with it in your pocket in

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.690
certain contexts, and so
you could have the

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.260
screen off and on.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.620
We have this Field Trip app that
runs in the background

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.500
while your phone is off.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.240
So I think it's something that
we'll continue to improve is

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.400
the battery life.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.460
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.860
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about
your comment on the

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.110
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.520
BRANDON BADGER: So at this
point, Google is definitely a

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.290
developer friendly company.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:11.020
I was a product manager
for the Maps API

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.310
for a number of years.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:16.690
I think we're still in a beta
period, so I think it's

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.380
important right now that the
players all use the same tools

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.550
and use the official tools.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:24.010
Part of that is from a
playability point of view.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.940
Some of it is also just our
server capacity, we're still

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.710
limiting access to the game so
we still are at a point where

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.070
we need to have people use the
official tools just so they

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.490
don't hit on our servers
incorrectly.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.940
AUDIENCE: If I have another
question because I am from

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.320
Hong Kong and I represent
a part of the

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.610
players in Hong Kong.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.690
We found that mocking
is [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.160
now.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.660
And I want to ask if you're
working on something to avoid

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.030
mocking of the locations?

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.600
BRANDON BADGER: So that's
another thing that our

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.240
engineering team is constantly
battling over.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.950
We definitely are working to
prevent people from spoofing

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.500
their location while
they play.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.950
So on our servers, we can do
things like if you hack a

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.870
portal in San Francisco and
then five minutes later,

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:12.180
you're hacking a portal in New
York, there's things that we

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.540
can do on the server side
to detect that.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.240
AUDIENCE: Are you
planning to do--

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.610
BRANDON BADGER: He's giving
me the thing.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:20.670
But thanks everyone.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.240
Come to our party and
play the game.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:40.930
[APPLAUSE]
