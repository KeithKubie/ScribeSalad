1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
Now as a journalist when you see shit
like that that has got to hit home.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,540
Oh yeah. The last few years for,
for journalist, especially if your,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
I mean he wasn't an American citizen,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,470
but he did write for the Washington
Post and was a resident. But,

5
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,900
but I mean I was, I was, I was
arrested in Iran for a week, a long,

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,650
long time ago and roughly the same time
and Iranian Canadian photographer was

7
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,020
arrested and she was
raped and beaten to death.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,310
So the people that are citizens of
these countries there, they're really,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,950
really bearing the brunt. Um, and again,

10
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:35,400
that's why I'm uncomfortable if people
call me brave because I get to come home

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,890
with these guys,
you know,

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,130
they can get to them and they can get
to their families very easily. And that,

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,780
that takes a whole other level of bravery.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,800
And the woman who was raped and beaten
to death, what was she involved with?

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,080
What happens? Photographer. She was
just taking pictures of, yeah. Yeah.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,530
And the usual thing with, I
mean, certainly we in Iran,

17
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,270
but this is common all over the place.
Um,

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,440
if you're a dual citizen working
as a journalist in for example,

19
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,020
around they'll accuse you of being a spy.
I was accused of being a spy.

20
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,730
They tried to get me to
confess to being a spy.

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,840
That's a very normal assumption out there.
And how long were you in jail for?

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,430
Just seven or eight days. He was
out like actually not, not too bad.

23
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,830
I mean psychologically it was bad
because they were threatening torture and

24
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,890
execution. Um, physically it wasn't,
it wasn't too bad. I was fed. Um,

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,960
I had a bad bed that was roughed up
a bit. I wasn't, I wasn't beaten. Um,

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,990
but I did think it could last months
and months and months and I did think I

27
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:26,700
could go to Evin prison.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,060
They actually put me in a car and drove
me to what they said was ever in prison

29
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:31,080
once and then just took me somewhere else.
Evan prison,

30
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,530
even prisoners where people
have been tortured and executed.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,180
So they just drove you there are scarier.

32
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,180
Drove me around for a few hours to scare
me and then took me to another place

33
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,000
here. What were they trying to get
you to confess to the being a spy?

34
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,900
And they said, at one point they said, uh,

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,790
do you honestly expect us to believe
you travel the world collecting all this

36
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,330
information and you don't share it
with your government? I said, yeah,

37
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,710
that's exactly how it works.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,190
And they thought I was insulting
their intelligence by, by saying that.

39
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,780
What were you over there
covering? We were, I did a series.

40
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,360
One of the first series I did was
called holidays in the access of evil.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,560
So I spent my first four years as a
journalist undercover wearing a secret

42
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,394
camera.

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,750
And Luckily I appeared on a couple of
docs with the guy who was not very good.

44
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,440
And so I looked genuine next to him.
Um,

45
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,380
so the control to BBC Two said,
give this guy a series.

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,360
And I was racking my
brains trying to think.

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,950
I wanted to be a foreign correspondent
and wanting to cover conflict than George

48
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,090
Bush made the axis of evil speech.

49
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,010
And John Bolton added three countries
to the list. So it was Iraq, Syria,

50
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,490
Cuba, and North Korea. Uh, Libya,

51
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,390
Cuba with a six evil countries.
So we went to all six countries.

52
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,870
Me and one camera man held
out handheld camera chain,

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,900
actually saw it and that's
when he first reached out.

54
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,250
And I started talking to vice
about eventually joining them,

55
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,780
but kind of documentaries from the
streets up to, we're just trying to say,

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,120
you know,
despite all the rhetoric about Iran,

57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,480
this is what the people are actually like.
And it was, it was kind of youth led.

58
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,020
We,

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,910
we interviewed a bunch of students who
are involved in some famous protests in

60
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,750
1999 where the police came in and smashed
the dormitory and burned them down and

61
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,030
beat them.
I think because we interviewed them,

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,950
we were then tracked in and arrested.
Oh, so how'd you get it free?

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,940
How did I get, how'd you get free?
Uh, it's, I didn't know at the time,

64
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,400
but if to come 10 countries
have diplomatic relations.

65
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,680
It's only a big deal after a week.
So on the night of the seventh day or the,

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,490
or the eighth day, they, they let
me go. Oh yeah. But I had no idea.

67
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,190
At the time. I thought, I thought
this could go on months and months.

68
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:34,480
A month now when you were over there in
around what is their perception of the

69
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,250
United States when you're talking to
the young people over there? Oh, uh,

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,950
love the United States real music culture,
sports,

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,720
everything and over extremely well
educated about the United States. Um,

72
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,430
American foreign policy is a completely
different discussion, but I mean,

73
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,420
one of the things we tried to cover was
the Friday rally at Tehran University

74
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,250
where you see everyone
chanting death to America,

75
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,820
death to Israel and we wanted to cover
it because they bus in old men from the

76
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,400
countryside who sent their guy. Yeah.
Death to America. Death to Israel. Real.

77
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,800
It's not something to be seeking
some propaganda. Staged event. Yeah.

78
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
I mean if there was a turning point in
the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and with

79
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:18,670
Iran, Ryan Crocker, who was the
former ambassador to Saudi Arabia,

80
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:22,420
Israel, Iraq, Afghanistan,
s straight off the nine 11,

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,040
he was sent to Geneva where a number of
countries affected by the refugee crisis.

82
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,660
We're meeting to discuss
how to deal with it.

83
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,390
One of the countries that are wrong,
so that have this meeting.

84
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,210
And then he and his Iranian
counterpart would disappear for,

85
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:39,211
he says seven or eight hours over tee
to discuss the future of American Iran

86
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,380
relations. They knew that they were
going to get rid of the Taliban. Um,

87
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,860
so the Uranian said, okay, here's
a map of the Taliban leaders homes.

88
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,080
If you take out those homes on day one,

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,500
Taliban have finished and Ryan
Crocker set up, thank you. Can I,

90
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,130
can I take notes from this map? They said,
the map is yours. We made it for you.

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,060
Gave him the map. Uh, let the
Americans use Iranian airspace,

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,530
handed over some prisoners.

93
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,430
They were absolutely key in us
overthrowing the Taliban so quickly.

94
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,350
And Ryan Crocker was making good progress.

95
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,740
And then talking about the future of
Iraq post Sudan one night he gets a knock

96
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,920
on his door. [inaudible] and two of his
staff has come in and say, boss, you'll,

97
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,110
you'll really not kind of like
what's just happened. And he said,

98
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,660
what's just happened?
And it was the axis of evil speech.

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,940
So the moderate so-called in Iran who
had fought hard to get permission to

100
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:32,530
negotiate with the Great Satan, the
u s said, you've made us look stupid.

101
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,550
You know, it was hard for us to get this
chance. We helped you in Afghanistan.

102
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,910
We were willing to discuss future
relations between our two countries and,

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,860
and this is, this is what
happens. So it's over why.

104
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,540
And then fairly soon after that,

105
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,110
obviously there's the invasion of Iraq
and Iran is sponsoring the insurgency and

106
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,710
giving them sophisticated ids and
all that rather than, you know,

107
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,090
potentially helping.

108
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,500
So you think that with wow,
with one speech.

109
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,730
Yeah, the whole thing
shifted. Yeah. So they would,

110
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,550
they would've been willing to somehow
or another negotiate or cooperate or I

111
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:12,970
mean at work alongside getting rid of
sedan was obviously an in their interests.

112
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,260
You know, they put a brutal eight
year that year were with it.

113
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,170
We have a very strange
relationship with Iran. I mean,

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,880
going back to the hostages
from the Jimmy Carter era. Yep.

115
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,240
I buy, I do think it's one of the most
misunderstood countries in the region.

116
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,910
I mean, when you actually
go there, um, you know,

117
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:33,230
that people are so smart and so
educated and, and potentially such,

118
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,730
such good allies. So what is the
key issue? It's the government.

119
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,530
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,940
And you know what I just explained and
I think they're capable of thing being

121
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,140
far more rational than,

122
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,620
than the speeches by the crazy odd
mullahs what would suggest, Huh?

123
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,840
They proved it.
Yeah.

124
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,170
And the idea that the Saudis and Mrr teas
can somehow bomb the WHO sees in Yemen

125
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:59,930
into submission and push back Iranian
influence on their southern border is,

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,540
is ridiculous. That's just
never going to happen. Um, and,

127
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,430
and I think even if you ignore
the obvious moral argument, um,

128
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,560
just from a pragmatic point of view,
the idea that we should back this, um,

129
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,830
unconditionally is, is
ridiculous. Let's see.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,490
This is just part of the real problem
when you're dealing with world advanced,

131
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:23,180
is trying to parse all this stuff out and
look at so many different stories from

132
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,030
so many different parts of the world
in so many different areas of conflict.

133
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,520
And it's almost impossible to
pay attention to it all. Yeah.

134
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Every time I meet people from
these countries, I'm, I, I'm,

135
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,420
I feel like a fraud because there's so
much that they know that I don't know and

136
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,390
I shouldn't. Right. Um, and you know,

137
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,390
I get paid to do this and I get paid to
pay attention to this for a living and I

138
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:45,230
feel out of my depth regularly and that's
focusing on the five or six countries

139
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,210
that I focused on,
let alone everything else.

140
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,330
What other countries do
you focus on? Uh, I mean,

141
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:54,410
the last few years has been Congo
quite a bit. Afghanistan, mostly Iraq,

142
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,720
Yemen, I focused on a lot of
the last three, four years.
Um, they're the main ones.
