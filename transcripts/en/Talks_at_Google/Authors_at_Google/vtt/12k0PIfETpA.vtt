00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:07.110
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.930
OWEN SUSKIND: There is a boy
who was just like other boys

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.100
until one night, he
sees from his window

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.978
a storm on the horizon.

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:19.644
-Who are you?

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:21.006
-I'm Peter Pan.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.276
And you're Captain Hook.

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:26.836
RON SUSKIND: All of a sudden, at
three years old, Owen vanishes.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.770
The doctor says, let me
explain what autism is.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.597
Some of the kids will
never talk again.

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:40.180
CORNELIA SUSKIND: I
remember thinking,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.460
I'm just going to
hold you so tight

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.650
and love you so much
that whatever is going on

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.942
will go away.

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:49.900
RON SUSKIND: We were
beginning to give up hope.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.396
And one day, we were watching
the Disney animated movies.

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:57.920
And he says he doesn't want to
grow up, like Mowgli or Peter

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.518
Pan.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:03.016
CORNELIA SUSKIND: What
hell just happened?

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.349
RON SUSKIND: And all of a
sudden, it became clear to us.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.090
He's using these movies to
make sense of the world.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.910
He actually is
living in our world.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.640
So at that point, we began to
speak to him in Disney dialog.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.800
(IN VOICE OF IAGO) When did you
and I become such good friends?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.979
Whatever works to get to Owen.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.520
OWEN SUSKIND: I have been scared
my whole life of growing up.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330
Peter Pan doesn't want to grow
up because when you grow up,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.980
you lose all your
magical childhood times.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.860
CORNELIA SUSKIND: My hope is
that he is independent enough

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.050
to be able to grow
older on his own.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.750
OWEN SUSKIND: When I
look in the mirror,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.090
I see a proud autistic man
ready to meet a future that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.065
is bright and full of wonder.

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.840
RON SUSKIND: He's going
to have to fall and fail.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.321
We're not afraid of
that as we used to be.

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:06.261
CORNELIA SUSKIND: I just can't
believe how far Owen has come.

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:10.169
OWEN SUSKIND: The future,
I'm still searching for it.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.640
CORNELIA SUSKIND: Who decides
what a meaningful life is?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640
SEBASTIAN: It's
like I always said.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.942
-Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:29.654
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:30.622
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:32.160
SPEAKER: Well, that's a trailer.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.280
But you have to watch
the entire movie, which

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.190
I did within three hours of
getting the link from Ron.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.320
I was in London.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.680
And for some reason,
Debbie reached out to me

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.200
and asked would I host this
particular talk of Authors

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.750
at Google.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.730
I'm like, Ron Suskind?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.680
Are you kidding me?
"Life, Animated"?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.000
And I will tell you.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.640
It's not only because Ron
is a Pulitzer-Prize-winning

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.370
journalist and has
written many books,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.390
but it was specifically because
I remember exactly where I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.530
was sitting, what office I
was in, when somehow, someone

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.260
sent me a link to a "New
York Times" story about you,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.080
your wife, and your
son, and how Owen

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.590
discovered his voice through
relating to Disney characters.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.860
And I immediately
shot it to my husband.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.170
I said, oh, my god.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.950
Someone else has had
the same experience.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.480
My son Patrick is 23.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540
Has a condition called
Fragile X syndrome,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.350
which has autistic-like
characteristics associated

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.060
with it.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.340
And he, indeed, learned to
speak through Disney Pixar.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.105
His modus is really "Toy Story."

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.480
RON SUSKIND: It's
a great choice.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.300
It's a great movie.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.240
There's a ton there to work
with, tons to work with.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.230
SPEAKER: So Ron, we could talk
a lot about your credentials.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.160
But what was striking to
me in my first conversation

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.390
with you was the excitement
and the belief and the purpose

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.710
that your life has.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.980
Probably you always had it.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.410
You're a serious journalist.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.150
But there's something
magical that's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.900
happened through
telling Owen's story.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.650
RON SUSKIND: Yeah.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.490
SPEAKER: And you could
see in your bio--

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.710
one could you say you've
had a 20-plus year struggle.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.640
I would say "journey,"
a hero's journey,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.600
of raising a child like Owen.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.290
So can we talk a little
bit about that segment

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.670
we saw where Owen, little curly
haired boy, loses his voice.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.220
What's it feel like?

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.609
And looking back now, tell
us about that journey.

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:35.150
And I know we're
going to intersperse

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.360
our discussion with clips
from the documentary.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.770
So we'll have moments
to illustrate points.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.320
RON SUSKIND: Yeah,
it's interesting

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.170
because folks know
the other books.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.530
This is my sixth book.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.200
And the other books--
I wrote a book

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.060
called "A Hope in the Unseen,"
a New York City African-American

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.760
kid who goes to the
Ivy League, and then

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.470
for books on presidents and
power, where I was investigated

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.050
and things like that, big,
noisy books about America

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.600
and America's role in the world.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.810
And what's interesting
is this story

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.940
was the story behind
all of those stories.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.440
It wasn't like we
were hiding it.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.190
But we became clear as we grew,
Cornelia and I, that Owen was

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.730
really driving us, as Owen
would say in his parlance,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.119
that we were sidekicks trying
to find our inner heroes.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:28.160
SPEAKER: Now, can you
describe for this audience,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.550
who might not be Disney
aficionados, what

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.750
a sidekick is?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.600
RON SUSKIND: OK, so I'll
just jump a little bit ahead.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.260
But it's a big architecture
that Owen has created

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.560
in his head over many years.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.090
Owen is thrown out of a school
when he's about 11 years old.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.821
Now, already he had memorized 50
Disney animated movies as sound

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:49.320
alone.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.590
And we were talking
in Disney dialogue.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.110
That's how we communicated.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.220
That's the only way
we could communicate.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.190
But he gets to a point where he
doesn't have a lot of speech.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.790
Enough, but he's whacked.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.700
I mean, he begins to see what
the world sees of him when

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.480
he's thrown out of this school
he loves and deemed uneducable.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.830
And he goes in the basement.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.490
And he begins to draw
with peculiar intensity.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.800
He's grabbing books and pads.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.050
We don't know what he's doing.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.140
It's like he's
working on a project.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.340
And I go down to the basement
a few months into this period--

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.230
and we know he's busted up.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.390
And he's really broken.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.820
But he can tell us how he feels,
which is terrible for a parent.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.972
And I grab a book.

00:06:32.972 --> 00:06:33.680
And I open it up.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.950
And I see there are
hundreds pictures, precise,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.030
just like a Disney animator
would draw, all sidekicks,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.920
no heroes.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.440
Sebastian, when Ariel
loses her voice, that

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.144
look of fear-- how do you know?

00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:47.100
[GASPS]

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.680
There's 10 of those.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.050
SPEAKER: Nice West Indian voice.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.460
RON SUSKIND: That's right, yeah.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.460
I mean, we do voices
in our family.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.440
It's the way we
talk to each other.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.600
And 100 sidekicks, no heroes.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.770
Of course, he saw that
the world had judged him.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.500
As he told us later,
he's not a hero.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.680
He's a sidekick.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.570
Now, we ask Owen later, he says,
well, a sidekick's important.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.440
They help the hero
fulfill their destiny.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.480
Without them, nothing happens.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.810
And I'm a sidekick.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.352
SPEAKER: Does that
make you the hero?

00:07:24.352 --> 00:07:26.393
RON SUSKIND: Well, it's
hard to know because he's

00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:27.240
grown into the hero.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.370
But at the end of the
book, he writes two things.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.015
One is, "I am the protector
of the sidekicks."

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:33.370
SPEAKER: Love that.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.770
RON SUSKIND: And the last thing
he writes, "Np sidekick gets

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.120
left behind."

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.920
In a way, this is
his answer back

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.730
to what the world sees of him.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.510
You know, I was already
out as a journalist

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.250
writing about the
left-behind people

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.390
of the world in
inner city America,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.760
in Afghanistan,
in Pakistan, folks

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.700
who were in the discard pile.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.740
Of course, the most
left behind person

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.580
I knew was living
in the bedroom.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.580
And more and more over
the years, as Walter

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.560
says-- Owen's older brother--
Owen is our best teacher.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.990
Silent child for many years,
making sense of the world

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.010
from what he can grab from
the wide world of content,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.630
the web, an image,
and turning it

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.950
into a vessel that becomes a
vessel that we all can board.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.750
And that's we have now with
the movie, that everyone

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.610
is boarding this ocean liner
of making sense of the world

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.044
through passion, through
the things we love,

00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:40.659
through things that are often
not validated as important.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:41.970
But they are.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.580
It's what we do with them.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.500
It's how we own them, how
we fit them to our lives.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.270
And that's why we're having
so much fun with this movie.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.080
I mean, it's amazing.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.440
So we won the Director's
Award at Sundance.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.020
That's where it
debut in January.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.100
And this was the first
time we saw it with people.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.790
And Owen is there.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.180
And Cornelia and Walter
saw it for the first time

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.390
at Sundance, which is audacious.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.640
Obviously, you can see I'm
married to an audacious woman

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.360
here, ferocious.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.020
And she's like, well,
we know our life.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.170
The question is will
people get our life?

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.030
And we'll know it at
Sundance with 1,000 people.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.240
At the end of the movie,
the lights come up.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.740
And Roger Ross Williams, an
amazing director, Academy Award

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.036
winner, says, ladies and
gentlemen, Owen Suskind.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:30.990
SPEAKER: [GASPS]

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.580
RON SUSKIND: Owen bounds
down onto the stage.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.740
And everyone is up.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.110
And I've never heard
cheers like this.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.820
I mean, they just cheered
themselves hoarse.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.880
And Owen's just feeling
this wash over him.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.240
I mean, the whole thing
started with the book and then

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.220
the movie six years ago,
where Owen said to me--

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.660
and Cornelia's like--
he's like, people

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.380
don't see me for who I am.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.800
SPEAKER: He's the hero though.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.200
RON SUSKIND: Well,
that's what's emerged.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.290
But he has a
different twist on it.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.470
He says, really, really,
we're all really sidekicks,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.470
at our best when we help
others fulfill their destiny.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.050
And on that day, we
find our inner heroes.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.400
But we're really
sidekicks deep down.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.770
And you don't get
redrawn in this life.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.480
I love that because it means
that these notions of heroism

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.910
that are often very
brittle are now

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.810
recast by a left
behind person to say,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.510
heroism is a choice of what you
do to help someone else fulfill

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.760
their destiny.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.480
And in that way, you
fulfill your own.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.210
That's a beautiful
recasting that, of course,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.550
someone with autism does
because that's their gift.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.550
And so much of
what we see here is

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.700
a display of what I
call compensatory gifts.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.440
And all I have all
these neuroscientists.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.980
I'm living in neuroscience
fantasy camp these days.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.310
I can call them on the phone.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.000
SPEAKER: Tom Insel
is right here.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.874
RON SUSKIND: We got the
great Tom Insel here,

00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:04.772
who is like a rock star.

00:11:04.772 --> 00:11:05.730
SPEAKER: And a Googler.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.854
RON SUSKIND: And a Googler.

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:09.260
So, tom, just so you know--
he's sitting near me here.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.885
Tom was the head of
the National Center

00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.930
for Mental Health since 2002.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.710
Right?

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.030
And Tom was already a
big autism researcher.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.230
But then he sat in really
the hot seat of an era

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:28.170
when, at Tom's behest, we began
to redefine neurodivergence

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.980
as maybe not all the big P
pathology we thought it was,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.980
to say, look, yes, the
deficits and the disabilities

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.320
are profound, but
it's more complicated.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.260
And what my neuroscience
friends tell

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.070
me is that for every
deficit that is visible--

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.910
and we measure them religiously,
exhaustively-- somewhere,

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.824
there's an equal and
opposite strength.

00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:53.240
The question is
not if, but where.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.880
The brain, neuroplasticity,
its definition,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.920
a working definition is
that the brain finds a way,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.240
with often enormous ingenuity.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.280
And that neural
pathway's a strength.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.230
Now, Owen is bursting with
compensatory strengths

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.070
in this movie.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.560
And it's not something
we knew for a long time.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.946
For a long time,
we said, oh, my.

00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:18.670
What's going to happen?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.780
What will his life be like?

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.980
And so that's our journey.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.060
SPEAKER: Can you tell us the
moment that you recognized

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.510
this compensatory strength?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.490
Was it that first phrase
he uttered in the movie

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.740
that Cornelia responded to?

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.270
I mean, he comes out with
profound heroic statements

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.810
about the nature of humanity.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.470
in this movie.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.400
RON SUSKIND: Well, look,
we've got a couple clips.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.066
Let's do a clip.

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:45.890
So let's do the clip-- right
now, you can see it happening,

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.600
where you see Owen
as a little guy.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.270
He's 2 1/2.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.120
He's got a few hundred
word vocabulary,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.610
like a typical 2 1.2 year old.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.150
We're living in what we called
then the continent of normal,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.820
whatever that means.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.880
We didn't even know we lived
there until later, until we

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.280
were exiled from there.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.250
OK, so we're living in this
lovely house in Dedham.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.540
And you can see the clip.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.152
And then I'll tell
you what happens.

CORNELIA SUSKIND:
Daddy and Owen fighting

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.105
with swords in the leaves.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.826
RON SUSKIND: Owen, who are you?

00:13:27.826 --> 00:13:29.170
-I'm Peter Pan.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.970
And you're Captain Hook.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.900
-Oh, I'm Captain Hook.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.647
You're Peter Pan.

00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:35.160
OK, come on, Pan.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.290
You're a demon.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.790
Yes!

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.540
RON SUSKIND: There's a
video we came across.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.570
And then once we found it,
we couldn't stop watching it.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.830
OWEN SUSKIND: Your weapon.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.820
-Thank you, thank you.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.610
That's very chivalrous of you.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.120
Now, in a way, it's just
an unremarkable video

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.880
of a dad and the son playing.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.010
I'm chasing Owen around.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.270
He's chasing me around.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.010
He's Peter Pan.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.951
I'm Captain Hook.

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:09.244

RON SUSKIND: At the time we
shot it, I'm in my early 30s.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.380
I'm a reporter for "The
Wall Street Journal."

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.180
And our life is taking shape
just the way we'd want it.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.640
-We had two beautiful boys.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.080
We'd just had our second boy.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.340
We had a little tiny house.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.920
But it was just like
our dream house.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.772
-You want to say hi to Mommy?

00:14:34.772 --> 00:14:35.547
-Hi Mommy!

falling into place.

sudden, at three years old,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.955
Owen vanishes.

CORNELIA SUSKIND:
Goodbye, Peter Pan.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.600
RON SUSKIND: So that's
the before time.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.780
We moved to Washington about
a week after that was shot.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.840
Exciting time.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.520
I became the senior
national affairs

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.061
writer for "The Wall
Street Journal,"

00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:16.690
a job you got to kill people
to get I killed 10 guys to get

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.800
the job, nice family
men, good guys.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.540
And we're just in a
hub-bub, boxes to unpack,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.460
new school for Walt,
new job for Dad.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.550
And a couple weeks in, about
a month, Cornelia's like,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.890
something's wrong with Owen.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.690
He's unhappy.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.300
He was always a happy guy.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.004
And he's-- then he's
not looking at me.

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:39.420
I mean, I stopped
telling her what

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.086
was happening at work
because every day,

00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:42.920
she had another story.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.120
And he's losing speech.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.580
About three months in, that
few hundred word vocabulary

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.940
is down to a single
word, juice, one word.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.014
And we don't know
what's happening.

00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:55.930
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.880
Kids don't grow backwards.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.380
Maybe he banged his head when
we weren't looking or ingested

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.540
something toxic, god forbid.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.540
So we see a doctor.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.680
She says, you need to see a
different doctor, a specialist.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.480
And we see her.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.665
And she says autism.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.210
What did we know?

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.830
We knew "Rain Man."

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.400
1988, that's what
most people knew.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.326
This was 1994,
first months of '94.

00:16:21.326 --> 00:16:24.270
I said, you're telling
me my son is like Dustin

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.170
Hoffman in that movie?

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.950
She's like, well,
maybe, a lot of them

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.010
don't speak again though.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.040
He might not talk anymore.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.900
Yeah, we didn't hear anything
else in the visit after that.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.610
All we heard was
noise in our ears.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.770
Cornelia and I literally
lifted out of our bodies.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.750
We were floating
on the drop ceiling

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.234
just like this looking
down on the scene,

00:16:51.234 --> 00:16:53.400
the kid on the rug looking
at his hands, the doctor,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.300
and these two parents.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.502
I mean, we used to say
we left them in there.

00:16:59.502 --> 00:17:01.210
They didn't leave with
us, those parents.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.420
I used to miss them.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.220
But we don't anymore because we
were starting a journey where

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.569
we were-- Owen changed,
but we were changing,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.720
which we didn't realize.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.700
So off we went into a
time of silence and panic.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.625
We found a new doctor,
which was good.

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:28.000
And the first
thing he says to me

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.430
is, what do you do for a living.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.030
I'm like, me?

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.740
I'm a reporter.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.550
He's like, I'm so
sorry to hear that.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.154
I'm like, why?

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.320
So you're good with numbers?

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.660
I'm like, [INAUDIBLE] math.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.880
I test OK.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.542
Investment banking, a
terrific career choice.

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:43.500
I'm like, what do mean?

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.767
He said, you just paid
me $120 for this visit.

00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:47.850
You're going to need to
see me three times a week.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.114
It's not covered.

00:17:49.114 --> 00:17:50.050
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.697
RON SUSKIND: Oh, god.

00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:52.780
I said, this is what I do.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.870
I'm a story guy.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.310
I'm a reporter.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.040
He said, you'd better
be really good at it.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.870
We we're bankrupt by the summer.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.720
And then we were
just living in fear.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.314
Now, Owen is silent at
this point, no words.

00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:11.730
But he's murmuring-- a few
months in-- a little jibberish.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.440
He's saying,
juicerfuzz, juicerfuzz.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.621
We're like, sounds
are good, like a baby.

00:18:17.621 --> 00:18:19.370
And Cornelia thought
he wanted more juice.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.960
But he didn't want the juice.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.280
He knocked over the sippy cup.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.780
He had graduated
to the big boy cup.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.770
But the motor function
goes crazy with autism.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.120
The one area it worked
though, the motor function,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.380
was his thumb on the remote--

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.350
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.100
RON SUSKIND: The thumb
on the rewind button.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.470
His brother taught him
how to use the rewind.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.065
And he watched "The
Little Mermaid" a lot.

00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:45.440
Now, how many people here have
seen "The Little Mermaid"?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.149
every single person.

00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:48.690
SPEAKER: What was
his favorite scene?

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.260
Because I'm sure he had one.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.580
RON SUSKIND: Well, he had one.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.390
You know this with Patrick.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.870
So the scene he
loved was where Ariel

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.530
loses her voice, where she makes
her deal with Ursula the sea

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:02.247
witch.

00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:03.560
OK?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.360
So, you know Ariel, a selfish
girl, wants what she wants,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.920
do anything to get it.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.492
She's working now
at Goldman Sachs.

00:19:10.492 --> 00:19:11.200
She's doing fine.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.350
The whole Eric thing
didn't work out.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.040
The prince, the whole prince
thing doesn't usually work.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.980
And so she'll make her
deal with the sea witch.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.900
And of course, the
sea witch says,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.480
it won't cost you much, a
trifle really, just your voice.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.990
Owen rewinds it.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.800
Walter's like, Owen,
just watch the movie.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.350
Second rewind, third rewind.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.682
Cornelia grabs me!

00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:33.390
It's not "juice."

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.090
I said, it's not "juice."

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.210
It's "just."

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.580
I grab Owen.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.110
"Just your voice!"

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.550
And he looks at me for
the first time in a year.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.220
And he says, "juicerfuzz,
juicerfuzz, juicerfuzz."

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.735
Walter starts
jumping on the bed.

00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:48.740
Owen's talking again.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.790
And Cornelia starts to cry
and says, he's still in there.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.010
This goes on for years.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.680
We see our doctor the next day,
Alan Rosenblatt, terrific guy.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.450
He says, look, sit down.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.970
You're not going
to like this word.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.240
This is called echolalia.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.440
I'm like, oh, I hate that word.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.880
Is that what-- yeah, it's
kind of what it sounds like.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.350
Like a parrot?

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.220
He's like yeah, they're
just repeating the sounds.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.070
The thinking is they
don't understand them.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.610
I mean, we called this
our Helen Keller moment.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.430
So that's where we lived for
years, between the pet store

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.220
and Helen Keller.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.640
And he's murmuring
more jibberish,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.280
scripting we call it, taking
little pieces of dialogue.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.500
The view then is not only
is the Disney obsessive,

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.600
but it's not productive
for him to be doing that.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.560
Jump ahead to the
next scene actually,

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.420
where-- so you met
me and Cornelia,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.250
this extraordinary woman, who
is also journalist like me.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.820
But as soon as
Owen is diagnosed,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.780
she's like, I have
my job forever, him.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.240
And your job is to make
more money than any reporter

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.740
in the history of newspapers.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.240
SPEAKER: Why don't
you write a book?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.906
RON SUSKIND: Outta
here, get outta here!

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.890
Enjoy, have fun.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.070
Right, I mean, thank god I won a
Pulitzer Prize soon thereafter.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.640
But necessity is the mother
of terrific invention.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.550
Trust me.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.490
So Owen and Cornelia and
I are at the core of it.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.530
But there's another
key actor here,

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.300
which is Walter,
who is as important

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.890
a character in this
movie as anybody

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.680
in the book and our life.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.530
Now, he's the sibling.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.780
And he's like a lot of siblings
of people with disabilities.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.920
From early on, he sees
Mom and Dad are really

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.140
overwhelmed here.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.100
So I'm good.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.920
I'm on my own.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.710
It's like a little
character out of Dickens.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.240
See ya.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.420
OK?

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.270
David Copperfield.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:44.180
So Walt is tough and resilient
and can handle anything

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.180
the world throws at him.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.516
This is the story Cornelia and
I tell each other about Walt

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.890
because I'm a
story guy, and this

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.050
is a lot about story, the
stories we tell ourselves

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.260
to make our way in the world.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.500
Owen does it too.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.290
So the story about Walt was
that, the Jewish marine,

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.360
handle anything the
world throws at him.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.560
But he'll never leave his little
brother behind, two-part story.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.910
We don't even notice he
gets emotional on only one

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.540
day of the year, his birthday.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.970
It doesn't fit our story.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.160
So on Walter's ninth
birthday, Owen's almost seven,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.955
Walt's in the backyard
with the other kids.

00:22:15.955 --> 00:22:16.580
The kids leave.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.080
Owen's back there.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.100
Walt gets a little weepy.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.770
Owen follows us back
into the kitchen.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.530
Now at this point,
after years of therapy--

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.610
I mean, morning, noon,
and night-- Owen's

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.580
up to a three-word
sentence, I want juice.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.390
And we're feeling OK about that.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.540
At least he can
say what he wants.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.916
He follows us into the kitchen.

00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:39.790
He looks at Cornelia.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.280
He looks at me.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.860
Something odd,
something's bubbling up.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.260
And he goes, Walter
doesn't want to grow up,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.870
like Mowgli or Peter Pan.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.450
And off he goes.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.653
We're like, what's that?

00:22:51.653 --> 00:22:54.960
It's like a thunderbolt
went through the kitchen.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.770
So we're struck silent.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.180
And then we can stop
talking for hours.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.600
Finally, Cornelia says to me,
look, you're the crazy one.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.160
You wear the propeller hats
at the birthday parties.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.420
Find a way in.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.100
I'm tired.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.820
I'm up every night with him.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.456
This is your job.

00:23:13.456 --> 00:23:16.720
The guys don't
often get a prompter

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.860
they can try to lift the
back of the Volkswagen.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.650
That's mostly the mom.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.400
So I go up.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.480
And it's this very
night that this occurs.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.566
So let's play that second scene.

00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:30.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.740
RON SUSKIND: So I
go up to his room.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.690
I see Owen on the bed,
flipping through a Disney book.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:43.980
And over to my left, I
see Iago, the puppet.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.980
Now Iago is the evil
sidekick to the villain Jafar

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.960
from "Aladdin."

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.430
Now, I know Owen
loves this puppet.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.400
-Jafar!

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.370
Jafar!

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.825
Get a grip!

00:23:53.825 --> 00:23:55.280
[CHOKES]

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.882
-I grab the puppet.

00:23:56.882 --> 00:23:58.920
I pull it up to my elbow.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.310
And I begin to crawl across
the rug as quietly as I can.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.970
And Owen turns to
the puppet like he's

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.860
bumping into an old friend.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.190
I say to him,
[IAGO VOICE] Owen, Owen,

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.658
how does it feel to be you?

00:24:15.658 --> 00:24:20.930
-And I said not good because
I don't have any friends.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.446
-Now I'm under the bedspread.

00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:25.230
And I just bite down hard.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.446
I just say to myself,
stay in character.

00:24:33.446 --> 00:24:38.380
[IAGO VOICE] And I said,
OK, OK, Owen, when did you

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.630
and I become such good friends?

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:48.350
And he said, when I watched
"Aladdin," you made me laugh.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.805
And then we talk, Owen
and Iago, for a minute,

00:24:53.805 --> 00:24:56.230
minute-and-a-half.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.957
It's the first conversation
we've ever had.

00:24:58.957 --> 00:25:00.210
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:04.360
RON SUSKIND: So what happens
after the two minutes,

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.580
after we have this
moment, all of a sudden,

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.900
Owen clears his throat.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.070
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.570
And he says, [JAFAR VOICE]
"I love the way

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.390
your foul little mind works."

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.010
That's Jafar.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.602
It's the next line.

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.310
And I threw off the
bed-- I was like, ah,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.960
we're talking in Disney dialog.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.940
oh, my god.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.470
This is the way
we'll communicate.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.470
The next night, we start what
we called the basement sessions.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.460
"Jungle Book" was big.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.530
Owen loves "Jungle Book."

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.870
So we had all four of
us go to the basement.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.980
Now, I'm going to be
Baloo, which kind of works

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.320
other than the height thing.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.060
Cornelia is Bagheera,
the protective panther.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.050
Walter's King Louie.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.090
"Tell me the secret of
man's red fire, man cub."

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.140
And Owen's Mowgli.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.630
And off we go,
scene after scene.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.300
Now, we need the
screen because Owen's

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.230
going to outrun you quick.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.940
He's memorized 50
movies, all of them.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.440
He can go for hours.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.310
So we do a scene.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.990
We refresh.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.270
We do it.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.780
We do it.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.840
So by about the
seventh scene in,

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.810
it's a scene where
Baloo says to Mowgli,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.000
he says, you know, you'd
make one great bear.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.020
And Mowgli says, do you
think so, Papa bear?

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.440
And then Owen hugs me.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.150
And I'm not sure if it's Mowgli
and Baloo or me and Owen.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.450
And of course, Cornelia
says it doesn't matter.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.420
And it doesn't.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.070
And that's what happens.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.900
We move forward for years
playing animated characters.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.240
That's how Owen gets his
speech back over years.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.140
He learns to read
by reading credits,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.990
all tapping
intrinsic motivation.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.380
This is part of autism.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.810
They're self-directed
just like poets are.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:46.700
This is what I do.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.350
This is who I am.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.780
They won't do the transaction
in a one-size-fits-all.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.770
They'll never do it.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.420
And they'll never
succeed doing it.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.930
So we start living a double
life, the whole family.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.329
By day, Walt's going to school,
riding his bike in blizzards

00:27:03.329 --> 00:27:05.620
cause he doesn't want Cornelia
to drop him off and have

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.660
Owen come in because then
it'll be about his brother.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.530
What's with the brother?

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.380
Cornelia's running ragged.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.880
I'm interviewing presidents,
[BILL CLINTON VOICE]

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.240
some of who I know are
not telling me the truth.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.000
I mean--

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.994 --> 00:27:27.235
I'm not sure, but--
And at night, we're

00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:30.440
animated characters, in
the basement meditating

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.090
on the emergence of the hero.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.660
SPEAKER: Were you conscious
that you were meditating

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.120
on the emergence of the hero?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.700
Or did that come over time?

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.408
RON SUSKIND: Owen made
us conscious of it

00:27:40.408 --> 00:27:43.950
because, as Patrick does,
as so many of the folks do,

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.080
he was starting to use
the narrative frames

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.760
and tropes as structures
to understand himself.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.700
And so in a way, Owen, through
these years, starts to lead,

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.500
like saying, no,
no, this character

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.610
has not fulfilled his destiny.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.030
And this character
here is confused.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.840
But here's the twist.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.857
This character
advances the plot.

00:28:07.857 --> 00:28:09.690
He was looking for
people who were advancing

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.850
the plot in his own
life to match the mirror

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.740
and codebreaker that
the content provided.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.200
Again, we didn't know
really what we were seeing.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.810
Now we know.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.710
Now, all of our
neuroscience friends

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.293
and the therapists
and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:25.293 --> 00:28:26.920
are saying, yeah,
yeah, this is the way

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.210
it actually is
working and works.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.300
The content they
embrace is a choice

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.700
which shows the way their brains
actually work, what feeds them.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.220
The map kids might be
different from the Disney kids.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.500
But they all do it the same way.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.440
They use it as their mirror,
their map, their guide,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.740
their vessel.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.270
Now, for us neurotypicals,
we're like, gosh,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.560
if I have to watch
"Dumbo" one more time,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.230
I'm going to run
away with the circus.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.720
But then you're like, no,
no-- Cornelia said it best.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.670
Loving what he loves is the
way we are going to love him.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.640
And we'll do it all together.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.760
And we're going to live
in this underground cavern

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.000
that he's building.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.620
It's like an underground palace.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.240
So another clip is
Owen going forward.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.410
And you're going
to see that as he

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:26.010
gets through his teenage years,
he moves out into the world.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.990
Goes to a school on Cape
Cod called Riverview.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.140
And it's a big jump for him.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.910
He's leaving home.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.400
And he starts Disney Club.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.640
We know other kids
are doing this.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.470
But we don't really know
it in terms of something

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.850
we can touch.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.790
So here is Disney Club.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:47.780
This is very cool.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.580
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.660
-Oh, OK.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.850
Listen up.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.090
As soon as everyone
gets here, we can begin.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.170
-Hey, Owen?

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:54.670
-Yeah.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.878
-Could I just recommend that
instead of saying listen up,

00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:57.830
you say may I have
your attention?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.288
-May I have your
attention, please?

00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:01.920
When everyone gets
here, we'll begin.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.320
I started a Disney Club So I
can get to know more people

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.430
and they can be around me,
so I can be more popular.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.182
It worked.

00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:14.890
Tonight, we're watching
some of "The Lion

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.040
King," because this year
is the big 20th anniversary

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.320
of the original release
of "The Lion King."

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.230
-Yeah, sure!

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.720
-Shall we?

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.330
-Then-- then not only
am big Disney fanatic,

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.550
but I also like to play magical
movie scores on this piano.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.550
-Yeah!

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.550

[PIANO MUSIC, PEOPLE SINGING]

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.140
OWEN SUSKIND: We watch parts
of the Disney animated films

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.520
and discuss them and
see what they're really

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.707
about in our lives.

00:30:44.707 --> 00:30:45.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:50.060
RON SUSKIND: The first
Disney Club we went to-- Owen

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.292
goes to school in Cape Cod.

00:30:51.292 --> 00:30:52.500
We were living in Washington.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.980
I was fighting it
out in that terrain.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.300
And I came up to Harvard to
be the writer in residence.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.020
So we're only an hour away.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.960
And it was better we
were close to Owen.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.840
It's far, Washington
to Cape Cod.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.230
And we were just an
hour down the road.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:07.667
And Owen starts at this school.

00:31:07.667 --> 00:31:08.750
And he starts Disney Club.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.140
We;re like, fabulous.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.789
This is great.

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:12.080
He'd never even been in a club.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.971
Now, he's the
president of a club.

00:31:13.971 --> 00:31:15.970
And so we're like, so
what do you do every week?

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.960
Well, we watch Disney
movies and eat popcorn.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.760
I'm like, OK, you
need to do something.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.710
You need a program.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.770
So about eight months in, after
Cornelia and I are hawking him

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.000
every week, he's
like, well, they said

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.270
we can have parent advisers.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.130
So I guess you guys can come.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.152
So we're like,
[IMITATES SCREECHING TIRES].

00:31:34.152 --> 00:31:38.380
We make it from Harvard Square
to the Cape in 32 minutes.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.930
And we get into the room.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.830
And there's 12
kids just like him.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.650
That's the revelation.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.530
And they're watching
"Dumbo" first time

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.790
we-- which is a
great choice really.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.430
I mean, it's one of the
quintessential narratives.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.150
And if Joseph Campbell
was sitting here

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.440
with this, or Maria
Tatar from Harvard,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.150
the folklore chief who is
my buddy, she'd say, yeah,

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.670
"Dumbo" is a story humanity
has been telling itself

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.590
for thousands of years
in every culture,

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.750
just like "Beauty and the
Beast" and "Snow White."

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.100
The Brothers Grimm took them.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.160
Disney took them.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.150
They're the tales that
help us manage our life.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.530
They're not simple.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.160
They're quite
complicated, in fact,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.120
in terms of all the human
attributes that are challenged

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.340
and then express themselves.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.931
So I say to this young lady
sitting there-- I'm like,

00:32:27.931 --> 00:32:28.430
"Dumbo."

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.350
She's like, that's
my number one.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.730
OK, so you tell me why.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:39.490
She's like, OK, well, well, I
didn't talk for a long time.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.586
And Dumbo doesn't talk.

00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:45.490
What we find out later is
many of the non-verbal kids

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.780
are bonding with non-verbal
characters, of course,

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.745
of course.

00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:51.550
They express all
emotions without words.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.570
She said, but then
I learned to talk.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:33:00.620
And I was an outcast for much
of my life, junior high school.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.500
And then I saw
what it was about.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:08.130
You see, the things that made
Dumbo an outcast, those ears,

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:12.180
he learns that they're
his greatest strength

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.700
and allow him to soar.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.600
And that's the
way it is with me.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.990
The things that
make me different

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.240
are my greatest strengths.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.050
And I can soar too.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.150
That's why I'm a Dumbo girl.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.580
That's all we needed to hear.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.900
That's Emily, his girlfriend.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.680
It's like, that's good.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.596
That's the one for me.

00:33:29.596 --> 00:33:30.797

00:33:30.797 --> 00:33:31.630
I mean, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.340
Are you getting more than that
with 10 dates of small talk?

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.343
I mean, really?

00:33:35.343 --> 00:33:37.490
No, you know that's no.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.390
So they become a couple.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.172

doing this third year,

00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:42.630
when he's the
president for three--

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.510
there's like eight boy-girl
couples in Disney Club.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.430
They're speaking a
language they share.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.780
It's a lingua franca
of their affinity,

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:57.320
their interest, a language,
just like the languages we talk.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.010
And so what's really
powerful about this

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.790
is what it helps us
see with new eyes,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.250
I guess Proust would
say, as to the way people

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.730
find each other in
a way they can now

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.600
and they kind of couldn't
when I'm a kid, based

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.389
on their powerful
interests that define them

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.176
and that they can
go 100 feet deep on.

00:34:19.176 --> 00:34:21.550
We were talking a minute ago
with one of the young ladies

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.156
here about-- your
brother, right?

00:34:24.156 --> 00:34:25.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.570
RON SUSKIND: And
what is he, Disney?

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.403
Or what's his thing?

00:34:27.403 --> 00:34:28.429
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he loves Disney.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.304
RON SUSKIND: Does he?

00:34:29.304 --> 00:34:31.230
So one of the things
I thought about

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.671
is in a little
technological changes,

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.170
some things have
an enormous effect.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.090
And one that all
of you, I think,

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:42.300
probably know is when the VCR
arrives for home use in home

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.020
penetration around the
mid-'80's, that's actually huge

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.264
because content then was
on free feed, on demand.

00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:51.139
And everyone built-up
those little libraries.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:55.840
Remember the little clamshell
box with the VCR's, VHS tapes.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.380
And that was really
important for Owen.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.285
And I dare say that
before that, there

00:35:00.285 --> 00:35:02.300
were probably more
kids who were map kids

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.670
and train schedule kids.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.870
And more of them
migrated over to videos

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.250
because they were getting
more from them as models,

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:16.660
as mirrors, as really clues
that they could really decipher.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.600
And that's kind of big
because what's happening now

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:27.170
is that Disney clubs-- every
kid who left that room went out

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.170
into the world after they
graduated and started

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.590
a Disney club, which is neat.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.320
So now virtually, they
can meet other people.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.410
And they can share the
thing that defines them.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.570
That's a very exciting change.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.550
And the other
change is that when

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.290
people hear Owen
and the other kids

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.600
in that room talk about what
they see in a movie all of us

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.140
have seen, they're like, how
can they see so much more

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.030
in the movie than I do?

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.690
And I test really well.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.640
What's going on here?

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.140
That's good.

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:06.500
That up ends lots of things that
end with a lot of people being

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:12.470
dismissive of those who don't
fit one-size-fits-all models

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.930
of measuring ability or
value or in a way, meaning.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.680
There's a line in the
middle of the movie that

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.880
jumps off the screen.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.920
And every time I hear
this-- and Cornelia says it.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.960
I cry every single time where
she says, at one point--

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.130
and it's because someone
challenged us, and an expert,

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.427
in fact.

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.260
And we could see the
way she looked at Owen.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.955
And it wasn't the
way we saw him.

00:36:40.955 --> 00:36:45.500
It was a little bit
like the broken toy.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.420
And she said, you know, Ron
once said to me-- she says,

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.610
forty feet tall on the screen.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.420
She said, who decides what
the meaningful life is?

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.820
Who makes that call?

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.590
And the idea of the who is
a challenge that you may not

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.010
be making that decision
in ways you think.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.870
Maybe the culture, maybe
certain ideas of success,

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:14.444
maybe the tyranny of the
oo-ahs, oo, Harvard, ah,

00:37:14.444 --> 00:37:16.828
Cape Cod Community College.

00:37:16.828 --> 00:37:18.820
Huh.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.750
And why shouldn't we
talking about the one

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:22.830
son and not the other.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.680
All that shapes us.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.090
And I think it shapes
us often unconsciously.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.360
Owen called that
question in our family.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:39.370
And that made us better,
really measurably better.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.940
When I say he helped us
find our inner heroes,

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.570
that's how he did it,
by forcing the question.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.650
So that question, and
what I consider progress,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.390
was discussed last
week at Dartmouth,

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.610
where they saw the movie.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.010
And university-wide, they
did discussion groups

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.200
asking that question.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.650
Who decides the meaningful life?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.050
Are you deciding?

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.130
Someone deciding that for you?

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.520
You didn't realize
that they are.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.790
I love that conversation.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.820
And in three weeks, the entire
Houston public school system,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.940
all of them, all the staff,
29,000 people and all 200,000

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.316
students, are going to watch
the movie and ask that question.

00:38:21.316 --> 00:38:23.440
Now, mind you, many of them
are African-American or

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.060
Latino-American students
from tough circumstances.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.640
And the prompt
will be, you decide

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.150
what the meaningful life is.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.120
Don't let anyone
impose that on you.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.297
That's your choice.

00:38:36.297 --> 00:38:37.880
And the last thing
I'll say about this

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.360
is about three months ago,
we had an amazing moment,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.230
where we watched the movie.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.410
They screened it at Disney.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.010
Yeah, I know.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.540
It was crazy.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.790
It was like a gigantic
catharsis in a theater.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.070
SPEAKER: I think they
should employ him.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:51.570
Come on.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.960
RON SUSKIND: OK.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.750
Is this being telecast?

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.030
I'm calling Burbank, California.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.800
No, I mean, Disney has been
great to Owen, in fact.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.870
And he knows lots
of people at Disney.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.910
And they love him.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.880
And he loves them.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.370
Of course, he knows
every credit they

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:12.160
ev-- he's like a walking IMDb,
which they love, of course.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.610
No one know that.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.320
Really?

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.560
My wife doesn't know that.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.060
SPEAKER: Owen knows it.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.050
RON SUSKIND: Owen does.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.010
So they screen the movie.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:23.570
And one of the animators,
they're all bawling their eyes

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:24.730
out and they're cheering.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.270
And one of them said,
Owen, what about that

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:32.230
question that your mom asked
about the meaningful life.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.850
Who decides the meaningful life?

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.300
And the room got very quiet.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.885
It's a challenge, in a way.

00:39:38.885 --> 00:39:41.190
And Owen just there
about 30 seconds.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.560
And he said, I do.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.680
I decide.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.470
Boy, that feels
like justice to me.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.900
So that's what's happening.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.950
SPEAKER: Well, Ron, I
could ask 1,000 questions.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.840
I think we have another
video clip to show.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.830
RON SUSKIND: Yeah, and we have
20 minutes still for questions.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.750
And this little video.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.037
So we're OK.

00:40:02.037 --> 00:40:02.870
SPEAKER: We're good.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.300
We're good because I don't
even need to be here.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.500
We'll just wind him up.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:08.970
RON SUSKIND: No, Eileen.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.600
Without you, what would I do?

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.109
SPEAKER: But here
are some things

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:14.150
that have occurred to me.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.960
RON SUSKIND: She's my sidekick.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.710
SPEAKER: I'm the sidekick.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.420
I'm not used to
being the sidekick.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.550
RON SUSKIND: And
she [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.440
SPEAKER: But there is something
in this journey as a parent.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.380
And at a point in your life,
I'm sure you had sorry eyes.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.910
Your sister, your cousin,
oh, I'm so sorry for you.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:39.880
What people don't
recognize is the enrichment

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.560
that comes with having
non-conventional situations

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.560
in your life and the
strength that comes

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.205
with finding other pathways in.

00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:53.860
It sounds to me though,
you just had an intuitive

00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:00.400
moment there with Iago, caw,
and followed it quite naturally.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.500
A lot of the techniques that
are introduced to parents

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.310
is get into their passion area.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:12.780
My child, it was subways,
horses, and Disney.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.490
Those were the three paths in.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.970
And as a reward for his
first use of the big boy

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.550
toilet, my son-- I was
bundled in the cold going

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.620
home one night from work.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.590
And I see my husband and
son leaving the apartment.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.190
And I shout across the
windy streets of New York,

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.270
where are you guys going?

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.060
Patrick pooped in the potty!

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.465
We're going to the subway.

00:41:34.465 --> 00:41:35.678
RON SUSKIND: Oh, my god.

00:41:35.678 --> 00:41:39.180
[LAUGHTER] That's amazing.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.000
It's amazing.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.230
SPEAKER: Guess where he
wanted to go the next day?

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.045
The subway.

00:41:43.045 --> 00:41:44.794
I'm like, no, no, no,
it's not every time.

00:41:44.794 --> 00:41:46.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.160
So we've got no over
that particular instance.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:56.450
But you just knew that you had
to reward or follow a passion.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.410
One of the first conversations
I had with Patrick

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.300
was while he was
speaking to a horse.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.940
He'd gone away to
school in Boston.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.630
He came back.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.380
And we were near
a horse breeding

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.280
farm, where there was this one
horse, Traveler, whom he loved.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.950
And we walked up
with our carrots.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:18.280
And he started speaking
in full clear sentences.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.360
Oh, Traveler, my
buddy, my friend, I've

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.430
missed you so much.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.280
How have you been?

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.475
You're getting bigger, bud.

00:42:25.475 --> 00:42:26.350
A whole conversation.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.540
I'm like, what about me?

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.611
You want to ask
me how I'm doing?

00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:31.610
RON SUSKIND: You need to
start whinnying is what

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.630
you need, stamping your foot.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:37.340
SPEAKER: But we absolutely
indulged those passions.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.890
And so I mean, some of us
might be parents, siblings,

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.730
interested parties.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.880
We may be
neurotypically atypical

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.480
ourselves in this room.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.930
What can you tell
us about raising

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.490
a child with extra
needs and accessing

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.900
these passions as paths in and
enrichment for your own life.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.620
RON SUSKIND: I love
your horse story.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.744
And the subways, of course.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:04.630
I mean, in a way, Patrick
not ingesting context

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:05.910
of the supposed to's.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.870
So he sees things as they are.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:11.110
Look, I mean, we think subways--
oh, what's the big deal?

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.210
Subways are amazing.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:12.880
SPEAKER: They are amazing.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.380
RON SUSKIND: I mean,
think about it,

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.780
a train that runs underground
jammed with people.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.160
I mean, that's an
amazing creation.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.549
And we are taught
as little kids,

00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:24.340
horses can't understand
what you're saying.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.500
But they kind of do.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.040
Patrick doesn't "know
better," so he tries things

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.540
that we're taught not to do.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.660
And I think that's
a big part of this

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.250
is you've got to look at
yourself as not necessarily

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:42.900
superior, which is hard to do
sometimes, to the individual.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.100
You say, they are my peer.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:45.950
I'm just different.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:46.750
That's all.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.680
So part of that is looking at
the neurotypical differences

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.140
you have to them.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.830
And that's sometimes hard to
look at yourself that way.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:44:00.180
But that's the key, actually,
because then, you'll

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.250
burn off a lot of
neurotypical blind spots

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:07.030
that you either have or
are taught to embrace.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.370
I mean, I'll give an example.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.055
A famous molecular biologist,
I won't say what his name is.

00:44:11.055 --> 00:44:12.820
A great guy, he's
friend of mine.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.860
He called me up when he had
read the book two years ago.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.850
And he says, gosh, I
wish my kid-- Paul,

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.325
let's say-- was a Disney kid.

00:44:22.325 --> 00:44:23.450
I wish he was a Disney kid.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.440
He's a map kid.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.204
And I'm like, OK.

00:44:26.204 --> 00:44:27.120
So we're on the phone.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.661
And I'm like, so the question
is, are all of these affinities

00:44:29.661 --> 00:44:31.380
created equal?

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.580
And all of a sudden, we start
to think, wait a second.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.290
Maps are the two-dimensional
rendering of all humanity.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.290
The cartographers of the
great geniuses of their age.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.550
Everything's on a map if
you know where to look.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.580
I said to my friend,
you need to start

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.570
speaking map with your kid.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:53.080
A month later, they've been
speaking map for a month.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.510
He calls me up.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.140
He's like, an amazing
thing happened.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.370
And he talks to me about
how the kid expressed love

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:03.910
by identifying a city on a
map there that represented,

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.164
in its characteristics,
his father.

00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:09.080
A girl comes up to meet
at the Semel Institute

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.900
not too long ago.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.570
I gave a speech
over there at UCLA.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.350
A perfect example,
a dinosaur girl.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.120
I'm like dinosaurs, great.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.400
So teach me.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.380
That's the way you do it.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.680
You are an expert.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.380
I'm not.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.790
Teach me.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.934
OK?

00:45:23.934 --> 00:45:24.725
And she's like, OK.

00:45:24.725 --> 00:45:25.660
I said, what's your favorite?

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.170
She was like, I don't
want to tell you.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.961
You'll laugh at me.

00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:29.440
I said, I promise I won't laugh.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.940
OK, the velociraptor.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.720
I'm like, OK, that's
a vicious animal.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.010
So why the Raptor?

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:41.590
OK, well, the Raptor,
it's a pack animal.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.400
And all pack animals
are not all the same.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.500
They move together.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.595
They need to recognize
what each does well.

00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:50.470
And if they work together,
they can take down

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.110
much larger dinosaurs.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:58.330
So it's about interdependency
and about relying on each other

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.310
and seeing each other
as we are really.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:02.810
And that's why I
love the raptor.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.740
I mean, there's not
a paleontologist

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.000
in the world that would
come up with that.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.710
What I love about that if she's
drawing from the affinity what

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.080
she needs to know herself.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.080
That's the reversal
of the telescope.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.520
That's what's happening.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.110
And that's why when you
feed these affinities,

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.565
these individuals grow into
these mighty individuals.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.780
They're square pegs.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.070
If you shave off the edges
to fit them into a world

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.150
that only prizes
round holes, you're

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.160
going to cut off the best stuff.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.240
So the key is, how do you have
them identify their passion--

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.410
and most parents
know early-- feed it,

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.570
and let them turn
it into a pathway

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.890
because it's not a prison.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.190
OK, we got this video.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.225
You've got to see this.

00:46:49.225 --> 00:46:50.840
This is us doing it.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.620
So Tom knows about this.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.490
When the book came
out two years ago,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:00.380
I spoke to the UN General
Assembly and Congress and NIH.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.490
And we got an
avalanche of parents

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.540
from all over the
world saying, I get it.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.100
I see now my kid
for who they are.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.410
But how do I do this?

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.490
I work out of the house.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:11.169
So does my wife.

00:47:11.169 --> 00:47:13.460
And we can't sit in the
basement watching Disney movies

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.030
for the next 10 years.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.700
So help us.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.580
So what we did is we
grabbed neuroscientists

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.413
and technologists from
all over the country,

00:47:20.413 --> 00:47:22.360
pulled them together in
a kind of consortium,

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.730
to build what we kind
of knew we needed.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.589
And it's a platform.

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:29.380
It's a new kind of
communications platform.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.910
It's called Sidekicks.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.120
Owen named it, number one.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.130
And actually, Owen
is on the patent

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.350
for guided personal
companion that was approved

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.830
by the US patent office.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.010
Isn't that great?

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.137
Because he helped us
come up with the idea.

00:47:44.137 --> 00:47:44.720
So here it is.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.344
So this is a four-minute video.

00:47:46.344 --> 00:47:47.510
Just hold it for one second.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:48.820
Let me explain what happens.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.225
What happens is the
kids download an avatar

00:47:51.225 --> 00:47:51.850
on their phone.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:53.710
They get to pick
which one they want.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.310
When you talk into your phone
or type, or into your computer,

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.200
it comes through in real time
in the voice of the character,

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.160
wherever they are.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.416
You could be in Mumbai doing it.

00:48:03.416 --> 00:48:04.540
They talk right back to it.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.320
It's all automated
speech recognition.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.200
Natural [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.330
And so it picks up their speech.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:13.760
And you're having a mediated
conversation that breathes life

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.370
into the entity.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.930
The entity mirrors
their interests.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.299
It loves what they love
because what we have is

00:48:20.299 --> 00:48:22.340
we have thousands of clips
from Disney and Warner

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.620
Brothers and all the
big content providers.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.620
These kids love what everyone
loves-- Harry Potter, Star

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.400
Wars, Disney-- that stream
across the platform.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.730
That's the stuff of
their language after all.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:34.890
The video runs.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.370
And the sidekick then--
you behind the curtain,

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.430
the therapist, the parent,
a brother or sister--

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.660
speaks to them
about what they see.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.190
The big matching game--
I know what Ariel feels,

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.870
but what do you feel?

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:48.530
And what does this tell you?

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.679
How can you apply
that to your life?

00:48:50.679 --> 00:48:52.220
What does it tell
you about yourself?

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.110
Code breaking with human
essence assistance.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.550
They neat part-- and a lot of
you guys, you're a lot of AI

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:02.610
people here-- is that
because the dialogue

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.135
is context aware-- they
know who the person is.

00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:06.010
It's not one to many.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:11.440
It's one to one-- and domain
limited, because that's autism,

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.720
and not only the subjects
that are domain limited,

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.910
but it's an individual,
it grows into automation

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.230
with significant speed.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.530
So the person is needed behind
the curtain less and less

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.230
and then only when
needed, they're summoned.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.980
So these are the first three
kids, all spectrum kids,

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.550
to use the device last year at
a thing we did at a university

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.920
usability study.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.590
Now, we knew all
their affinities.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.370
I think the girl
is a "Frozen" girl.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.460
The boy is a "Toy Story"
boy, the little guy.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.710
And the other guy's
a Star Wars guy.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.810
Each of them showed
a higher level

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.130
of expressive and receptive
speech and connection

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:54.810
than basically the parents had
ever seen on the first usage.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.030
It's crazy.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.530
OK, so watch this video.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:58.160
It's very cool.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.104
SPEAKER: Crazy.

00:49:59.104 --> 00:50:00.964
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:01.242 --> 00:50:02.408
AUTOMATED VOICE: Hey, there.

00:50:02.408 --> 00:50:04.768
I'm Jaze, your new sidekick.

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.468
Nice to meet you.

00:50:06.468 --> 00:50:06.967
-Hey.

00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:10.890
AUTOMATED VOICE: I heard you
really like Disney movies.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.140
Is that right?

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.910
-Yes.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.980
AUTOMATED VOICE: Want
to watch a funny video?

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.180
-Yeah, I do.

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.478
-I don't have a skull or bones.

00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:21.822
-[LAUGHS]

00:50:21.822 --> 00:50:24.070
-She's laughing at it.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:26.190
-That was really funny.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:30.710
-This is a very useful
tool for a family like ours

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.870
because we are currently stuck.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.004
So we know what his deficit is.

00:50:35.004 --> 00:50:36.420
But we don't know
how to help him.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.330
-A lot of the hard
work that's been

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:41.340
done with him in
the last seven years

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.250
around emotions
and other people's

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.660
emotions and his
emotions and how they all

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.040
interact, if I had had this
device seven years ago,

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.290
he would be a lot further
along than where he his now.

00:50:55.147 --> 00:50:56.480
AUTOMATED VOICE: I like burgers.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.291
What do you like?

00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:00.790
-Pizza.

00:51:05.027 --> 00:51:06.860
AUTOMATED VOICE: Would
you share it with me?

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.090
-Yes.

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:11.610
-If I had asked him,
what do you like to eat,

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.080
he would not give me
that same information.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.090
That's a very simple question.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:17.350
It was.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.030
I don't get an answer, I
like pizza or a burger.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:21.950
I have visuals at home usually.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.080
I have them on the fridge.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.480
And it's like, whoa, what do
you think you like to eat?

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.690
And he goes over there and
he'll pick the visuals.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.410
-At home, he only do
requests, like I want this.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:35.500
I want that.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.850
It's very hard for him
to initiate conversation

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.938
to express himself.

00:51:40.938 --> 00:51:42.901
-Thanks.

00:51:42.901 --> 00:51:44.314
[HORN HONKS]

00:51:44.314 --> 00:51:46.274
-Our buddy's saying, bye, house!

00:51:46.274 --> 00:51:46.940
-Woody, the man!

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.121
-Bye house!

00:51:49.121 --> 00:51:50.620
AUTOMATED VOICE:
It is kind of weird

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.120
that they say
good-bye to the house.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.019
-OK.

00:51:56.019 --> 00:51:57.560
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Why do they do that?

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:02.889
-Because he is moving to the
truck and Woody's plan worked.

00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:04.430
-Have you ever felt
afraid or ashamed

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:06.800
of being different
from other people?

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.264
-Sometimes.

00:52:08.264 --> 00:52:12.620
-Maybe we can watch a clip
to understand how you feel.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:13.792
-Sure thing.

00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:16.150
-You belong down in Arendelle.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.370
-So do you.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:22.190
-No, Anna, I belong
here, alone, where

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.220
I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.015
AUTOMATED VOICE: Have
you ever been afraid

00:52:28.015 --> 00:52:30.070
and wanted to be alone?

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.060
-Sometimes.

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.650
AUTOMATED VOICE: Why?

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.410
-Because I have low
self-esteem and autism.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.600
-Doing this, taking on this
other persona in order for her

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.180
to have a conversation, I could
more anonymously talk to her

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.770
or have her explain her
thoughts without it being mom.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:52.450
-Right.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:54.480
-Which speaks volumes.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.540
-Amazing to get
him to this point

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.540
where he's actually
interacting with the devices.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.390
But I think the ease
of use comes out

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:02.570
of the use of characters.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:03.840
The voice also helps.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.790
The visual helps.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.850
-We go to therapists
a lot because

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.420
in the different environment,
he behaves very differently.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.961
That's why I think
it's good that you

00:53:10.961 --> 00:53:13.690
can do it at the therapist
and then do it at hoe.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.157
Try to generalize
the skill he learned

00:53:16.157 --> 00:53:17.240
and then practice at home.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.300
That's why I think
it's a very useful app.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.590
I think this is a very good.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.800
-There's a therapist that
works with her that she sees

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.630
outside, just a personal one.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:31.810
And I think something like this
would probably be a great thing

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.685
to sell to that field.

00:53:33.685 --> 00:53:34.750
-It's that great?

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.340
-But I would have used
this as a tool with him

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.660
maybe to get him to express
his feelings of grief

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.780
around his father because it's
always a very difficult topic.

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.850
And with the use
of the character,

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.540
it would have been much easier
to get him to talk about it.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.623
WOMAN: What's some other
stuff, in your own words,

00:53:50.623 --> 00:53:52.440
about what it's like
to use Sidekick?

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.210
-So that way I don't can speak
to her when I'm in distress.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.250
So that way, I can talk to her.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:05.222
And she-- and she
understands how I feel.

00:54:05.222 --> 00:54:07.430
WOMAN: Can you think of
anything that we could change

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.190
or add to make Sidekick better?

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:11.600
-You could add my
favorite movies

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.690
like "Inside Out"
and "Cinderella,"

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:24.165
and "Paul Blart, Mall Cop"
and "Home" and "Pixels."

00:54:24.165 --> 00:54:25.040
-You think it was OK?

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.090
Or did you like it a lot?

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.055
-I liked it a lot.

00:54:29.055 --> 00:54:29.555
-OK.

00:54:29.555 --> 00:54:31.110
Awesome.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.810
-Anything else you want
to share with us or ideas?

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.735
-When can we get it?

00:54:34.735 --> 00:54:36.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.880
-Do you have any other
feedback for us about Sidekick?

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.080
-Oh, it was really great.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.650
RON SUSKIND: Yeah,
it's cool stuff.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:43.150
Yeah.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.560
So this is this brave new world.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.870
We're releasing it in
the next month or so.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:54.910
We have 100 folks who have
taken it home now in the pilot.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.850
And it's amazing.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:01.519
The heavyset kid whose dad died,
so he talks to the Sidekick.

00:55:01.519 --> 00:55:03.310
And what's interesting
is that some of them

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:05.240
know that the parent's
behind the curtain.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.630
They don't care.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.800
Actually, no one cares.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.360
Even neurotypicals don't care.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.310
It's symbolic speech.

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:12.559
It's shadows on the cave wall.

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.910
It's the way we communicate
through shared context

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.680
just like in the movie theater.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.829
And so he was talking
to the Sidekick.

00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:20.870
The mom's in the bedroom.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:22.190
He's in the den.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:26.480
And he says, do you
have a family, to Griff,

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.960
the Sidekick, the avatar.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.072
And the mom's like-- [GASPS].

00:55:30.072 --> 00:55:33.170
And she types no.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.560
And he's like, do
you have a father?

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.280
And she said no.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.330
He's like, I don't either.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.782
But I know how to be.

00:55:41.782 --> 00:55:43.270
And I'm going to be OK.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.160
And I can help you.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.980
And then the mom, of course,
is bawling her eyes out.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.350
And he runs up to the bedroom.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:53.420
And he says, my Sidekick
doesn't have a dad either.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.840
But I'm going to help him.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.030
That's like Mozart.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:00.760
That's an orchestra playing.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.500
And the thing that I love
about "Paul Blart, Mall Cop"--

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.760
which is, you know-- is that
that's actually something that

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.170
echoes with us a lot and I think
a lot of families is that when

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:14.690
I say the ASD folks are
just brilliant consumers

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.050
and appreciators
of film, of music.

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.570
I mean, they're all running
their own music and film

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:25.190
appreciation classes in a
way because they have to be.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.630
They've got to draw more
from it because they're not

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:31.160
drawing from this like we do.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:36.790
And so there's a scene
where the girl, Kaitlin, is

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.470
telling the mom, here's
what I need you to feed it.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:41.620
I know what I'm using.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.540
So there was a moment in the
book where that happened where

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.740
Jonathan Freeman,
the voice of Jafar,

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.750
came to our house to visit
because we became buddies.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.050
And he comes down for breakfast.

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:56.890
And Owen is playing
"A Whole New World."

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.350
And Jonathon's like, Owen,
are who playing that for me?

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.930
And Owen's like, no, I play
that every morning to get ready

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:08.030
for my day, which is
exactly what he does.

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:11.976
He's already got hundreds of
clips and passages of music

00:57:11.976 --> 00:57:14.350
that he's using just like
Temple Grandin uses her squeeze

00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:17.670
machine, to integrate,
to organize, to inspire,

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:22.320
to ground, for all the
things that we instinctively

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.530
do or maybe don't do.

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:29.030
And that's what's neat about it
is that it's very interactive.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:31.330
And more and more, the
kids take control of it.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.430
And because it's mobile
and it grows automation,

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:39.090
it's their support as
they go into the world.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.300
I mean, I'm a content guy.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.220
I've been doing
concert my whole life.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.940
It's so exciting to think
about content living

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.770
more fully and deeply
in people's lives

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:50.610
where they actually live.

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:54.140
I mean, that's the dream, for
all available knowledge that's

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.270
now sitting on a PDA.

00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.900
And these kids, I think, are
going to lead that charge.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.220
That's the most
exciting part about it.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:06.010
Look, we all talk about
big data and automation.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.880
You know, it's not there yet.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.630
Because the exchanges
are so rich and so

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:19.230
specific to the individual that
the data grows into automation

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:21.990
more forcefully-- look, we
can still plug in the API

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:25.651
as to whatever Cortana or Siri's
doing on movie times and pizza

00:58:25.651 --> 00:58:26.150
toppings.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:27.310
That's fine.

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:30.240
But in terms of something
that tailors itself

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.490
to who you actually
are, that's what

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:38.480
this does for this population
that really needs it.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.350
a that's where we're going
right at at-need populations,

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:47.377
a lot of them, autism
first, but ADHD, OCD, PTSD.

00:58:47.377 --> 00:58:49.210
I mean, someone from
the UN called and said,

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.140
how about refugee populations?

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.580
They've all got
Androids, all those kids.

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.750
So we're going to get a
gathering of specialists

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:57.840
in trauma and we're
going to build something

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:03.160
that sits on your platform that
they can talk to and grow with.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.697
That's the crazy thing that's
going on with Sidekicks.

00:59:06.697 --> 00:59:09.280
I've been yakking too much here
Can we get a couple questions?

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.564
s still have five
minutes at least.

00:59:11.564 --> 00:59:12.980
AUDIENCE: And
actually, a question

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.810
related to that
because both of you

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:16.601
may have interesting
perspectives to share,

00:59:16.601 --> 00:59:20.170
but I'm really
curious what companies

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:22.242
can do for employees
because I know

00:59:22.242 --> 00:59:24.200
this is specific to our
world, and I'm in POps.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.600
But I have the
experience that I have

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.460
a feeling there are
a lot of folks here

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.030
who would benefit from
an environment that's

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:34.339
more receptive to
their special talents.

00:59:34.339 --> 00:59:35.630
So what can we do as a company?

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.090
I'm really curious.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.720
RON SUSKIND: It's
a time of change.

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.630
People are seeing
that differently abled

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:43.810
is not just a PC term.

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:47.900
It's a term that's actually
more reflective of what is true.

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.400
So I think part of it is, again,
changing the wider populations,

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.990
whether in the workplace or
beyond it, to say, OK, well,

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:01.220
this is just a wide gap
of deficits and strengths.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.600
I'm 50-50.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.070
Owen's 30-70.

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:08.690
So it means that you've got to
place both the 30 and the 70

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:14.403
in your model, to say, yeah, I
know we support him on the 30.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:15.760
Oh, yeah, that's hard.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.180
He needs to take breaks.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.705
And he needs the
lighting changed.

01:00:18.705 --> 01:00:20.425
He's got to work at home some.

01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:22.050
But I think the key
to that and the way

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.405
human beings are and the way
enlightened self-interest

01:00:24.405 --> 01:00:26.530
works-- and that's the only
thing that really makes

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:29.550
the world turn, for
better or for worse--

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:33.820
is to prize the 70 as it is.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.560
A friend of mine at
Harvard-- I teach

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.744
a class called Public
Narrative and Justice

01:00:37.744 --> 01:00:38.660
at Harvard Law School.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.035
And I have a lot
of buddies there

01:00:40.035 --> 01:00:41.642
and this guy,
Howard Gardner, who

01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:44.100
is the multiple intelligences
guy, so I've known for years.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.164
He's an amazing guy.

01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:46.580
At one point, I'm
like, Howard, it

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.230
would've been great if
we'd built yardsticks

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.070
for the other seven, eight
kinds of intelligences

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.170
other than just analytical,
cognitive, which is the winning

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:56.366
yardstick for everything.

01:00:56.366 --> 01:00:58.320
He's like, yeah,
that would be great.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.050
It's hard to do first.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.460
But maybe now, we
can start doing

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.180
that because Owen does
certain things four

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.990
and five times better than me.

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.330
He should be measured on that.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.020
And me too.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.480
And I teach at
Harvard Law School.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.130
OK?

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.940
He should get credit for
being a four x of me.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.370
That's how we start to
see them as they all are,

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:24.240
prize them in the workplace,
support them as part

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.280
of a larger corporate purpose.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.910
I mean, just a
little funny story

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:30.210
that says it so powerfully.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:33.710
So I gave a speech at this
brain conference in Tel Aviv.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.382
And it was a great.

01:01:35.382 --> 01:01:36.340
Shimon Peres was there.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.650
It was really exciting.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.920
And so I talk about all this.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.202
And a guy walks up to me
from Israeli intelligence.

01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:45.050
Now, I wrote a book in 2006,
one of those big door stops

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.020
called "The One Percent
Doctrine" about the war

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.160
on terror.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.920
And say his name's Avi.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.620
OK.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.578
And I'm like Avi, how
are you? [ISRAELI ACCENT]

01:01:52.578 --> 01:01:54.200
Hey, Ron, it's nice to see you.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.940
I heard you were
coming to Tel Aviv.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:56.790
I said, yeah, yeah.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:57.855
We loved the last book.

01:01:57.855 --> 01:02:00.230
I said, you mean "The One
Percent Doctrine" on terrorism.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.190
No, no, the one about your son.

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:03.022
Really?

01:02:03.022 --> 01:02:08.180
Yeah, yeah, we have a division
at Israeli intelligence, 2,000

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.350
autistic spectrum young adults.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.470
They see patterns in
the data we cannot see.

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.140
They're our secret weapon.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.611
They keep Israel safe!

01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:19.260
I go, oh, my god!

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.290
And I'm like, so they
want to watch movies, let

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:22.630
them watch movies.

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.300
And I love that
story because it's

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.010
someone under
duress, the Israelis,

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:31.570
seeing things with clarity,
as the Israelis will.

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:35.330
And that feels like
the future to me.

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:36.980
Once you start
seeing it that way,

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.980
you say, I want 10 of them, 20.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.460
And what's the
special skill here?

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.876
Oh, this is-- can
we measure that?

01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:44.830
Oh, that's fabulous.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.440
The other part of
it though, it's

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.460
not even the big muscle in
terms of some of that heightened

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:52.700
ability.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.500
It's also the social supports.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.260
And I'll tell you--
and every parent-- I

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.230
know Eileen feels this way.

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:03.750
And certainly Paulette
knows this in her life--

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.790
is that when there's a person
who's different, whether it's

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.020
a spectrum person
or any person who's

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:13.250
neurodiverse among
neurotypicals,

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.830
they make us all better.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:19.900
They just do because they
call the same question

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.430
that Owen called in our family.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.750
I mean, I could go
survey 20 businesses.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.150
How's the workplace atmosphere?

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:29.880
How do they treat employees?

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.220
How do they treat customers?

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.390
And then I could plant
a spectrum person

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.550
in each business,
re-survey them.

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:38.376
Everything will improve.

01:03:38.376 --> 01:03:41.349
They'll treat each other
better in the workplace.

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:43.390
They'll treat customers
better when they come in.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:46.180
Customers will come
to see the person.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.910
It's their favorite employee.

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:53.740
That's complex, hard to
measure, but absolutely true.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.680
So the question is,
how do we get there?

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.047
And I think
everyone's getting it.

01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:00.880
And we're just a part
of it, all of us here.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.457
And if it's going to happen,
it's going to happen here.

01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:04.040
You know that.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.720
This is Google, for Christ sake.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.640
You guys are grasping
the reins of the future

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.850
in terms of especially data.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.310
I'm a journalist.

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.633
We had no data forever.

01:04:18.633 --> 01:04:20.730
I never even knew
who read the stories

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:22.560
I wrote in the "Journal."

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.750
You've got data which reveals
us as to who we really are.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:31.100
It's going to happen at a place
like this, here or Facebook

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.850
or Microsoft or one
of the big shops

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:36.540
because people say OK,
we have the horsepower

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.250
and by virtue of the fact
that we are embracing

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.530
neurodiverse people
who are stars

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:47.560
and are valued members of
our teams, we're changing.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.140
And we're seeing it.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.390
And now we know what to do.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.490
SPEAKER: So on that
powerful note, Ron,

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.910
thank you for the
storytelling, the inspiration,

01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:00.010
for the book and the movie.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.760
[APPLAUSE]
