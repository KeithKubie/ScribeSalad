00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
In this lesson, we will talk
about system virtualization.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.360
It's another important component of the
system software stack that's involved

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.000
in the management of
the physical resources.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.220
We will explain what is virtualization
and why it is important.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.270
And we will discuss what are some of the
key technical approaches that are part

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.880
of popular virtualization solutions,
such Xen and KVM and VMware CSX.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.530
In addition,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.370
at the end of the lesson we will discuss
what are some of the hardware advances

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.020
that have occurred over the last decade
in response to virtualization trends.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.702
Specifically in the context
of the x86 architecture.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:41.310
A lot of the content in this lecture is
also summarized in a paper by Rosenblum

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.610
and Garfunkel.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.240
Virtual Machine Monitors,
Current Technologies and Future Trends.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.550
Note that this is a paper from 2005,
so much more has happened in

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.020
the virtualization space than what
this paper what this paper describes.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.780
But it gives,
does serve as a useful reference.
