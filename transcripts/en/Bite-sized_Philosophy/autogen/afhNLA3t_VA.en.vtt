I mean there's a lot of debate in the
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.980
I mean there's a lot of debate in the
scientific literature about the meaning

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990
scientific literature about the meaning
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.829
scientific literature about the meaning
of dreams and perhaps there's even

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
of dreams and perhaps there's even
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.720
of dreams and perhaps there's even
debate about whether it's possible for

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
debate about whether it's possible for
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.320
debate about whether it's possible for
dreams to have meaning I think partly

to understand what what dreams mean and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
to understand what what dreams mean and

know what it is that scientists have
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939
know what it is that scientists have
discovered about dreams so for example

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
discovered about dreams so for example
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.969

you wake up when someone's dreaming

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
you wake up when someone's dreaming
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230
you wake up when someone's dreaming
their brain is about as active as it is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
their brain is about as active as it is
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880
their brain is about as active as it is
when they're awake so there's a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
when they're awake so there's a
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.679
when they're awake so there's a
tremendous amount of journal processing

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
tremendous amount of journal processing
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.350
tremendous amount of journal processing
going on in the dream state if you wake

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
going on in the dream state if you wake
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300
going on in the dream state if you wake
someone up when they're dreaming there's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
someone up when they're dreaming there's
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910
someone up when they're dreaming there's
about an 80% chance that they'll report

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
about an 80% chance that they'll report
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.960
about an 80% chance that they'll report
the emotion of anxiety dreams tend to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
the emotion of anxiety dreams tend to
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240
the emotion of anxiety dreams tend to
focus on threat

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
focus on threat
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.680
focus on threat
now a threat is anything that might hurt

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
now a threat is anything that might hurt
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320
now a threat is anything that might hurt
you but it's more than that - a threat

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330
you but it's more than that - a threat
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.940
you but it's more than that - a threat
is anything that doesn't fit into your

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
is anything that doesn't fit into your
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.610
is anything that doesn't fit into your
current conceptual scheme you imagine

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
current conceptual scheme you imagine
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.170
current conceptual scheme you imagine
that you have a theory about the way the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
that you have a theory about the way the
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.320
that you have a theory about the way the
world is and then you act on that theory

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
world is and then you act on that theory
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420
world is and then you act on that theory
and sometimes things work out the way

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
and sometimes things work out the way
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.610
and sometimes things work out the way
you'd like them to work out but often

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
you'd like them to work out but often
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.130
you'd like them to work out but often
they don't and every time things work

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
they don't and every time things work
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.740
they don't and every time things work
out in a way that isn't how you would

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
out in a way that isn't how you would
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.440
out in a way that isn't how you would
like or how you predicted that indicates

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
like or how you predicted that indicates
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900
like or how you predicted that indicates
that there's some more about the world

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
that there's some more about the world
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.900
that there's some more about the world
that you have to learn about and that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
that you have to learn about and that
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.729
that you have to learn about and that
fact first manifests itself in anxiety

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
fact first manifests itself in anxiety
 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.830
fact first manifests itself in anxiety
now the dream focuses on anxiety and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
now the dream focuses on anxiety and
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.789
now the dream focuses on anxiety and
then it loosens up it's the normal

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799
then it loosens up it's the normal
 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.070
then it loosens up it's the normal
conceptual constraints that characterize

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
conceptual constraints that characterize
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.809
conceptual constraints that characterize
waking thinking and it starts to play in

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819
waking thinking and it starts to play in
 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.530
waking thinking and it starts to play in
a sense or hypothesize about how your

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
a sense or hypothesize about how your
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.360
a sense or hypothesize about how your
current categorical structure could be

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
current categorical structure could be
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.059
current categorical structure could be
shifted around so that that threat could

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
shifted around so that that threat could
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.370
shifted around so that that threat could
be accounted for

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380
be accounted for
 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.770
be accounted for
okay now that means the dream is dealing

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
okay now that means the dream is dealing
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840
okay now that means the dream is dealing
with things that you need to understand

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
with things that you need to understand
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.440
with things that you need to understand
but you don't yet understand so when you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
but you don't yet understand so when you
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.390
but you don't yet understand so when you
wake up and you remember the dream the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
wake up and you remember the dream the
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.069
wake up and you remember the dream the
dream doesn't really make sense because

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079
dream doesn't really make sense because
 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.240
dream doesn't really make sense because
it's about something you don't

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
it's about something you don't
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.110
it's about something you don't
understand

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
understand
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.789
understand
now it's your brains best guess at

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799
now it's your brains best guess at
 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.809
now it's your brains best guess at
configuring or understanding the

thing or the threat is just too great to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850
thing or the threat is just too great to
 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.610
thing or the threat is just too great to
really come to any terms with it

really come to any terms with it
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.069
really come to any terms with it
whatsoever okay now I imagine that

whatsoever okay now I imagine that
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.410
whatsoever okay now I imagine that
you're dreaming about something and it

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420
you're dreaming about something and it
 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.990
you're dreaming about something and it
produces enough emotion what the threat

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
produces enough emotion what the threat
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.699
produces enough emotion what the threat
produces enough emotion not only to

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
produces enough emotion not only to
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.860
produces enough emotion not only to
produce a very vivid dream but to wake

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870
produce a very vivid dream but to wake
 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.229
produce a very vivid dream but to wake
you up when you wake up you remember the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239
you up when you wake up you remember the
 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.449
you up when you wake up you remember the
dream and then you will tell someone

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459
dream and then you will tell someone
 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.210
dream and then you will tell someone
about it well the dream is about

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
about it well the dream is about
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.099
about it well the dream is about
something you don't yet understand that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109
something you don't yet understand that
 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.650
something you don't yet understand that
that's upsetting and if you tell a bunch

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
that's upsetting and if you tell a bunch
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.969
that's upsetting and if you tell a bunch
of people about it they're going to give

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979
of people about it they're going to give
 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.649
of people about it they're going to give
you all sorts of opinions on the dream

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659
you all sorts of opinions on the dream
 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.659
you all sorts of opinions on the dream
and that's a way that you can gather

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669
and that's a way that you can gather
 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.969
and that's a way that you can gather
more information about the threat are we

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979
more information about the threat are we
 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.909
more information about the threat are we
talking

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919
talking
 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.279
talking
about an extreme case which is known as

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289
about an extreme case which is known as
 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:29.969
about an extreme case which is known as
a nightmare

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979
a nightmare
 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.749
a nightmare
or perhaps simply a dream which is

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759
or perhaps simply a dream which is
 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.760
or perhaps simply a dream which is
faintly troubling all puzzling because

the case of nightmares and often too
 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.399
the case of nightmares and often too
because nightmares tend to have

because nightmares tend to have
 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.309
because nightmares tend to have
archetypal themes you know people for

archetypal themes you know people for
 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.379

it's made out of reptilian parts and it
 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.420
it's made out of reptilian parts and it
also includes the idea of fire and

that tends to use archetypal imagery to
 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.050
that tends to use archetypal imagery to
conceptualize a fairly powerful threat

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:12.869
they can tell that the interpretation
has put some missing pieces of the

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879
has put some missing pieces of the
 

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.600
has put some missing pieces of the
puzzle into place and I think it's

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:15.610
puzzle into place and I think it's
 

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.309
puzzle into place and I think it's
important to rely on that as an

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319
important to rely on that as an
 

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:19.439
important to rely on that as an
indicator of whether the interpretation

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:19.449
indicator of whether the interpretation
 

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:22.559
indicator of whether the interpretation
is actually derived from the dream or

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:22.569
is actually derived from the dream or
 

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:25.619
is actually derived from the dream or
sort of just a theoretical imposition on

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:25.629
sort of just a theoretical imposition on
 

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.929
sort of just a theoretical imposition on
its structure now we can go underneath

00:08:27.929 --> 00:08:27.939
its structure now we can go underneath
 

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:30.119
its structure now we can go underneath
that too and I mentioned already that

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:30.129
that too and I mentioned already that
 

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.189
that too and I mentioned already that
basic categories are more

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:32.199
basic categories are more
 

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.399
basic categories are more
action-oriented than object-oriented so

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:35.409
action-oriented than object-oriented so
 

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.829
action-oriented than object-oriented so
basic categories the basic categories of

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839
basic categories the basic categories of
 

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:40.379
basic categories the basic categories of
the human mind are categories to do

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:40.389
the human mind are categories to do
 

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:43.679
the human mind are categories to do
things with well by the same token there

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:43.689
things with well by the same token there
 

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.470
things with well by the same token there
are also motivational and emotional

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480
are also motivational and emotional
 

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.929
are also motivational and emotional
categories so the primordial mind like

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:48.939
categories so the primordial mind like
 

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:51.720
categories so the primordial mind like
the animal mind thinks sort of

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:51.730
the animal mind thinks sort of
 

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.860
the animal mind thinks sort of
axiomatically

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:52.870
axiomatically
 

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.510
axiomatically
that all things that produce

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:54.520
that all things that produce
 

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.510
that all things that produce
the same emotion are the same thing so

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:57.520
the same emotion are the same thing so
 

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.250
the same emotion are the same thing so
there's things that make you happy or

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.260
there's things that make you happy or
 

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.840
there's things that make you happy or
there's things that make you sad or

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:00.850
there's things that make you sad or
 

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.880
there's things that make you sad or
there's things that make you anxious and

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:02.890
there's things that make you anxious and
 

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.550
there's things that make you anxious and
the fact that all those things share the

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560
the fact that all those things share the
 

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.389
the fact that all those things share the
capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399
capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of
 

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.850
capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of
some ESET essential identity between

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:11.860
some ESET essential identity between
 

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.699
some ESET essential identity between
them now the identity is in relationship

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:14.709
them now the identity is in relationship
 

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:17.910
them now the identity is in relationship
to the experiencer and not necessarily

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920
to the experiencer and not necessarily
 

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.250
to the experiencer and not necessarily
with regards to similarity between the

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.260
with regards to similarity between the
 

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.070
with regards to similarity between the
objects but it's still how we naturally

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.080
objects but it's still how we naturally
 

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.550
objects but it's still how we naturally
think and it's certainly how mythology

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560
think and it's certainly how mythology
 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.920
think and it's certainly how mythology
thinks and it's how drama thinks and how

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:28.930
thinks and it's how drama thinks and how
 

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.500
thinks and it's how drama thinks and how
religion thinks and we've lost sight of

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:31.510
religion thinks and we've lost sight of
 

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.850
religion thinks and we've lost sight of
that in part because we've become

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:32.860
that in part because we've become
 

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.920
that in part because we've become
scientifically trained to some degree

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.930
scientifically trained to some degree
 

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.690
scientifically trained to some degree
and we tend to believe that the real

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:36.700
and we tend to believe that the real
 

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.790
and we tend to believe that the real
categories of the world are objective

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800
categories of the world are objective
 

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.389
categories of the world are objective
and all right that that just strikes me

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399
and all right that that just strikes me
 

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.910
and all right that that just strikes me
as it's wrong there's something about it

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920
as it's wrong there's something about it
 

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.250
as it's wrong there's something about it
that's wrong and it's wrong because we

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.260
that's wrong and it's wrong because we
 

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.800
that's wrong and it's wrong because we
have to act
