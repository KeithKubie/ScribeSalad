And now zooming
to the meat of the program,

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.570
let's play tonight's
#HashtagWars.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:06.539
(cheering)

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.244
Tonight it's very cool
to have Jeff here.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.645
Wilco's a fantastic band.

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.981
You should see them live
if you get the chance.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.050
So, comedians,
not every song can be a hit,

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.952
which is why tonight's hashtag
is #OneWordOffSongs.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.890
Examples might be:
♪ Get out of my car ♪

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.992
♪ Get into my car. ♪

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.796
Uh, I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock, and begin.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.064
Jen Kirkman.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.733
Um, "I Am Trying
to Break Your Fart." Come on.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.701
Hey! Perfect!

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:36.736

-Yeah, just changing the tense
really does... -Yeah.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.797
-Yeah, Jen.
-"Nothing Compares 2 Jews."

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.966

-(laughter)

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.134
Dave Koechner.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.536

One More Time."

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.106

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.987
(laughter, shouts, cheering)

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.422
Thank you.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.891
