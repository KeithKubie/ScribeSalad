all right so let's do Russian hacking

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100
all right so let's do Russian hacking
 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900
all right so let's do Russian hacking
and what I want to do is I want to put

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
and what I want to do is I want to put
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820
and what I want to do is I want to put
quotes around Russian hacking because

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
quotes around Russian hacking because
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.280
quotes around Russian hacking because
we're actually talking about a question

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
we're actually talking about a question
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.259
we're actually talking about a question
of how we go about making sense of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
of how we go about making sense of
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450
of how we go about making sense of
everything altogether so Russian hacking

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
everything altogether so Russian hacking
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.910
everything altogether so Russian hacking
is not a an event as much as it is a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
is not a an event as much as it is a
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250
is not a an event as much as it is a
phenomenon that describes a very large

phenomenon that describes a very large
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070

location in the social field interpret
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.179
location in the social field interpret
differently so yes I think this is an

differently so yes I think this is an
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.990

excellent example of this new emergent

excellent example of this new emergent

you're looking at Russian hacking in

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.049
you're looking at Russian hacking in

you're looking at Russian hacking in

quotes from the blue church perspective
you're actually thinking about something

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159
you're actually thinking about something
 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.310
you're actually thinking about something
that isn't actually how it's working and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
that isn't actually how it's working and
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.539
that isn't actually how it's working and
you're going to be making particular

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549
you're going to be making particular
 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.689
you're going to be making particular
mistakes so you will think I think I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
mistakes so you will think I think I
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.280
mistakes so you will think I think I
mean certainly I'm defining a blue

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290
mean certainly I'm defining a blue
 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.660
mean certainly I'm defining a blue
church so certainly if you are in the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
church so certainly if you are in the
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.160

blue church my top modality you will

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
blue church my top modality you will
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979
blue church my top modality you will
think that there is some kind of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
think that there is some kind of
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990
think that there is some kind of

hierarchical control structure with this
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149
hierarchical control structure with this
says small number of decision-makers we

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
says small number of decision-makers we
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.539
says small number of decision-makers we
will call them the Russians who are

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549
will call them the Russians who are
 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.539
will call them the Russians who are
principally responsible for the behavior

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
principally responsible for the behavior
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.539
principally responsible for the behavior
of the system under investigation so you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
of the system under investigation so you
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.300
of the system under investigation so you
were looking for an expertise hierarchy

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
were looking for an expertise hierarchy
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950
were looking for an expertise hierarchy
you know somebody who's in charge and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
you know somebody who's in charge and
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719
you know somebody who's in charge and
how their expertise hierarchy is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
how their expertise hierarchy is
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550
how their expertise hierarchy is

causation fashion to generate the
results of what you're seeing and that's

results of what you're seeing and that's
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080
results of what you're seeing and that's
actually not an appropriate evaluation

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
actually not an appropriate evaluation
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.010
actually not an appropriate evaluation

Russian hacking and the degree to which

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249
Russian hacking and the degree to which
 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.849
Russian hacking and the degree to which
there is a specific understanding on the

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859
there is a specific understanding on the
 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:38.989
there is a specific understanding on the
part of the Russians which there

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999
part of the Russians which there
 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.539
part of the Russians which there
certainly is there clearly was the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
certainly is there clearly was the
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700
certainly is there clearly was the
phrase somebody used punching up and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
phrase somebody used punching up and
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069
phrase somebody used punching up and
they're clearly a dramatically more

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
they're clearly a dramatically more

they're clearly a dramatically more

capacity and power in the world because
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.959
capacity and power in the world because
of a higher quality strategy in this new

of a higher quality strategy in this new
 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.719
of a higher quality strategy in this new
decentralized environment is I think

it's more of a potentiation strategy and

it's more of a potentiation strategy and

it's more of a potentiation strategy and
much less of a control strategy and then

much less of a control strategy and then
