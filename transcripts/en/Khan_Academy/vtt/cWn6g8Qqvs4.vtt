00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.520
We're asked to multiply the
complex number 1 minus 3i times

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.250
the complex number 2 plus 5i.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.170
And the general idea
here is you can multiply

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.230
these complex numbers like
you would have multiplied

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.802
any traditional binomial.

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.010
You just have to remember
that this isn't a variable.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.880
This is the imaginary
unit i, or it's just i.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.569
But we could do
that in two ways.

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.610
We could just do the
distributive property twice,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.100
which I like a little bit more,
just because you're doing it

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.325
from a fundamental principle.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:31.340
It's nothing new.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.320
Or you could use
FOIL, which you also

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.970
used when you first
multiplied binomials.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.570
And I'll do it both ways.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.310
So this is just a
number, 1 minus 3i.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.380
And so we can distribute
it over the two numbers

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.534
inside of this expression.

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:48.950
So when we're multiplying it
times this entire expression,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.850
we can multiply 1 minus 3i
times 2 and 1 minus 3i times 5i.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.890
So let's do that.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.200
So this can be rewritten
as 1 minus 3i times

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.860
2-- I'll write the 2 out front--
plus 1 minus 3i times 5i.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.070
All I did is the
distributive property here.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.430
All I said is, look, if
I have a times b plus c,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.650
this is the same
thing as ab plus ac.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.970
I just distributed the
a on the b or the c.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.716
I distributed the 1 minus
3i on the 2 and the 5i.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:30.840
And then I can do it again.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.290
I have a 2 now times 1 minus 3i.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.170
I can distribute it.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.660
2 times 1 is 2.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.607
2 times negative
3i is negative 6i.

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:42.940
And over here, I'll do it again.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.580
5i times 1-- so it's plus.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.130
5i times 1 is 5i.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.610
And then 5i times
negative 3i-- so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.490
let's be careful here-- 5 times
negative 3 is negative 15.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.329
And then I have an i times an i.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.370
Let me do this over here.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.010
5i times negative 3i--
this is the same thing

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.710
as 5 times negative
3 times i times i.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.450
So the 5 times negative
3 is negative 15.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.830
And then we have i times
i, which is i squared.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.300
Now, we know what i squared is.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.030
By definition, i
squared is negative 1.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.990
i squared, by definition,
is negative 1.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.780
So you have negative
15 times negative 1.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
Well that's the same
thing as positive 15.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.440
So this can be rewritten
as 2 minus 6i plus 5i.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.280
Negative 15 times
negative 1 is positive 15.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.700
Now we can add the real parts.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.530
We have a 2, and we
have a positive 15.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.170
So 2 plus 15.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.110
And we can add the
imaginary parts.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.950
We have a negative 6.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.460
So we have a negative 6, or
a negative 6i, I should say.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.780
And then we have plus 5i.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.970
And 2 plus 15 is 17.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.830
And if I have negative
six of something

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.664
plus five of that
something, what do I have?

00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:14.121
Or if I have five
of that something

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:15.900
and I take six of
that something away,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.520
then I have negative
one of that something.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.700
Negative 6i plus
5i is negative 1i,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.470
or I could just say minus i.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.020
So in this way,
I just multiplied

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.130
these two expressions or these
two complex numbers, really.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.300
I multiplied them just using
the distributive property twice.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.450
You could also do it using FOIL.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.730
And I'll do that
right now really fast.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.600
It is a little bit faster.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.340
But it's a little
bit mechanical.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.669
So you might forget why you're
doing it in the first place.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.210
But at the end of the day, you
are doing the same thing here.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.200
You're essentially multiplying
every term of this first number

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.670
or every part of
this first number

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.560
times every part of
the second number.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.730
And FOIL just makes sure
that we're doing it.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.710
And let me just
write FOIL out here,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.960
which I'm not a huge fan
of, but I'll do it just

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.710
in case that's the way
you're learning it.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.470
So FOIL says, let's
multiply the first numbers.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.520
So that's going to
be the 1 times the 2.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.940
That is the F in FOIL.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.180
Then it says, let's multiply the
outer numbers times each other.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.640
So that's 1 times 5i,
so plus 1 times 5i.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.070
This is the O in FOIL,
the outer numbers.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.440
Then we do the inner
numbers, negative 3i times 2.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.710
So this is negative 3i times 2.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.430
Those are the inner numbers.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.660
And then we do the last
numbers, negative 3i times 5i.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.280
These are the last numbers.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.986
So that's all that
FOIL is telling us.

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:44.610
It's just making sure
we're multiplying

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.280
every part of this number times
every part of that number.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.160
And then when we simplify
it, 1 times 2 is 2.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.240
1 times 5i is 5i.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.420
Negative 3i times
2 is negative 6i.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.540
And negative 3i times
5i-- well, we already

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.850
figured out what that was.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.110
Negative 3i times 5i
turns out to be 15.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.450
Negative 3 times
5 is negative 15.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.692
But i times i is negative 1.

00:05:11.692 --> 00:05:16.320
Negative 15 times
negative 1 is positive 15.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
Add the real parts, 2 plus 15.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.430
You get 17.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.530
Add the imaginary parts.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.130
You have 5i minus 6i.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.840
You get negative i.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.500
And once again, you get
the exact same answer.
