00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.260
&gt;&gt; So part of the point of looking at these two different kinds of concepts is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.030
that depending on the different kinds of concepts we are dealing with right now,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.870
you may come up with a different knowledge representation and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.680
a different inference method. Let me explain.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.960
Supposing we're dealing with concepts like Foo or Holiday or Inspirational.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.370
Then the case-based reasoning method might be a very good method for

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.230
dealing with things of that kind. We may have experience with specific holidays,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.780
but we cannot abstract them out into a concept with prototypical conditions.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.880
On the other hand, if we were dealing with concepts like a right triangle or

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.930
a reptile, for which we can define necessary and sufficient conditions,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.540
in that case there are alternative methods available that might be more suitable

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.580
then case-based reasoning. So instead of thinking in terms of one method that is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.660
going to work for all conditions and all concepts, we might want to think in

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.580
terms of a array of methods, where each method is more or

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.710
less useful for different kind of conditions or different kind of concepts.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.640
David, I am sure you recall mentally who was a Russian chemist who came up with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.730
the basic notion of the chemical periodic table. I'm sure all the students in

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.100
the class know about the chemical periodic table, which organizes all

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.290
the elements according to certain properties like hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.330
so on. Now, Mendeleev came up with this notion of a chemical periodic table, and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.580
in some sense what we're trying to do in this course is to build a similar kind

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.300
of periodic table, except that this is a periodic table of the elements of mind.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.236
It's a periodic table of the basic fundamental elements that compose

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:56.340
intelligence. Instead of talking about elements and valances and atoms and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.710
so on, what we are going to be talking about are methods and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.530
representations. So it as if we are discovering the fundamental knowledge for

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.800
presentations and organizations and reasoning methods that go with it.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.860
Case based reasoning was one. Reasoning method that went with certain kinds of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.275
concepts that are hard to abstract and

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:18.770
into conditions, like typical conditions, are necessarily logical conditions.
