00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.300
Tiffany says, "Why do you like lap dances
so much?"

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.300
"Okay.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.039
In 2007, there was a movie called Grindhouse.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.900
And in the trailer quentin tarantino himself
promised us a lap dance.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.789
So I went to see that movie--all 10 hours
and 47 minutes of it--and there was no lap

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.289
dance anywhere.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.560
So, then flash forward, I get the DVD with
my buddy and we watch the 6 hour director's

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.630
cut and lo and behold, there's the lap dance
that we'd been promised in the original trailer.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.910
It made me wonder how many other movies that
that happened in, where they film a lap dance

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.050
and then they just cut it before it ends up,
you know, hitting the theaters.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.560
I've gotten really good at spotting those
moments where it's obvious they filmed one

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.380
and it just didn't make the final cut.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.570
"Why don't you stop doing the conversation
videos and other bullsh*t and just do more

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.110
sins videos?"

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.110
Alright.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.479
I'm gonna assume just by asking that you've
never made a sins video, but whatever.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.630
Let's forget for a second that most people
who watch the conversation videos actually

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.630
enjoy them.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.630
Um.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240
Let's throw that aside.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.600
What you're talking about is a time difference.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600
It takes way longer to make a sins video than
it does a conversation video.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840
It's like comparing the Grand Canyon to your
vagina.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.649
It's like saying "Should I cook myself some
dinner, or should I build a log cabin with

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.859
my bare hands from scratch?"

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.579
Doing a conversation video in no way keeps
us from doing a sins video.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.670
What keeps us from doing a second sins video
is that they take for f*cking ever.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.549
It's time we're happy to spend... weekly.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.959
But, you know, maybe just watch the sins videos
once a week and go about your life.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.539
There's this new tool YouTube just put out
actually, it's called Not Watching Videos

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.759
That You Don't Like.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.090
You should check it out.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.729
"How many people are there behind Cinema Sins?"

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.549
Okay, this one, I'm glad we can clear up.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.119
cinema Sins is two people.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.850
But not you and me.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.060
Right, not you and I.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.720
You and I should be considered, like, one
entity.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.150
Along with any other uses you see running
around here.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.150
Right.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.840
Like, the other guy has never been on camera,
but he's been part of the writing and shooting,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.240
and editing since the beginning of Cinema
Sins.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.400
He's like Teller.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.760
Well, Teller appears on camera.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.940
He's just silent.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.640
So it's not exactly the best analogy.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.920
It's a fine analogy, alright?

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.450
Everybody knew what I mean.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.110
There's another guy, and he's mysterious.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.890
How is he mysterious.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.100
In ways!

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.520
"Will you have sex with me?"

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.830
Well, I don't know you, but sure.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.520
Wait, is she hot?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.610
Well, I don't know, dude, she didn't send
a picture.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.610
It's just an email.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.340
I don't even know if it's a girl.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.340
Hmm.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.080
I'll have to take my chances.
