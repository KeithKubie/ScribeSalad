00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The best answer is to roll objects down inclined planes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The reason why this isn't a great answer is because attaching a parachute is essentially

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
doing the same thing as we do when we drop a feather.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're just making a big bag to catch that air

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and to slow the object down artificially. We're not observing its somehow natural motion.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Same thing when we drop an object through water or another liquid.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That water is basically doing the same thing as the air would be

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
doing when we drop a feather, but it's having an even greater effect.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we want to make air resistance negligible, the thing to do is to roll objects down inclined planes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Professor Settle, what do you have to say about this?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He eventually decides to try rolling balls down an inclined plane.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
His first experiment, so-called, on an inclined plane, he is still looking for a proposed uniform motion.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What he begins to find is that he is never getting uniform motion.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What he's getting always is acceleration.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So he's finding acceleration.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It seems that this experiment is actually making some progress in disproving Aristotle.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You may be saying--big deal, of course objects accelerate when they fall,

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but this was not common knowledge at the time.
