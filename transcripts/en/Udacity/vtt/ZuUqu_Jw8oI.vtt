00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.410
Here's the answer I came up with.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.770
The actor wants to maximize
the number of burned calories and

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.960
he burns 12 calories for

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.470
every minute of step-aerobics and
four for every minute of stretching.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.840
He can't spend more
than 40 minutes total.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.720
So I expressed that constraint by
saying that x + y is at most 40.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.037
And expressing that he has to
spend five minutes stretching,

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:29.790
is a little unintuitive because of
the way the inequality is directed here.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.820
But I can do it by saying that
-y is at most -5, like so.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.940
Using the graph and check method of your
high school teacher, gives the optimum

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.530
solution as 35 minutes of step
aerobics and 5 minutes of stretching.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.100
Now you probably didn't bother graphing
the polytope as I've done here.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.050
The answer was too obvious.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.940
But why was it so obvious?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.150
Maybe you realized that more exercise
was better, and started thinking about

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.030
constraints somewhere along here,
that used up all 40 minutes.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.770
Because step-aerobics
burn more calories,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.460
you realize that you would want to
do as many of them as possible,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.580
pulling you along this constraint,
downward towards this vertex.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.500
Or maybe you realized that just
five minutes of stretching, and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.280
zero minutes of step aerobics
would satisfy the constraints.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.430
And then you decided to
increase the number of minutes

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.940
spent on step aerobics,
until you ran into another constraint.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.890
Another case, your intuition led you
to think very much along the lines of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.290
the simplex method,
that we'll see in a little bit.
