00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.705
- [Narrator] "Alicia took a
random sample of mobile phones"

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:05.012
"and found a positive linear relationship"

00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:08.733
"between their processor
speeds and their prices."

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.359
"Here is computer output
from a least-squares"

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.309
"regression analysis on her sample."

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.344
So just to be clear what's going on,

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:18.722
she took a sample of phones,
they're not telling us

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:22.290
exactly how many, but she
took a number of phones

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.071
and she found a linear relationship

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:26.198
between processor speed and prices.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:30.463
So this is price right over
here, and this is processor

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.107
speed right over here.

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:36.021
And then she plotted her sample.

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:38.129
For every phone would be a data point,

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.676
and so you see that, and then
she put those data points

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:42.996
into her computer, and
it was able to come up

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:47.218
with a line, a regression
line, for her sample.

00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:49.373
And her regression line for her sample,

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:51.831
if we say that's going to be y is,

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:55.919
or y hat is going to be a plus bx,

00:00:55.919 --> 00:01:00.919
for her sample, a is going to be 127.092,

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:02.323
so that's that over there,

00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:05.401
and for her sample, the
slope of the regression line

00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:07.658
is going to be the coefficient on speed.

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:08.911
Another way to think about it,

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.556
this x variable right over here is speed,

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:13.552
so the coefficient on that is the slope.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.406
But we have to remind ourselves

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:17.453
that these are estimates of maybe

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:20.073
some true truth in the universe.

00:01:20.073 --> 00:01:22.226
If she were able to sample every phone

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.298
in the market, then she would get

00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:25.959
the true population parameters,

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.227
but since this is a sample,
it's just an estimate.

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:30.682
And she, just because she sees this

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:32.865
positive linear relationship in her sample

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:34.987
doesn't necessarily mean that this is

00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:37.395
the case for the entire population.

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:39.984
She might have just
happened to sample things

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:42.161
that had this positive
linear relationship.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.829
And so that's why she's
doing this hypothesis test.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.155
And in a hypothesis
test, you actually assume

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:49.490
that there isn't a relationship

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.674
between processor speed and price.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.103
So Beta right over here, this would be

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:56.253
the true population parameter for

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:58.177
regression on the population.

00:01:58.177 --> 00:02:00.705
So if this is the
population right over here,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.782
and if somehow, where it's
price on the vertical axis,

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:07.684
and processor speed on
the horizontal axis,

00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:11.159
and if you were able to look
at the entire population,

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.353
I don't know how many phones there are,

00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:13.809
but it might be billions of phone,

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.033
and then do a regression line,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.370
then our null hypothesis
is that the slope of

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.829
the regression line is going to be zero.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.149
So the regression line might
look something like that,

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.223
where the equation of the regression line

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:28.873
for the population, y hat would be

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:33.873
Alpha plus Beta times, times x.

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.546
And so our null hypothesis
is that Beta's equal to zero,

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:38.099
and the alternative hypothesis,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.896
which is her suspicion,
is that the true slope

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:45.164
of the regression line is
actually greater than zero.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:48.561
"Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met."

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:53.561
"At the Alpha equals 0.01
level of significance,"

00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:56.772
"is there sufficient evidence to conclude"

00:02:56.772 --> 00:03:01.145
"a positive linear relationship
between these variables"

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:02.620
"for all mobile phones?"

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.499
"Why?"

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.554
So pause this video and see
if you can have a go at it.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.556
Well, in order to do this hypothesis task,

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:12.325
we have to say, "Well,
assuming the null hypothesis"

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.890
"is true, assuming this is
the actual slope of the"

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.246
"population regression line,"
I guess you could think

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:21.781
about it, "what is the
probability of us getting"

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:23.751
"this result right over here?"

00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:26.949
And what we can do is use this information

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.268
and our estimate of the
sampling distribution

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:33.437
of the sample regression line slope,

00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:36.986
and we can come up with a T-statistic.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:39.956
And for this situation where
our alternative hypothesis

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:44.497
is that our true
population regression slope

00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:47.247
is greater than zero, our P-value

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:52.902
can be viewed as the probability
of getting a T-statistic

00:03:52.902 --> 00:03:54.654
greater than or equal to this.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:56.825
So getting a T-statistic greater than

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:00.612
or equal to 2.999.

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.515
Now, you could be tempted
to say, "Hey, look"

00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:05.115
"there's this column
that gives us a P-value,"

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:06.739
"maybe they just figured out for us"

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.074
"that this probability is 0.004."

00:04:10.074 --> 00:04:12.049
And we have to be very, very careful here,

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.902
because here, they're actually giving us,

00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:16.534
I guess you could call
it a two-sided P-value.

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.883
If you think of a T-distribution,

00:04:19.883 --> 00:04:23.231
and they would do it for the
appropriate degrees of freedom,

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.058
this is saying, "What's the probability"

00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:26.557
"of getting a result where the"

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:30.582
"absolute value is 2.999 or greater?"

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:34.061
So if this is T equals zero
right here in the middle,

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:39.061
and this is 2.999, we
care about this region.

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:41.235
We care about this right tail.

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.920
This P-value right over
here, this is giving us

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.019
not just the right tail,
but it's also saying,

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.636
"Well, what about getting
something less than"

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:52.040
"negative 2.999, or
including negative 2.99?"

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.500
So it's giving us both of these areas,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.686
so if you want the
P-value for this scenario,

00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.395
we would just look at this.

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:01.248
And as you can see,
because this distribution

00:05:01.248 --> 00:05:03.120
is symmetric, the
T-distribution is going to be

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.714
symmetric, you take half of this.

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:10.125
So this is going to be equal to 0.002.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.257
And what you'd do in any significance test

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:16.249
is then compare your P-value
to your level of significance.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.357
And so if you look at 0.002 and compare it

00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:25.274
to 0.01, which of these is greater?

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:27.756
Well, at first your eyes might say,

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:28.795
"Hey, two is greater than one,"

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:32.303
but this is two thousandths
versus one hundredth.

00:05:32.303 --> 00:05:35.263
This is 10 thousandths right over here.

00:05:35.263 --> 00:05:37.806
So in this situation, our P-value is less

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:41.463
than our level of significance,
and so we're saying,

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:44.893
"Hey, the probability of getting a result"

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:48.647
"this extreme or more extreme is so low,"

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:51.105
"if we assume our null hypothesis,"

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:54.127
"that in this situation we will reject."

00:05:54.127 --> 00:05:56.329
"We will decide to reject
our null hypothesis,"

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:58.486
"which would suggest the alternative."

00:05:58.486 --> 00:06:00.222
So, "Is there sufficient
evidence to conclude"

00:06:00.222 --> 00:06:01.731
"a positive linear relationship"

00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.011
"between these variables
for all mobile phones?"

00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.214
Yes.

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:06.312
"Why?"

00:06:06.312 --> 00:06:11.312
Because, because P-value

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.879
is less than our significance level,

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.962
and so we reject our null hypothesis,

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:23.629
which suggests, suggests
our alternative hypothesis.
