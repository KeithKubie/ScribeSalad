00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.100
The right answer is no, and since this might seem a bit counterintuitive

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.230
given this huge range of the hardware continuum, let's reason

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.190
it out. Basically, the hardware inside a computer

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.110
system consists of the processor, memory. And

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.550
implode the devices. And the organization of these hardware elements

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480
within the computer system, whether we are talking about

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.570
smart phone or cloud, is not going to change tremendously.
