One limitation of many measures of personality is that they rely on conscious

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:08.966
verbal assessments. However, some theorists such as Sigmund Freud, believe that

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:12.614
much of our personality is actually unconscious and therefore difficult to

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:17.444
verbalize. &gt; That's right. And Sigmund Freud was a very famous psychologist who

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:21.573
developed the psychoanalytic theory. And he thought that at the core of a

00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:26.082
person's personality was the unconscious mind. Their thoughts, motives and

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.245
drives as opposed to the conscious mind.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.405
&gt;&gt; Followers of Freud actually developed indirect measures of our unconscious

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:37.170
needs and motives. They believed that dreams and fantasies actually revealed a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.825
lot about the unconscious mechanisms behind personality.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:45.401
&gt;&gt; Now, these techniques are known as projective tests. And that's because a

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.952
person's unconscious thoughts, motives, and drives, are projected onto their

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:50.190
answers.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.600
&gt;&gt; The key with projective test is, you have to give a person a stimulus that's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.620
really ambiguous. That way, it can be interpreted in many different ways.
