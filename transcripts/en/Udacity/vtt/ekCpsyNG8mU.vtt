00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.760
So before we go on to the next example, Michael, I wanted to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.480
do a quick quiz, just to make certain you really get what's going

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.650
on here. The, the sort of power of looking, using Bayesian learning. The,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.400
the main insight, I think, I, I want to drive home here, is something

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.610
you said. Which is that, when we were doing regression before, when we

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.750
were talking about the perceptrons, we actually had in our head a particular

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.220
kind of function, a particular hypothesis class. In here with what been talking

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.893
about with Bayesian learning, the answer tto

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:25.780
finding to sum of squared errors was

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.360
independent of the hypothesis class and only dependent upon the

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.880
key assumptions that we were making, mainly that we had

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180
labeled the data with certain form, and that that data

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.720
was generated by a process that took deterministic function and

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.500
added some Gaussian noise to it. So, here's the quiz.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.340
Here's your training data. You've got a bunch of Xs

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.005
and a bunch of Ds. These are the values that

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.052
you have to learn. And I want you to tell

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:54.852
me, which of these three functions over here, these three

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:59.300
hypotheses is the best one under this assumption. Got it?

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.020
&gt;&gt; mod? Are we allowed to do that?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.569
&gt;&gt; We are allowed to do that because

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.570
&gt;&gt; It's just a function.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.640
&gt;&gt; It's just a function, man.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.530
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.360
&gt;&gt; It's just a function.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.160
&gt;&gt; So we've got a linea-, a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.510
constant function, a linear function, and we've talked

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.720
about those, but we've also got a mod

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.420
function. alright, and we've got a uniform prior

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.100
over these threes hypotheses.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.330
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.530
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.700
&gt;&gt; Okay. Go.
