00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.150
PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Gilbert
Strang, and this is the very

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.870
first in a series of videos
about highlights of calculus.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm doing these just because
I hope they'll be helpful.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.790
It seems to me so easy to be
lost in the big calculus

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.300
textbooks and the many, many
problems and in the details.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.660
But do you see the
big picture?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.370
Well, I hope this will help.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.150
For me, calculus is about the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.110
relation between two functions.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.990
And one example for those two
functions, one good example,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.760
is function 1, the distance,
distance traveled, what you

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.890
see on a trip meter in a car.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.790
And function 2, the one that
goes with distance, is speed,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.720
how quickly you're going, how
fast you're traveling.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.330
So that's one pair
of functions.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.570
Let me give another pair.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.450
I could get more and more, but
I think if we get these two

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.190
pairs, we can move forward.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.610
So in this second pair,
height is function 1,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.860
how high you've climbed.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.540
If it's a graph, how far the
graph goes above the axis.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.060
Up, in other words.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.600
So that's height, and then
the other one tells you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.460
how fast you climb.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.730
The height tells how
far you climbed.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.070
It could be a mountain.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.300
And then the slope tells you how
quickly you're climbing at

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.050
each point.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.630
Are you going nearly
straight up?

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.620
Flat?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.790
Possibly down?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.400
So distance and speed, height
and slope will serve as good

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.660
examples to start with.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.480
And let me give you some
letters, some algebra letters

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.090
that you might use.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.490
Distance, maybe I would
call that f of t.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.480
So f for how far or for
function, and the idea is that

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.990
t is the input.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.970
It's the time when you're
asking for the distance.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.060
The output is the distance.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.580
Or in the case of height,
maybe y of x would

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.740
be the right one.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.270
x is how far you go across.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.870
That's the input.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.830
And at each x, you have an
output y how far up?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.860
So f is telling you how far.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.660
y is telling you the
height of a graph.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.340
That's function 1, two examples
of function 1.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.060
Now, what about slope?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.560
Well, luckily, speed and slope
start with the same letter, so

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.990
I'll often use s for the speed
or the slope for this second--

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.960
oh, it even stands for
a second function.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.590
But let me tell you
also the right--

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.620
the official--

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.670
letters that make the connection
between function 2

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.030
and function 1.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.240
If my function is a function of
time, the distance, how far

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.589
I go, then the speed is--

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:27.050
the right letters are df dt.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.840
Everybody uses those letters.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.830
So let me say again how
to pronounce: df dt.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.100
And Leibniz came up with
that notation, and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.850
he just got it right.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.920
And what would this one be?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:56.760
Well, corresponding to this, it
looks the same, or dy dx.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.060
Again, I'll just repeat how
to say that: dy dx.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.940
And that is the slope, and we
have to understand what those

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.820
symbols mean.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.730
Right now, I'm just writing
them down as symbols.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.740
May I begin with the most
important and the simplest

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.650
example of all?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.660
Let me take that case.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.590
OK, so the key example here,
the one to get completely

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.450
straight is the case
of constant

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.820
speed, constant slope.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.900
I'll just graph that.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.225
So here I'm go to graph.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.220
Shall I make it the speed?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.000
Yeah, let's say speed.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.600
So time is going
along that way.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.410
Speed is up this way.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.740
And I'm going to say in this
first example that the speed

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.690
is the same.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.250
We're traveling at the
constant speed

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.610
of let's say 40.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.920
So it stays at the
height of 40.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.040
Oh, properly, I should add units
like miles per hour or

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.520
kilometers per hour or meters
per second or whatever.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680
For now, I'll just write 40.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.330
OK, now if we're traveling at a
speed of 40 miles per hour,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.780
what's the distance?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:42.300
Well, let me start with the
trip meter at zero.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.790
so this is time again,
and now this is

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.040
going to be the distance.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.000
After one hour, my
distance is 40.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.990
So if I mark t equal to
1, I've reached 40.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.940
That's height of 40.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.175
At t equal to 2, I've
reached 80.

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:10.420
At t equal to 1/2, half an
hour, I've reached 20.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.830
Those points lie on a line.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.120
The graph of distance covered
when you're just traveling at

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.890
a steady rate, constant rate,
constant speed is just a

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.070
straight line.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.660
And now I can make
the connection.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.500
I've been speaking here about
distance and speed.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.170
But now let me think of
this as the height--

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.450
40 is that height.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.090
80 is that height--

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.740
and ask about slope.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.180
What is slope?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.810
So let's just remember what's
the connection here.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.720
What's the slope if that's the
distance if I look at my trip

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.970
meter and I know I'm traveling
along at that constant speed,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.700
how do I find that speed?

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:13.670
Well, slope, it's the distance
up, which would be 40 after

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.980
one hour, divided
by the distance

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:23.820
across, 40/1, or 80/2.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.760
Doesn't matter, because we're
traveling at constant speed,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:39.110
so the slope, which is up,
over, across is 40/1,

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:45.570
80/2, 20 over 1/2.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:51.360
I'll put 80/2 as one
example: 40.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.780
Oh, let me do it--

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.960
that's arithmetic.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.240
Let me do it with algebra.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.000
We don't need calculus
yet, by the way.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.060
Calculus is coming
pretty quickly.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.090
This is the step we can take.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:15.370
Because the speed is constant,
we can just divide the

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:22.760
distance by the time to find--

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.020
and this slope, let me
right speed also.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.620
Up, over, across, distance
over time, f/t,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.280
that gives us s.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.530
This is s.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.590
OK, what about--

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.400
calculus goes both ways.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.210
We can go both ways here.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.500
We already have practically.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:56.140
Here I went in the direction
from 1 to 2.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.090
Now, I want to go in
the direction--

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.090
suppose I know the speed.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.490
How do I recover the distance?

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.560
If I know my speed is 40 and I
know I started at zero, what's

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.810
my distance?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.740
Distance or height,
either one.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.830
So these are like both.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.280
Now, I'm just going
the other way.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.670
Well, you see how.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.060
How do I find f?

00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:36.630
It's s times t, right?

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.560
Your algebra automatically says
if you see a t there, you

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.490
can put it there.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.250
So it's s times t.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.640
It's a straight line.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.150
s times t, s times
x, y equal sx.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.400
Let me put another--

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.310
the same idea with
my y, x letters.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.610
It's that line.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.030
In other words, if that one
is constant, this one is a

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.280
straight line.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.400
OK, straightforward, but
very, very fundamental.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.290
In fact, can I call your
attention to something a

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.780
little more?

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:27.280
Suppose I measured between
time 2 and time 1.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.330
So I'm looking between time 2
and time 1, and I look how far

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.860
I went in that time.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.150
But what I'm trying is--

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.710
I'm going to put in another
little symbol because it's

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.720
going to be really
worth knowing.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.430
It's really the change in f
divided by the change in t.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:58.210
I use that letter delta
to indicate

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.800
a difference between--

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.110
the difference between time 2
and time 1 was 1, and the

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:11.130
difference between height
2 and height 1 was 40.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.390
You see, I'm looking at
this little piece.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.710
And, of course, the
slope is still 40.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.350
It's still the slope
of that line.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:26.800
Yeah, so that really what I'm
measuring in speed there, I

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.670
don't always have to be starting
at t equals 0, and I

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.390
don't always have to be starting
at f equals 0.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.880
Oh, let me draw that.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.100
Suppose I started
at f equals 40.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.720
My trip meter happened
to start at 40.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.300
After an hour, I'd
be up to 80.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.270
After another hour,
I'd be up to 120.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.430
Do you see that this starting
the trip meter, who cares

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.160
where the trip meter started?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.450
It's the change in the trip
meter that tells how

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.520
long the trip was.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.560
Clear.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.383
OK, so that's that example.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:14.020
We come back to it because it's
the basic one where the

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.950
speed is constant.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.170
And even if now I have to move
to a changing speed, you have

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.210
to let me bring calculus
into these lectures.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.290
OK, I'm going to draw another
picture, and you

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.692
tell me about the--

00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:38.310
yeah, let me draw function 1,
another example of function 1.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.600
So again I have time.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.280
I have distance.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.280
I'm going to start at zero, but
I'm not going to keep the

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.610
speed constant.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.520
I'm going to start out at
a good speed, but I'm

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.805
going to slow down.

00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:59.590
Do you see me slowing
down there?

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.340
I don't mean slowing down
with the chalk.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.650
I mean slowing down
with slope.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.690
The slope started out steep.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.800
By here, by that point,
the slope was zero.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.050
What was the car doing here?

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:21.860
The car is certainly moving
forward because the distance

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.970
is increasing.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.770
Here it's increasing faster.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.480
Here it's increasing barely.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.810
In other words, we're putting
on the brakes.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.130
The car is slowing down.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.540
We're coming to a red light.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.860
In fact, there is the red light
right at that time.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:48.030
Now, just stay with it to think
what would the speed

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.840
look like for this problem?

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.850
If that's a picture of
the function, just

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.410
let's get some idea.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:03.210
I'm not going to have
a formula yet.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.170
I'm not putting in
all the details.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:11.230
Well, actually, I don't plan to
put in all the details of

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:18.070
calculus of every possible
step we might take.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.070
It's the important ones I'm
hoping to show you and I'm

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.890
hoping for you to see that
they are important.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.430
OK, what is important?

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.820
Roughly, what does the
graph looks like?

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.060
Well, the speed--

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.100
the slope--

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.800
started out somewhere
up there.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:45.040
Yeah, it started out at a good
speed and slowed down.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.030
And by this point, ha!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.040
Let's mark that time
here on that graph.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.930
Do you see what is the
speed at that moment?

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.770
The speed at that
moment is zero.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.420
The car has stopped.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.500
The speed is decreasing.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.280
Let me make it decrease,
decrease, decrease, decrease,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.860
and at that moment, the speed
is zero right there.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.680
That's that point.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.400
See, two different pictures,
two different functions.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.730
but same information.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:31.190
So calculus has the job of given
one of those functions,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.300
find the other one.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.690
Given this function,
find that one.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.380
This way is called--

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.040
from function one to function
two, that's called

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.690
differential calculus.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.230
Big, impressive word anyway.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:51.800
That's function one to two,
finding the speed.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.860
Going the other direction is
called integral calculus.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:03.500
The step is called integration
when you take the speed over

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.510
that period of time, and you
recover the distance.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.569
So it's differential calculus
in one direction, integral

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:13.930
calculus in the other.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.880
Now, here's a question.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.230
Let me continue that curve
a little longer.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.609
I got it to the red light.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:32.040
Now imagine that the distance
starts going

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.160
down from that point.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.080
What's happening?

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.690
The distance is decreasing.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.360
The car is going backwards.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.020
It's going in reverse.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.700
The speed, what's the speed?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.860
Negative.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:18:01.430
The speed, because distance is
going from higher to lower,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.320
that counts for negative
speed.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.245
The speed curve would
be going down here.

00:18:08.245 --> 00:18:13.730
Do you see that that's a not
brilliantly drawn picture, but

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.230
you're seeing the--

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.240
that's the farthest it went.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.660
Then the car started backwards,
and the speed curve

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.820
reflected that by going
below zero.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.990
You see, two different curves,
but same information.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.290
I'm remembering an old movie.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.250
I don't know if you saw an
old B movie called Ferris

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.920
Bueller's Day Off.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.440
Did you see that?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.080
So the kid had borrowed
his father's--

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:55.570
not borrowed, but lifted his
father's good car and drove it

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:00.740
a lot like so and put
on a lot of mileage.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.260
The trip meter was way up, and
he knew his father was going

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.390
to notice this.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:12.620
So he had the idea to put the
car up on a lift, put it in

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.820
reverse, and go for a
while, and the trip

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.160
meter would go backwards.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.755
I don't know if trip meters
do go backwards.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:36.000
It's kind of tough to watch them
while going in reverse.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.780
But if whoever made the car
understood calculus, as you

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.520
do, the speedometer--

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.680
now that I think of it,
speedometers don't have a

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.450
below zero.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.540
They should have. And trip
meters should go backwards.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.690
I mean, that movie was just made
for a calculus person.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.950
Maybe I'm remembering more.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.330
I think it didn't work
or something.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.030
And the kid got mad and kicked
the car, and it fell off the

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:20.190
lift, went through
the glass window.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.370
Anyway, calculus would
have saved him if

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.480
only the car had been--

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.500
or the meters in the car had
been made correctly.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.320
All right, that's one pair.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.650
That's our first real pair in
which the speed changes.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.580
OK.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:54.460
I thought in this first video,
later, even today, I'll get to

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.340
a case where we have formulas.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.200
That's what calculus
moves into.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.420
When f of t is given by some
formula, well, here it's given

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.210
by a formula: s times t.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.020
A simple formula.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:20.350
And then, knowing that, we
know that the speed is s.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.340
Later, we got more functions.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:29.030
But let me take an example, just
because these pairs of

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.030
functions are everywhere.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.970
What could I take?

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:38.920
Maybe height of a person.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.060
Height of a person.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:47.430
OK, so this is now another
example, just to get practice

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.940
in the relation between the
height of a person and the

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.470
rate of change of the height.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.120
So this is the height.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.990
Maybe I'll call it y.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:04.040
Let me write height
of a person.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.840
And what is this going to be?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.950
What is function two?

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.510
Well, slope doesn't
seem quite right.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:18.120
The point about function two is
it tells how fast function

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.000
one changes.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.720
It's the rate of change
of the height.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.610
It's the rate of change.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:34.890
So let me call it s, and it'll
be the rate of change.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.620
Good if I use those words.

00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:47.120
Yeah, so I want to think
just how we grow, a

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.540
typical person growing.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:56.910
In fact, as I wrote this on
the board, I thought of

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.060
another pair.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.310
Can I just say it in words, this
other pair, and then I'll

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.330
come back to this one?

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.430
Here's another pair.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:11.880
This could be money in a bank.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.360
Wealth sounds better.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.610
Let's call it wealth.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.340
That's zippier.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.490
And then what is this one?

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.840
If this is your wealth,
your total

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.890
assets, what's your worth?

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.730
This would be the rate
of change, how

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.510
quickly you're saving.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.970
s could be for saving.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:50.450
Or if you're down here, s
is for spending, right?

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.550
If s is positive, that means
you're wealth is increasing,

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.800
you're saving.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.940
Negative s means you're
spending, and your wealth goes

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:07.210
whatever, maybe--

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.760
I hope-- up.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.470
Height is mostly up, right?

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.270
So let me come back to
height of a person.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.360
Now, where--

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.780
oh, and this is time in years.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:28.340
This is t in years, and
this, too, of course.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:40.340
Actually, I realize
you started at t

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.120
equals zero: birth.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.835
You do start at a certain--

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.330
actually, what do I know?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.680
You don't say tall.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.530
You say long.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.930
But then as soon as you can
stand up, it's tall,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.180
so let's say tall.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.780
Shall we guessed 20 inches?

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.720
If that's way off, I apologize
to everybody.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.060
Let me just say 20, 20 inches.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.270
OK, at year zero.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:17.270
OK, and then presumably
you grow.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.680
OK, so you grow a little.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.790
What are we headed for?

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.450
About 60, 70 inches
or something.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.900
Anyway, you grow.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.230
Let's say that's 10 years old
and here is 20 years old.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.780
OK, so you grow.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.700
Maybe you grow faster
than that.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.990
Let's say you're a healthy
person here.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.970
OK, up you grow.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:55.200
And then at about maybe age 12
or 13, there's a growth spurt.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.030
And maybe the point is, how do
we see that growth spurt on

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.210
the two graphs?

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.320
Differently, but it's the
same growth spurt.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.340
OK, so here your height
suddenly jumps up.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.330
Boy, yeah, you catch
up with everybody.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.500
And then at about 12 or 13 well,
then unfortunately, it

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.190
doesn't do that forever, and
it kind of levels off here.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.960
It levels off, and actually
you don't

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.300
grow a whole lot more.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.930
In fact, I think when you get
to about-- oh, I don't know.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.380
Whatever.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.200
We won't discuss this point.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.900
I say when you get too old,
you probably lose some.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.100
Let's not emphasize that.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.230
OK, so here is the--

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.460
now, what's happening
over here?

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.950
Well, it's the slope
of that graph.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.080
So the slope might be--

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.520
this is time zero, but you're
growing right away.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.230
The s graph, the rate
of growth graph,

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.990
doesn't start at zero.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.280
It starts how fast you're
growing, whatever you're

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.040
growing, whatever
that slope is.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.710
It's fantastic that when we
draw graphs of things, the

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.870
word "slope" is suddenly
the right word.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.370
OK, so you're growing, maybe
at a pretty good rate here.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.960
And let me mark out
10 and 20 years.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.500
And OK, you're doing well,
you're coming along here, and

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.050
then the growth spurt.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.295
OK, so then suddenly, your
rate of growth takes off.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:58.090
But it doesn't stay
that way, right?

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.070
Your rate of growth levels
off, in fact,

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.990
levels way off, levels--

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:09.650
you'll come down to here, and
you probably don't grow a lot.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.190
Do you see the two?

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.000
This was the growth curve.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.940
This was the fast growth.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.090
But then it stopped.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.160
Up here, it slowed down.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.090
Here, it dropped.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:33.120
And oh, if we allow for this
person who lived too long,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.540
height actually drops.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.640
OK, there is an example
in which I don't--

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:48.550
also I'm sure people have
devised approximate formulas

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.480
for average growth rates,
but you see, I'm not--

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.520
it's the idea of the relation
between function one and

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.770
function two that
I'm emphasizing.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:11.040
Now, my last example, let me
take one more example, one

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.900
more example for this
first lecture.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:21.990
So let me take a case in
which the speed is--

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:23.483
so here will be my two--

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.210
let's use speed.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:34.230
Let's use this as distance.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:41.840
This is distance again,
and graph two, as

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.045
always, will be speed.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:53.720
And I'm going to take
a case in which

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.630
it's given by a formula.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:02.030
I'm going to let the speed
be increasing steadily.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:07.480
OK, so my speed graph this time
is going to go up at a

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.810
constant rate.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.690
So this is the speed s.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.780
This is the time t.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.530
So this would be s equals--

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.070
s is proportional to t.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.180
That's where you get
a straight line.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.460
s is let's say a times t.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.690
That a, a physicist, if we were
physicists, would say

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.570
acceleration.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.260
You're accelerating.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:40.560
You're keeping your foot on the
gas, steadily speeding up,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:47.260
and so then s is proportional
to t.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:54.580
Now, think about the distance.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.600
What's happening
with distance?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.540
If this is accelerating, you're

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.780
going faster and faster.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.210
You're covering more and more
speed, more and more distance,

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.420
more and more quickly.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.770
If this is slope, the
slope is increasing.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.870
Look, the graph--

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.820
let's start the trip
meter at zero.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.920
So you started with
a speed of zero.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.120
You were not really increasing
distance until you got

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.820
slightly beyond zero,
and then it

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.920
slightly started to increase.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:36.225
But then it increases faster
and faster, right?

00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:47.730
It never gets infinitely fast,
but it keeps going upwards.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.780
And the calculus question
would be

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.550
can we give a formula--

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.810
an equation--

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.060
for the distance?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.970
Because in this case, I guess
I started with function two,

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.710
and therefore, it's function
one that I want to look at.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.550
It's always pairs
of functions.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:17.260
OK, now, let's think where this
would actually happen.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.040
If we were leaning over the
Tower of Pisa or whatever,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.220
like Galileo, and drop
something, or even just drop

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:31.700
something anywhere, that
would be-- we drop it.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.310
At the beginning, it has no
speed, but of course,

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:39.310
instantly it picks up speed.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.580
The a would have something to
do with the gravitational

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.820
constant for the Earth,
whatever, and then maybe--

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.880
yeah.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.580
And what would be
the distance?

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.810
OK, now can I just mention a
small miracle of calculus?

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.810
A small miracle.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.270
I'm going this direction now
from speed to distance so I'm

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.600
doing integral calculus.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.730
And we'll get to that later.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.500
In the first lectures,
we're almost always

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.320
going from one to two.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.190
But here is a neat fact about
going from two to one, that if

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:26.580
this is the time t, then, of
course, this height here will

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.600
be a times t.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:40.710
And the amazing fact is that
this graph tells you the area

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.830
under this one.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.550
Graph one--

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.630
function one--

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.970
tells you the area under
the graph two.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:56.640
And in this example with a nice
constant acceleration,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.550
steady increase in speed,
we know this.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.000
This is a triangle.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.890
It has a base of t.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.470
It has a height of at.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:12.610
And the area of a triangle, of
course, the area, and my point

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.050
is that the area is
function one--

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:22.130
amazing; that's just
terrific--

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:29.090
will be-- the area of this
triangle here is 1/2 of the

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.560
base times the height.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.310
That's the area, and calculus
will tell us

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.360
that's function one.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:50.860
So this function is 1/2
of a times t squared.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:59.180
So there is a function one,
and here is df dt.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.470
If I go back to the first
letters that I mentioned, if

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:09.250
this is my function f, then
this is my function that--

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.650
and notice what kind
of a curve that is.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.250
Do you recognize that
with a square?

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:19.060
That tells me it's a parabola,
a famous and important curve.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.540
And, of course, it's important
because it

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.730
has such a neat formula.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:32.680
OK, so we have found
the function one.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.710
We've recovered the information
in that lost black

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:43.260
box, the distance box, the trip
meter, from what we did

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:50.110
find in black box two, the
speed, the record of speed.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.710
And notice, I'm using the
speed all the way

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.560
from here to here.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.770
The speed kind of tells me how
the distance is piled up.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.700
The distance is kind of a
running total, where the speed

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.610
at that moment is an
instant thing.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.060
Oh, we have to do that
in future lectures.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.480
The difference between a
running total of total

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.780
distance covered and a speed
that's telling me at a moment,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.120
at an instant how distance
is changing.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:31.050
The slope at this very point
t, that slope is

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.440
this height, is at.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.160
OK, so there you have
the first--

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.850
well, I'll say the second.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.050
The first pair of calculus
was this one.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.500
f equals st, and it's
derivative was s.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.220
Our second pair is f is this,
and will you allow

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.210
me to write df dt?

00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:05.134
If f is 1/2 of at squared,
then df dt is at.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.250
You'll see this rule again.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:15.680
The power two dropped
to a power one.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.790
But the two multiplied the thing
so it canceled the 1/2

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.390
and just left the a.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.580
OK, that's a start on the
highlights of calculus.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.810
Thanks.
