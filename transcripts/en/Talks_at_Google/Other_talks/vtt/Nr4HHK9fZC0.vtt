00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.320
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: All right. Thanks for
coming today. My name is Brian Fitzpatrick,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.700
here at Google Chicago. And I'm very happy
to have our guest here, who is no stranger

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.700
to this office.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: That's true.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.700
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick : Dan Sinker.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I'm sorry. I'm drinking my water
just as he said my name.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.189
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick : Oh that's, by all means.
If you can talk while you're, tweet while

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.800
anonymously, if you can talk while you're
drinking.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: It's true.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.349
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick : But Dan Sinker, as many
people know him, at MayorEmanuel. So, thanks

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.349
for coming today, Dan.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.509
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Thanks for having me. This is
awesome.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.731
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick : It's great to have you
back. So, a little bit of the history. I mean,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.750
you've been here before. What do you usually
come here for?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.000
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I have. Usually I come here.
I convince Fitz to allow me to bring students

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.740
here. I teach at Columbia College Chicago
in the Journalism Department and I teach kind

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.570
of various formats of digital journalism.
And a big part of what I do is teach teach

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.230
kids how to build stuff on the web.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.920
And Fitz has been very, very thoughtful enough
to allow my classes to come here and actually

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.950
present their final projects to some of you
guys. I recognize some faces here, and to

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.470
other folks that we invite in. So, yeah. I'm
definitely no stranger to these offices, which

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.070
made writing about Rahm's visit to Google
much more fun.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.030
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick : Well, I think maybe

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.510
we should just start right into that.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.880
[Dan Sinker laughs]

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.560
So, it sounds like at MayorEmanuel had a heck
of a trip when he came here.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.890
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. Well, I mean that was
the thing, right? The funny thing about writing

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.881
a fictional story about a guy running for
mayor in a city where you know a lot of people,

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:35.659
right? And and is he kept visiting places
that I was friends with people there.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:44.940
So it allowed me to kind of make merciless
fun of those places, knowing that there would

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.010
be people that would appreciate it. So, yeah,
when he came to Google, he spent he spent,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:58.439
the whole morning topping up on nerdery. So,
his intern, Carl, who over the course of the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.690
story kept getting more and more. Two things
happened with Carl as the story progressed.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.460
He kept getting younger.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.370
Like, he started as a twentyish year old college
intern and by the end of it he was a high

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.450
school kid, 16 years old. And he also kept
getting more and more geeky, right, till literally

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.160
the last day. They pick him up after Mathletes
practice at Lane Tech. And so, Carl was beside

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.550
himself with excitement that he was gonna
be speaking at Google. So he had to memorize

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.170
Pi down to a certain number of digits.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.380
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Not an interview question.
Just to be clear.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.459
[Dan Sinker laughs]

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.350
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: And David Axlerod was getting
him to memorize Monty Python lines and he

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.940
had been up all night getting a D and D character
together just in case. I believe the quote

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.810
was, "just in case anyone throws down a twentyside."
[audience laughs]

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.830
But yeah. But then he shows up and I actually
don't know anything about his appearance here.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.982
Neither do you. You totally weren't here.

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:01.982
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I was in Australia.

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:02.982
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I know.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:03.982
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Yeah.

00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:06.600
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I was like, "Oh my God. I'm
gonna write about Google 'cause Fitz is there."

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.390
And then you're off on a cruise.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.240
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: No, I was in New Zealand
at Foo Camp down there and furiously logging

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.950
in as people are telling me that--

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.950
[Dan Sinker laughs]

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.920
Mayor Emanuel was at your office being chased
by people on segways.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.921
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: By Eric Schmidt on a Segway
was mine. And yeah, they end up Segway jousting

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:34.640
out on Kinsey [audience chuckles] and then
being chased. I believe the setup is that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.930
Schmidt totally knocks him on his ass in Segway
jousting, which has anyone actually ever Segway

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.201
jousted? It seems fun in my head.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:43.819
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I've seen Segway juggling,
but.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.340
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, I think Segway jousting.
'Cause it would be, they're hard to knock

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.870
over. So you've really got to work at that
thing, right?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.800
[audience chuckles]

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.770
But anyway, he knocks him on his ass and then
starts giving a speech.[Brian Fitzpatrick

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.120
laughs] And Axlerod recognizes this speech
is coming out of the film, "Three Hundred."

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.550
And so he just tells Rahm, "OK, when he gets
to the line, like madness, this is Google,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.849
we just need to start running."

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:21.780
And so, they end up taking off running and
the line in the story is, "And now we're being

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.520
chased by 300 nerds." Or, "three hundred geeks
on Segways. Geeks with motherfucking swords."

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.730
Or something to that effect.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.730
[Brian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.350
And they end up hiding under the LaSalle Bridge
until everyone realizes that they're missing

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.830
Stargate SG-One. And they go wheeling off
on their Segways. So.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.550
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So you're saying you
wanna ride on my Segway? Is that what you're

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.550
saying here?

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.169
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I've ridden on your Segway.
That thing is terrifying, man.

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.169
[laughter]

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.660
That is all power to people that can handle
that. But I thought I was gonna die for the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.810
two minutes that I like, moved at one mile
an hour.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.860
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Four feet?

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.081
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Rocking back and forth like
this the whole way.

00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:06.800
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You've got "Three Hundred
" in here. We've got "Stargate SG-One." We've

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.750
got fermented baby food that causes people
to hallucinate. Were you under the influence

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.430
of any illicit drugs while you were writing
this?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.590
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I wasn't. People keep saying
that. But especially my students. And

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.250
[laughter]

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.590
I wasn't at all. It's just really fun to write
hallucination, right? And it's fun to write

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.509
things that start at one point and then end
really, really far off of that point and the

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:37.570
more sideways you can get.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:45.080
And definitely, as the story line progressed,
like the more kind of like geek references

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.340
and the comic book references and sci-fi references
and stuff like that that you can really subtlety

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:58.490
work in, the better. Down to the second to
last tweet has just this perfect, awesome

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.960
"Empire Strikes Back" subtle reference in
there that almost nobody picked up on. But

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.040
the other thing about Carl the Intern was
he was this awesome, gay teenager and he was

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.419
secretly in love with Rahm Emanuel. And at
the end of it, he

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.889
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: A Monty Burns sort of
thing.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:22.610
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, yeah. I guess so. But
at the very end, second to last tweet, as

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:30.930
Mayor Emanuel is disintegrating into time,
itself, Carl just says, "I love you." And

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.300
Mayor Emanuel responds, "I know."

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.500
[laughter]

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.650
Such a great little "Empire" moment in there.
And it went over a lot of people's heads.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.620
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, it's admittedly
subtle.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: It is, yeah.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: But--.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.110
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: There was a much less subtle
"Empire" reference where an entire morning

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.300
with Bill Clinton was reliving the whole Hoth
Wampa scene in "Empire."

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.411
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Right. Right. Right.
Well actually, let's back up for a second.

00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:58.950
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. Let's back up for a second.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.960
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: We've got two amazing
fantasy sequences where you can basically

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.100
do whatever you want, right?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.130
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I mean, that's like,
talking about the Simpson's. Simpson's writers

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.740
have said that one of the reasons that they
loved Monty Burns so much,might even have

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.853
been Harry Shearer, I don't know who it was,but
is that it gives you the freedom to do anything.

00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:15.880
The sky has unlimited wealth.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.880
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.530
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So, how did you get there?
When you first started off, I mean, the first

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.699
very few tweets, it was just like a whole
lot of profanity, right?

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:30.860
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes. Definitely. I mean, the
thing started not even really knowing it was

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.800
a thing. I mean, I think that's the way a
lot of people start projects is you don't

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.620
really know you've started that project until
you're well into that project.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.100
And so, that was certainly true with this.
It started late at night. Like, looking at

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.770
the timestamps on the tweets, it was like
post 10:30, which meant my kid was in bed

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.600
and my wife had probably gone to bed early
that night as well. So I'm just hanging out

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.290
on the couch. And this was the end of September,
so there were a lot of.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.229
P had just gone live with a story that Rahm
Emanuel was gonna leave the White House. There

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:10.889
had already been a lot of rumors that he was
gonna run for mayor, but this was the first

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.069
understanding that he was actually gonna leave
the White House. This was before the midterms.

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:17.039
Quite early in terms of when people thought.

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:24.259
P went live. The Tribune went live. It suddenly
became a big story and I have no idea why

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.880
that night it's sitting there by myself. It
just seemed like, "Well, that would be a funny

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:36.050
thing to do, wouldn't it?" And so, it started.
And yeah, I mean the early first few weeks

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:42.629
of the account, it was just, it was raw. The
profanity is pretty insane.

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:45.210
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I'd hate to break it
to you, but it's pretty insane the whole way

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.210
through.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:52.209
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well, except that it got a lot
more utilitarian, right? Early on, a lot of

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:59.360
what was entertaining to me was like, "What
word can I add to a hyphenated profanity to

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:08.160
make it just disgusting?" So, it was just
really gross. Like, reading it now it's like,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
"That's really gross."

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.790
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: At last count, there
were over two hundred of these hyphenated--.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.230
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes, there were. There were.
But that stuff dropped off especially as the

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.300
story-telling increased. Oftentimes, a tweet
would get written where you'd write the tweet

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.480
and then be like, "Oh, wait. I've gotta fold
a 'motherfucker' in here." Or something like

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480
that.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: People called you out
on that a few times, right?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.019
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes, every time. The best part
was that every time you would send one off

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:38.509
without, you would immediately hear. And that
person thought that they had just discovered

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:43.029
a leprechaun. Like, that person would be like,
"This is the first tweet ever without any

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:44.029
swearing."

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:48.170
And it's like, "No, look. Two weeks ago there
was one, too." And that guy also thought he'd

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.389
found the only one ever.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:52.490
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Yeah. And you follow
it up with a tweet of nothing but swear.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.579
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, yeah. Usually you would
then overcompensate for a while. But yeah.

00:09:57.579 --> 00:10:02.459
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, so it's interesting.
That brings up the point of people were replying

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.920
to you in real time. So, there's a couple
of issues here. One, the story's unfolding

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.111
and it seems like a pretty obvious thing for
at Mayor Emanuel to be angry about because

00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:12.769
why does he have to go through this with this
election?

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:13.769
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:16.550
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I mean, there's. He clearly
believes there's just no contest here and

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.550
I'm wasting my time.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:24.519
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. That's the conceit. The
whole early part of the story is this guy

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:31.019
basically being like, "Oh my God. I have to
do this, too?" Like he knows he's gonna be

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:39.959
elected but still has to perform all the duties
that you have to do when you're elected. And

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:45.290
every single one of them is irksome to him.
I mean, that's totally the character.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:50.619
The actual person seemed to love that stuff.
I mean, God, he went to an el Stop every day,

00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:54.470
right? Whereas my character, each el Stop
he just got more and more annoyed with the

00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:00.869
whole thing. I think by the end of like, the
first week, he's like, "Whoever runs janitorial

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.199
for the CTA, I wanna take a meeting with that
guy."

00:11:03.199 --> 00:11:06.119
[laughter]

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:12.069
But yeah. He's just really annoyed with the
process of running for mayor. It all just

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.700
seems like a big pain in his ass.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.910
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So then, people start
replying to you.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.910
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.589
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And the story's unfolding
in real time as the election is going on.

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:24.949
But how did that affect things? You had all
these people talking to you while you're story.

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:26.879
You're getting instant feedback. Tell me more
about that.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:33.309
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: So this is the thing that I
actually think is really interesting. And

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:39.740
it's something I've thought about a lot and
now that the story's done and out and a lot

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.019
of other people are starting to dissect it
as well.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:48.790
But you had people that have written fiction
on Twitter before. But typically what they

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:54.149
do is they write a story and then they dole
that thing out 140 characters at a time. So

00:11:54.149 --> 00:12:00.939
it's really just a terrible way to read a
story. Like one sentence every now and t hen

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:07.429
and you can't really keep up with it. With
the story that I wrote, it was in real time,

00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:12.499
so anything that happened was happening the
same way.

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:16.611
He ate lunch when you were eating lunch. He
was having coffee in the morning when you

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:17.791
were having coffee in the morning.

00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:18.791
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: He like coffee a lot.

00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:25.379
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: He loved coffee. I love coffee.
That stuff was honest. Pure, honest love of

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:31.410
coffee. But when it rained, he complained
about the rain. So there's a lot of real interplay

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.940
there. But the other thing was, and this happened
early on.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:43.829
So like I said, the entertainment value for
me at the very beginning was how do I these

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:50.889
really weird profane word combinations. But
that's not a lot of sustainability in terms

00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:59.819
of mental enjoyment, thankfully I guess right
, for my own psyche. And so then it became,

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:04.660
'cause a lot of it, especially early on, was
written as I rode the train.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.059
I live in Evanston. I work downtown. So I
take the Metro in and then walk from the Metro

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:16.019
to my office. So the total time between those
two things is about an hour. So a lot of the

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:22.189
tweeting is going to, or coming from, work.
And I started to entertain myself by writing

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:26.980
these little story arcs. Something would happen
and then something else.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.239
They probably started out as like, three Tweet
arcs, but it would be a beginning, middle,

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:38.589
and an end little mini story. And that might
unfold over 20 minutes or something. And in

00:13:38.589 --> 00:13:44.189
between each one of those beats, three, five,
let's say five tweets. In between each one

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:48.589
of those five tweets, you're immediately getting
feedback from the people that are reading

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:55.980
it, which is a really interesting way to write
a story because it completely influences the

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.850
way the thing that you set out to tell, the
way it progresses.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.499
It might. What it ended up doing was slowing
down those arcs, a lot of the time because

00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:12.999
you suddenly saw people react to them. Oftentimes,
like seeing things that you didn't see. So

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:19.209
it was like, "Oh, whoa. That's a totally cool
idea. Let's move in that direction." Or just

00:14:19.209 --> 00:14:28.779
the interplay of reaction and writing was
really complicated and very much influenced

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:31.169
the entire way the thing progressed.

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:35.649
'Cause it was these little mini arcs and you
just see how people reacted to those arcs.

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:41.459
And so then you're like, "What if it extended
out? What if, instead of being a one-hour

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:45.459
arc, it was a one-day arc?" Or, “What if
it wasn't a one-day arc, it was a one-week

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:49.060
arc, and how does that work with the people
that are following it?"

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:56.679
To me, the ultimate example of that is right
after Emanuel is kicked off the ballot for

00:14:56.679 --> 00:15:03.290
those of you watching on the screen that aren't
in the room with me, you might not know the

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:08.319
intricacies of the Chicago mayoral race. Emanuel
moved here from DC. There was a question as

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:12.329
to whether he was actually a Chicago resident
because he had been living in DC, working

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:13.329
for the President.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:18.769
And so, there was actually a period of time
in early January where a court had ruled that

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:26.119
he was, in fact, ineligible. And so, he was
removed from the ballot. And in the real world,

00:15:26.119 --> 00:15:31.679
Emanuel had a press conference. And in my
world, he freaked the fuck out. Like, they

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:36.930
destroyed the apartment they were living in
and basically lit everything on fire and then

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.859
decided that that wasn't enough.

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:44.369
They were actually gonna throw it all out
the front window. And Axlerod and Carl, who

00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:49.739
seemed to always be around, though they didn't
actually live together. They took off after

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:54.619
flipping Axlerod's Honda Civic. They must've
flipped it back and they took off to ostensibly

00:15:54.619 --> 00:16:00.689
go drive it into City Hall. And that left
Rahm alone.

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:08.069
And he ends up kind of singing Guns N' Roses,
"Patience" to himself as he walked the streets

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:14.600
at night, just trying to make it right. And
ends up sleeping underneath a bridge. The

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:21.799
Courtland Street Bridge. And wakes up the
next morning just really despondent. Any good

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:24.979
story, you have to have a complete low moment.

00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:33.669
This is his complete low moment. He has, nd
Axlerod's puppy ends up with him, named Hambone.

00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:40.809
And he ends up seeing a little duck, right?
And the way I was writing it, that duck was

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:47.749
like a one-tweet thing. Like, this duck was
just gonna be a thing that. It was gonna demonstrate

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:50.669
just how screwed up his head was.

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:56.749
Because he sees a duck and he somehow thinks
it reminds him of Axlerod. And so, he names

00:16:56.749 --> 00:17:01.529
it. Actually, in the original tweet, he names
it Axlerod, which is really stupid. The second

00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:08.759
tweet after that, the joke is much better.
He names it Quackslerod. But that was supposed

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:11.789
to be the whole thing. Like, the duck was
gonna fly off.

00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:19.470
And the at replies just exploded on Quackslerod.
So it was like, "Oh, this duck should probably

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:26.889
stick around, I guess, for a little while
'cause people are really enjoying it." And

00:17:26.889 --> 00:17:33.889
that Quackslerod character just became this
thing that I could not have possibly predicted.

00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:37.899
And had I written it like a normal story,
it never would have existed.

00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:43.899
But because I was able to see what was working
and conversely, what was not working with

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:49.009
the people that were reading it at the time,
you could totally. It completely changed things.

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:54.691
Quackslerod being the biggest of all of it.
But yeah, throughout the whole thing.

00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:57.870
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, there were the
small, like the "Back to the Future" thing.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.880
I mean, did you even realize that? Sort of.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.840
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well that's, yeah. OK, so. All
right. To, again, to contextualize a little

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:14.639
bit. So it turns out that we live in a multiverse,
according to what I wrote. And that the Mayor

00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:24.620
of Chicago is in fact, in charge of overseeing
the Chicagos infinite Chicagos. Mayor Emanuel

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.710
gets kidnapped by Mayor Daley and brought
to City Hall the day before the election so

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.549
that he can explain all of this to him.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:40.590
And it turns out that, Highlander-style, there
can only be one of any one of us in this multiverse.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.880
And that there were, in fact, two Rahm Emanuels
living here--the one that we now know, and

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:54.120
the one that I was writing. And so, mine realizes
that he's the anomaly here, and that he's

00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:01.730
gotta. He essentially has to sacrifice himself
or the world will end.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.830
Which, in terms of character arc, you start
with this guy who just thinks this whole thing

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:12.430
is an annoying waste of his time and you end
with this ultimate sacrificial, selfless act.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:19.350
But anyway, this is all set up to get back
to "Back to the Future." So it turns out,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:30.750
during the election day, there's some interplay
between space time and election results because

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:38.179
he's slowly starting to disappear.

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:44.919
This was a huge gamble on my part because
even though it really seemed like he was gonna

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:52.440
win it on that day, the way the Chicago election
works, we don't know this 'cause we really

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.419
haven't had an election in 21 years.

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:55.419
[laughter]

00:19:55.419 --> 00:20:04.700
But if you don't get over fifty percent,fifty
percent plus onethen there's a runoff, which

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:13.320
is what's happening today among City Council
people. Vote if you haven't. It seemed like

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.259
he was gonna win. Polling results, which I've
been tracking through a whole other, fully

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:23.559
legitimate process that I'd built, had him
above fifty.

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:29.000
But it felt like everyone's confidence that
that was really true was starting to wane

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.410
as Election Day progressed.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.460
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: It was a record low turnout.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:37.980
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: It was a record low turnout.
Basically, every other person running against

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:44.759
him was attempting to just get him below.
I mean, that's traditional, political strategy

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:47.259
is just knock this guy. Make him unlikeable.

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:55.360
Knock him down enough so that we can survive
to this next round. But the day before, I

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.980
had written this whole story that was clearly
setting up the end. And then I just decided

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:10.220
like, "OK, I've got. This is it. I have to
commit to the story that I just wrote." So,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:15.059
he's getting ready to go into the party that
they were hosting.

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:22.110
And he's alone by himself in the car and he
says, "Everyone's talking runoff, but I know

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:29.519
it's a win because my stump disappeared this
morning and my whole hand is going now." So

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:37.210
he puts on a glove like Michael Jackson style
to go in. But I'm backing, writing myself

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.190
into a corner at this point. I literally didn't
know what the hell happens if it is a runoff?

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:49.320
I've got him with an invisible hand. I don't
know what to do. How do you finish six more

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:57.429
weeks of this? And I did not think. And then
somebody in the at replies was like, "Oh my

00:21:57.429 --> 00:22:03.120
God, his hand is disappearing just like in
'Back to the Future.'" Which I loved that

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.721
film as a kid. And I can see that scene, but
I still can't remember if it was one or two.

00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:08.721
Does anyone know?

00:22:08.721 --> 00:22:09.721
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: It was one.

00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:10.721
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Was it one? OK.

00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:12.299
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, it happens again
in two, but he's observing it.

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:19.529
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. Right. And so, suddenly
I was like, "Oh my God. If it goes to runoff,

00:22:19.529 --> 00:22:26.059
that's my out." So I totally had this plan
that if it started to look like he was not

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:30.269
gonna win, and in fact, he won it handily
and very, very quickly. It was basically.

00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:33.750
Election night was over before it began, but
if it was looking like that's where it was

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.330
gonna go, the story was gonna be that Carl
the Intern realized he couldn't live without

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:46.970
him. He needed six more weeks with him at
a minimum. So he was gonna take Axlerod's

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:53.090
Civic and the Dearborne Station clock tower
and totally "Back to the Future" it just to

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.250
change the election results so that he'd be
back.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.250
[laughter]

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:03.909
So that was the out, entirely coming from.
Multiple people in the replies saw the "Back

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:08.259
to the Future" reference way before I did.
Like, I don't think I would've seen it, but

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:12.279
it totally, I had this perfect little out
right in my pocket if I needed it, which,

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:13.960
it turns out, I didn't need.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:20.230
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So that's a great example
of bringing other stories and that sort of

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:25.370
thing. Were there a lot of inside jokes in
the stream? I mean, clearly you knew people

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.670
and that sort of thing. You came here.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.341
There's a whole lot of talk about Segways
which unnerved me to no end because you had

00:23:31.341 --> 00:23:33.789
never told me about this.
[Dan Sinker laughs] And I'm like, "This has

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:36.700
gotta be somebody I know." And I never once
suspected --.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.190
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. I mean, there was a lot
of that kind of thing. When he went to Groupon,

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.759
I made a lot of Groupon jokes. When he went
to Threadless,he went to Threadless twice.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:52.100
He loves Threadless. That guy loves Threadless.
He's like a 14 years old girl.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100
[laughter]

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.250
He loves Threadless.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.870
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You'd think Axlerod would
be the one who likes to dress up.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.700
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well, the original writing,
Axlerod was super into Threadless. Like, was

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:07.549
like piling shirts on while Emanuel was complaining
about it. But then he goes back. But.

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:09.030
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: But you dressed up Axlerod
all the time.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.030
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes, I did.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.289
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: But sorry. Let's go back
to inside jokes. We'll come back.

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:17.960
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I feel like that was a lot of
the jokes, was just if I knew of a person

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.340
at a place, like, I could totally rib that
place. I'm trying to think of jokes for the

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:31.639
few people that knew. [pause]I definitely
planted things for the tiny collection of

00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:33.111
people that knew what was going on.

00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:36.470
It was like, "I'm just gonna throw this little
nugget in." But now, for the life of me, I

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.320
can't think of a good example of that, which
makes for a shitty story.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.919
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So who knew? Who knew
about this?

00:24:42.919 --> 00:24:47.769
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well, I've given people,the
few people that knew, I've always said, "You

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:48.769
out yourself."

00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:49.769
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: OK.

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:55.160
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: So, I'm not gonna out anyone.
My wife knew. I'll out her. She knew. And

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.590
then there were four other people throughout
the story that knew. Dan O'Neil being one.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.970
He outed himself when he took a picture of
me for the thing.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.330
That was again, like, he went, actual Rahm
went to EveryBlock and so I got to make a

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.420
lot of jokes about EveryBlock.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.420
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Right.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.750
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: And that was especially funny
'cause Dan O'Neil

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.750
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: 'Cause Dan O'Neil

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.890
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: from EveryBlock knew who was
doing it. And apparently, a lot of staffers

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:23.460
were eyeing him while they were there 'cause
it's like he's writing about every like . And

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.379
Dan was on his phone writing, being like.
So, anyway.

00:25:26.379 --> 00:25:28.809
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I suspected Dan. I suspected
Dan.

00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:34.259
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: A lot of people suspected Dan
and I would just be like, "What? That is a

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:43.470
good idea." That guy absorbed a lot of blows
for me, for sure. But that was really it.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.429
That was this tiny little collection of people
that knew.

00:25:46.429 --> 00:25:55.350
And the thing that was interesting to me was
that as the story line progresses. Because

00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:02.780
at the start, Mayor Emanuel doesn't like Axlerod.
He calls the intern a cocktard. He doesn't

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.149
like any of these people.

00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:13.350
And as the thing becomes harder for this character,
he relies on these friends of his more and

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.659
more and more and more. And so, by the end
of the story, I mean, they're just entire

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:22.169
tweets where all he's doing is in all caps,
yelling about how he loves his friends and

00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:27.059
stuff like that. And that's totally about
the folks that knew.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:36.370
Because it definitely felt, as media attention
increased, as just the whole thing got more

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:43.929
and more and more intense, I felt a little
bit like I needed an anchor, right. 'Cause

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:50.000
it just was very a weird thing to be in the
middle of. And those friends really became,like,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.039
the real world friends,became that anchor.
It was like, "God, you guys know which means

00:26:54.039 --> 00:27:00.289
I can actually have a real conversation with
you and I don't have to pretend that these

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:03.100
major things in my life don't exist."

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:11.200
So all of the friendship stuff in the Mayor
Emanuel story is totally reflective of the

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.940
friendships that I really needed during the,
especially the last, probably two or three

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.940
months.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.519
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, I mean the friendships
got really intense, I thought, toward the

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:20.789
end. That was a very big focus.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:21.789
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:25.080
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: The other focus that
I saw in it is, I just felt like there was

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.399
a sudden like love for the city.

00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:28.399
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:29.399
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You were going to different
places in the city.

00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:30.399
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Totally.

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:31.399
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Doing different things
and seeing different things.

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:37.369
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. That, I mean, that started
definitely by the end of it. That was,a big

00:27:37.369 --> 00:27:43.230
part of it was just like how amazing Chicago
is. But that actually started earlier than

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:49.889
I think a lot of people think. The first real
dream sequence that I wrote was actually on

00:27:49.889 --> 00:27:50.889
Halloween.

00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:56.870
So, it was basically a month after the account
started. And he ends up hallucinating 'cause

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.039
he eats too much candy corn, right? Which,
if any of us,

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.039
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: It happens.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:05.120
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: When you eat candy corn, man,
that like, you do go a little bit nuts, right?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.309
So I just pushed that. And I was actually
walking around Trick or Treating with my son,

00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:15.700
while writing this whole, like, Halloween
sequence. But he ends up hallucinating on

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.869
candy corn and having this,.

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:25.490
He's clearly travelling around the city, but
he's meeting people that aren't alive. At

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:31.830
one point, he's swimming in the river with
Harold Washington and Papa Bear Halas and

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.669
just like people from Chicago's history. And
he's looking at the skyline and the Sears

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:46.480
Tower and the Hancock Building are kissing.
And he ends up in Lake Michigan kind of baptizing

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480
himself.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.429
And in fact, he yells out, like I'm refucking
born, or something like that. And that actually

00:28:53.429 --> 00:29:00.440
does mark a big change in the overall story.
And he ends up,this is one of my favorite

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.009
parts,and this is again, like one of those
"how long can this story line go on?"

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:09.800
He starts in the evening and that feels like
the end, but he actually wakes up on the roof

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.350
of the Museum of Science and Industry the
next day and is like, "I don't know where

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.960
I am. All I know is I have the head of Benny
the Bull here, and 700 Brady for Governor

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960
yard signs."

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:33.940
Like, what happened last night? 
But that was the first of many, many Chicago

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:39.710
stories then. I mean, even the freak-out sign.
He ends up underneath the Courtland Bridge

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:47.041
and then he and the duck and the puppy ride
an ice flow down the river and Mayor Daley

00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:50.700
is riding an ice flow going the other way.
Which is like one of my favorite 'cause first

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.460
of all, that wouldn't work.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:58.090
The river only goes in one direction. But
also, just this idea that that's a natural

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:04.759
way to travel around in Chicago, is just hop
of a piece of ice and float down the river.

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:10.740
But there's just like Chicago becomes a character
in the story. And both in terms of fantasy,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:20.990
there's an extended entire twelve-hour long
dream sequence near the end that you mentioned.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.249
He's living in the crawlspace of his old house
by the end of it, which,

00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:25.659
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Which happens as well.

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:30.149
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: happens, but the crawlspace
was a great little writerly device because

00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:36.700
you're in a room filled with boxes, which
means anything you need,open a box, right.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.730
And suddenly, there it is. So, he and Axlerod
and Carl the Intern end up playing hide and

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.730
seek.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:48.960
And that little story line was actually written
in reflection of the fact that the real Rahm

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.440
Emanuel went on the radio and said like, "Hey."
They asked him about the account and he said,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:01.190
"I like the account. I think it's funny. I'd
like to know who does it and I'll donate money

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.419
to that person's charity of their choice if
they reveal themselves."

00:31:05.419 --> 00:31:09.750
Which, this was about two weeks out from the
election, so it was about two weeks out from

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:14.830
when the account is ending. And that freaked
me out 'cause suddenly it was like,. There

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.950
were a lot of people wondering about who was
doing it, but they were mostly journalists

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:24.149
and things like that. That changed the equation
significantly about who was looking for,.

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:26.419
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You have a bounty on
your head, now.

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:30.750
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well, literally. He goes on
the radio and clearly lays it out that's it's

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.809
a donation to charity and stuff like that.
Within ten minutes, I think it was MSNBC led

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:41.869
with the headline of, "Rahm Emanuel Puts Bounty
On Fake Twitterers Head."

00:31:41.869 --> 00:31:46.980
So suddenly, literally, there were like message
boards, especially among Conservative groups,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:53.419
that were like, "Let's round up a posse and
collect Rahm's money." I was like, "What?"

00:31:53.419 --> 00:32:00.860
So anyway, so the hide and seek was a direct
reaction to that. And he finds a box of old

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:07.840
baby stuff. And he's hiding in the box and
he's like, "No one's ever gonna find me. I'm

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.221
gonna be so still and quiet that they'll never
find me."

00:32:10.221 --> 00:32:14.559
Which is a reaction to what I was feeling.
Well he ends up being really good at that

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:18.669
and gets stuck in the box 'cause something
else falls over. And Axlerod and Carl the

00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:24.490
intern go home. So he's caught in this box
and he wakes up the next morning and is really

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:30.419
hungry, but he can't get out of the box. So,
he finds an old jar of baby food in there,

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:32.440
which turns out to be fermented and he eats
it.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:39.059
And suddenly, the box starts changing direction,
like, shape, and getting much bigger and Pat

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:43.200
the Bunny,that children's book, 'Pat the Bunny'-,hops
off the cover of the book and goes running

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.950
off and he goes to chase it. And that goes
through this really big Chicago-centric dream

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:54.720
sequence where he ends up on this island and
there's this giant tower of Dibs chairs.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.940
You know, the chairs that you put out to hold
your parking spot in the winter. And he climbs

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.519
up it and there are all these different levels
where he meets certain,. The disembodied head

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:11.929
of Marshall Field and the heart of Studs Turkle
and then he ends up meeting Curtis Mayfield

00:33:11.929 --> 00:33:15.210
in a white room and he's all in white.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.840
Each time they're giving him little bits of
information about how important the city is

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:27.039
and the things that need to be fixed. And
so, this is a very long explanation for this

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:33.340
question I just realized. But that one especially
is all about just how amazing this city is

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:41.999
and yet, how many problems it faces. I mean,
who ever won that mayor's race, like, God

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:46.279
love 'em 'cause they've got a lot of things
they need to do here.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:51.331
So, I mean that was a very funny sequence,
but there are also these points that I was

00:33:51.331 --> 00:33:54.769
actually trying to make about some of the
troubles with the city.

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:59.539
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, there was a lot
of interesting symbolism in the story that

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:04.159
I thought. And I think most expectation would
be that you wind up with some great symbol

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:08.560
of Chicago, whether the Hancock, or the Art
Institute, or the lake or something. And it

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.270
turns out to be surprisingly up to everyone,
I think, celery salt.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.350
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:18.400
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So, obviously, I think
most people understand the celery salt hot

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400
dog.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.379
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. Well, celery salt, for
those of you that don't know this, Chicago-style

00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:29.399
hot dog, which is a hot dog and lettuce and
fluorescent green mustard and raw onions and,

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:30.399
not lettuce. Did I say lettuce?

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:31.399
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You did say lettuce.

00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:32.399
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I meant tomatoes.

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:33.399
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Tomatoes.

00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:34.399
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Holy shit, man.

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:35.399
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: But no ketchup, of course.

00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:39.149
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, no ketchup. Just mustard.
And then topped with celery salt. A lot of

00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:42.839
people forget the celery salt, especially
when they're making them at home. But it's

00:34:42.839 --> 00:34:48.260
really the crucial ingredient. And so, during
that period of time where he's kidnapped by

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:54.309
Mayor Daley, Mayor Daley brings him up to
the roof of City Hall, which, in my story,

00:34:54.309 --> 00:34:57.010
there's a giant glass dome on the roof.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:05.620
And inside, is this garden of celery. And
this is actually my favorite tweet that I

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:12.869
wrote of, out of 1954. He gives the entire
directions of how to make celery salt in one

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:21.100
tweet. And the best part about that was it
required such a reduction in language that

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.240
the way he says it really becomes a sacrament.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:34.890
Like, it's so minimalistic that it comes off
clearly that it's. The language, the reduction

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:40.750
in language implies the gravity of the action.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:45.130
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, it's on top of.
There's an immense sense of reverence already.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.130
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.130
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: They're in there. The
gravestones.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.609
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: That whole sequence is quiet.
It's a totally different thing, yes. So there

00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:53.300
are three gravestones in there, too. I mean
the language. There were actually people in

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.050
the replies that were like, "See, I knew more
than one person was writing this account because

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:03.760
there's no way that the person writing this,
was also writing about unicorn's vaginas."

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.770
[laughter]

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:16.059
But yeah. The whole language becomes very,
very referential, or deferential. Really quiet.

00:36:16.059 --> 00:36:21.590
I mean, it's clear to the character that he's
in this sacred space. And Daley shows him

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.631
this stuff and then he shows him this.

00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:27.809
He gives him a taste of the salt. And then
he looks and he realizes there are actually

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:34.220
three gravestones in this field and they're
the gravestones of Harrison, of Washington,

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:42.200
and of Daley's father, right. And they're
all three very important mayors in the history

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.369
of Chicago, but also three mayors that died
in office, right.. So, there's this really

00:36:47.369 --> 00:36:48.369
just, yeah.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:52.680
So he sees these and it's super silent and
he takes little rocks and he puts them on

00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:00.270
each gravestone. And it's just this really
quiet moment that they just sit there. I mean,

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.299
there's even a tweet that's like, "And then
we just sit there and listen to each other

00:37:03.299 --> 00:37:04.482
breathing." Or something like that.

00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:05.482
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: He set rocks on the stones.

00:37:05.482 --> 00:37:10.859
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. I mean, it's this quiet
moment, but then immediately flips into complete

00:37:10.859 --> 00:37:17.369
batshit when Daley's like, "There's something
else." And he flips a switch and this giant

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:22.549
grill rises up from the ground and he opens
the lid and you can see into these infinite

00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:30.280
Chicagos. But there is this celery salt moment.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.050
And the thing that was interesting was it
took another guy, a guy named Tim Carmondy

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:43.900
I believe is his name, who actually storified
a couple of the last days of Mayor Emanuel.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:49.740
He catches the celery salt thing and then
is like, "And then I read through the account

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.799
and celery salt appears all over the place."
Which I didn't really know I was doing, but

00:37:54.799 --> 00:37:55.799
it's true.

00:37:55.799 --> 00:38:00.880
Like that Halloween story. Like at one point,
he's like, "My tears taste like celery salt."

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.280
And I mean, there's just all these moments
where celery salt is this total symbol for

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:14.059
everything about Chicago, which in some ways,
I think, is true. Because it is this crucial

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:20.220
and oft overlooked ingredient. I mean if you
take the Pepsi Challenge, go to hot dogs,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.991
order two dogs,Chicago dogs.

00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:27.849
One without the celery salt, one with and
it's like you can eat that one, the one without,

00:38:27.849 --> 00:38:33.809
and it's just a hot dog. And then you eat
that one and it's a Chicago dog. So I mean,

00:38:33.809 --> 00:38:38.430
it really is a crucial, crucial thing that
we don't think about a lot.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:43.099
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So other than your fascination
with celery salt, how did you keep this secret

00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:46.480
the whole time? Surely there was one point
where you just wanted to be like, "Tell everybody."

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: No?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.480
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Opposite.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Really, you sound horrified?

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.740
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: There were a lot of times where
it was like, "OK, I'm just ending this. If

00:38:51.740 --> 00:39:00.180
I stop this right now, no one ever needs to
know." But I couldn't 'cause I'm not very

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.500
good at that apparently. Keeping it a secret
was hard.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.980
I mean, it wasn't hard at the start 'cause
I didn't know I was keeping a secret. But

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:14.480
eventually, it reached a point where you knew
you were keeping a secret. And then you really

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:19.750
needed to think about how do you keep a secret?
How do you keep a thing that you've got to

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:26.032
constantly be feeding? A secret. It's like,
if you're a kid and you really wanted a dog

00:39:26.032 --> 00:39:28.069
and so you sneak that dog home one day.

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:32.000
And you're like, "I can totally keep it in
my room and never tell anyone and no one will

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.510
be any wiser." But it really--. There were
30 tweets in a day. And a lot of those were

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:46.010
written in public. A lot of them were written
on the train back and forth, so train rides

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:51.369
really became like super paranoia inducing,
where it's like.

00:39:51.369 --> 00:39:55.700
I would totally judge the people. Who could
I sit next to that might not be reading the

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.500
account? Because a lot of people read this
damn account and so the worst case scenario

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.900
was you plop down next to some dude and you
were to write and then he's clearly reading

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:15.130
it as you're like, "The gig is up, right."
The secret was kept because it was not shared

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.150
very widely early on.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:25.619
That would be the A Number One thing and then
that the people that knew, I trust intrinsically.

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:32.109
And even near the end, when it became clear
that I did need to let a few other people

00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:38.579
know, right, those people were selected on
the like "I really trust these people." And

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:46.880
so, that's how it was done. I was not very
interested in revealing myself.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:54.650
So that helped because if you really wanna
tell someone a secret, you're gonna tell 'em.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:41:01.690
And I didn't. And in fact, even once I'd made
up my mind that I would reveal myself, I continued

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:10.480
to be very ambivalent about that reveal to
the person that I'd selected to reveal, to

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:17.430
the point that we conversed for days before
I finally told them who I was.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:25.040
'Cause it just. I was so unsure about that
reveal. And a lot of that was because this

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:33.640
thing had gotten so much bigger than I could
have ever imagined it to be. And as a result,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:40.480
I didn't know what was gonna happen. And that
unknown, in terms of positive, or in terms

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.000
of negative. I mean, I was very unsure whether
I would be able to keep my job.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.361
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You slogged a lot of
people.

00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:49.309
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. A lot of people.

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:50.589
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: But you're an equal opportunity,
pretty much.

00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:58.440
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I'm very much so. And so yes.
I was very ambivalent about the reveal.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.799
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So, we were at a conference
together, end of January.

00:42:03.799 --> 00:42:04.799
[Dan Sinker laughs]

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:08.940
We were at ORD Camp, OK? Where you were already
paranoid at this point, I would assume.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.940
&gt;&gt; Dan Sinker: Yes.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.660
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: How did you get into
it? 'Cause everybod,. There was a lot of hype,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.430
a lot of talk about at Mayor Emanuel at the
conference. Where were you? Like off in a

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.430
corner like tweeting ?

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.490
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I tweeted from the bathroom.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.490
[laughter]

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:26.960
If anyone was at ORD Camp and was watching
me, I appeared to have a major bladder issue,

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960
right?

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.290
[Brian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:35.789
Because I was in the bathroom a lot, in the
stall. It wasn't enough to just be in the

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:43.039
bathroom or the hallway. In a stall. No one's
walking in on me. More than that, he had just,

00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:48.869
there had just been a major location change
in the story. After the huge snowfall that

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:54.230
happened in. Wait. Back up.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.490
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Snowfall was the week
after, I think.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:57.490
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:58.490
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: The blizzard.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.720
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: So how are they in the car?
I'm confused. My own chronology is off. But

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:11.640
they hadn't moved into the house, but at ORD
Camp, they had decided to haunt the guy living

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:17.809
in Emanuel's house. So they all wore bed sheets
and went into the house, including the duck

00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:22.170
and the puppy.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:26.210
And so, that was a great little story line,
but I'm totally writing that at ORD Camp,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.299
so I had to keep. 'Cause I would get a good
idea and then I'd have to go running off to

00:43:30.299 --> 00:43:31.299
the bathroom.

00:43:31.299 --> 00:43:32.299
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I'll be right back.

00:43:32.299 --> 00:43:33.299
[laughter]

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:36.051
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, to actually tweet it.
But somehow, 'cause I know a lot of people

00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:42.790
did talk about the account at ORD Camp and
I managed to not be at those locations, 'cause

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.109
that would've been really difficult.

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:48.309
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Did you ever fish for
like, compliments or anything?

00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:49.309
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No. Never.

00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:50.730
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You ever asked somebody,
"Hey, you ever read that at Mayor Emanuel?

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.810
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No. No. No. And in fact, my
wife was convinced that that was gonna be

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.260
the thing that gave me away.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.300
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: The negative space.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:03.480
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: 'Cause she was like, "You would
be all over this thing. If it wasn't you,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.619
you would be retweeting it, you would be talking
about it all the time. And you're not doing

00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:12.869
anything. You're silent of everyone that you
know.

00:44:12.869 --> 00:44:18.359
You are this gaping void in a conversation
around Mayor Emanuel." Like if somebody had

00:44:18.359 --> 00:44:24.940
done pure, statistical analysis of Twitter
and who was taking about Mayor Emanuel that

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.190
could possibly be it. And then there's me.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:35.670
Like, I'm the only one not. It was so clear,
but no, I didn't. I tried to avoid it. I never

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:41.369
wanted to touch it. One, because I was like,
contrary to what you might think I'm actually

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:44.350
not a very good liar. And so, it's like,

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.350
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Sure.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.050
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: if it came up, it would be awkward
and

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.890
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, the face to face
thing. It would be really hard.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.010
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. The face to face thing
would be really hard, especially with people

00:44:53.010 --> 00:45:02.750
who I know and like. And so, in my brain,
that account was fire. So it was like I wouldn't

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:09.340
personally touch it ever. In fact, I only
retweeted Mayor Emanuel once, and that was

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:14.710
the original retweet, which if somebody also
had fallen back enough.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.950
I retweeted it like the old retweet way, where
you actually have to manually do it. And the

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:24.930
nice thing was, the attribution to me, personally,
fell off almost immediately as it made its

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:29.910
way through. Like, if it had been kept intact,
I think it would have been very easy for people

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:31.619
to have figured out early on that it was me.

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:38.500
But the attribution fell off, literally within
one or two tweets. I tried to never touch

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.789
it, I never engaged a conversation about it.
If it came up in conversation, I would literally

00:45:44.789 --> 00:45:50.550
just be like, "What's the tangential thing
I can possibly bring up to move this conversation

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:56.369
away from this as quickly as possible.”
I tried to stay far from it.

00:45:56.369 --> 00:46:00.990
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So when you did finally
decide to fess up

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.990
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:05.549
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: to, what made you choose
Alexis at the Atlantic?

00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:06.549
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, at the Atlantic.

00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:09.630
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And also, I'd like you
to talk about this back and forth you had

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.630
over, you know.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.630
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Sure, well.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.630
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Were you just abusing
him the whole time?

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:13.630
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. Basically, yeah.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.750
[Brian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.730
Well, a lot of press people wrote @replies
to Mayor Emanuel,

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.059
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And he told them all
to fuck off.

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:23.030
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: trying to get interviews. All
of them, every single one, just

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.541
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Abuse.

00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:30.869
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: abuse, right? A lot of it would
be abuse couched, like, "Oh, yeah. No problem."

00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:35.180
They'd write me like, "I'd love to do an interview."
And I'd be like, "Yeah, no problem. Just give

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.660
the office a call. It's 312 FUCK OFF." And
stuff like that.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660
[laughter]

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.839
I had to spell the numbers out. The first
time I did it, I actually used the digits

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:48.380
that spelled it out and I'm positive whoever
lived at that number got like a trillion phone

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.090
calls, 'cause nobody got the joke.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.400
[laughter]

00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:02.430
But this guy, Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic,
he wrote same exact kind of at reply on Election

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:09.020
Day. In my head, I knew the account was ending.
By that point in my head, there was so much

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:18.420
attention on the thing that I couldn't keep
the secret once it was over. Because it just

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.910
was, It was difficult to live.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:28.260
I mean, it sounds stupid, but it was very,
very hard to feel all of this pressure and

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:35.359
all of these people hunting for you and to
exist in the world. You had to kind of remove

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:40.000
yourself from the world. I mean, my own personal
Twitter account, I'd barely tweeted at all

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.151
in the last couple weeks 'cause it was just
like I can't engage in the world.

00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:48.371
And I needed to be able to engage in the world.
So I knew I needed it to end. I knew the story

00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:53.869
was ending. And this guy writes an at reply.
And I write him back and just told him to

00:47:53.869 --> 00:48:01.430
fuck himself the same way everyone else gets
it. And he wrote back and tried again and

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:05.500
I think I ignored him. Then he wrote again
to be like, "Well at least you owe me another

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.630
'fuck off'."

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:13.630
And so I think I told him that. And then he
wrote one more time and wa,. Or, I think my

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:19.289
second reply was like, "Look, I've got an
election to win and a time vortex to disintegrate

00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:23.711
into. I don't have time for you." Or something
like that. And he wrote back and was like,

00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:29.039
"Everyone has 15 minutes." And included, in
a public at reply, his Gmail account.

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:30.200
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Yeah.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.740
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: And so I was like, well that's
funny. Who is this guy anyway? And so I looked

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:40.410
it up and it turns out he used to write for
Wired and now he's the tech editor and a senior

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:45.630
writer at the Atlantic online. And I was like,
"That's an interesting, that's a good pedigree."

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:50.460
And I threw it out to the collection of people
that knew the secret, like, "Who is this guy?

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.980
Do any of you know him?"

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.980
And one of them actually had a friend that
knew him. So it was like, "OK, this is someone

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:02.010
who is writing about stuff that I like in
a publication that I have a great deal of

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:08.849
respect for. He's known as being a decent
person among the people that I'm really trusting

00:49:08.849 --> 00:49:15.200
here. I'll give it a shot." So when I had
registered the account, I didn't use my own

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200
email address.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.810
I used a Gmail account that I'd set up. Gmail,
good times, untraceable, right. And so, I

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:30.490
was like, "OK. I'm gonna write him from that
account." And so I wrote him an email. The

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:31.990
subject line just said, "OK, Asshole."

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.210
[laughter]

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.480
And then it just said two things. It said,
"One, you mention this tweet, this blog, about

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.609
it, it's over before it even begins. Two,
you're the journalist. Pitch me." And he wrote

00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:48.529
me back with a pitch and it was really not
a very good pitch. And so, I wrote him back.

00:49:48.529 --> 00:49:51.809
And I was like, "No, that sounds boring. I'm
gonna go to the New York Times instead."

00:49:51.809 --> 00:49:56.059
Which was totally like one of the back and
forths was me constantly threatening to go

00:49:56.059 --> 00:50:02.150
to the New York Times. And so, he wrote back
and he's like,. It basically was like, "Well,

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:08.940
if that sounds boring, what sounds good?"
And I wrote back and was like, "I'm not doing

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:15.940
your job for you, basically." And then, I
think it was that one, where I finally was

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.559
like, "The New York Times."

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:23.150
I don't know. We had a few more. Then there
was finally one where I wrote back and I said,

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.411
"You know, I don't know. What you're promising
isn't very interesting. The New York Times

00:50:26.411 --> 00:50:30.299
says they'll give me all the piggy back rides
I want and a pony." [Bian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:50:30.299 --> 00:50:35.369
And he wrote back and he said, "Oh, great.
Now I'm gonna have to kill everyone at the

00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:37.160
New York Times and every pony."

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.630
[laughter]

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:43.400
That's a pretty good response. I mean, so
then it was like, "Huh."

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.400
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I'll play ball.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:50.039
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. So then, I mean literally,
it was dating. I think he counted it. There

00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:56.740
were 60 emails exchanged between us and a
lot of them were just jokes, like me being

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.740
rude to him.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.070
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: How long was that? A
couple days, or a week?

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.070
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No, it

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.070
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: It wasn't even a week.
It was.

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:08.030
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Forty-eight hours, maybe. But
it was just testing. I think I was testing

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:17.609
him to see who he was, how he thinks, how
he could respond to stuff. And he was testing

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:24.829
me to just see is there really anything here.
But we bounced back and forth.

00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:32.799
And I think it was the end. Let me think.
The election was on a Tuesday. The account

00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:38.450
ended on a Wednesday. So it was on that Thursday
that I finally wrote to him and was like,

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:43.950
"I'm gonna drop pretense." So, we communicated
for two days with me basically writing to

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.250
him in character.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:51.210
And finally on that Thursday I think I wrote
him and I was like, "I'm gonna drop all pretense

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:57.450
here. Here is my misgivings." And I think
what I said was, "I'm very nervous that my

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:05.079
life might get a little crazy when this comes
out. And as a result, I'm very ambivalent

00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:09.490
about it coming out. And I want it to come
out the right way, if it does."

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:14.029
And he wrote me back this super long email
that started out like, "I totally get it.

00:52:14.029 --> 00:52:18.761
I've had some friends that I think," he wrote,
"descended into the media vortex and it was

00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:25.500
hard to see that happen to them." But then
he also basically was like, "Here's why I

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:33.109
think the account is really interesting."
And he ends up quoting Russian literature.

00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:39.170
And so, I wrote him. And that was, that's
kind of awesome. I mean, a total ego play

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:44.960
for him to do that. But a smart one. And so
I wrote him back and I was like, "OK, you'll

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.599
do." That's all the email said. And then my
favorite thing is I didn't write him back

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:50.210
for hours right after that.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.210
[Brian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:56.849
Like, he wrote right back and then I just
let him stew for a really long time. But then

00:52:56.849 --> 00:53:03.630
we started conversing more directly. And he
did a couple of things that I think were really

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:10.390
smart. One, he never asked me who I was through
all of this. We were continuing to email just

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:14.380
through this anonymous account.

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:21.991
And finally, I was riding in that Friday and
I had already told him like, "Nothing's going

00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:28.799
live this week." I had actually. My wife and
kid and I had already made plans to leave

00:53:28.799 --> 00:53:36.779
town. In part because we really needed a vacation,
but also in part because in my head it was

00:53:36.779 --> 00:53:38.130
like, "I need to get out of here."

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:43.619
So we were going up to Milwaukee and I was
like, "I wanna have a normal weekend with

00:53:43.619 --> 00:53:48.640
my wife and kid, so nothing's coming out until
Monday. I'm not gonna talk to you until Monday."

00:53:48.640 --> 00:54:01.140
But, on the train in, I realized two things.
One, I'm not just some dude. I've worked very

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:09.660
hard on a lot of different things for a long
time right ,almost 20 years.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:16.460
And all of that stuff adds layers to, I think,
the understanding of the story. So it's not

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:23.109
fair for him to not know who I am until we
talk on the phone for the first time. So I

00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:27.789
realized that. And I also realized like, "Wait,
how does this guy not know I'm some guy just

00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:33.920
screwing with him?" Like, he put his email
out on a public at reply and he's corresponding

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.369
with an anonymous email account.

00:54:35.369 --> 00:54:40.680
So I wrote him back that morning when I got
into work and I basically was like, "OK, first

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:46.780
of all, how do know that I'm me? And second
of all, why haven't you asked me who I am?"

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:53.010
And he wrote back and he said, "I think I
wondered about whether you were you, but there's

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:57.619
just so much tonally in your writing that
I'm pretty sure it's the same."

00:54:57.619 --> 00:55:06.289
And not profanity, but the other stuff. But
he didn't ask me who I was, which is brilliant.

00:55:06.289 --> 00:55:14.490
'Cause he had totally figured out like, I
needed him to ask me. And he wasn't gonna

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:21.059
do it. Like, it was so clear he was not gonna
do it. He was gonna make me do it. So, I finally

00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:25.029
wrote him and was like, "OK. This is gonna
happen.

00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:29.019
It's happening on Monday. We're talking on
Monday, but I'm gonna give you the weekend

00:55:29.019 --> 00:55:33.869
to do some research on who I am." And so,
I said, "I'm Dan Sinker." And I hit send.

00:55:33.869 --> 00:55:40.079
And then I was like, "I gotta go teach a class."
So literally in the back of my head in class

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:43.890
is like, "I'm gonna come outside and there
are gonna be reporters all over."

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.470
Like, what is gonna happen 'cause he's not
gonna hold up his side of the bargain. And

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:53.210
meanwhile, I'm trying to teach, ironically,
about social media that day.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:54.210
[laughter]

00:55:54.210 --> 00:56:00.690
And I came out at break. We had a very early
break that day and he had not revealed it,

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:06.660
but he had started to research. And I came
in and there was an email at my actual email

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:12.119
account from him that just said, "Punk Fucking
Planet," with six exclamation points, which

00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:15.140
was this magazine that I'd run for 13 years.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:21.599
And it turns out he had come up in the Portland
independent publishing and punk scene. So

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:26.579
he knew that history. So that was really the
moment where it was like, clearly this was

00:56:26.579 --> 00:56:33.170
all meant to be. And yeah. And then he wrote
the story. It went live on Monday and then.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:35.230
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Everything went upside
down.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:40.819
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. I mean, my idea of things
might be crazy for a bit and what actually

00:56:40.819 --> 00:56:42.670
happened are.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:43.940
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Diverse?

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.099
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. I'm over here and.

00:56:46.099 --> 00:56:49.310
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Did you expect reporters
on your lawn?

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:55.240
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No. The story went live at 1:15.
By three o'clock, local media was on our lawn.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.240
[laughter]

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.051
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I believe the quote from
you was that "there's a fucking reporter on

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:02.051
my lawn."

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:06.829
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, I tweeted that out and
then I did what I think anyone would do in

00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:13.460
that situation, which was dive off of my couch
and crawl across the floor into the bedroom.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.460
[laughter]

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.690
And then freak out. My wife had come home
early because it became pretty apparent pretty

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:24.760
quickly that this, the reaction to this was
significantly more than we had thought it

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:31.250
was gonna be. So she came home early, which
was a blessing. But her basic approach was

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.430
like, "If we don't make any sound, they'll
go away."

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.650
[laughter]

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:39.930
And I was like, "I was sitting in the window.
He walked right; I'm pretty sure he knows

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:47.850
we're here." And they're ringing the bell
and knocking on windows. And so finally, I

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:54.619
was like, "I gotta go answer the door." So
I answer the door. My wife furiously is cleaning

00:57:54.619 --> 00:58:02.910
as much of the house as can happen at that
time. And I say to him. It's one guy from

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:09.680
ABC 7 . I say to him, "Did you have to come
to my house?" 'Cause that felt.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.789
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Like a violation.

00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:14.960
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Like a violation. I mean, it's
like you're in my house. My kid is coming

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:22.940
home from school in a half an hour. My neighbors
think I'm an axe murderer now. And he goes,

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.880
"Well, we tried going to your work first,
but you weren't there." I was like, "Oh, great.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.690
Perfect."

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:31.500
[laughter]

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:35.980
And then he says, "Well, just so you know,
like, we're here now. Everyone else will be

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:41.339
here soon." Meaning, all the other channels.
And he was like, "So you need to think about

00:58:41.339 --> 00:58:44.670
how you wanna do this." I was like, "What
do you mean?" He was like, "Well, there are

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:45.829
basically two ways you can do this."

00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:46.890
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: The easy way or the hard
way?

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.940
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. That's what I said.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.940
[Brian Fitzpatrick laughs]

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:54.771
And he chuckled and he said, "Well, no. But
either you can invite us in, each one of us.

00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:58.519
We'll take ten minutes out of your time. We'll
get out of your hair pretty quickly. The story

00:58:58.519 --> 00:59:02.089
will be on the news. It'll be a good story."

00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:07.540
To his credit, he was actually a legitimate
fan of the account. And so, I was very lucky

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:12.609
that he showed up first, I think. And I was
like, "OK, what's the other way?" 'Cause that

00:59:12.609 --> 00:59:18.299
way did not sound very appealing to me. He
was like, "The other way is you can close

00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:22.829
the door and say, 'I don't wanna talk to you
guys,' and we'll talk to your neighbors and

00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:24.750
we'll go over to your parent's house in Glenview."

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:30.089
They already knew. They had looked that up.
And he's like, "And we'll do the story that

00:59:30.089 --> 00:59:39.650
way." And I'm like, "That's a kind of a bum
deal." Those are my two choices? So I was

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:46.180
like, "All right. I'll invite you in." And
so, they came in and shot a thing. And then

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:51.770
everyone else showed up and it was just this
insane local media parade.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:57.440
And meanwhile, my email is just like [makes
buzzing noise]. Just emails and my phone is

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:09.420
going crazy. And yeah. I mean, it was nothing
like I had thought it possibly could have

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.890
been. I mean, it was insane. That 24-hour
period was insane.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:20.160
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, so let me get this
straight here. So, you had reporters drive

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.980
up from the City of Chicago to Evanston.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.980
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.309
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: They're on your front
lawn.

01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:25.309
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes.

01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:28.529
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And I believe,we're not
gonna name names, here,but several people,

01:00:28.529 --> 01:00:32.780
I believe, asked you, if I recall correctly,
who you voted for in the election.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.920
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. I got asked that twice.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.391
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: For the City of Chicago.

01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:36.391
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

01:00:36.391 --> 01:00:37.619
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: While they're standing
in Evanston at your house.

01:00:37.619 --> 01:00:39.049
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes. In my house.

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:40.049
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: In your house.

01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:41.701
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: They asked me, "Who did you
vote for?"

01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:43.839
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well, it is Chicago,
I suppose.

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:44.839
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Well, you know.

01:00:44.839 --> 01:00:45.902
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: How many times did you
vote for that?

01:00:45.902 --> 01:00:49.760
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: You think it'd be a question
you might've worked out as they crossed the

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:59.869
border out of Chicago. But they didn't. They
asked it. And my response was basically, "What?"

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:01.380
But yeah. So, I mean that just.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:08.150
The local media.. Then I was on the cover
of the Tribune. Like, the whol,-. Not little

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:13.171
like that. The story, if it was on the cover,
should've been a little tiny box on the cover,

01:01:13.171 --> 01:01:20.609
but no. It was the whole cover, which interesting
anecdote. I got recognized from the news constantly

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:23.589
the next few days. And the Tribune?

01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:27.559
Only people consistently citing, "You're the
guy from the newspaper," drunk homeless people.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.559
[laughter]

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.559
Exclusively.

01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:32.809
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Well now, interestingly
enough, on your personal Twitter account,

01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:35.901
you're often haranguing the Tribune for leading
stories.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:36.901
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes.

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:38.990
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Like there's some huge
thing going on in Wisconsin and they're talking

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.990
about

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:42.200
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Kraft Beers was their leading
story this week.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.060
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Yeah, exactly. That's
their lead story. And you continue to do that,

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.430
even though you've already been on the front
page.

01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:46.430
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:47.430
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: You're not giving it
up.

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:51.710
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I mean, no. I mean, the thing
to me is, I teach journalism. And I think

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:57.609
about media and the impact of media a lot.
To then suddenly be at the center of every

01:01:57.609 --> 01:02:03.910
single thing that I criticize, right. I mean,
it lead the news that night. It was the lead

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:10.039
story on the news. Second story? Mayor elect
meets with the actual mayor.

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:19.539
That's the second story because I needed five
minutes at the start, right. That's a poor

01:02:19.539 --> 01:02:26.079
editorial priority. I mean, that's just, that
embodies everything that's wrong with the

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:32.730
news media right now. And then it's me. I
was like, "Oh, great."

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.140
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So you met. A few days
later you met Rahm.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:42.900
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah, that was the height of
the media insanity was. Two weeks previous,

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:47.119
I guess, maybe three weeks previous at that
point, Rahm Emanuel had gone on the radio,

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.769
commercial radio station, which I.

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:54.550
I mean, I listen to public radio. Like, I'm
that guy. Commercial radio? I hadn't heard

01:02:54.550 --> 01:03:02.990
a commercial radio station since I stopped
calling Z 95 when I was in middle school.

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:10.250
He goes on WLS radio, on the Roe Conn, Richard
Roeper Show, which is a major drive-time radio

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.250
show.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:17.070
And he had said this thing. So I get an email
from, I think it was Roe Conn, or with one

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:22.690
of their producers that Tuesday, being like,
"OK, Rahm wants you to come on the video.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:31.049
He wants to donate money to your charity."
Causes.com, which is a Sean Parker investment

01:03:31.049 --> 01:03:37.789
thing that raises money on Facebook, has agreed
to match this donation.

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:41.310
Which, the first time he goes on the radio,
he actually says, "I'm gonna donate $2500

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:47.799
to this person's choice." And then for some
reason, they continue to talk to him and then

01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:55.650
he says $2500 or five thousand. And so then,
as the media echo chamber goes, that canonical

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.619
number was 5,000.

01:03:57.619 --> 01:04:05.250
So, he's in for five grand. They say causes.com
is gonna match it. And so, ten thousand dollars.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:11.609
"We need you to be on the radio." Like, I
can't turn ten thousand dollars for a charity

01:04:11.609 --> 01:04:17.769
down. So, I'll go and be on the radio. So
I agree. And so in my head, I'm like, "I'm

01:04:17.769 --> 01:04:22.609
going to be on the radio. No one can see the
radio. We're good, right?

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.319
[chuckles]

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:29.631
Later that Wednesday. So we're gonna meet
up Wednesday at five at the radio station

01:04:29.631 --> 01:04:37.289
which is downtown. That afternoon, just after
lunch time, they email me the press release

01:04:37.289 --> 01:04:43.700
that they had issued. I'm like, "Oh, I'm not
just gonna be on the radio, am I?" And then

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:50.609
I get a call from NBC, who had a deal to live
broadcast it live.

01:04:50.609 --> 01:04:54.100
They were the only ones allowed to broadcast
it live. And then they're like, "We need to

01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:00.410
get footage of you walking in the building.
So when will you be arriving?" I'm like, "Oh

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:05.880
my God. What is this?" And so actually, my
friend Dan O'Neill, I was like, "Please can

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.580
you come help me here?" Se we're walking along
State Street and it's totally that moment

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.329
where I hear someone go like, "There he is."

01:05:12.329 --> 01:05:17.800
And then there's a camera comes running up
and they shoot me going in. And then we get

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.200
in the elevator and then a reporter jumps
in the elevator with me and it's actually

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:30.730
the same guy who showed up at my house first
thing. And we're going up and I say to him,

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:33.410
"Who's up there?" And he just goes, "Everyone."

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.630
[laughter]

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:38.779
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Carl the Intern, Quack
the Duck.

01:05:38.779 --> 01:05:43.980
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No, he meant everyone from the
media. So they bring me into a room with no

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:51.520
door, which is really nice. And the media
is swarming outside the doorless room. It

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:58.430
was like sharks. And you've got the meat in
your shark cage and one of them swims in and

01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:04.980
swims off. And then another one gets a little
bite and then whoomp! I was totally that.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.599
One would come in and be like, "Hey, how's
it going?" "I'm kinda nervous." And then they'll

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:11.950
be like, "OK, I'll leave you alone." And they
walk off and then another one would be like,

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:19.450
"So, my name." And finally, it was like, "Can
we get?" And they're keeping us separate,

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:22.200
too. They're keeping me and Rahm separate.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:31.420
They want the reveal to happen live on the
radio. So they bring me in, finally. They

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:37.260
allow the shark cage thing to end. And they
bring me into the studio first. And I walk

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:44.789
into the studio and the studio is, I don't
know, 15 by 20. That makes it sound bigger

01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:49.380
than it was. It was a small room with a big
table in the middle.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.660
And the two hosts on that side of the table
and two open mics on this side of the table.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:58.779
And behind the hosts, was a sea of cameras.

01:06:58.779 --> 01:06:59.779
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Like a firing squad.

01:06:59.779 --> 01:07:07.180
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes, and lights. And I walk
in and my basic reaction is, "Ahhhh."

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.450
[laughter]

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:16.119
And they make a couple of jokes about that
and then I was just like, "Huh?" And then

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:19.009
they're like, "OK, we're gonna bring Rahm
in." And so Rahm comes in and he's just like,

01:07:19.009 --> 01:07:21.980
"Hey, how's it going? What's up? Nice to meet
you. OK. Blah, blah, blah."

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:27.020
And I'm still like, "Huh?" And then they're
talking to him and asking him questions and

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.700
he's just like, "OK, yeah. And blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. I've totally been prepped

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.569
on this and I can talk as much as I want about
whatever it is that I want." And I'm just

01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:39.441
standing in the corner like, "Huh?" And then
they're like, "OK, well thank"

01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:43.839
And he hands me a check and I'm like, "Huh."
And then they're like, "OK, thanks a lot."

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:48.700
And then he walks out and I'm just standing
there like, "What the fuck just happened?"

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:49.700
[laughter]

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:57.740
So people say like, "Oh, you met Rahm." But
I didn't meet Rahm. I was involved in this

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:06.880
completely surreal, bizarre media event. And
then they sent me back into the windowless

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.069
room while Rahm had a press conference in
the middle of their office. So yeah, that

01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:19.050
was crazy. Thankfully, two things about that
that were actually awesome.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:24.450
One, it seemed to rip the Band-Aid completely
off in terms of local news. Like, they got

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:30.730
to have their shark attack moment and they
were into it. And that quieted down significantly.

01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:37.160
The other thing was, I mean, I have to give
the guy an incredible amount of credit. Like,

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.840
that first of all, they didn't shut the account
down immediately.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:47.050
I still don't why they didn't do that. They
could have. Two, they did this bizarre mental

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:52.390
arithmetic. Like, at some point, there had
to be a discussion. It was like, "OK, do we

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:55.270
think this guy's a psycho? No. All right.

01:08:55.270 --> 01:09:01.500
Do we think maybe he has a brain? Yes. Do
we think that it wouldn't be the dumbest thing

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:07.180
in the world to actually acknowledge that
it exists? Yes. Do we think that we should

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:13.040
actually align ourselves with this thing and
offer to donate a large amount of money to

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:21.470
any charity that this person picks? Check."
Like, huh? So they did that math.

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:26.870
I wouldn't have done that math. And they decide
that they are gonna go this charity route.

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:32.070
Which meant that,. And then causes.com is
like, "Hey, free publicity and the ability

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:40.120
to donate more." There's a big chunk of change
on the table. And I got to choose, which was

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120
amazing.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And you chose?

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.700
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I chose an organization called
Young Chicago Authors, which they're best

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:49.950
known for the Louder than a Bomb poetry, Youth
Poetry Slam contest here in.

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.470
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Did you always have them
in mind from the second the bounty came out?

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:56.630
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: The moment I heard it, after
I got over the like, "That's never gonna happen,"

01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:01.640
they were the people that I thought immediately
of. I've known about the organization for

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.400
a very long time. They actually profiled me,
I don't know, 15 years ago or something for

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.250
a magazine that they publish called 'Say What.'

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:13.980
I've had friends that have helped and volunteered
there. They're just a really amazing group

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:20.250
of people. And the thing that--. And it was
amazing to be able to actually give them a

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:26.660
sizable amount of money. And the other thing
that was amazing was on Thursday. I still

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:33.830
was getting local calls and every single call
was, "Why did you choose Young Chicago Authors?"

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:38.040
All the stories were about Young Chicago Authors
and it was like, "Man. That guy knows how

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:44.640
to play a chess game." I mean, he knew this
outcome way before anyone else did and it

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.560
was this outcome that actually everyone got
to win from, which is amazing if you think

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.970
about it. But yeah. But that totally ripped
the Band-Aid off the local media. Also, giant

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:58.240
sex scandal at Northwestern helped, too right.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.400
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: I believe you thanked
that guy a little bit later.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:08.660
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: I did. I actually got an email
from a professor at Northwestern, an English

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:14.240
professor, who's now teaching the at MayorEmanuel
stuff in his Chicago literature class. He

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:18.120
wrote me that day and I wrote him back and
I was like, "Please express my thanks to your

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.600
colleague for removing the media circus."

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:28.390
And then we moved into more of a national
media focus, which was MSNBC, and then insanely,

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:29.390
The Colbert Report.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:30.600
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: How was that?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.910
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: It was awesome. It was so cool.
I mean,.

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.980
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: He seemed completely
disarmed by you.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.811
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: He was. I got high-fives from
stage hands afterwards. They were like, "I've

01:11:40.811 --> 01:11:45.890
never seen him do that." It was great. They
called. I was actually being interviewed by

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:50.080
the student reporter for the Columbia Chronicle
at my office, and they called.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.471
And her side of the conversation must have
been hilarious to hear 'cause it was just

01:11:55.471 --> 01:12:02.920
me being like, "No it isn't. No. Who is this,
really?" Like, "You're not The Colbert Report."

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.070
But they did. They called and they said, "We
like to bring you out to New York on Tuesday

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:18.120
and we'd like to have you on." And I follow
Colbert and Jon Stewart through,.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.560
I don't have cable. So I don't watch it every
day, but I'm certainly very familiar with

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:29.330
the show and I think what both of them do
is pretty amazing. But I will fully admit

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:33.460
to be one of those people that watches the
start and the interview comes on and I may

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:37.120
watch it, and I may not watch it. So, I agreed
to do it.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.460
And then that whole weekend was just people
being like, "How could you have agreed to

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:47.610
be interviewed by Stephen Colbert? He's gonna
murder you. Watch out." The best thing you

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:52.040
can possibly do to someone that's going to
be on The Colbert Report is not write them

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.890
an email that says, "You must be so nervous."

01:12:55.890 --> 01:13:04.310
Which I must have gotten 300 of over the course
of a 24-hour period. So I hadn't been nervous.

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:10.920
I was just really excited and then I got very
nervous. But it turned out it was great. I

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:18.370
mean, they do some very smart things. One
of which is just to have this really awesome

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:25.900
person who hangs out with you when you're
backstage and occupies your brain so that

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.440
I never really felt very nervous.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:35.900
I'm a person that is prone to getting nervous.
And this person, she was great. She had a

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.830
really cute dog, which helped. So I was hanging
out with her dog and chatting with her about

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.930
her dog for. But she's just keeping your brain
moving.

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:44.240
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So you can't stew.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.370
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Right. And then finally, she's
like, "Oh, we should go backstage." And it's

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:52.770
like, "OK. Let's go backstage." And you're
walking backstage, talking about when TV on

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:55.810
the radio were on and then she's like, "Oh,
we should go sit down."

01:13:55.810 --> 01:14:00.770
And it's like, "OK, cool. Let's go sit down."
And you go and sit down and you're still just

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.960
chatting with her and she's like, "OK, well
I'm gonna go in back." And it's like, "Oh,

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.961
well thanks. It's been great hanging out with
you." And then she turns around and they're

01:14:06.961 --> 01:14:11.460
like, "And action." Like literally, there's
no pause there.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:19.000
So the time it took Stephen to run from his
desk, around the crowd and sit down in front

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:27.160
of me, was the sum total time that I had to
be nervous. So it was great. And then he sat

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.550
down and just let me tell this ridiculous
story, which doesn't,

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.950
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: He looked like he was
trying to hold it together. I thought he was

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:34.950
gonna lose it.

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:35.950
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: No, seriously.

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:36.950
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: No?

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:39.230
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: If you watch the thing, most
of the time they're showing me, right?

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:40.230
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Yeah.

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:46.200
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: But my angle was of this. He
had his head in his hand like just, sparkles

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:54.490
in his eye and just smiling. And it was like,
this is awesome. So yeah. I mean, it was of

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.100
all of the media that I did and I did a lot.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:06.510
And I didn't want to do most of it. It was
amazing. It was so much fun. It was,. The

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:14.280
feedback that I got from both people that
I really respect and from just seemingly everyone

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:21.870
was great. And they were just so nice. Every
single person that I met there just clearly

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:26.890
loved their job, which is just a great thing.
Just to be able to walk in every day and be

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:30.200
like, "Man, I'm so,." Like the makeup woman.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:36.060
She's done it for 30 years and has worked
at Colbert for, I think, from the start. And

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:40.930
you could just tell she loved it. It was awesome.

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.230
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: So, he ended up with
two questions. One you wanted to smoke your

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.230
beard, I believe.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:47.230
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yes. That didn't happen.

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.670
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: Oh, that's good. The
other question was Mayor Emanuel gonna return,

01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:51.670
I believe?

01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:52.670
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:58.020
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: And on Sunday night,
a tweet appeared. It was suddenly deleted.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:02.290
It was binary and appeared to be an abbreviated
version of "one night will remind you." Were

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:04.050
you hacked? What happened there?

01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:07.560
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Ah, you know, time vortexes
are funny things.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.160
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: OK. Well, Dan thanks
a lot for your time. I really appreciate it.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.310
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Yeah. Definitely. Thank you.

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:14.350
&gt;&gt;Brian Fitzpatrick: It was great talking
to you. Thanks.

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:16.990
&gt;&gt;Dan Sinker: Thanks everyone.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.870
[applause]
