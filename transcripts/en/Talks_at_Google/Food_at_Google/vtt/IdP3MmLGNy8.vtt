ANDREW PERLICH: All
right, welcome everybody

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.220
to Google's Kitchen
Sink, the download

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.270
on food-- Google's
teaching kitchen.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.010
My name is Andrew Perlich.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.390
I'm the cafe manager here
at Kitchen Sink Cafe.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.340
And it is my distinct
pleasure to welcome today

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.600
Chef Tony Gemignani over here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.540
In Chef Tony's 24
years making pizza,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.650
he's become an 11-time pizza
world champion, including

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.290
being the first and
only Triple Crown

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.770
winner for baking at
the International Pizza

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.440
Championships in Lecce, Italy.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.320
He's the chef and owner
of Tony's Pizza Napolitana

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.720
in San Francisco.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.850
You may have seen
him on Jay Leno.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.010
You may have seen him also
on "Good Morning America,"

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.160
and you may have also
seen him as a regular

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.094
on the Food Network.

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:48.260
He's going to show us how
to make some pizzas today,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.380
so everybody please join me in
welcoming Chef Tony Gemignani.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.614
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:59.510
TONY GEMIGNANI: Who likes pizza?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.480
Who loves pizza?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320
Nice.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.280
24 years ago is when I started.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.880
Anybody make dough at home?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.120
Anyone trying to make
pizza dough at home?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.310
Some of you?

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.340
Most of you?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.840
Nice.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.862
So that's always a challenge--
making pizza dough at home.

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:15.820
Wanna hold that for me?

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.320
All right.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:18.370
Don't get scared.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.755
Don't throw it back.

00:01:19.755 --> 00:01:20.729
Don't throw it back.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.020
I'm going to teach you guys
how to make a basic recipe.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.600
This is the a dough recipe
that I use in my restaurant,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.760
at Tony's, and actually
all my restuarants.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.600
It's a little different,
but it's about 99% there.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.990
We're going to use a
starter in this dough.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.430
So if some of you don't
know what a starter is,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.360
we're going to use
a poolish, which

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.280
is a starter that has equal
parts flour and water in it.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.530
So if I were to take one pound
of flour, one pound of water,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.830
and a minute amount of
yeast, mix it and let

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.930
it sit on my counter
for 18 hours,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.570
it would turn out like this.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.190
You smell it.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.540
It's acidic, slightly sour.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.030
If I use less water, it
could be less acidic.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.039
We're going to use this
mass into our batch

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.990
to make our dough much
more exciting, much more

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.810
flavorful, much more aromatic.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.746
So in the book
"The Pizza Bible,"

00:02:16.746 --> 00:02:18.630
we talk a lot about starters.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.970
It's the pizzeria of tomorrow.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.290
And it's not really
the pizzeria of today.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.540
When you think of that
'80s and '90s pizzeria

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.480
of just flour, salt,
yeast, and water,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.376
things have progressed
quite a bit.

00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:35.500
So you've heard, I'm sure,
we're from the Bay Area.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.100
Sourdough starters--
there's ways to make this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.560
without using yeast.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.010
You can actually ferment it
over six days, seven days.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.430
But really, when I cook,
I really look for balance.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.890
I'm not looking
for a starter that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.502
really is in the
back of your mouth

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:53.710
and all you taste is starter.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.010
I'm looking at a
complex dough that

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.420
marries with the sauce, that
takes you to the cheese,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.840
and you find those ingredients.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
You know, when I make my
pizzas, and if you ever

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.780
been to Tony's Pizza Napolitana
or any of my other places,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.580
it's always about balance.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.020
If it's sweet, it
could be spicy.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.969
It's salty.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.510
You always have this three to
four different flavor profiles.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.468
And you're going to see
this in a couple pizzas

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:17.850
we're going to make today.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550
So we have our KitchenAid mixer.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.360
We have 100% 00 flour.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.610
It's my 00 flour.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.040
But it's a high gluten,
high protein flour.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.390
A lot of times when you're
making pizza at home,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.260
you grab all-purpose
flour, which is typically

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.470
the wrong flour to grab.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.520
In the pizza business,
we don't typically

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.990
grab all-purpose flour.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.570
We look for a protein
that's in a range of 12.5%

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.010
to 14.6% protein.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.190
So when you're shopping, when
you're looking for a good flour

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.910
to use, look for high
gluten, high protein flour.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.834
I added my flour
here, and we have

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:52.000
a few different ingredients.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.060
We have oil in front of
me, malt, salt, yeast,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.060
and then we have our starter.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.360
We have two water mixtures, a
warm water mixture and almost

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.410
an ice-cold water mixture.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.570
So we have our yeast here.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.480
I'm going to warm it up
in my warm water mixture.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.230
We're going to do a
slow rise, meaning

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.640
that am I going to make this
dough today and eat it today?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.730
No.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.060
Do I want to eat this
dough in 24 hours?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.774
That's good.

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:21.610
If I want to eat it in
36 hours, that's better.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.450
If I want to eat it in 48
hours, that's even way better.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.030
So why do I want to eat old
dough compared to young dough?

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.320
One of the worst things you
can do in the pizza business,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.550
or when you're making pizza at
home, is to make dough today

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.110
and eat it today.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.320
Well, yeast feeds
on simple sugars.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.440
In our flour, we have
about 1% to 3% simple sugar

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.406
already in our flour, meaning
that if our yeast goes

00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:49.280
in there, it's going to
find something to eat

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.700
and it'll grow.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.280
So it's already
present in flour.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.350
One of the rules of thumb when
you're cooking at 450, 500,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.520
520, like a lot of our home
ovens are typically at,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.360
we want to use a browning agent.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.560
Now what's a browning agent?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.080
A sugar, a malt, a honey,
a molasses-- something

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.640
that can help your dough brown.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.630
It's very important.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.210
One of the ingredients
that you tend

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.810
not to see when you're
making pizzas at home

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.390
is a browning agent.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.780
Why am I using malt?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.640
I'm using a low diastatic malt.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.840
It's a derivative of barley.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.490
It's more natural.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670
I like the flavor
profile better.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.600
Could you use sugar?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.460
Say I can't find
any powdered malt.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.230
Could I use sugar?

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.688
Yeah, and if you
were to use sugar,

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:38.020
you could use about
three times as much sugar

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.780
as you would malt.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.349
Malt's pretty strong.

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.390
So what am I going to do?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.260
I'm going to malt my flour.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.895
So I'm adding my
flour to my malt.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.170
I'm going to blend
that up a little bit.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.270
I just woke up my
yeast in warm water.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.860
Yeast lies dormant
when it's cold.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.945
It wakes up when
it's in warm water.

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.320
But I want to wake
it up and then

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.730
slow it down with cold water.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.910
Why didn't I add my
malt to my warm water?

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.980
It's llike giving
the yeast a Red Bull.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.440
I don't want to wake
up the yeast that much

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.280
and get it going crazy.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.870
I want to actually let
my dough rise slower,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.790
and I want my yeast
to eat slower.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.630
So we have two water
mixtures, cold and warm.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.610
I'm going to add my
yeast mixture sure to it.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.170
I added this first because
if there was any leftover

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.085
yeast in the bowl, I can always
wash it out with my cold water.

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:30.460
Does that make sense?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.980
Sometimes you'll
see a little bit.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:43.440
I'm going to add my
water, wait a little bit.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.300
I can put it up a little bit.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.076
Anyone have a spatula?

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:49.200
Somebody grab me a spatula.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.300
So as this is mixing,
I could stop it,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.130
bring everything to the middle.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.250
Does anyone have a
KitchenAid at home?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.660
Anyone make their dough
by hand, old school?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.237
Kind of do both.

00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:13.820
I'm going to add the
rest of my water.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.340
So I added my water.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.810
I added my yeast.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.780
I have a few ingredients
left-- salt--

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.250
I'm going to keep my yeast
and salt away from each other.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.555
They don't like each other.

00:07:28.555 --> 00:07:30.920
They actually hate each other.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.420
Salt can kill yeast, so I
like to keep them separated.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.830
We have our oil.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.720
I'm going to add
that at the very end.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.470
Oil is a binding agent.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.890
It emulsifies.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.730
I don't want to add my oil first
because it won't let my water

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.480
hydrate into my flour.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.410
And that's important.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.160
But I have this starter here.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.390
When am I going
to add my starter?

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.760
My starter's pretty tacky.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.034
I'm going to go ahead and
wet my hands, stop my mix,

00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:05.400
and go ahead and add my
starter in the middle.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.906
So why are we adding starter?

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:10.230
I just said it a minute ago.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.070
Complexity, flavor--
you guys need a coffee.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.625
You guys aren't awake yet.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.630
You're just really hungry.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.460
I got on the road at 4:40
to see you guys today.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.320
Yeah, right?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.840
People thought I was nuts.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.660
I had to go to San Franscisco,
San Francisco to here.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.930
OK, so I'm going to
pick it up a little bit.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.750
I'm going to add-- my flour's
incorporating in my dough.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.740
Everything's kind
of coming together.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.278
About two minutes-- so while
this is mixing, any questions?

00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.730
TONY GEMIGNANI: We're
getting close to high 60s.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.980
With that poolish, with the
starter, we had over 65%

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.960
hydration.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.040
It's a good question.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.280
So in the bread world or in the
pizza world-- mostly the bread

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.280
world-- we're always trying
to get super hydrated.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.120
It's cool to say I have
a 75% hydrated dough.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.650
What does that mean?

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.760
More-- I'm going
to add my salt now.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.190
The more water I
have in my dough,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.870
does it mean it's
a wetter dough?

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.650
It does, but not during
the baking process.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.012
During the baking process, if
you really want a crispy pizza,

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:24.470
you want to actually
try to achieve

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.277
more water in your dough.

00:09:26.277 --> 00:09:28.610
So you're always trying to
get more water in your dough.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.651
It's one of those things.

00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:33.240
As a baker, you're always
trying to go up a percent or 2%.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.590
I just want from 65% to 66%.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.690
What's hydration?

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.930
What's baker's percentages?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.930
For example, I have
100 pounds of flour.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.660
And I say, make
it 65% hydration.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.410
That means it would
be 65 pounds of water.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.766
Does that make sense?

00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:54.010
If I said, make it 2% salt, you
always go to your flour ratio.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.600
So that means if
I had 100 pounds,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.460
I would put two pounds
of salt into that recipe.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.250
So this is coming
together great.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.180
I'm going to add my oil.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.710
I'm going to let it mix
for about two more minutes

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.132
and then we're ready to
go-- maybe a minute a half.

00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:12.840
There's not much.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.770
I could finish is on
the table, which I will.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.680
Any other questions?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.096
AUDIENCE: What type of oil?

00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:22.882
TONY GEMIGNANI: Extra
virgin olive oil.

00:10:22.882 --> 00:10:24.840
I'm not looking for one
that's super-expensive,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.620
but I am looking
for extra virgin.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.110
Why do we add oil?

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.310
One, it helps emulsify.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.720
It binds everything together.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.650
But I'm not really
looking for it for flavor,

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.680
unless I'm looking for
Chicago-style pizza

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.130
and I want 8%, 10%
fat or oil or butter.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.010
Then I may be looking
for a different type.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:50.010
All right, so we're
pretty good to go.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:55.750
Could somebody grab this for me?

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.630
Great, so everyone can see.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.505
So I'm looking at this and I'm
going to bring it together.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.140
It's a little tacky,
but tacky's good, right?

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.900
So I'm finishing my dough
on a nice hard surface.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.340
I'm developing the proteins.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.905
But I'm not going to overmix it.

00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:25.280
I definitely didn't
overmix it here.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.650
We didn't do a 10 minute batch.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.520
But when I look at it, and
I'll let this pass-- pass this

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.285
around, I'm making that
ball nice and tight.

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:41.160
You can kind of feel
that and pass it around.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.330
Wet dough, wet hands.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.800
It'll help.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.560
Sometimes you think that
you're going to grab flour.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.060
I'm not.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.501
Want to throw this one at you?

00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.000
Ready now?

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:03.780
That was great.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.280
Good job.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.620
Made me mess up.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.260
Wet hands.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.650
Sticky dough.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.720
You didn't get that, did you?

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.220
He's good.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.350
He got it.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.100
He told me he was going
to get everything.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.525
AUDIENCE: So Chef Tony,
what kind of pizza

00:12:18.525 --> 00:12:20.040
is this dough good for?

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.950
TONY GEMIGNANI: This dough
is good for Sicilian style.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.140
This dough is great
for a classic Italian.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.700
This dough is great for Roman.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.160
It can be great for thin.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.370
It's great at 500, 550, 600.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.020
When you get to 650, you
don't need a browning agent.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.487
So 500 to 650-- I'm sorry.

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:40.570
You need a browning agent.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.900
Once you go after 650,
then you need one.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:48.100
So for your home ovens,
this dough's great for.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.060
So I have some dough
in front of me.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.120
But somebody wanted me to teach
somebody how to toss pizzas.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.030
Who wants to learn
how to toss pizzas?

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.330
I need two volunteers,
two Googlers.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.205
What do we got?

00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:04.390
All right, buddy.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.380
Wanna come?

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.270
I love it when they
wear blue or black.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.020
It's perfect.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.890
Pizza guys wear white, geez.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.460
It's OK.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.915
Who else do I have?

00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:17.665
MALE SPEAKER: We have
one right over here.

00:13:17.665 --> 00:13:19.070
TONY GEMIGNANI: Wanna come?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.880
OK.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.600
I might be able to get one more.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.870
Can you grab me some dough?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.800
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.175
How many would you like, Chef?

00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:27.860
TONY GEMIGNANI: Oh,
two-- just one more set.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.111
If you put one more set
together, that would be great.

00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:30.818
What's your name?

00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:31.620
SHENG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.841
TONY GEMIGNANI: Sheng?

00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:33.340
And?

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.194
ALICE: Alice.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:35.110
TONY GEMIGNANI: Alice?

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.870
Cool.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.780
It's a little easier
on a harder surface.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.740
Let's grab our dough
and let's push it down.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.760
I made special
dough for you guys.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.760
I tripled the salt on this to
make it extra, extra durable.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.666
Don't eat this one.

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:55.290
Can have the one that fell, but
you don't want to eat this one.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.540
OK, so let's kind
of stretch this out.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.320
And I'm kind of digging
into it like this.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.650
So there's resistance in this.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.685
It's because of the triple salt.

00:14:06.685 --> 00:14:10.640
But I wanted to teach
you guys how to throw.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.200
So if you ever seen us on
the Food Network doing stuff,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.980
it's triple the salt.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.830
We're not that good.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.960
We're good.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.551
But it makes it a
little stronger.

00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:21.217
All right, buddy we
need some help here.

00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:23.851
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:24.350
Come on.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.130
They're hungry.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.680
MALE SPEAKER: So Chef, how did
you get into pizza throwing?

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.720
TONY GEMIGNANI: My brother
got me into the business 20,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.861
going on 24 years.

00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:34.860
Won't give you that one.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.775
What did you do to this one?

00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:40.275
Jesus.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.299
Let me help you.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:48.465
Getting a workout at Google.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.974
You have this one.

00:14:53.974 --> 00:14:55.140
Let me teach you the basics.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.240
What hand to we write
with or draw with?

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.772
SHENG: Right hand.

00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:05.970
TONY GEMIGNANI: Right
palm-- want to go like this.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:06.800
Just like that.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.750
So instead of
going like this, we

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.938
want to throw it up in the air.

00:15:12.938 --> 00:15:13.550
Pretty good.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.450
So palm, two fists.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:16.950
Pretty good.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.030
Palm, two fists.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.640
You're good.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.820
Palm, two fists.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.370
She's better than you.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.550
Palm, two fists.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.750
OK, more of a spin, though.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.080
See, she has the wrist action.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.950
Spin it on your fingers.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.040
Very hard trick.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.730
It's like a basketball, sort of.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.660
Go across the shoulders.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.480
Here, I'll show you.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.030
Right hand, go to our
left, go to our right.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.245
Go across the shoulders.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.750
See, everyone's watching, too.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.500
OK, the whip.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.500
Practice that.

00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:08.660
You're making me look bad.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.080
I mean, I dropped
it first, right?

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.580
OK, great.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.340
Thank you guys.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.740
Here, keep your doughs.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.560
Keep your dough.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.780
So we're going to
make a pizza for you.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.940
It's a sausage and stout pizza.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.710
It's not in the book.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.717
A lot of people were upset that
this pizza was not in the book.

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:38.675
I kind of was developing
it a little bit after.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.890
So we have a dough that
has 20% Guinness in it.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.910
So you saw my water mixture?

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.660
Let's take 20% out and
substitute it with Guinness.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.130
So we have that in the dough.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.516
It's honey malted, so
I have honey and malt.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:01.100
So I have two browning
agents, a little bit

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.400
of spelt, whole wheat.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.467
Or inside the dough,
we have some semolina.

00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:09.550
So there's a lot going on.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.000
This is a multi-grain dough.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.280
It has beer in it.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.670
There's some sausage
that we're going

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.220
to add to this that has beer,
Guinness beer in the sausage.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.210
We have a Guinness beer salt
that we're going to finish it.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.680
We have a Guinness reduction.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.109
I mean, it's all about
stout and multi-grain

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:29.700
and it's pretty awesome.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.540
This is one of our
most popular pizzas

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.970
at Tony's, and this is the one
I'm going to show you guys.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.240
And we're going to make one
that doesn't have any-- doesn't

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.760
have any of the sausage.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.800
We're going to make a
vegetarian one, basically.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.760
So this is kind
of football-shaped

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.720
and we rolled those out
into a football shape.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.650
We're going to go ahead
and stretch it out

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.070
into a football shape.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.230
So what does that mean?

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:15.000
I'm going to stretch it out this
way instead of making it round.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.050
So when I look at this
dough, it's pretty hydrated.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.832
It's in the 70s.

00:18:20.832 --> 00:18:22.790
I'm going to be nice and
gradual on this dough.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.410
I'm going to be nice
and soft on this dough.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.020
I don't want to de-gas my dough.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.780
This is actually
three-day-old dough.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.620
So the lighter you
are on your pizza,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.480
the lighter your pizza will be.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.370
If you see me on
the Neapolitan line

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.580
at Tony's, I'm
really soft on it.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.290
If you see me on the slice
line, New York slice line,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.780
I'm digging into it.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.560
Because that New York slice
should be really tough

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.610
when you fold.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.500
It cracks, but it doesn't break.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.860
And when you have a Neapolitan,
a true veraci pizza Napolitana,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.340
it should be like a
pillow, be nice and airy.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.149
So those two elements
are important.

00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:13.940
And when you look at
my lines at Tony's, we

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.030
have four pizza
lines, seven ovens,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.990
13 styles of pizza with
different dough recipes.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.970
It's confusing, but a lot of
times you'll see one of my guys

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.156
maybe help me from my slice line
coming on the Neapolitan line

00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:27.530
and they're just
digging into it.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.970
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.487
You got to be gentle with this.

00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:31.820
You got to treat it like a lady.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:41.280
So we have 100% whole milk
mozzarella, about six ounces.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.140
This is Grande mozzarella
that I'm using.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.190
It's high in fat.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.240
It's the best
cheese you can buy.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.450
There's not really a
more expensive mozzarella

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.060
in the industry.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.940
You see a lot of
places that are ranked

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.930
the top pizzerias in the
industry, nine out of ten

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.470
usually use Grande.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.194
You can find it.

00:20:02.194 --> 00:20:03.860
Some home users think
you can't find it,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.230
but you can find it, in
some high-end grocery

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.199
stores like Dreger's,
which is kind of nearby.

00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:12.240
You can find it in some
other grocery stores too.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.629
So I'll do the
vegetarian one first.

00:20:18.629 --> 00:20:19.920
We have some sauteed mushrooms.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.000
We have roasted peppers.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.890
This pizza I kind of
always like to go diagonal.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.230
It's the way I like to top it.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.060
You'll see the way I finish it.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.500
I always think that even my
cut will be a diagonal cut.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:56.360
Caramelized onions--
any vegetarians here?

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:56.860
OK, good.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.110
I was going to say, if there's
not, why am I doing it?

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.630
No, good, good.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.700
We made special-- we
made it to a point

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.250
that we have some
vegetarian pizzas.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.170
It's important.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:15.060
So sometimes when
you make a pizza,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.280
you think everything
has to go on before.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.020
Not really.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.510
In the pizza business,
and usually on a line,

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.740
your finish line is as
big as your make line,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.190
meaning that the ingredients
will go on before and after.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.170
What's great about this is
I use a lot of semolina.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.230
And these GI metal
peels are awesome,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.730
because everything
falls through it.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.800
So if you have a dirty oven, you
won't really with this kind of

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.300
peel.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.040
I'll land it in that oven.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.430
We have it at what, 520?

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.900
Trying to get it at 520.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.350
We'll cook at six
minutes and six minutes.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.910
It's pretty good time here.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.430
I'm going to cook it--
if you look at this oven,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.730
I have two levels, the
highest and the lowest.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.150
We have reversed
half sheet pans.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.635
We don't have stones.

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:06.710
If I were cooking
making pizzas at home,

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.470
I would use a baking steel.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.320
It's a quarter inch.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.180
Some of them are a
half inch or one eighth

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.890
of an inch piece of
steel that you put in.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.610
The recovery time is great.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.480
And it gets hot.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.360
Or I would use my stone.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.180
Or if you didn't have a stone,
I would use a reverse baking

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.780
sheet.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.840
So we have those flipped
over in our oven.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.060
I have two.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.730
I just don't cook on one.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.255
In the book, I talk about
cooking pizzas, starting on top

00:22:38.255 --> 00:22:39.630
and then finishing
on the bottom.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.338
So it's always good
to have two elements.

00:22:41.338 --> 00:22:42.820
Does that make sense?

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.540
Like in the pizza business,
when we put a pizza in,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.420
do we keep it there?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.530
We keep it there
about 80% of the time

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.030
and then we move it to a
hotspot to finish that bottom.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.720
So we just don't have
one dedicated spot.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.710
So a lot of people
just buy one stone.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:02.070
Really, you should invest
in two stones or two steels.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:08.980
So we have our other pizza,
our sausage, our onions.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.180
I'm going to add my
caramelized onions first.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.440
Remember, there's no
borders on these pizzas.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.340
I'm really making this pizza
or decorating this pizza

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.820
all the ways to its ends.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.200
And when it comes
to sausage, this

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.960
is a sausage we make in house.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.220
I want to pinch in
the size of a dime.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.040
If I pinch in the
size of a quarter,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.120
it may not cook
in your home oven.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.620
So when you're using raw
sausage, it's important.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.780
I don't like to pre-cook
really anything.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:45.290
You want that fat, that flavor
to really ooze into your pizza.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.046
It's important.

00:23:47.046 --> 00:23:51.210
Do you have any
questions about anything?

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:51.840
More tricks?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.800
AUDIENCE: 00 flour.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.180
TONY GEMIGNANI: Say it again?

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.721
AUDIENCE: Where can
you buy 00 flour?

00:23:54.721 --> 00:23:56.976
TONY GEMIGNANI: You can buy
it at CentralMilling.com.

00:23:56.976 --> 00:23:58.225
You can see it at fgpizza.com.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.850
Even when you look
at a King Arthur,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.140
they have a Lancelot
that's good.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.620
It's a higher protein,
higher gluten.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.780
I would look for that flour.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.550
Giusto's makes a good
high performer flour.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.880
They're local.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.552
Central Milling is
one of the best,

00:24:19.552 --> 00:24:21.010
especially if you're
into organics.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.080
They're one of the
best flour companies.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.045
They may make my 00 flour that
a high gluten, high protein.

00:24:27.045 --> 00:24:28.830
So there's a lot of
great ones out there.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.890
I just really recommend
getting one and not just using

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.850
an all purpose flour.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:38.520
It'll cook way better and
it'll be all around better.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.650
So I have this
other pizza but I'm

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.320
waiting to put this pie
on the bottom shelf.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.450
So I can just let it sit here.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.100
It's nice to have a
surface like this.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.350
Not so good to open up a
pizza on a surface like that.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.490
So marble, granite, stainless
are the perfect surfaces

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.760
for pizza.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.410
So I did talk about
finishing ingredients.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.410
And what does that mean?

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.630
Well, we have
crushed red pepper.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:09.080
We have our salt, our Guinness
salt, some fresh mozzarella.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.170
We have our fontina
and some onions.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.660
We're going to finish that
pizza with all these ingredients

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.040
and then we have our
Guinness reduction,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.920
which will give it this
sweet, almost malty beer

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.676
kind of flavor to it.

00:25:23.676 --> 00:25:25.910
It's been about four
minutes, give or take.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.470
I'm going to check in.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.100
We're cool.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.475
We have another
two minutes, then

00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:31.710
I'm going to take it, flip
it around, and then put it

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.840
on the bottom.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.965
So we have Q and A, we
can do some questions

00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:37.140
if you guys have any.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.990
MALE SPEAKER: We've got a
question in the back over there

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.531
on the right.

00:25:41.382 --> 00:25:43.257
AUDIENCE: It's not a
really serious question.

00:25:43.257 --> 00:25:44.490
Why did you decide
to make it football

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.580
shaped instead of round?

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.750
TONY GEMIGNANI: You know,
it's pretty hydrated.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.590
And usually, if a pizza's
really hydrated and over 70,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.660
it's harder to make in a circle.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.690
So I'll say that we'll make them
more-- it's easier to open up.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.480
It kind of goes down the routes
of a Roman style pizza as well.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.450
And Roman-style pizzas
are really hydrated.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.570
They could be thick
or they could be thin.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.940
So that's the reason really.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.650
It's a little tougher to
make it into a circle.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.670
Some people say they
want to-- it's artisan,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.240
and that's what they want.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.200
It's not artisan.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.820
It just means that they
can't make it into a circle.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.910
I'll admit it.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.870
Cool.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:27.117
AUDIENCE: Do you experiment
much with different beer styles

00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:27.700
in your dough?

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.710
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.060
I like the darker beers.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.400
I mean, I use Guinness for
this, but the darker beers

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.840
go a lot further-- Anchor
Steam, Anchor Porter.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.690
Yeah, some of those beers I
always tend to lean towards.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.230
I don't want it
to just be tasting

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.430
like you're eating beer.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.750
I want it to taste
a hint of beer.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.390
I want to say, OK, there's
beer in it, then the salt.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.920
I don't want it to
be super, you know,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.044
like you're drinking a bottle of
Guinness or a pint of Guinness.

00:26:58.044 --> 00:27:00.460
But I want to make sure that
you kind of know that there's

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.640
something in there.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.680
Does that makes sense?

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.506
Cool.

00:27:04.506 --> 00:27:07.079
AUDIENCE: When you do a
long ferment like this,

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:08.870
are you de-gassing
everyday, or do you just

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.170
leave it for three days?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:10.830
TONY GEMIGNANI: I'm
letting it ferment.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.705
It's a good question.

00:27:11.705 --> 00:27:12.560
So am I de-gassing?

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.790
What does that mean?

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.800
I got my dough, I balled
it, I put it in my fridge.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.470
Am I taking it out
and de-gassing it?

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.150
Am I taking it out
and de-gassing it?

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.060
No.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.300
I only have one really
bench rest, cut and ball it

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.970
and then let it ferment
for two days, take it out.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:34.320
And one rule of thumb is
so see my pizza right here?

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.280
I could pop, move this a little
bit, move my ingredients over.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.060
I'm going to turn it
around and move it

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.960
right into my bottom deck.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.302
Does that make sense?

00:27:44.302 --> 00:27:46.340
You guys can see it.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.381
So I'm not de-gassing and
re-balling and reballing and

00:27:50.381 --> 00:27:50.880
de-gassing.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.781
I have a starter in
it that's definitely

00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:53.780
going to give it flavor.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.507
I bench rest it,
meaning that after it

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.590
was done mixing I let it
sit for about 30 minutes,

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.000
cut and ball it.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.640
I'm going to put it in my fridge
for one day, two days, maybe

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.880
three days.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.319
Am I going to take that dough
out and use it right away?

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:08.360
No, I'm going to bring it
out to room temperature

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.180
like I did here.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.642
And since I let it come out
to room temperature for three

00:28:12.642 --> 00:28:14.850
hours, well, I was in the
car for, like, three hours.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.960
So like five hours.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.270
One rule of thumb, don't put
cold dough in a hot oven.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.390
So you want to bring that
dough up to room temp.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.930
Some pizzerias boast,
like, a 1200 degree oven

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.412
and cook for 60 seconds.

00:28:32.412 --> 00:28:33.620
What do you think about that?

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.510
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah,
I have several of them.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.030
I cook at-- my Tony's Pizza
Napolitano, or Neapolitan,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.400
we took at 900 degrees.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.550
Then we have our [INAUDIBLE]
and we cook it at 1,000 degrees.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.390
Yeah, straight.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.370
I celebrate every
style of pizza.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.310
So when it comes to me,
if Chicago's done right,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.590
if New York's done right,
if Neopolitan's done right,

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:57.160
I kind of celebrate them all.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.820
I'm going to put
one now on the top.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.580
That other one has
about two minutes,

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.190
and I'll show you how to
finish that on the bottom.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.549
But yeah, you know, it
depends on what you like.

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:09.090
Like I said, I
celebrate all of them,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:13.180
so I can't say that I love
Chicago and I hate Neapolitan.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.180
I think if it's done right,
then it's pretty awesome.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.370
We have so many ovens.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.190
Kind of crazy.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.572
AUDIENCE: How do you decide
when to use pizza sauce?

00:29:22.572 --> 00:29:25.370
TONY GEMIGNANI: How do I
decide when to use pizza sauce?

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.790
It depends on what I'm making.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.550
Sometimes you don't need it.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.540
If you ever have white pizzas,
pizzas that have no sauce,

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.150
they're just as good
as pizzas with sauce.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:43.110
Sometimes my reductions
I use-- I tend to I

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.470
guess-- how can you say it.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:49.220
When I use reductions a lot,
like a fig reduction or a fig

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.510
compote or if I'm
using, like, an orange

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.510
or if I'm doing a
maybe even a balsamic

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:01.400
or if I'm doing a Guinness, I
kind of treat that as my sauce.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.110
So it has that--
that's what I do.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.029
So whenever I use a lot
of reductions or compotes

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:09.320
and stuff like that, I tend
to get away from the sauces

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.200
and use that as my sauce,
if that makes any sense.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.660
Kind of like this one.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.240
I treat that Guinness
reduction as the sauce.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.740
So this pizza's just about done.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.820
Turned out pretty
good for these ovens.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.060
Not bad.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.610
Nice bottom.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.610
Thing I always say is,
I got a great bottom.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.545
So something I always say.

00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:50.570
So I'm going to cut through
it, because I want to finish

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:57.101
my pizza after I cut it.

00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:59.600
A lot of people will finish it
and make this beautiful pizza

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.370
and then they'll cut right
through it and ruin it all.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.370
I don't want to do that.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.630
So I'm going to add
some fresh mozzarella.

00:31:14.255 --> 00:31:16.794
AUDIENCE: Are you
always [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:16.794 --> 00:31:18.710
TONY GEMIGNANI: Yeah,
do I cut it immediately?

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.460
That's a good question.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.130
I do.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.550
I cut it right away and I
want to serve it right away.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:26.085
Especially Neapolitan-- when
you see a Neapolitan pizza

00:31:26.085 --> 00:31:27.230
and you're cooking it.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.390
You cringe when you're watching
somebody eat it or they haven't

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.760
eaten it for like two minutes

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.509
And it's on the table
and they're talking.

00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:34.730
Then it's five minutes.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:35.660
Then it's 10 minutes.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.696
And I'll go grab
the pizza and then

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:39.820
I'll make them a new pizza.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.050
I'm all, here you go.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.722
I literally, like--
it bothers you,

00:31:42.722 --> 00:31:44.680
especially Neapolitan,
because that's the pizza

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.720
you want to eat fast and first.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.920
Sicilian style will
actually sit well.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.720
So we have a crushed red pepper.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.960
We have that beer salt.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.830
I'm heavy on the hand
with this beer salt.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:10.736
Some green onions--
we got some more here.

00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:13.152
ANDREW PERLICH: So Tony, where
can you get that beer salt?

00:32:13.152 --> 00:32:14.160
TONY GEMIGNANI: You're
going to make it.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.140
ANDREW PERLICH: Oh, really?

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.556
TONY GEMIGNANI:
Everything's made.

00:32:16.556 --> 00:32:17.457
Come on.

00:32:17.457 --> 00:32:18.915
ANDREW PERLICH:
How do you make it?

00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:20.164
TONY GEMIGNANI: I'll tell you.

00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:21.230
Hold on one second.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.770
So we have our fontina.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:29.255
So we use some nice
triangle pieces of fontina.

00:32:29.255 --> 00:32:31.160
It's very geometrical
when you look at this.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.940
Cool.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.450
Then we'll finish it
with the Guinness.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:45.460
If you went ahead and reduced
Guinness down, and then

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.860
once you reduced it down and
it became somewhat of a glaze,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.010
you would add the salt
to it, sea salt to it,

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.750
and keep cooking the
salt into the Guinness.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.400
Once it reduces down, you'll go
ahead and have a nice Guinness

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.140
salt.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.650
I'll let you guys try it if
we have a little bit extra.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.590
So this is a Guinness reduction.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.280
When you reduce Guinness,
it's really nice

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:17.367
and sweet and malty.

00:33:17.367 --> 00:33:19.200
So this is a great pizza
you guys will love.

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:22.780
There you go.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.540
So how are we looking here?

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.456
About two minutes on top.

00:33:29.456 --> 00:33:30.830
And then we're
going to finish it

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.212
on the bottom for another
maybe four minutes.

00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:35.170
We're almost done here.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.120
You guys have any questions?

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.120
ANDREW PERLICH: Got another
question in the back

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.159
over there.

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:41.950
TONY GEMIGNANI: Anyone
want to try a slice?

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.360
AUDIENCE: The bubble that
came up on your pizza there--

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.690
TONY GEMIGNANI: Say it again?

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.000
AUDIENCE: The bubble that
came up on your first pizza--

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.630
is that something you
generally try to avoid?

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.255
TONY GEMIGNANI: No,
not for this pizza.

00:33:50.255 --> 00:33:52.610
There's certain pizzas
I tend to avoid it,

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.440
like on my sliced pizzas.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.060
This one, I was so soft
to it, I expected it.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.540
If I didn't see
bubbles on this pizza,

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.946
it means somebody
was too hard on it.

00:34:01.946 --> 00:34:03.320
Why do we get
bubbles on a pizza,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.450
other than being
very light on it?

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.440
One is that you're
dough could be cold.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.460
Cold dough brings
lots of bubbles.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.690
This was a bubble that
really came from my hands.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.239
I wanted to have that.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:19.750
I wanted this pizza to look
thick but really kind of be

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.719
nice and thin.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.570
Even when I look
at it here, it's

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.469
nice and malty and thin
and light and airy.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.199
I wanted it to be a
nice, aerated pizza.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.711
So it depends on the style.

00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:32.460
If there was no bubbles
on this, I open up

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.230
my door at the restaurant,
I look in my oven

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.856
and I see a sausage or
stout, I would go to the guy

00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:40.179
and say, you were way
too hard on that pizza.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.520
I expected to have bubbles.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.800
So it depends on the style.

00:34:45.598 --> 00:34:47.889
AUDIENCE: Did you have to
manipulate the dough like you

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.820
did spinning it around
with all of them,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.862
or do different doughs
have different techniques?

00:34:51.862 --> 00:34:54.320
TONY GEMIGNANI: Different doughs
have different techniques.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.639
Sometimes you'll roll dough
out if you wanted it thin.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.890
Sometimes you dock it,
which is little spikes

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:03.880
that you'd roll over it for
thin crust pizzas, so the gas.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.510
Sometimes you want
a thicker rim.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.900
Sometimes you want a
thinner rim [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.940
So it really depends
on your hands.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.260
There's a different
technique of slapping, which

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.430
is a Neapolitan technique.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.530
Or if you're picking it up off
and you're stretching a 22 inch

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:21.590
pie around the edges.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.950
So all the pieces have little
techniques that are important.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.670
Lot of times I get guys that
come in that have no technique

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.180
and they're just doing
all these different steps

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.290
and it kills you.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.490
It makes you want to cringe.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.885
AUDIENCE: Can you briefly walk
us through a simple red sauce?

00:35:40.885 --> 00:35:42.350
TONY GEMIGNANI: A
simple red sauce?

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.260
So a simple pizza sauce--
typically you don't cook it.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.980
A lot of people think that
you have to cook your sauce.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.690
You don't.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.970
Let's say you have three
different types-- a ground

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.720
tomato, a plum
tomato, and a paste.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.390
Your paste is for sweetness.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.930
Your ground is your base.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.241
And if you want texture,
hand-crushed plum tomatoes.

00:36:02.241 --> 00:36:03.240
So does that make sense?

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.989
If you just want it
to be ground tomatoes,

00:36:04.989 --> 00:36:07.580
something light, on a lighter,
like on a thinner pizza,

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.310
that's fine.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.590
If you're looking for a Sicilian
style or Chicago deep dish,

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.100
then I would be adding
that paste, definitely,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.310
to sweeten it naturally.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.190
And I would add crushed
tomatoes to make it more hearty.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.280
So the thicker the pie,
the thicker the sauce.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.720
The thinner the pie,
the thinner the sauce.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.170
Oregano, garlic, salt are the
three standard ingredients--

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.236
pressed, garlic
not chopped garlic

00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:33.360
where you're eating garlic.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.920
Just the essence of garlic.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.460
Torn basil leaves, salt--
you always have to have salt.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.990
Oregano is always nice.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.570
You can over-sauce your pizzas.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.322
You don't want to
over-sauce your pizzas.

00:36:46.322 --> 00:36:47.780
I mean, over-spice our pizzas.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.671
We don't want to
over-spice our sauce.

00:36:49.671 --> 00:36:51.420
You want to taste
tomato, and then there's

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.960
a little seasoning.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.650
When you make your sauce, you
always use it the next day,

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.570
or about 6 to 8 hours later.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.790
You never make your
sauce and then use it,

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.770
because you always taste
the seasoning first,

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.850
not the tomato.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.370
It needs to set.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.390
Sauce has to set.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.181
It's important, because
you'll be all, man,

00:37:07.181 --> 00:37:08.100
this is way too salty.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.880
And you know what?

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.815
In four hours, it will
be totally different.

00:37:11.815 --> 00:37:13.410
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.970
I was wondering if you did any
dessert pizzas, and if you did,

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.255
what are the differences in
the dough and ingredients?

00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:22.530
TONY GEMIGNANI: So do I do
any dessert pizzas, and are

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:23.821
there differences in the dough?

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.300
Not necessarily.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:35.320
You could do a special
dough recipe for desserts.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.260
But it's really the
toppings that make it.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.290
I kind of found over the years
that you don't need a specialty

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.980
dessert recipe when you can
just do what you want on top.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.060
Dessert pizzas kind of
are like the first things

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.299
you do when you
start making pizzas.

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:53.590
Those are the things that
you start experimenting with,

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:57.750
like Nutella or
bananas or triple berry

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.550
and stuff like that.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.192
Yeah, I don't think
you need to do

00:38:03.192 --> 00:38:04.400
anything special for dessert.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.020
My first book
"Pizza," I wrote it.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.020
We had a special recipe for it.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.890
As I get into it now, I can
make any great dessert pizza

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:15.060
just right out of dough.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.680
This dough is great if
you fry it and you make

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.450
a zeppoli into it.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.540
It's pretty awesome,
where you just

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:27.710
toss it in powdered sugar or
sugar and a little cinnamon.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.470
So it's great dough to fry with.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.136
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:38:30.136 --> 00:38:31.540
Thank you.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.868
TONY GEMIGNANI: This is the
master dough with starter.

00:38:35.868 --> 00:38:37.826
Any other questions?

00:38:37.826 --> 00:38:39.990
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
preference for coal or wood

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.490
pizza?

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.940
TONY GEMIGNANI: Say it again?

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.520
Coal or wood?

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.090
I like them both right now.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.960
Coal, you know, we're the
only coal oven, I think,

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.800
that's out here.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.309
My New Yorker pie, or my tomato
pie out of the coal oven,

00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:56.100
it doesn't really get
any better than that.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.470
But it depends.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.930
You get bored,
and so you'll say,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.664
oh, this is my
favorite pizza now.

00:39:01.664 --> 00:39:02.830
You'll start doing it a lot.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.660
Detroit-style pizza
is really great.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.420
If you guys ever
had Detroit style,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.690
we're of the only guys
that has Detroit out here.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.930
That's a great pizza.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.290
You should try that one
if you guys come in.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.667
So this one's just about done.

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:16.000
We're just finishing the bottom.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.652
And we're going to finish
it the same way we did here.

00:39:19.652 --> 00:39:20.660
So you guys got it?

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.510
Pretty good?

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.370
You're all experts now?

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.330
I'd definitely like to
thank everyone here.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.090
And especially Google.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.700
It's my second
time here, but it's

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.800
been a lot of fun--
lot of great questions.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.270
And it's a pretty
awesome campus,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.354
so thanks for inviting me.

00:39:35.354 --> 00:39:36.853
ANDREW PERLICH: All
right, everybody

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.560
join me in thanking
Chef Tony Gemignani.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.210
[APPLAUSE]
