00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.080
UNICEF estimates that 12 children who live in
extreme poverty die, every minute of every day.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.040
They die because they don’t have access
to clean water.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.850
They die because they don’t have enough
to eat.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.350
They die of malaria, or of intestinal worms – something we don’t even let our pets suffer from.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.250
It’s a horrifying truth, and what’s maybe even more horrifying is that these deaths are easily preventable.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.590
For $3, a child could get a mosquito net for
her bed that would protect her from malaria.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.790
To cure her of intestinal worms, a dose of
medicine costs less than 50 cents.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.770
As for food, you could probably feed her with
the loose change in your pocket.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.930
We have this money.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080
I definitely have it, you probably do.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.700
So, why are all of these children dying?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.660
The United States is an affluent country; we have enough money to easily stop world poverty – just end it.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.800
But, why should we?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.160
Why should I give any of my hard-earned money
to strangers I will never meet?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.649
What entitles them to a portion of what I
have?

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.031
Thinking about world poverty, and whether we have an obligation to do something to stop it, really comes down to questions of obligation.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.659
Most of us don’t know anyone who’s living
in extreme, life-threatening poverty.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.130
The victims of that kind of poverty aren’t
our family, or our friends.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.040
So, according to an ethics of care, as we discussed last time, we have no real obligation to those people.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.120
Or if we do, it’s much, much less than the obligation
we have to those who are near and dear to us.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.180
So, many people argue that we simply don’t
have any obligation to help strangers in need.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.979
We didn’t make them poor, and we never agreed
to help them.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.440
So if we do choose to help, that’s great, but such actions are supererogatory – they go above and beyond the call of moral duty.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.140
In this view, giving money to charity is like
getting moral extra credit –

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.240
if you do it, you can go ahead and pat yourself on the back, but if you don’t, you have no reason to feel bad about it.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.860
Contemporary Australian philosopher Peter
Singer thinks differently, however.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.330
To see how, let’s head over to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.240
Singer offers a thought experiment that has seen many variations over the years, but a basic version goes like this:

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.259
Imagine you’re walking to class, feeling pretty good about how great you look in your brand new $200 shoes.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.779
And soon you pass by a shallow pond.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.880
Suddenly, you notice a small child, flailing
in the water.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.000
No one else is around.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.480
The pond is shallow, but the child has lost her
footing, and she can’t get her head above water.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.260
As you watch, the flailing stops.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.510
You realize there’s very little time.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.930
You could easily wade into the water and pull
her to safety.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.700
But if you take the time to remove your shoes,
it’ll be too late.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.100
You know the muddy water will ruin your new
purchase.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.200
So what do you do?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.120
Singer’s pretty sure that we’d all give
the same answer:

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.980
Shoes are replaceable; that child’s life
is not.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.359
So, none of us would think twice about running
in to save her.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.219
But what exactly would be wrong if you decided
not to save the child?

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.879
Singer says it comes down to costs and benefits.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.120
The cost of your shoes is so low, compared to the value of the child’s life, that it would be appalling not to make that sacrifice to value shoes over a person’s life.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.160
But here’s the thing: we know children are dying
right now – 12 every minute – and yet we do nothing.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.800
So what’s the difference, Singer asks, between a life
in front of us and a life halfway around the world?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.940
A life is a life, and both the child in the pond and
the child dying of malaria are equally innocent.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.360
If we do wrong in failing to save the child in the pond, Singer argues we do equally wrong in failing to save some of those children who we know are dying right now.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.500
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.740
Singer argues that, if you can prevent great harm,
at a little cost to yourself, you should do it.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.040
And when you look at it like that, it’s
hard to disagree with him.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.689
But his thought experiment points out some
huge inconsistencies in our moral thinking.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:41.449
Most of us don’t feel the weight of obligation to help dying children we can’t see, but at the same time we think we would have an obligation to help a dying child in front of us.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.509
What does it matter whether we can see the
child or not?

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.340
Some people argue the difference is that, in the
thought experiment, there’s no one else around.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.659
You’re the only one who can help, so you
must.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.019
But what if there were many people standing around that pond, but no one else was willing to save the child?

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.259
Would that then make your inaction more
excusable? Why would it?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.940
Singer argues that it doesn’t matter what
everyone else is doing.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.540
You are in control of you, and of your actions.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.779
So if you see a need, and you know you can help,
you must, even if there are others who could, but don’t.

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:13.200
Now, is it fair for you to have to bear the
burden of helping, while others sit idly by?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.860
No.
It’s not fair at all.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.980
But fair doesn’t really matter in this case.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.300
What matters is whether or not you choose to take action, to prevent great harm at little cost to yourself.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.900
Whether you alone watch the child drown, or
you and a crowd of people watch her drown,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.900
either way, you’ve failed spectacularly
as a moral agent.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.940
And Singer says the same goes for world poverty.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.820
If everyone in America donated just 1% of
their income to help people in extreme poverty,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.690
we could save so many lives.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.030
Now, we know that everyone isn’t going to do that, but according to Singer, each of us is responsible for our failure to help, regardless of what everyone else is doing.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.560
Now, 20th century American philosopher and ecologist Garrett Hardin took issue with much of Singer’s reasoning.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.640
Instead, he offered what’s known as the
lifeboat analogy.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.080
Imagine, Hardin said, that 50 people are on a lifeboat, with room for 10 more, and 100 people are in the water, begging to be let aboard.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.900
Hardin said that if we understand that all life is equally valuable, then we have to admit all 100 of them.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.060
But of course, that would be too many for
the boat.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.970
It would sink, and then we’d all die.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.090
So maybe we only allow 10 people on board.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.320
But which 10?
How do we make that decision?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.620
Even if we had some way to choose between lives, Hardin argued that filling our boat to capacity is still the wrong answer.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.580
By leaving those 10 spaces empty, we’d have more resources for those on board, maximizing their chances of survival.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.240
Those people in the water are doomed, Hardin
said.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.500
They’re doomed because they don’t have a boat, and they need a boat of their own if they’re going to make it.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.960
Helping a few of them out doesn’t really
solve any problems.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.130
If anything, it draws out their suffering.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.120
OK. Here’s the thing about this analogy:

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.660
The lucky people in the lifeboat?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.150
Hardin said: That’s a nation.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.360
And the people in the water?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.700
They’re other nations, ones living in such extreme
poverty that they don’t have their own boats.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.960
The boat in this case represents a strong social
structure, a safety net that provides for its citizens.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.640
Hardin said that, just as the duty of a ship captain is to its passengers, a nation’s obligations are to its citizens.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.620
So a nation should never risk the well-being of its citizenry in order to help members of another nation.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.820
Of course, some nations don’t have the resources
to help their citizens.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.600
In others, people live under governments that are actively exploiting them, rather than protecting them.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.420
But Hardin said, that’s not our fault.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.000
And to give aid to people who don’t even have
a boat, well, that’s throwing away resources.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.120
Who cares if your mosquito net saves a child from malaria, when that child will still be living in inescapable poverty?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.440
The real problem, according to Hardin, is
overpopulation.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.760
And the hard truth is, if a nation has more citizens than it can support – just like a lifeboat that’s filled beyond capacity – no amount of aid will solve that problem.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.020
So, quite counter-intuitively, Hardin said
the most compassionate response is to do nothing.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.760
Yes, people will die, but if aid were to stop, Hardin said, populations would be reduced to a point where nations would be able to be sustain themselves.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.320
Now, there are at least two pretty immediate
responses to this line of thinking.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.720
First, the lifeboat analogy breaks down when you realize that the problem really has nothing to do with the scarcity of resources.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.740
In the real world, there are plenty of resources to go around – they’re just distributed extremely unevenly.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.200
So it seems that Hardin has committed what’s
known as the either/or fallacy.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.040
He said, either protect yourself, or help others, but with the amount of wealth we have, we could actually, and easily, do both.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.980
Second, Hardin cast his analogy in terms of
nations, but that scale is totally arbitrary.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:30.320
Any argument you could give for caring about your nation over others could also be given for caring about your state over others, or your city, or even your family.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.480
And you might say, darn right I care about
my family more than yours!

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.120
But be careful, because: Isn’t that just like arguing that you only have to pull that kid out of the water if she happens to be related to you?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.160
Morality calls for us to not draw arbitrary lines when it comes to who deserves help and who doesn’t.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:53.800
A lot of people, like Singer, think that the only non-arbitrary line is to say that there’s really only one boat, and we’re all in it, so we’ve all got to help. Everyone.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.020
So, what do you think?
Are you in your own boat?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:03.440
One thing that might help you answer that question is the topic of our next – and next to last – lesson: the value of human life.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.020
But today we talked about extreme poverty,
and our responses to it.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:14.300
We considered Singer’s argument that we have an obligation to prevent harm through poverty when we can, and we also looked at Hardin’s lifeboat analogy.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.880
