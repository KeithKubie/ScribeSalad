00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.310
So we've seen that this equation
represents a line with slope 3 and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.250
a y intercept of (0,-7).

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.120
Now I want you to actually
graph this line on your own and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.650
then check two points that
this graph goes through.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.320
So I'll give you a bunch
of check boxes here.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.520
And only two of them will actually
correspond to points on the graph.
