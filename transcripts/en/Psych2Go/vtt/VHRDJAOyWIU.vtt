00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.820
HEEEY!!!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.280
All right guys my name is Tom and let's get right to it!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160
Today I'm going to be talking to you guys about physical attractiveness.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.280
Physical attractiveness seems to play a big role in our everyday lives, as shown by multiple studies.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.580
These studies show that people who are considered physically attractive are attributed with more...

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.820
appealing qualities and traits. Attractive people are seen as smart,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.240
sociable,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.620
and they have a good moral compass.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.160
Now while there have been studies that do substantiate the stereotype, should we believe it?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.910
Attractiveness has influence in various areas of our lives, one being in the decision to hire. In this scenario

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.280
attractive people are more preferred over less good-looking persons even if they're more qualified.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.360
What?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.720
WHAT?!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.480
W U T ?!1?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.940
The Meta analysis (done by Lengua in 2000) shows that sixty-eight percent of attractive adults are

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.180
above the mean when it comes to occupational success, including income. Obviously, this is not

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.740
always the case. It can help women when applying for lower level positions

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
but not for higher ones, in the study done by Diff boy,

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.529
Marvel and Green in the late 70s and 80s

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.759
Ready for this? If a good-looking individual has committed a crime, their physical attractiveness

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.379
may influence judgments based on how serious the crime was.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.160
Doesn't that just put more faith in your judgment system, America?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.720
Yeah...! Researchers have found that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.940
attractive males are twice as likely to avoid going to prison, as if they were unattractive

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.500
Now, to wrap it all up for you guys, being attractive can have positive effects as well as make someone seem

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.820
untrustworthy, and, you know, the whole

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.840
Crime thing that is serious because they're just pretty good looking...

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.480
Now, most of these studies have only been done in western countries, so we can't say it's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.900
the same all around the world, and even so, how do we decide who is attractive?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.900
What are the deciding factor?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.660
